FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (15): Watchdogs do their best - A look
at the record of the market regulators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Hong Kong's regulators have notched up an impressive tally of opponents
spanning small brokers, predatory companies and corporate giants, but the
scorecard of wins suggests high profile actions have not always led to
retribution being delivered.
Lengthy and costly investigations have not stood in the way of business for
companies that have continued to divest themselves of assets and holdings
even as inspectors were delving into transactions. Meanwhile, investors
continue to fall foul of scams and unlicensed operators.
However, in its biggest battle the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong
Kong's corporate watchdog, is generally agreed to have come out on top. The
row over the application of the Hong Kong takeovers code pitched the SFC
against Jardine Matheson, the HKDollars 39.9bn trading company generally
regarded as one of the most powerful bodies in the colony.
Jardine had argued that shareholders were adequately protected by the
Bermuda takeovers code, tailor-made for the group by the authorities in its
country of domicile. The SFC refused to grant a waiver, leading Jardine
Matheson and its associate to quit the colony's stock exchange from the end
of this year.
The SFC was backed by the stock exchange, underlining the new era of
co-operation between the two. Giving his support Mr Charles Lee, stock
exchange chairman, said: 'We have done so much in trying to build our
reputation. With one stroke of the pen we could have destroyed it. This is
something we just can't entertain.'
But the row with Jardine is not over. The SFC says that the company - as a
Hong Kong company, listed or not - still falls within its jurisdiction.
Jardine disagrees.
Where the track record has perhaps been less impressive is in the handling
of Hong Kong's smaller fry. The past year has seen two spectacular swoops on
companies, complete with hundreds of uniformed policemen and vanloads of
potential evidence, but little more than a sheaf of paperwork has resulted
from either.
Mr Nicholas Allen, who works for Coopers and Lybrand, was appointed by the
government to investigate the corporate activities of Lee Ming Tee's Allied
Group - companies which had interests in metal trading, printing, seafood
processing and properties - in August 1992. When the investigation started,
the 10 companies making up the official and unofficial Allied Group had a
combined market capitalisation of HKDollars 7.6bn.
Mr Allen's 688-page report was released more than a year later. It details
mechanisms through which, it claims, Mr Lee Ming Tee, then chairman,
syphoned shareholders' funds into activities such as the undisclosed control
of listed companies, share price manipulation and the funding of stock
purchases by the controlling shareholders.
However, as yet Mr Allen's endeavours and HKDollars 46m of taxpayers' money
have done little to dent the ebullient Mr Lee, who has since stood down as
chairman but whose business activities are as prolific as ever. Moreover, Mr
Lee sold subsidiaries of the Allied Group throughout the investigations, so
that today it is a much slimmer animal than the one which came under
scrutiny in August 1992,
A similar investigation targeted the corporate affairs of the World Trade
Centre Group, a company previously controlled by the Australian Bond
Corporation and two associated companies.
Publication of this report - which will run to more than 1,000 pages,
including an appendix - is expected next month. In December, the Commercial
Crime Bureau seized crates of possible evidence from the three companies
plus four others largely under the helm of Mr Stanley Ho, a Macau tycoon
whose empire ranges from ferries to casinos.
As with the Allied Group, the World Trade Centre Group has undergone a
metamorphosis since Mr John Lees, the government-appointed inspector,
started delving into its affairs.
Nevertheless, market players are concerned that failure to act on the second
report will lead to a replay of the investigation into the 1983 collapse of
the Carrian property empire, which gobbled up HKDollars 100m in public money
but delivered little by way of justice. If the SFC is to send a message that
will be heeded by corporate Hong Kong and international investors, it will
have to show that, this time, money has not been spent in vain.
More successful has been the onslaught on activities such as trading
practices at odds with the interests of the investing public, market
manipulation, window dressing and false accounting. Among the bigger fish
caught, Peregrine Investments, the Hong Kong securities house, was
disciplined for misconduct concerning three of the flotations it handled.
The SFC last September accused the banking arm of engaging in stock trading
'which was likely to be prejudicial to the interests of the investing
public'; contributing to a restricted free-float in the shares of three
newly-listed companies; and failing adequately to monitor client trading
activities. Peregrine agreed to pay HKDollars 3.5m to a stock exchange fund.
Over the past year, the SFC has also forced up the price of bids in a number
of the takeover situations it has swooped on; and has acted as the saviour
of the minority shareholder by pulling significant corporate transactions
deemed to be potentially detrimental to small investors.
It has completed 'numerous' prosecutions for unregistered dealing, marketing
of unauthorised investment products, short selling (covered short selling
has now been legalised) and failure to meet disclosure of interests
requirements.
New regulations have been brought in to protect clients of foreign exchange
agents. The new capital requirement for brokers, allied to other controls,
is expected to see up to half the existing Forex brokers go out of business.
At the stock exchange itself - to which direct powers have been devolved
from the SFC - big steps have been taken to tighten up on malpractices and
to create an environment where both domestic and overseas investors can deal
confidently in Hong Kong and China securities.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (5): Call for deregulation
 -Japan's closed-door policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's tightly regulated pension fund industry is liable to be seen by US
trade negotiators as another example of the bureaucrats' reluctance to
relinquish accumulated power, and to open Japan's doors to foreigners.
However, as the Japanese population ages and concerns over maintaining an
elderly society mount, many officials are calling for deregulation of the
corporate and state pension investment schemes.
US pressure forced the partial liberalisation of fund management of
corporate pension and mutual aid associations in 1990, allowing foreign
investment managers into the market.
The welfare ministry also wants better returns on the state pension
investments, at present restricted to life assurers and trust banks. It has
called for a broadening of investment channels ahead of the expected rise in
pension liabilities as Japan's population ages.
However, unlike the social security planners at the welfare ministry, who
hope that increased investment returns will reduce the strain caused by the
increase in future pension payments, the finance ministry bureaucrats adopt
a prudent line. They claim that the government has to guarantee social
security benefits, and cannot allow further investments in stocks, which
most investment advisory companies excel in.
For many European and US fund management companies, which have failed to
gain access to such funds due to the tight relationships between Japanese
corporations and fund managers, winning public fund management contracts is
the only way they can justify maintaining operations in Japan.
Investment of state pension fund reserves totalling an outstanding
Y100,000bn (Dollars 136bn) is controlled by the finance ministry, of which a
bulk is funnelled into low interest loans for public works.
The finance ministry allows Y20,000bn of the balance to be invested by the
Welfare Service Public Corporation, (Nenpuku) run by the health ministry,
but rigid finance ministry laws still govern how the organisation invests in
the financial markets.
The health and welfare ministry, which is revamping the state pension system
and the eligibility age for pensions, also wants to alter legislation
limiting the state pension fund investment during the present parliamentary
session.
Another concern is the large amount allocated to one manager by Nenpuku. The
organisation is only allowed to allocate funds to 14 life assurers and 15
trust banks, with one institution managing as much as Y2,000bn.
Deregulation of the public pension fund market is on the agenda of the
bilateral trade talks between Japan and the US and the deadline has been set
for July.
'By allowing the 150 foreign and Japanese investment advisory companies in,
we want to increase our options and maximise the efficiency of the
investments,' says Mr Keiichi Fukuyama, a director in charge of pension fund
management at the welfare ministry. Nenpuku also wants more competition from
skilled European and US fund managers to maximise the returns on
investments.
Meanwhile, the corporate pension fund business is also growing fast as more
corporations are setting up funds ahead of the next century. Outstanding
assets of total corporate pension funds, which only totalled Y462.8bn in
1971, has grown to Y47,212.5bn at the end of March last year.
However, although pension fund asset management was opened up to investment
advisory companies in 1990, most of the funds are still managed by trust
banks, which at the end of last March were managing 56.9 per cent of the
total outstanding, and life assurance companies, which held 42.8 per cent.
The investment advisory companies are only allowed to bid for a third of
corporate pension funds' new assets, or 'new money'. Even then they have not
been able to win management business from Japanese companies, many of which
value old ties and relationships rather than the returns on the investments.
Other restrictions which prevent newcomers into the business and at the same
time deprive beneficiaries of returns, include limits on fund allocation.
Fund managers are forced to invest more than 50 per cent of the clients'
money into safe investments such as bonds and deposits, while a 30 per cent
limit is placed on stocks and foreign investments, and a 20 per cent limit
is set on real estate investments.
Unlike the US where pension funds invest in venture businesses, derivatives
and securitised instruments to maximise returns, the number of asset types
to which Japanese fund managers can allocate funds are limited to the
conventional stocks, bonds, cash deposits and real estate.
Pension fund assets value their assets at historic cost, or the price at
which the investments were made, rather than the actual market price. This
helps fund managers to conceal unrealised losses made on stock investments
made during the late 1980s. It also inflates the amount of stocks held on
the portfolio (since most of the stock investments were made during the
stock market 'bubble' of the 1980s) and limits the amount of new cash
allocated to equity investments.
The ministry of finance claims that it is maintaining regulations on pension
fund investments to ensure prudent investments and to secure the funds until
full pension payments commence due to the demographic changes at the end of
the century.
However, as the day of reckoning draws near, the ministry will need to face
the reality - that regulations are only helping fund managers to cover up
losses and the state may have to subsidise the low returns due to
inefficient investments. The most painless way to correct this situation
will be to free the market to more professional fund managers who will
maximise returns through more innovative investments.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (6): 'Beauty parade' blues
 -A look at the controversy over consultants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A handful of top-bracket firms have cornered a disproportionate share of the
UK fund management market.
This trend has caused tension between the fund management community and
pension consultants in the UK. Fund managers complain, privately, that in
spite of extensive 'beauty parades' - at great expense to the client and
requiring great effort by the fund manager - it is always the same handful
of firms which turn up on the short list.
The Institutional Fund Managers Association (Ifma), recently wrote to the
Society of Pension Consultants asking that its members simplify the
extensive questionnaires which are sent to fund managers who are to be
considered for a beauty parade. Mr Richard Weir, director-general of Ifma,
said that some of these can run to 300 pages and simply seek information
already duplicated in annual reports which fund managers make to
consultants.
For their part, consultants say that even when they try to suggest
innovative choices to trustees, their audience, because of its inherently
conservative nature, is unwilling to take a chance on a fund manager who
bucks the trend either in asset allocation or in approach to investment.
'The concentration has occurred partly through business risk-aversion,' said
Mr Bruce Pullman, a director at Quantec, a consultancy firm specialising in
quantitative fund management techniques. 'You do not get fired recommending
that you buy IBM stock.' This is in marked contrast to the US which, with
its huge diversity of fund managers, has seen increasing dispersion of
mandates.
Yet, the process of manager selection in the US is also guided largely by
consultants, who, like their UK counterparts, are usually actuaries. Indeed,
in some cases, the UK and US consultants are members of the same firm.
What is so puzzling is why supposedly similar advisers in two different
countries, when advising roughly the same sorts of businesses should offer
such strikingly different advice.
The answer, both consultants and trustees say, is complex, but much of it
has to do with the genesis of the relationship between pension funds and
their investment advisers. Also, the growth of the performance measurement
industry in both countries and regulatory differences between the US and the
UK have tended to encourage US pension schemes to seek many managers while
UK schemes seem content with only a few.
While US pension schemes are likely to use numerous specialist managers,
each with expertise in investing a particular asset class, UK pension
schemes have until now overwhelmingly preferred balanced mandates in which
one or two managers have discretion over both asset allocation and stock
selection.
According to a survey of the UK pension fund market in 1993 by US-based
Greenwich Associates, UK corporations using balanced managers have remained
roughly stable at 79 per cent of those surveyed for the previous five years.
But among the UK subsidiaries of US companies, only 56 per cent seek
balanced management, down from 79 per cent in 1989.
Overall, both consultants and fund managers say, the trend towards
specialist management in the UK could well end the trend to greater
concentration of assets in the hands of fewer and fewer managers. Indeed,
new research from Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps), the
performance measurement service, suggests that for the first time, the use
of specialist managers in the UK is growing.
Meanwhile, performance measurement in both countries has helped shape the
nature of manager selection. The fact that UK fund managers are measured
against their 'balanced' peer group means it is dangerous to take a big bet
on asset allocation. This means that managers are increasingly holding
exactly the same asset mix regardless of the client's needs. For trustees,
fund managers may look pretty much the same and there is little mileage in
choosing one which is not a big name in the business.
But in the US, such comprehensive benchmarks simply do not exist. Mr John
Williams, researcher at WM Company, another UK performance measurement
service, notes that while his service covers roughly 77 per cent of all UK
pension assets, no US benchmark covers more than 20 per cent. Because
benchmarks are less comprehensive, the concept of an industry norm does not
exist in the same way and clients are more willing to consider a wider
variety of fund managers.
But the reasons for the divergence between the US and UK may be rooted in
history. 'Historically in the US, the people who handled a company's
commercial banking relationships also managed their pension funds,' said
John Gillies, client executive at Frank Russell International, the
London-based offshoot of a US consulting firm. But they did not do it well
and by the 1970s US pension funds were looking for alternatives.
By contrast, UK investment banks were also managing the pension assets of
their clients as well, but because they did not see lending as their core
function, they took investment management much more seriously. In the UK,
for a very long time, pension funds have been largely satisfied with the
performance of their fund managers.
Research from Caps shows that, despite the accusation that UK pension fund
trustees - or indeed, consultants - are too short term in their approach to
manager selection, the average fund manager lasts 7.25 years with a single
client.
But by the early 1970s the science of performance measurement was being
perfected in the US, and it became obvious to pension managers that their
funds were not being invested well, Mr Gillies said. Then in 1974 the
'Erisa' legislation took effect in the US and companies were forced to pay
more attention to investment returns, he said.
And while a UK fund manager is typically reporting to a board of trustees of
a pension fund client - typically containing human resources professionals
and a few scheme members as well - the US fund manager is reporting to a
pensions manager and a corporate finance director. 'For a finance director,
there is a much sharper link between corporate needs and pension fund
performance,' Mr Gillies said. At the same time, US academics were putting
to use some of their newly developed theories about portfolio management,
and these appealed to corporate finance directors who were also using them
in other parts of the business.
It was relatively easy, he said, to urge US pension schemes to consider a
large number of specialist fund managers, each with expertise in different
asset classes.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (8): Clouds on banks' horizon - An
extraordinarily profitable market faces a harsher climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although it is hard to tell, given the lack of disclosure of basic financial
information by many of its 175 banks, Hong Kong heads towards 1997 with the
satisfaction of being world's most profitable banking market. The question
is whether that will continue, or is the colony heading for a fall?
The huge profitability of commercial banking in Hong Kong became obvious on
the London stock market last year as earnings from Hong Kong and the rest of
the Asia Pacific made HSBC Holdings the second most valuable company in the
FTSE-100, and the most valuable bank in the world outside Japan.
Yet as the new year started, there were growing signs of nervousness among
banking regulators - as well as investors - that banks were taking excessive
risks to generate earnings. Their exposure to both commercial and
residential property lending was increasingly an object of concern.
Hong Kong is an extraordinarily profitable market for commercial banking.
Banks commonly generate post-tax returns on equity approaching 30 per cent a
year compared to the mid-teens for the best banks in the OECD, while
maintaining very strong capital ratios and liquid balance sheets.
There are a number of reasons for the colony's attractions for commercial
banks:
Hong Kong has maintained a consistently high growth rate for the past three
years, achieving 6.4 per cent GDP growth in 1993. This has been matched by a
surging demand for loans among both consumers and companies, with total bank
loans outstanding growing by 13.5 per cent in the year to last September.
Overall price inflation of 8.5 per cent last year was driven by strong
inflation of asset prices. Banks making mortgage loans have been comforted
not only by full employment, but a steady rise in the value of assets. This
has contributed to very low bad debts - around 0.2 per cent of advances.
Because of the lack of a developed bond market, there is relatively little
'disintermediation' of banks by companies borrowing money directly on
capital markets. 'Companies have no other source of financing. It is a
choice of equity or loans,' says Mr Stephen Li, a banking analyst at Jardine
Fleming.
Hong Kong is a a trade centre for the fast-growing Asia Pacific region, and
is also strongly linked to China. There is enormous demand for loans within
China, and trade finance transactions - including foreign exchange dealing -
can be very profitable for banks with relatively little credit risk.
Banks have managed to maintain a relatively generous spread between interest
rates charged on loans and paid on deposits partly because of the so-called
'cartel' - or interest rate agreement - run by the Hong Kong Association of
Banks, which sets rates of HKDollars deposits of below HKDollars 500,000.
The demand for loans is boosted by negative real interest rates as a result
of the peg between the US and Hong Kong dollars. The assumed undervaluation
of the HK dollar means the Hong Kong Monetary Authority must keep interest
rates artificially low to prevent excessive demand for the currency.
These factors have combined to generate enormous earnings for banks without
their having to follow OECD banks in trying to raise non-interest income
through selling products such as life insurance to personal customers.
Ratios of non-interest to interest income are commonly below 25 per cent.
Yet this apparently perfect banking climate leads to its own concerns. Many
compare Hong Kong in the 1990s with industrialised countries in the 1980s
whose banks generated large profits only to be savagely caught out by
recession, rapid asset price deflation and escalating bad debts.
'There are plenty of examples of other banking systems coming to grief, and
you cannot rule out that happening in Hong Kong,' says Mr David Carse,
deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority with
responsibility for banking supervision.
Mr Carse has tried to persuade banks to be cautious over both residential
and commercial property lending. The banks agreed a mortgage loan cap of 70
per cent of the value of property in 1991, and it is now virtually
impossible to get more than a 50 per cent mortgage on luxury flats.
All banks proclaim the virtues of their own approach to risk, varying from
barring some categories of lending to being selective about borrowers. Mr
David Li, chief executive of the Bank of East Asia, says the bank
scrutinises borrowers carefully and will not lend for the purchase of land.
Even if Hong Kong avoids the crashes which have afflicted other banking
markets, earnings cannot keep growing at the same rate. Mr Paul
Selway-Swift, executive director of Hongkong Bank - the HSBC Holdings
subsidiary - says loan growth will slow as banks curtail property lending.
He says the Hongkong Bank has set itself a lower growth target for 1994. 'I
would not like to see loan growth sustained apart from anything else. I
would be worried that if loans grew as fast as before, there would not be
enough capital retention to justify the risk,' says Mr Selway-Swift.
Banks also face competitive threats over deposits. The Hong Kong Consumer
Council dealt a serious blow to the interest rate agreement in February when
it published a report arguing that the arrangement cost consumers in the
colony about HKDollars 5bn a year in forgone interest on HK dollar deposits.
The government intends to respond to the report within six months. Though it
regards the agreement as a useful monetary lever in maintaining the peg with
the US dollar, there is little doubt that the interest rate agreement has
not much more than a medium-term future in Hong Kong.
This raises the possibility of a gradual erosion of the banks' interest
margins as they compete for deposits. Some banks say that they will have to
introduce charges to compensate, while others argue that abolition could
encourage risky lending to cover higher funding costs.
The final cloud on the horizon of the Hong Kong banks is that they are
facing pressure to abandon a large amount - if not all of - their
traditional secrecy over balance sheets and sources of profits. A working
party of the monetary authority has proposed increased disclosure from next
year.
Even without pressure from shareholders and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,
banks would probably be forced into greater disclosure by the demands of
ratings agencies. As they carry out more international business, they have
to demonstrate their strength as financial counterparties.
On the face of it, there could hardly be stronger banks with which to deal
than some of the Hong Kong ones. Yet even as they celebrate their place at
the top of the world ranking for profitability and capital strength, they
face ominous signs of a less easy environment to come.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (11): Office costs hit peak - A look at
the property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month 489 people sent off registration forms and deposits as evidence
of their intention to pay up to HKDollars 15m apiece for flats that are
little bigger than half a standard swimming pool. Just 70 flats were
initially put up for offer, though Swire Properties, the developer, lost no
time in releasing a further 76.
These homes do not bear illustrious Peak addresses: instead, they are
perched half-way down, in the more built-up residential Mid-Levels area. At
an average HKDollars 9,728 a sq ft - or over HKDollars 10m for the smallest
1,094 sq ft flat - they are still within reach of the colony's newly rich,
its speculators and families already on the property ladder.
Within weeks (and after pleas from the likes of Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman of
Cheung Kong and Hutchison) the government announced it would take action.
Sir Hamish Macleod, the financial secretary, has not ruled out market
intervention. But he faces a delicate balancing act if he is to avoid the
risk of sending prices plummeting. For many - especially for those with
memories of property booms and busts elsewhere in the developed world - that
is the question: can it last?
Mr Peter Churchouse, head of research at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, says:
'I'm not expecting a crash here. We would have to see some sort of
cataclysmic event first.
'We don't have the gearing, the banks are not in problems - there are no
defaulting property landlords or developers and we are not seeing mortgage
defaults, and I think the risk of that is pretty slight. I don't think we
are staring a crash in the face, but at the same time I think the market's
going to start slowing down.'
A deceleration would certainly be timely. Hong Kong has already overtaken
Tokyo as the world's most expensive location to set up office: according to
agents Jones Lang Wootton, average top grade office rentals in the prime
business district of Central have shot up 75 per cent year-on-year.
Average net office rentals weigh in at HKDollars 75 a sq ft - although
one-off units have gone for more than HKDollars 100 a sq ft - compared with
HKDollars 71 in central Tokyo in December, since when rentals have fallen.
According to agents Brooke Hillier Parker, shopkeepers field the biggest
bills: at HKDollars 545 a month they were paying more than double the
HKDollars 232 paid by their peers in Tokyo.
At the luxury end of the residential market, Hong Kong prices have risen 350
per cent since 1989; for commercial property, values have increased by 150
per cent over the same period.
Tracking the trend of housing costs - as dictated essentially by the cost of
property and interest rates - against household income shows that, while the
disparity is nowhere near as severe as in 1981, it is very much worse than
in 1986-87, according to Morgan Stanley.
It is a concern being taken on board at the highest levels: in February Mr
David Carse, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
wrote to the Hong Kong Association of Banks calling on its members to review
their exposure to the property market and endeavour to restrict their
lending for house purchases to around 15 per cent a year. Total exposure to
the property market should be kept to around 40 per cent of loans in Hong
Kong, he said.
By March, Mr Li was calling on the government to jack up the 50 hectares a
year of land currently released under the Sino-British agreement. This was
the way to curb prices, he argued, not by introducing new taxes which would
simply serve to swell government revenues.
Mr Stanley Ho, Macau casino magnate and chairman of Shun Tak Holdings, went
one step further, leading a high-powered delegation from the Hong Kong Real
Estate Developers' Association to meet Mr Lu Ping, director of the State
Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and putting the request for
more land direct to Beijing.
Dissociating themselves from speculation, the developers blamed rocketing
prices on lack of construction and an unexpected demand for flats from
returning emigrants.
Pre-empting them both, the colony's legislative council members have given
voice to their concerns. The same week, Mr Lu warned mainland companies not
to dabble in property speculation across the border, saying this could
undermine stability and prosperity in Hong Kong.
Finally, since actions speak louder than words, Unisys Corp, the US computer
company, is to shift its regional headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore.
The action - and one which other multinationals are expected to follow -
shows that corporates are no longer prepared to swallow the high cost of
overheads in Hong Kong. It is a timely reminder that the colony does not
have a total monopoly on sophisticated legal and banking frameworks or on
bilingual labour forces. Others, too, may have a foot in the China door.
While there is unlikely at this stage to be a mass exodus from Hong Kong, Mr
Churchouse expects a phase of trading down: corporate Hong Kong refusing to
pay HKDollars 150,000 a month to house staff in big-scale apartments. There
is as yet no evidence of this happening, he says, but he believes the point
is not that far away.
'Rental costs for housing in good quality apartments are now as expensive,
or even more expensive, than they were in Tokyo at the top of the bubble,
looking at what would be considered a big flat in each of those markets.
However, on a square footage basis, Hong Kong is still cheaper than Tokyo
was at the top.'
There are other key differences between the two markets: Hong Kong's
developers are a notoriously conservative breed, and keep their gearing very
low. Individuals have only one mortgage on one house. Multinationals still
want a foot in the Asia camp, and preferably close to China.
Companies are already starting to rebel against office rentals, which are
now as much as Dollars 100 a sq ft in Exchange Square, a development of
shiny soaring blocks in the heart of the prime business district and home to
the stock exchange and many of the colony's businesses.
While few companies are reluctant to drop the cachet of an address on the
square, many are starting to cut floor space and despatch staff to Swire's
new development on the eastern part of the island. Here rentals are just one
third of those commanded at Exchange Square, which is a 10-minute cab
journey away.
With the government now pledged to take action, it is not just the
developers and young marrieds that await details with concern. Any steps
that might derail the property market hit Hong Kong at its very heart: some
65 per cent of the stock market is estimated to be property-related.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (10): The China option - The banks'
future opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The telephones sit silently on desks beside a single trading screen in a 3m
by 2m room in Shanghai. This is the Chinese foreign exchange centre of
Standard Chartered, the oldest foreign bank in China. Like other banks, it
is gearing up for a flood of business but, as yet, deals with a trickle.
As businesses in Hong Kong have turned their sights to China, switching
manufacturing operations into the Pearl River delta, so the colony's banks
have rushed to re-establish their presence. China's headlong economic growth
and developing financial infrastructure is a big opportunity.
For the local Hong Kong banks serving Chinese families who fled to the
colony after 1949 to avoid the Communist state, there is already a network
through which to operate. Most hope to move back into China through lending
to companies that are transferring operations back across the border.
For the foreign banks that were forcibly ejected from China after the
revolution - in the case of Hongkong Bank and Standard Chartered losing the
grand buildings which line the Bund in Shanghai - there is a harder
calculation about how much capital to invest in re-establishing a presence.
China is a risky market, in which it is hard to judge credit risk. The legal
framework is uncertain. It remains highly protected: foreign banks are
barred from taking deposits in the domestic currency and have to make
foreign exchange transactions through public 'swap centres'.
One reason for controls remaining in force is that, paradoxically, foreign
banks have advantageous tax treatment. The Beijing government is wary of
deregulating financial markets before tax reform has been enacted, for fear
of giving another advantage to sophisticated foreign banks.
Since financial laws are in a state of flux - this month alone saw the
publication of a series of new regulations, and a move to having a single
interbank foreign exchange market - Hong Kong banks are caught between
wanting to establish a presence quickly, and wariness about wasting capital.
Mr Paul Selway-Swift, executive director of Hongkong Bank, says that the
bank is keen to re-establish itself in China but cannot waive normal
investment criteria. 'We take a long-term view, but there has to be a return
to the shareholders, maybe not immediately but reasonably soon,' he says.
Mr David Kiang, Standard Chartered's chief executive for China, says banks
have to be selective. 'China is going through some very fundamental and
dramatic changes, and we need to find a strategy to cope with that,' he
says. Banks are concentrating on a variety of businesses in China:
First, they are lending money. There is strong demand for loans in expanding
economic areas, partly because of Chinese restrictions on credit to curb
inflation. 'It is very easy to lend money in China. It is a bottomless pit,'
says Mr Werner Makowski, managing director of Dao Heng Bank. Most Hong Kong
banks are ready to make loans secured on assets in the colony - often to
family businesses in Hong Kong. Mr David Li, chief executive of the Bank of
East Asia, says margins on lending in China are 'much healthier' than in
Hong Kong because of demand.
Second, banks are trying to expand their securities operations so that they
do not have to make all loans from their balance sheets. 'We want to move
from booking assets to originating and distributing them. China's demand is
so huge that we cannot just use our balance sheet,' says Mr Kiang. Many have
started with the B shares in Chinese companies sold to foreign investors on
the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges, and H shares in large Chinese utilities
traded in Hong Kong. There has been fierce competition among commercial and
investment banks to underwrite and distribute these.
Third, banks are waiting to be carry out foreign exchange transactions on
behalf of customers trading in China, including multinationals which have
set up joint ventures. Until this month, all trades had to be carried out
through regional 'swap centres' which set varying exchange rates. China had
planned to move to a single interbank market based in Shanghai, but has
compromised by retaining swap centres as well. Foreign banks such as
Standard Chartered hope that that they will eventually be able to use their
own centres to trade independently rather than through the state.
Finally, foreign banks want to develop wholesale transactions business such
as credit card processing and cash management which they will be able to
sell to Chinese businesses and financial institutions. They regard such
operations as safer and more reliable than taking credit risks by lending.
The biggest prize for foreign banks in China would be the ability to take
domestic currency deposits. The ability to fund loans through taking
relatively cheap deposits has been the backbone of their business in Hong
Kong, and the chance to replicate it in China is a tempting prospect.
It is unlikely to be realised soon. Full convertibility of the yuan is
unlikely within five years, and loosening restrictions on foreign banks
before then will depend on the Chinese authorities feeling comfortable that
their own banks can compete on reasonably equal terms with foreigners.
This means that banks will probably continue to tread carefully for some
time yet. Mr Makowski says that China is more of a prospect than a reality
for many banks. 'We are optimistic about the future, but cautious about
using our capital for more than seed money,' he says.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (9): Shares and the Chinese - The stock
exchange chairman talks to Simon Holberton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This October Mr Charles Lee steps down as chairman of the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange after a remarkable three years at the helm of Asia's most dynamic
stock market.
Mr Lee, who retires in accordance with exchange rules, has presided over the
market during a crucial phase of its development. He will leave the colony's
exchange immeasurably stronger than when he took up the first of three
one-year terms in January 1992.
Then the exchange was still recovering from the trauma of past events -
notably the 1987 stock market crash and problems with senior management -
and the ructions they caused to staff and membership alike. China was barely
on the agenda. The introduction of new technology seemed far off.
Not so today. The exchange has introduced paperless trading for the most
important stocks in the market and further technological enhancements are
planned. Moreover, Hong Kong has the opportunity within its grasp to become
one of the most important sources of capital for China.
In no small way, this is due to the drive of Mr Lee, 58. A quietly-spoken
UK-trained lawyer, Mr Lee negotiated the agreement whereby mainland Chinese
companies would list 'H' shares on the Hong Kong exchange. This was no mean
feat, given that these talks coincided with the bitter dispute between
Britain and China over Governor Chris Patten's plans for the colony's
political development.
'The leaders in China are very pragmatic people,' Mr Lee said recently.
'They said they want long-term stability and prosperity for Hong Kong. The
listing of 'H' shares benefits not only China but also Hong Kong. It puts
Hong Kong on the map as an international financial centre. It makes Hong
Kong the gateway to China. This is a good example of where they do separate
economic from political issues.'
Mr Lee was born in Shanghai to parents from Guangdong. By the time his
family fled China for Hong Kong in 1949 he was tri-lingual - speaking
Cantonese, Shanghainese and Mandarin, the language of education. In Hong
Kong he attended a secondary school run by the Jesuits.
After school he joined Peat Marwick Mitchell where he trained as a chartered
accountant. Although the knowledge he gained was to prove useful in later
life, 'I couldn't see myself doing audit all my life.' After a stint with
the Hong Kong government, in 1965 he went to London to study law.
He flirted with student radicalism - once lunching with 'Danny the Red', the
German student who organised demonstrations at the Sorbonne in 1968 - but
left the London School of Economics with a Master of Laws at the end of
1968. Back in Hong Kong, he rejoined the government and was made secretary
to a committee examining securities regulation and company law.
The committee's report led to Hong Kong's first unified securities law,
addressing for the first time the issue of investor protection. Mr Lee set
up on his own in 1970 and in 1973 formed the firm of solicitors Woo, Kwan,
Lee &amp; Lo, of which he is still a partner.
In 1988 he was asked by Sir David Wilson, then governor, to join the board
of the stock exchange as an independent representative. The four stock
exchanges had been unified in 1986 but the new exchange was brought into
disrepute first by closing its doors for four days during the global stock
market turmoil of October 1987, and then by allowing preferential share
allocations to council members for new issues.
All of that now seems a long way away. The listing of the first 'H' share in
the summer of last year proceeded from a serious analysis by the exchange of
its future prospects. According to Mr Lee, the exchange took a critical look
at Hong Kong and concluded that the market was rapidly maturing, and the
prospect of listing many more local Hong Kong companies appeared dim.
'So we looked for a different role for Hong Kong to play,' he recalled. 'We
could be a major market for capital formation in China. And we could be the
link between the Chinese issuer and international investors. We started
looking at this in early 1992 soon after I became chairman.'
Mr Lee sent a paper to the State Council (or cabinet) of the Chinese
government. It was favourably received and persuaded Mr Zhu Rongji - a
senior political figure who was later to assume far wider control of the
Chinese economy - that Chinese companies should accept international
financial standards.
'The key - I kept on emphasising - was that the issuers must comply with
international standards. I was not happy with 'B' shares. I told them it was
not in China's interest or in Hong Kong's interest for 'B' shares to be
listed in Hong Kong.'
The turning point came in September 1992 when the exchange held a two-week
seminar in Beijing. In all, some 60 experts from Hong Kong gave
presentations on what it means for a company to uphold international
financial standards. Lectures included accounting, management, regulation
and listing procedures.
'We got 200 hand-picked attendees,' Mr Lee recalled. 'That really opened
their eyes to why things had to be done in a certain way.'
Earlier this year the Chinese government said it would permit a further 22
state companies to list their shares on foreign stock exchanges. Although
some, notably two large power companies and two airlines, may seek a primary
listing in New York, Mr Lee is confident that all 22 will have their primary
or secondary listing in Hong Kong.
He also cites the performance of Chinese companies that are listed abroad as
a compelling reason why Hong Kong is a superior market place for mainland
companies. Brilliance Automotive, the Chinese auto company that is listed in
New York, is today rarely traded, its share price languishing below the
offer price.
Similarly, the dual listing of Shanghai Petrochemical in New York and Hong
Kong underlines the benefit of a Hong Kong listing. 'We trade four times the
volume of Shanghai Petrochemical shares as does the New York stock exchange
in spite of the fact that 70 per cent of the issue was first listed there.'
Lining up behind the next 22 companies to list are many more - 'several
hundred,' Mr Lee believes. China will underwrite the future of the Hong Kong
stock exchange.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (4): Cross-border
consensus remains elusive - Is the plan for a common European pension
approach sunk?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In public the pension Euro enthusiasts have not yet conceded defeat. In
private, though, the mood is gloomy.
Two years after the European Commission embarked on ambitious plans to
create a common European pension fund system, complete with cross-border
membership and full freedom of investment, the initiative now appears to
have been all but sunk.
For although European countries now face similar demographic pressures in
their pension fund systems, with rising numbers of pensioners and a
shrinking workforce, most member states seem far from ready to sacrifice
their national pension quirks in the cause of a common European pension
system.
The essential problem stems from the sheer range of pension systems and tax
relief regimes operating in the Europe - a state of affairs that leaves some
countries, like the UK, relying on advance funding systems, others like
Germany, use book reserving, and others, like France, depend on
'pay-as-you-go' schemes.
This range has always made it difficult for European employees who wished to
move around the union, not least because the different countries have
generally refused to recognise each other's tax relief regimes. And so,
mindful that pension harmony would be essential for a fully open labour
market, the commission has hoped to encourage convergence along two distinct
strands.
The first, and most ambitious, has been a call for cross-border membership
of pension schemes to allow European nationals to move around the community
while remaining members of a single pension scheme.
The second, more moderate initiative, has sought to encourage a free flow of
pension fund investment across the community, together with freedom of
operation for pension fund managers - a step that could potentially
revolutionise Europe's capital markets, unlocking huge investment resources.
Recognising that the first of these proposals was too ambitious for most
member states to swallow rapidly, the commission began by targeting the
second idea, proposing a directive intended to give fund managers freedom to
invest overseas or in other currencies, by reducing the investment
restrictions that now operate in most member states.
The initiative received considerable support from the UK, Ireland and the
Netherlands which impose few restrictions and consequently dominate the
overseas investment market - according to the research carried out by the
Federation of Retired People, the UK and Netherlands account for some 93 per
cent of investment in overseas currencies among EU countries.
However, the proposal was opposed by the other nine member states, where
privately funded sectors are extremely limited, and investment restrictions
in force. These range from a requirement in Spain and Portugal that pension
funds be locally managed, to a German regulation stipulating that private
pension funds cannot invest more than 5 per cent of their portfolios in
non-German assets.
In an effort to reach a compromise, the commission last year suggested that
countries could be permitted to require that up to 60 per cent of a pension
fund's assets were matched in national currencies or ECU.
But this received a cool reception at a single market meeting last December,
with the three 'liberal' countries insisting they were opposed to any
restrictions - and the remaining nine demanding a higher limit of 80 per
cent.
The Commission responded by introducing more compromises - a text which
would have allowed a pension fund manager from one state to act as a fund
manager in another was quietly removed; the date of entry of the proposed
directive was moved back by a year, to January 1997; and a currency matching
limit of 70 per cent was suggested by the then Belgian presidency of the EU.
But consensus remains elusive, not least because the commission itself is
adamantly opposed to raising the limit.
'The Commission's view is that after research from experts the 80 per cent
limit cannot be justified. There are benefits to be gained for pension fund
managers from diversification of up to 35 or 40 per cent,' explains one
commission official, who insists that higher limits would prevent the free
flow of capital around the union - one of the fundamental principles of the
single market.
With the Greeks, who currently hold the presidency of the EU, insisting the
matter should be a 'priority' case, more negotiations are planned in the
summer. But observers warn that unless a solution is found soon, the
directive is likely to be quietly shelved, not least because the next
presidencies will be held by Germany and France - countries where privately
funded pensions remain minimal.
'Personally I do not think anything will go through now,' says Mr Brian Hill
of the EFRP. He admits the Federation is 'very disappointed' by the outcome,
which appears to spell an end to plans for cross-border pension membership -
a proposal that had been warmly supported by many multinationals who hoped
it might allow them to streamline their pension schemes for their European
employees.
But although the deadlock has inevitably left countries like the UK
disappointed, other observers remain rather more sanguine.
According to Mr Richard Abramson, corporate pension fund manager with Ernst
and Young, there is rising corporate pressure for a European approach.
'I have detected an increased interest by companies wanting a pan-European
approach. The problem is that it is not possible while the obstacles are
still there,' he says.
Meanwhile, across Europe as a whole, more and more countries are now moving
towards a funded model, he points out, as demographic pressures place their
'pay-as-you-go schemes' under intolerable strain. Spain, for example, has
seen a gradual growth in the number of funded schemes over the past year, as
a result of its own recent pension fund reforms. Meanwhile, France is slowly
developing options for personal pension plans.
Some hope that this trend may eventually bring more de facto convergence -
or even result in a revival of the Commission's proposals. Indeed, as one
diplomat who has closely observed the wrangles over the past year suggests,
the main problem with the directive may have been its timing.
'Even if countries are moving towards a funded model like the UK, some seem
to fear that the directive was pushing them down a path they were simply not
ready for yet,' he insists. 'Almost all the European countries now agree
that they have to review their social security systems. The problem is that
pensions are a politically sensitive thing.'

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (3): Companies pressed on
discount rates - US funds are likely to increase their overseas exposure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volatile US bond markets have brought a high degree of uncertainty to the
funding of the country's corporate pension schemes.
Some companies saw their funding deficits balloon last year, as bond prices
soared and yields tumbled, while others lurched closer to deficit. Yet just
weeks later, with the yield on long-dated bonds up by more than a percentage
point, the deficits have miraculously shrunk again.
What are companies - and their shareholders - to make of it all? And what
does it mean for the way US pension fund assets are invested?
Since they reflect expectations of future inflation, bond yields act as a
proxy for inflation in calculating the present value of a fund's future
liabilities.
With bond yields plummetting last year, US companies came under intense
pressure to cut the discount rates used to calculate these - in the process,
increasing the present value of their pension liabilities.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, concerned that some companies were
hiding the true scale of their funding deficits by keeping their discount
rates high, last autumn leaned on any company that had a discount rate of
over 9 per cent. It wasn't surprising: at the time, the yield on long-term
bonds was headed below 6 per cent.
The effect can be seen in the table. Three of the US companies with the
biggest deficits slashed their discount rates at the end of last year,
greatly inflating their reported liabilities.
None of these companies had a rate above 9 per cent at the end of 1992; but
at 8.5 per cent, each was at the top end of the range of US companies.
General Motors, which has the biggest deficit in absolute terms (though, in
relation to the company's cashflow, it stands out less starkly) said the
discount rate change would put it squarely at the conservative end of
pension fund accounting. It has set a target of the end of the decade to
eliminate the deficit.
The rising bond yields of recent weeks could help GM - and other companies -
reach their funding targets much quicker than they had expected. By
mid-April, with long-dated bond yields some 150 basis points higher than the
low reached last October, most of 1993's escalation in deficits had
effectively been wiped out. Market volatility, though, is likely to make
companies cautious, and most will prefer to remain conservative in their
accounting.
While US companies, under pressure, have looked afresh at discount rates, it
is notable that they have done little to scale back their expectations of
future investment returns on pension fund assets. The two might have been
expected to go hand-in-hand: after all, the same deflationary forces that
were driving discount rates lower were at the same time reducing investment
returns from fixed income and equity investments. Yet many companies seem to
be clinging to investment expectations more suitable to the 1980s than the
1990s.
How will US pension funds address their funding deficiencies - and how will
they achieve what in some cases seem extravagant investment expectations?
The two questions are closely linked. While many companies have sought to
alleviate the strain by issuing shares to their pension schemes, or
transferred property and other assets into them, they remain under pressure
to lift actual investment returns. International diversification has
promised a partial answer.
With yields on US investments falling steadily lower last year, it is not
surprising that US pension fund managers directed more of their cash
overseas.
The wave of international investment had long been predicted by the
brokerage community: in the past two years, it has finally become a reality.
Greenwich Associates, a consulting firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut,
estimates that international stocks accounted for 6.4 per cent of US
corporate pension fund assets in 1993, up from 5.4 per cent the year before
and 4.4 per cent in 1991. International bonds accounted for a further 1.6
per cent, up from 1.3 per cent the year before (the first year Greenwich
analysed bond holdings).
By 1996, funds polled by the consultancy firm estimate their international
equity holdings will rise to 9.6 per cent of total assets, while
international bonds will account for 2.4 per cent.
Domestic equities have remained a relatively stable asset class since the
beginning of the decade, at around 29 per cent: the growth internationally
has come at the expense of domestic fixed-income investments.
Public pension funds, meanwhile - which account for around half of the US's
Dollars 2,500bn of pension fund assets - are also beginning to dabble in
international equities, though less aggressively. Such investments now
account for 5.2 per cent of their assets, up from 2.9 per cent in 1991.
In theory, international diversification is a route to higher returns, while
at the same time spreading risk. That argument has been severely tested
since early February, when the Federal Reserve began to push up short-term
interest rates. The emerging-country equity markets and the vast
international junk bond markets that have grown from the restructured debt
of developing nations - markets where US pension funds have directed an
increasing portion of their cashflow - shuddered at the move.
At the same time, yields on long-dated Treasury bonds have moved up to make
fixed income securities more appealing.
This does not mean that the wave of US pension fund money that helped drive
capital markets around the world in the early 1990s has dried up: however,
the mania for international investment of 1993 is giving way to a more
circumspect 1994.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (5): Realities of the trade links - The
prospects for the colony's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER

<TEXT>
It is a measure of the changing realities of Hong Kong that the possibility
of economic slowdown in China, rather than the political uncertainty which
still surrounds the impending transfer of sovereignty in 1997, casts a
bigger shadow over economic prospects .
Last year, despite the breakdown of Sino-British co-operation, Hong Kong's
economy picked up speed with gross domestic product growth of 5.5 per cent,
the highest rate of increase since 1988. Per capita GDP increased by 4 per
cent to reach Dollars 18,500, a level that exceeds that of the UK.
Heavy government spending on the new airport at Lantau Island, which is
designed to safeguard Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre,
was one of the reasons.
Irrespective of diplomatic spats over the airport's financing, public
spending on building and construction increased by 54 per cent last year,
contributing to a 5.5 per cent rise in domestic capital formation.
'Considering it is a dead project, there's a hell of lot of work going on,'
said one senior executive with one of Hong Kong's largest trading companies,
glancing towards Victoria harbour where half of the world's dredging fleet
is engaged in reclaiming land for what is the world's largest construction
project.
The overwhelming impetus has come from China, with China-linked trade and
capital flows offsetting lower demand in some of Hong Kong's traditional
export markets.
Both local businessmen and foreign investors regard the prospect of Chinese
rule with equanimity. Any political risks associated with the transfer of
power in 1997 are outweighed by the promise and opportunity created by even
deeper integration with the world's fastest-growing economy.
Mr Anthony Bellingan, regional research director at Peregrine, a local
securities house, says that international sentiment towards Hong Kong
shifted decisively in the second half of 1993 when the scale of overseas
investment interest simply 'drowned out worries about politics. The economic
realities hit everyone in the face.'
Those economic realities revolve around the fit between China's cheap land
and labour and plentiful natural resources and Hong Kong's expertise in
services, communications, marketing and finance.
Since China adopted economic reform and its open door policies in 1978, Hong
Kong's relations with it have become closer. The local business cycle has
become more and more synchronised with that of China since 1986, replacing
the territory's traditional dependence on the US and Europe.
But Hong Kong's economic performance last year indicates that a decisive
shift has taken place. Both Hong Kong investment in China and Chinese
investment in Hong Kong have seen a qualitative increase. Hong Kong is now
China's largest external investor, accounting for around two-thirds of its
total foreign direct investment value.
As much as 70 per cent of Hong Kong's manufacturing industry - textiles,
electronics, toys and watches - has moved away from Hong Kong itself to
Guangdong and other southern Chinese provinces, where average wage levels
are less than a fifth of those in Hong Kong.
Mr Michael Cartland, Hong Kong's secretary for financial services, estimates
that as many as 3m Chinese are now employed in China by interests owned or
controlled from Hong Kong.
Yet most of these companies continue to rely on Hong Kong as a source of
management expertise, financial services and marketing support, and help
stimulate the growth of the colony's service sectors. Mr Cartland says Hong
Kong companies increasingly specialise in 'both upstream and downstream
activities, such as product design, production management, technical
support, marketing and material sourcing'.
Statistically, this linkage is most apparent on the trade front, especially
in the growing importance of re-exports, goods processed in China and
exported through Hong Hong to third countries, or goods imported through
Hong Kong and then sold to China.
Last year, re-exports grew by 20 per cent in real terms, following an
increase of 29 per cent in 1992. The rise reflected rapid growth of the
China trade - re-exports to China rose by 29 per cent, re-exports from China
by 17 per cent, while those not involving China rose by only 1 per cent.
And it was sufficiently strong to offset entirely a 5 per cent reduction in
Hong Kong's own domestic exports which declined by 5 per cent, mainly
because of slack demand in the most important overseas markets.
Trade relations with Guangdong are particularly close - Hong Kong takes up
about 80 per cent of Guangdong's external trade. Overall, the proportion of
Hong Kong's trade involving China has increased from 17 per cent in 1980 to
56 per cent in 1993.
At the same time, Chinese investment in Hong Kong has grown apace. Mr
Cartland loosely estimates Chinese investment in Hong Kong at between
USDollars 12bn and USDollars 20bn, an amount which is 'probably larger in
value than that from the US and Japan'.
There is little doubt that Chinese interest in property is one of the
factors fuelling last year's 50 per cent plus increase in property prices.
Mr Cartland says trade patterns were 'broadened and deepened' with Hong
Kong's connections extended beyond the southern China. One fact reflecting
the 'permeability' of this relationship is that a quarter of Hong Kong
dollars are already circulating in China. That amount could increase,
especially after May this year when the Bank of China becomes the third
authorised note issuer.
The negative aspect of this integration is that Hong Kong's future prospects
might now hinge to a much greater extent on China's own economic prospects.
The abolition of China's most favoured nation status by the US
administration would have a decisive impact on the re-export trade, possibly
wiping off two to three percentage points off the growth rate. Most
forecasters regard this as unlikely but a tightening in China's austerity
measures, as the country's leaders seek to control inflation, could lead to
some slowdown in the re-export business and some repatriation of capital.
The one certainty is that the local business community seems set to spend
more and more time examining the Chinese - rather than Hong Kong's economic
performance.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (6): Peg is likely to stay - The
exchange rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maybe it is simply because eight is a lucky number in Chinese, but Hong
Kong's decision in 1983 to peg its currency to the US dollar at a rate of
7.8 has proved to be a successful one for the territory, helping to pave the
way for steady and consistent economic growth, Richard Lapper writes.
Despite opposition from some in the private sector, where the policy is
blamed for Hong Kong's relatively high levels of inflation, it looks as if
the peg will be maintained beyond 1997.
The peg was introduced by the British government to depress speculation
against the local dollar following a sharp downturn in the property market
and amid growing concern about Hong Kong's constitutional status. Mr Michael
Cartland, secretary for financial services, admits the policy was not well
thought out.
The reform amounted to devaluation - the Hong Kong dollar had been floating
at a rate of HKDollars 5.80-5.90 to the US dollar in the months preceding -
and helped to boost exports significantly. By maintaining its value within a
narrow band - last year it fluctuated between HKDollars 7.72 and HKDollars
7.76 - the policy has helped to provide a stable and predictable framework
for both local and overseas investors.
To obtain these benefits, however, the Hong Kong authorities have sacrificed
a measure of control over the local economy.
Interest rates must generally follow those set in New York by the Federal
Reserve, otherwise Hong Kong would see funds flowing out of the country.
Overall, this means that monetary policy cannot be used as a tool to tackle
inflation, restricting policy in this area to fiscal and supply-side
measures.
This has limited the government's ability to control inflation at a time
when prices have risen at a faster rate than both the international and
regional average. Consumer price inflation amounted to 7.5 per cent in 1988,
rising to a peak of 12 per cent in 1991 before falling to 8.5 per cent in
1993.
Worse still, it has contributed to significant distortions in the savings
market. With Hong Kong's prime rate shadowing US rates, real interest rates
have been negative.
Add to that equation the substantial margins obtained by local banks on
their savings deposits - deposit rates have typically been several points
lower than prime lending since 1991 - and there is little incentive for
people to put their savings in bank accounts.
As a result, savings have been directed elsewhere. Some of the slack has
been taken up by foreign currency accounts and life insurance policies - the
life industry offers policies which pay annual cash dividends as well as a
lump sum at maturity. The biggest impact has been on the local property and
equity markets. Last year, speculative fever pushed stock prices up by more
than 100 per cent, a level which has proved to be unsustainable with the
Hang Seng Index down by about a quarter so far this year.
Property prices have soared. On average, prices rose by at least 50 per cent
last year, but in some sectors of the market - such as luxury flats - prices
doubled, producing some of the highest property prices in the world.
Mr David Li, chairman of the Bank of East Asia, one of Hong Kong's biggest
banks, is the most well-known critic of the policy. In a speech last year Mr
Li said that 'while the peg served its purpose when it was introduced, it
has outlived its usefulness and now threatens Hong Kong's competitiveness
and growth.'
Mr Ian Perkin, chief economist at the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, agrees.
He says the policy has 'distorted resource allocation' with speculative
pressures rewarding borrowers more than lenders. He argues that the main
success of the policy has been due to 'an incredible dose of luck'. With the
US dollar falling against the yen and D-Mark over the period, the
competitiveness of the local currency has been maintained, helping exports
to grow steadily.
In addition, commodity prices have weakened, reducing the cost of imports
and increasing the territory's ability to achieve a positive trade balance.
However, increasingly these appear to be minority views. According to Mr
Kwok Kwok-Chuen, chief economist at Standard Chartered, 'people in the
financial services industry accept the economic costs. Overall, it is an
affordable price for exchange rate stability.'
'The virtues are obvious,' says Mr Kwok-Chuen, especially in the run-up to
1997, when political uncertainties will be reflected in sharp and unsettling
movements of the dollar.
Mr Anthony Bellingan, regional research director with Peregrine Securities,
a local securities house, says the removal of the peg would leave the
economy 'totally at the mercy of capital flows'. In present conditions,
change would effectively lead to the revaluation of the Hong Kong currency,
which he describes as 'a fairly appalling prospect' since it could spur even
faster asset price inflation.
There are signs that Hong Kong's inflation is falling as a result of
structural factors. Especially important here is the shift of as much as 70
per cent of Hong Kong's manufacturing sector to mainland China, where it can
benefit from wage rates that are less than a fifth of those available in the
colony.
And in Hong Kong itself, although the labour market remains tight, there has
been a recent relaxation of pressures as thousands of emigrants who left
Hong Kong in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 return. Hong
Kong's government is also beginning to tackle another supply-side constraint
which has contributed to asset price inflation - the shortage of land.
Even Mr Perkin accepts that there is very little chance of the policy being
changed. 'Even if you came up with the strongest case in the world the
government would not do anything about it,' he says. 'We've got to keep Hong
Kong stable and happy until 1997. They don't want anything that will upset
the apple cart.'
Mr Cartland, financial services secretary, adds: 'They're getting used to
the idea. We definitely mean it when we say we have no intention of
changing.'

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (2): New business shifts
towards a few winners - Barry Riley analyses the performance of the managers
and finds that the top four have opened up a gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within a virtually static market place, the pension fund management business
continues to show marked changes. The big four active managers have opened
up something of a gap, Gartmore's Pounds 16bn under management at the end of
1993 being more than Pounds 4bn ahead of the Prudential's total.
BZWIM's inclusion in the top group is for rather different reasons: it is
the leader in index-tracking, which represents Pounds 17bn of its UK pension
fund business, and it also looks after Pounds 7bn of the Barclays group's
in-house pension funds.
The biggest winners of new business in 1993, according to the newsletter
Global Money Management, were Gartmore, Schroder and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund
Management. Good progress was also made by Baring, Morgan Grenfell, Baillie
Gifford and Legal &amp; General (the latter in index funds, where it is number
two to BZWIM).
Net losers included Cazenove, Fleming and BZWIM. Mighty Mercury Asset
Management, too, suffered a modest net loss of business last year, although
it remains the clear industry leader. With well over 400 clients, MAM is
bound to lose several each year, for instance through mergers and
restructurings, even if it performs well; and it is having to run hard to
stand still.
As always, the performance league table explains a lot. Last year there was
a very wide dispersion of total returns within the top 15 managers, from 25
per cent to 37 per cent. Over five years, the differences are much less, but
there is still a 3 or 4 percentage-point gap between the top few and the
bottom group. That implies a 20 per cent difference in the size of a
client's fund after five years.
The performance figures have been supplied to the Financial Times and are
certified to comply with the industry code. However, the gradual shift
towards specific asset allocation benchmarks, rather than full manager
discretion, may mean that the figures do not always reflect the actual
experience of clients.
Moreover some managers decline to publish figures. Mercury Asset Management
is believed, for instance, to have a particularly wide dispersion of
performance, and it refuses to disclose a house median (although it is
thought to have been close to the industry average in 1993).
Newton, a fast-growing independent firm, easily retained its leadership of
the five-year performance table in 1993, but has been closed for new
business for a while. Stewart Newton is anxious to keep the rate of growth
under control, and will only accept a small number of new clients in the
remainder of this year.
The tendency for business to cascade in an unmanageable way towards the
performance leaders is something which advisers and consultants seek to
resist, but with little success. Baillie Gifford, the lone current success
story from Scotland, raised its funds under management by 60 per cent last
year, although it was also said to be turning away business at one stage.
The much bigger Gartmore did almost as well in the wake of its brilliant
1992 performance. Rivals have been watching closely, however, to see whether
Gartmore could cope with such a heady pace of expansion at the very time
that the company's November stock market flotation might have been expected
to take the management's eye off the ball.
Performance did, in fact, wobble in 1993, but a good final quarter, when
high exposure to the Far Eastern equity markets boosted the results, enabled
Gartmore to close the year respectably, just inside the second quartile of
returns.
The use of aggressive strategic switches is a feature of Gartmore's style,
and it is significant that it is asking its clients to approve the use of
derivatives so that it can continue to apply this approach to funds which
have expanded 2 1/2 -fold in two years.
Elsewhere among the leaders, PDFM also had an indifferent year for
performance, going heavily bearish and raising liquidity during the final
quarter's bull run in global equities. However, its value-oriented stock
selection has been very good, and it will be reaping the benefit of its
recent caution in 1994's much more difficult markets.
In contrast Schroder, which had a strong suit in its emerging markets
expertise, enjoyed a brilliant year, and was the only one of the Big Four
managers to shine. Its performance was almost too good, because it promotes
a steady, just-above-median style, and racy figures might not always go down
well with its risk-averse clientele. However, with funds under management up
by almost 50 per cent last year, Schroder is in a purple patch.
But while some of the merchant banks and independent managers are doing
well, life assurance companies are going through a bad period. Prudential
Portfolio Managers has suffered from poor performance and Scottish Widows is
also slipping back. Legal &amp; General at least has a niche in index funds. The
only upwardly-mobile life office in segregated pensions at the moment is
Clerical Medical, which jumped past the Pounds 2bn milestone last year. 'The
only life companies who are going to succeed are those who think like
merchant banks,' says Mark Henderson, senior investment manager at Clerical
Medical, which is comfortably in the top half of the performance table.
Positions in the lower part of the league are making business difficult,
however, for two waning ex-stars of the pension management business,
Henderson and Fleming. Of the two, Fleming had a better time in 1993,
however, and one more good year might take its five-year performance up to
the median level.
Last year, Fleming beat the median through well-judged asset allocation,
says its head of balanced funds, Chris Tracey. There were profitable moves
into and then back out of Japan. But Fleming was underweight in UK
second-line stocks, which was costly.
As recently as 1986, Fleming was the second-biggest manager; now it is
ninth. So the houses now at the top of the list certainly cannot relax.
They will lose business if performance slips, but at the same time the
market has become more concentrated. The big four were running Pounds 115bn
at the end of 1993, up 37 per cent in a year. This was about 27 per cent of
the UK occupational scheme total, and a much larger proportion of the free
market, given that many of the biggest funds are run in-house.
There were indications at one stage that specialist mandates might provide
an opportunity for new small competitors to come into the external
management business, as they have in the US where boutiques in fact dominate
pension fund management.
But the only specialisation to have succeeded in the UK has been index fund
management. Even this may be reaching a ceiling as a proportion of the
market, at somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent. One of the minor players,
Bankers Trust, pulled out earlier this year by selling its Pounds 1.2bn UK
index funds business to Invesco.
A number of international financial institutions with London operations are
trying to break into the UK pension fund business by offering specialist
services such as global bond management. They range from Swiss banks like
Lombard-Odier and Julius Baer to overseas life companies such as the
Australian-owned AMP.
Progress is very slow in the UK, but as it happens there are many new
mandates on offer at present from US pension funds, which are greatly
stepping up their international exposure.
Those genuine boutiques that survive in London mainly do so by marketing to
US clients. This applies to Marathon Asset Management, for instance, and to
quantitative boutiques like Panagora and Pareto Partners.
According to Nigel O'Sullivan, of consultants Bacon &amp; Woodrow, UK pension
fund sponsors find it hard to accept small firms' names on a short list. In
the post-Maxwell climate there is an even greater inclination to play for
safety.
When one of the high-profile stars of Mercury Asset Management, Leonard
Licht, left in 1992 to move to the little-known Jupiter Tyndall, he took
negligible amounts of business away with him. In the US such a move by a
personality manager would have had much more impact.
In fact, it is the big balanced managers who are, by and large, taking the
specialist briefs.
Not only has the shift to specialisation in the UK proved quite modest, but
it is strengthening the stranglehold of the established leaders rather than
weakening it.
Unless one of the Big Four spectacularly blows up, the process of
concentration within the UK's pension fund management industry could have
some way further to go.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (4): Handling down days - Interview with
the chairman of the futures exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On January 3 of this year, his first full day on the job, Mr Ivers Riley
could only watch as the key futures index plunged 1,060 points. As
newly-installed chief executive of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, he could
be forgiven for viewing the fall - which prompted three intra-day margin
calls - as less than auspicious.
But to Mr Riley, a veteran of the derivatives world, the fall proved one
thing: the Futures Exchange which he had inherited was not going to crumble
in the face of massive volatility or rampaging bears.
'It gave me an absolute validation that I was right; that the mechanism had
been fixed. Because of the reput- ation from 1987 (when the effects of the
global crash were exacerbated by the closure of the colony's stock and
futures exchanges) it was felt that maybe it could not handle big down days:
but it worked perfectly,' he says.
'That gave me a base to go and talk to international companies, to say that
not only is Hong Kong telling you it has fixed its problems, it has also
proven it has fixed them. That allows us to move forward, and so I've gotten
more aggressive than I had planned in terms of looking at new things to
introduce.'
Introducing programmes and contracts is very much Mr Riley's thing. It is he
who, in the mid-1970s, was responsible for the introduction and institution
of a trading programme for the first listed put options; more recently, he
launched a raft of products on the American Stock Exchange, including Hong
Kong Index warrants.
His plans for the Hong Kong market are still under wraps, though he is
certain to bring in China-related contracts and, next year, currency
options. There will also be an overhaul of existing contracts, the bulk of
which are dormant - the gold contracts trades four a day for pricing
purposes; futures contracts on the Hang Seng sub-indices and interest rates
are likewise inactive.
Mr Riley says: 'I am making it quite clear to other exchanges that we would
like to be original. We would like to be first and therefore the concept
would be to build contracts down to the very last detail.'
But the immediate matters on his agenda are more nuts-and-bolts concerns:
growing demand for and interest in derivatives has triggered a rapid
increase in the number of traders on the floor. The trading floor population
has more than doubled to 300-plus, and - in anticipation of further growth
to 400 and a sticky Hong Kong summer - workmen will descend to crank up the
air conditioning and other facilities.
Although Hong Kong's notorious shortage of space is also hurting the
exchange's would-be members (the technology-oriented nature of the business
puts heavy demand on office space) neither the problems nor the high costs
entailed in resolving it have stemmed the flow of international houses
coming to the colony. Mr Riley says many market makers are starting to come
in, with two big institutions, including Hull Trading, moving in over the
next month.
The growth of users and anticipated launch of currency contracts which will
be traded across different time zones has spurred the second priority:
installation of an electronic trading system
Installing systems may all seem a little basic for a man who started his
career at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, but Mr Riley has never fought
shy of quitting Rolls-Royce set-ups for less-established brands if the scope
for development is greater.
He raised eyebrows in 1986 when he jumped ship from the New York stock
exchange (where he was in charge of derivatives, bonds and market data) to
the American stock exchange. 'I believe in accepting offers when there's an
opportunity,' he says.
His new appointment (which ran counter to the exchange's earlier pledge to
have an ethnic Chinese sitting at its head) is directly related to his
overseas experience: Hong Kong wants to be known as an international centre.
and is eager to be accepted on a global level. Indeed, this is the dominant
theme on the long-term agenda.
Facilitating Hong Kong's role as an international marketplace are its useful
global positioning in terms of time zones and geographic location in the
most dynamic part of the world and on the doorstep of China. Mr Riley's view
of 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty, is simply that it
enhances this position.
However, while Hong Kong may still have some catching up to do when it comes
to keeping pace with the US, Mr Riley notes a number of common factors
between the two markets.
'The institutional side of the market did not develop until there was some
confidence in Hong Kong, and that started to happen in 1993 and in late 1993
we saw that not just the mechanism held up but also liquidity was there, so
now there is an international institutional customer base mixed with
individual money. That is very similar to the US and different to other
countries, such as the UK, where there is hardly any public (retail)
business.
'Perhaps you get stability and liquidity because of this, because when
institutions dry up they tend to do so all at once, but the public may not
have the same opinions at the same time so there is no lemming effect,' he
says.
Also similar is the make-up of the market: 80 per cent of business is
carried out by 10 per cent of the players.
Of the differences, Hong Kong's links with China perhaps yield the biggest
potentials, and Mr Riley has already opened talks with some of the myriad
futures exchanges across the border.
A string of business relationships and deals is likely to emerge over the
coming years, and the exchange already provides a clearing service for
Nanjing Petroleum.
Mr Riley concedes it is 'unfortunate' not to speak the local language (he
told American reporters quizzing him on this deficiency after announcing his
departure from the American stock exchange that he was bilingual: 'I speak
English and derivatives') but spent a fortnight learning numbers in
Cantonese so he could at least work out what was going on on the trading
floor.
On the personal front the biggest difference, he says, is getting used to
space measured in square feet not hectares. But he adds: 'I would never move
into New York City, and yet I love living in Hong Kong.'

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (3): The speck that looms larger - The
view from Peking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask a young resident of Beijing or Shanghai what his or her view is of Hong
Kong and the row with Britain and the reaction is likely to be one of bored
indifference.
Typical of the responses was that of the representative in Beijing of a
foreign joint venture who said simply: 'It doesn't affect me in any way that
the talks (with Britain) broke down. In fact, I couldn't care less about the
issue.
'To me, Hong Kong has been doing fine for decades like this, I don't think
there is a need for political change.'
In the eyes of many Chinese, including an educated urban elite, Hong Kong is
a distant appendage which is destined willy-nilly to return to the
motherland's embrace at midnight on June 30 1997. Arguments about the
arrangements for the handover are details.
Chinese officials like to give the impression that they view Hong Kong
through a long-distance telescope in which the colony is a mere speck, but
in reality Hong Kong looms larger, though not nearly as large as Hong Kong
residents might imagine.
Sharply differing perceptions of scale between Beijing, the sedate imperial
capital, and the distant hyperactive trading post of Hong Kong are not the
least of the problems that have clouded the issue in a sometimes
cantankerous debate over the colony's future under Chinese rule.
Beijing's insensitivity to the real concerns of Hong Kong residents on a
whole range of issues is partly a product of these conflicting perceptions
from opposite ends of the Chinese land mass. It is also, of course, a
function of the gulf between respective laissez-faire and authoritarian
systems.
China's handling of the recent case of the Hong Kong journalist jailed for
12 years for 'spying and stealing state secrets' is a case in point.
By any standards, the penalties meted out to the reporter, who published
details of China's gold sales and its plans for exchange and interest rate
reform in the Chinese-language Ming Pao, were harsh.
In Beijing, the case barely rippled the surface, however. If there was a
view discernible among Chinese it was that the Hong Kong reporter deserved
some form of punishment for traducing a bank employee.
Needless to say, a contrary opinion did not appear in the official press. A
Chinese journalist summed up what seemed to be a common attitude when she
said that the reporter had 'become the victim of a political game' while
China and Britain remain at odds over Hong Kong.
In the colony itself, the jailing of Xi Yang brought protesters into the
streets, elicited a complaint from Governor Chris Patten and was widely and
understandably regarded as an ominous portent for press freedom post-1997.
But Chinese officials, with their long-distance view of Hong Kong, are
unlikely to have been much moved by these protests, just as they generally
remain impervious to criticism of their clumsiness in addressing the
concerns of Hong Kongers over threats, real or imagined, to political and
economic freedoms.
Beijing's appointments to the Preparatory Work Committee, which acts as a
shadow government in the run-up to 1997, show how an opportunity has been
missed. The PWC, headed by Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, is
mainland-dominated, suggesting few concessions to China's critics in Hong
Kong.
Feelings in Beijing towards Hong Kong are almost devoid of sentiment. With
its tangled colonial history, Hong Kong is still regarded as something of a
'western barbarian creation'. No Chinese poet or writer has ever waxed
lyrical about the barren rock that was home to a collection of fishing
villages before it became a launching place for the opium trade in China.
Beijing officials also harbour lingering suspicions about Hong Kong
residents themselves, many of whom fled the Communist revolution in 1949.
Behind these misgivings lie the innate prejudices of Chinese of the north
and the Yangtze river valley - who dominate the government - towards the
southerners and the Cantonese in particular, who predominate in Hong Kong.
They tend to be regarded as noisy, avaricious and untrustworthy.
Among Chinese official perceptions, the one that seems to be uppermost is
that the colony's status is a 'problem left over from history', and as such,
must be dealt with in those terms. This is not necessarily forward-looking.
Scarcely a week passes without reference somewhere in the official media to
the unequal treaties, infringements of sovereignty and so on. Chinese
officials in the past week or so assailed a House of Commons report on the
Hong Kong issue, saying that 'China is no longer what it used to be when it
was bullied and lorded over at will'.
But for all the mis-perceptions, wilful and otherwise, there is little sign
of Beijing losing its keen appreciation of Hong Kong's value as an
international conduit, and increasingly as a destination for mainland
investment.
Powerful Chinese corporations are flocking to Hong Kong, strengthening
business ties with the centre. In turn, this is providing a useful
educational function for a sometimes remote leadership. Indeed, many of the
younger Chinese businessmen most active in Hong Kong are the sons and
daughters of senior Beijing cadres, including Mr Deng Xiaoping himself.
While the political relationship may be fractious, business continues. This
was so even at the height of the cultural revolution when nervousness in
Hong Kong peaked about its neighbour.
Mainland businessmen make no secret of Hong Kong's value as a launching pad
for their broader international ambitions. It might be a cliche, but if a
place like Hong Kong did not exist the Chinese might be obliged to invent
one.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (2): Patten reforms make headway - Simon
Holberton gives his assessment of the political mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A calm that has not been seen since before the arrival of Mr Chris Patten,
its populist governor, almost two years ago, has returned to politics in
Hong Kong.
Whether this is because the eye of the storm is presently passing over the
colony, or because the storm has run its course cannot be known with total
confidence.
But what is clear is that ever since the breakdown in Sino-British
co-operation on Hong Kong's political develop- ment - especially since
February, when the colony's legislative council (LegCo) passed the first
stage of Mr Patten's democracy legislation - both sides have moved to take
the heat out of the issue.
China has scaled back its attack on the governor and his pro-democracy
supporters in LegCo. For his part, Mr Patten has drawn back from engaging in
the high-profile political campaign promised late last year and is watching
the LegCo process of ratifying, or amending, his second reform bill, with
cool detachment.
Apart from lowering the volume of the abuse it directs at Mr Patten, there
are plenty of signs of China's new attitude. Beijing now appears prepared to
settle some out- standing issues relating to Hong Kong's economic devel-
opment.
Prospects have brightened for a resolution to the dispute over financing
Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport and railway. Some in the colonial
government are hopeful of an agreement before the summer; pessimists look to
the autumn.
There are also indications that China will permit its surrogates in Hong
Kong to contest elections under the terms of the Patten provisions. The
Chinese Communist party's main grassroots political organisation, the
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, seems likely to run
candidates in the elections due this autumn for 'district boards', the
lowest level of local government in Hong Kong.
The better atmosphere, however, may be no more than inaction born of
distraction. A less optimistic interpretation of current events is that
China's leaders have their hands full with more pressing matters, such as
getting control of the economy and jockeying to secure a place in the
post-Deng Xiaoping leadership of the country.
Whatever the case, the Hong Kong government has some cause to feel pleased
with itself. Mr Patten's first political reform bill got through LegCo with
a higher-than-expected vote of support. The bill cleared the way for this
September's district board elections and municipal council elections in
March next year.
The governor's aides are quietly confident that his second reform bill -
which seeks to broaden the demo- cratic franchise for the LegCo elections to
be held in autumn 1995 - will also get through relatively unscathed, if only
because the bill is too difficult to amend substantially.
On balance, this is probably correct, although Mr Patten's plan to increase
democracy by enfranchising the colony's working population is seen as
vulnerable to amendment. Under this proposal, Mr Patten envisages dividing
the colony's working population of 2.7m into nine 'functional' electorates
along industry lines.
This is likely to be opposed by conservative and ind- ependent members, who
together may have a majority to block the proposal. Together, they may amend
the provision so that the nine new functional constituencies resemble the
existing 21 constituencies which represent business and professional
interests.
It it less certain, however, if a majority exists to block Mr Patten's other
proposal which so angered Beijing: the method of electing 10 LegCo members
in 1995 via an electoral college.
Mr Patten has proposed that the 347 district board members elected this
autumn form a committee next year and from among their number elect 10 LegCo
members. Conservatives will attempt to amend this provision to bring it more
in line with China's wish to see a committee which consists of four broad
sections of Hong Kong society.
Soon after Mr Patten unveiled his political proposals in October 1992 LegCo
supported his proposal for the election committee. Although Beijing's
pressure on individual members has eroded some of this support, even
conservative members are unsure if they can defeat this measure. The
recently announced merger between the United Democrats and Meeting Point
will make the Demo- cratic Party, with 17 followers, the largest party in
the 60-strong LegCo. This group will support Mr Patten.
The prevailing view among middle-of-the-road LegCo members was summed up by
one recently as follows: 'Ironically, the hardliners in Beijing and Chris
Patten are on the same side. He wants his bill to go through and so do they,
so they can tear it up in 1997. It would be more difficult for China to tear
it up if the middle view prevails.'
China is, however, keeping its powder dry.
Among much fanfare and sabre rattling it launched last summer the
'Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong
Special Admin- istrative Region' - to give the PWC its full name. As a
precaution against failure in talks with Britain, which were then under way,
one of its first tasks was to draw up a specif- ication for elections to be
held in the second half of 1997.
However, according to one member of the PWC, the committee is unlikely to
come up with recommendations that are set in concrete. 'There is a long time
between now and 1997, much can happen and we want to retain flexibility,' he
says.
Such an attitude casts an interesting light on China's threat to disband the
LegCo elected in 1995 upon its resumption of sovereignty in mid-1997; it
suggests that Beijing may want to assess the outcome of the elections before
it makes any firm decision.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (1): Time to be more sober
 -Over the past decade, returns have been extraordinary and, on the face of
it, pension fund managers have done an excellent job. But the level of risk
in portfolios is now concerning actuaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
At one level, 1993 was a wonderful year for investment returns for the UK's
pension funds. The average rate of return was some 28-29 per cent, depending
on the degree of exposure to property.
This was the best year since 1989 in nominal terms, and in real terms was
even better, given the much lower levels of pay and price inflation.
Over the past decade the returns have been extraordinary: an average annual
return for the median fund of 15.9 per cent, according to Caps, one of the
two performance measurement services.
This has shown a vast margin over the 5 per cent average inflation rate, and
7.4 per cent a year over pay inflation, which is more relevant to the large
majority of pension schemes which offer benefits linked to pay at or near
retirement.
On the face of it, pension fund managers have done an excellent job but they
have achieved this by pushing the investment strategy of UK schemes towards
new extremes of risk. The exposure of funds to equities, according to the
other measurement specialist WM, is now 80 per cent, against only about 60
per cent ten years ago
The level of risk in pension fund portfolios is now beginning to cause
concern among actuaries, who are worried that the increasing maturity of
many schemes may require the adoption of a lower-risk strategy.
There is also concern at government level, following last autumn's
publication of the report of the Goode Committee on pension law reform. The
department of social security is currently preparing a White Paper on
proposed legislation, including rules on a minimum solvency standard.
The government is likely to follow the line of the Goode Report and
legislate, perhaps in 1995, to improve the security of pension scheme
members when companies get into trouble.
A minimum solvency standard might mean that companies would be forced to
pump more capital into their schemes at the bottom of a stock market slump.
There are moves to moderate the impact by calculating solvency on an
age-related basis. Only schemes with a large proportion of old members would
be seriously affected. In such cases, nevertheless, avoiding such risks
could cost companies money, if they come under pressure to invest in safer
but lower-returning assets, or alternatively if they feel obliged to
purchase portfolio insurance against the risk of equity market slumps.
Nevertheless, the high returns of equities have greatly contributed to the
currency prosperity of most schemes. One of the leading investment firms,
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, has been publishing a statistical review
called Pension Fund Indicators for 21 years and it has data going back 31
years in all.
Over this period UK equity returns have beaten pay inflation by 4.8 per cent
a year, but the returns on fixed income government bonds have failed to
match pay inflation and have underperformed domestic equities by 5.5 per
cent a year. Over the past decade government bonds have performed much
better against inflation, but have continued to return about 5.5 per cent a
year less than shares.
Somewhat curiously, however, overseas equities have also markedly
underperformed UK equities in the past decade. They have returned 4.3 per
cent a year less on average, even though the underlying economic performance
of the UK has been uninspiring. An explanation could be that valuation
factors have distorted the returns recently; consequently, an unfavourable
rebalancing of the UK market is quite possible in the future.
Certainly UK equity valuations have looked quite demanding recently. The
dividend yield on the All-Share Index of only 3.2 per cent when the market
reached its peak at the beginning of February was close to the lowest ever
reached in modern market history.
In fact, for the purposes of scheme valuations, many actuaries will almost
entirely disregard the surge in share prices last year. They will value the
assets on the basis of dividends, which failed to grow last year: modest
underlying rises were wiped out by the 6 1/4 per cent hit which resulted
from changes in dividend taxes.
The equity market's gain was a valuation effect related to the sharp fall in
government bond yields.
The rise in asset values was effectively cancelled out by the higher present
value of scheme liabilities, because long-term interest rates were much
lower.
These effects of valuation changes were seen even more dramatically in the
US, where long-term Treasury bond yields also tumbled.
General Motors' pension plan, for instance, revealed that each one
percentage point fall in the long bond yield added Dollars 5bn to its
deficit. US pension schemes began to speculate in risky assets, even
including emerging market bonds, in a search for adequate returns.
A subsequent jump in the long bond yield to well over 7 per cent has imposed
widespread capital losses, but has restored some balance to the long-term
institutions by improving their longer-term funding prospects.
In the UK, too, pension funds could not meet their rate of return
requirements in the sterling fixed interest bond market last year.
Although the government sold a record Pounds 50bn of gilt-edged, pension
funds failed to make any net additions to their fixed interest sterling bond
portfolios, although they bought a small amount of index-linked gilts.
On both sides of the Atlantic pension funds were effectively priced out of
the bond markets because of the massive intervention of speculators such as
hedge funds and bank proprietary trading departments. But it looks as though
a very different scenario may develop in 1994.
Whatever happens, however, UK pension funds will no longer be substantial
net investors of new money. Although the total of funds under management may
have neared Pounds 450bn at the end of last year, the net cash flow was only
about 1 per cent of that. Stripping out capital gains and investment income,
the funds showed underlying shrinkage of about 3 per cent.
So far, however, there is little sign among big UK schemes of another feared
development, a switch to a money purchase (or defined contribution)
structure rather than the conventional final salary (or defined benefit)
scheme design. The latest NAPF survey showed that only 7 per cent of schemes
(covering just 3 per cent of the aggregate membership) are run on a money
purchase basis.
However, another recent survey, covering small to medium-sized companies, by
consultants Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, showed a 19 per cent proportion of money
purchase schemes.
There are concerns that as scheme valuation surpluses disappear and the high
costs of final salary schemes become more evident, the money purchase
approach will become much more common in the UK. Because money purchase
schemes transfer investment risks to the scheme member, such a trend would
require investment managers to take much more notice of the short-term risks
facing scheme members, especially those approaching retirement.
This shift is already taking place in the US, where corporate sector defined
benefit plans showed a negative cash flow of Dollars 36bn last year,
according to consultants Greenwich Associates. Corporate defined
contribution plans, in contrast, enjoyed positive cash flow of Dollars 11bn.
Defined contribution plan assets now represent 37 per cent of all US
corporate pension assets, and the proportion could be 60 per cent in ten
years' time on current trends.
Brilliant returns by UK pension fund managers over the past three years,
when the typical fund has produced annual returns of 22 per cent on average,
while annualised pay inflation has been only 5 per cent, have distracted
attention from some of these problems.
But 1994 is striking a more sober note. The typical return will have been a
negative 4 or 5 per cent in the first quarter. From now on fund managers may
need to pay at least as much regard to risk as to reward.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (1): A test of nerves - The rise in US
interest rates and concern about the Chinese government's ability to control
its economy are clouding the outlook for Hong Kong, whose claim to be a
financial centre of consequence is being tested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
This is Hong Kong's year of living dangerously. It is a year when the
colony's claim to be a regional financial centre of consequence will be
severely tested.
Unusually, the tests it now faces have nothing to do with the Sino-British
row over Hong Kong's political development. Britain and China appear to have
reached a tacit agreement to draw a line under that dispute and are in the
process of sorting out the remaining, mostly non-political, issues which
need attention before the mid-1997 handover of sovereignty.
The problems facing Hong Kong come from the US and China, and are a mixture
of politics and economics. They could delay one of the most remarkable
transformations in Hong Kong's ever-changing corporate personality or, at
worst, threaten its new-found and potential financial might.
US interest rates are on the rise and, because of the link between the
American and the Hong Kong dollar, that means Hong Kong's interest rates are
also heading up. The change in the direction of interest rates - initiated
by the US Federal Reserve in February - has already had an unsettling effect
on the colony's financial markets, although US rates have risen only by
three- quarters of a percentage point.
Financial markets have been nervous because they know the change in the US
interest rate cycle heralds the end to cheap money. And the effect has been
immediate: share prices have come under pres- sure and are 20 per cent to 30
per cent off their highs of early January; sentiment towards the colony's
overheated property market has turned cautious.
Most analysts have con- vinced themselves that the property market will not
crack: that Hong Kong in 1994 is not Tokyo in 1989. Instead, they talk of a
slow, orderly deflation in property values, with prices falling between 10
per cent and 20 per cent in the coming year.
However, orderly corrections of overheated markets are rare; it is more
normal for them to overshoot and a sharper correction in prices cannot be
ruled out. This possibility has grown in recent weeks with a marked change
in sentiment towards Hong Kong's property market - where transactions appear
to have diminished - and property companies listed on the stock exchange.
The rise in interest rates has also coincided with a shift in sentiment
towards China. While China may still be the 'growth story' of the 1990s, in
the short term, there is concern in Hong Kong about the Chinese government's
ability to control the economy. That, together with the difficulties of
doing business on the mainland, is causing some business people to look
elsewhere in Asia for investment opportunities.
'The Chinese think there is an endless appetite out there for their
companies,' says one investment analyst. 'Let's see how they manage their
economy over the next six months.'
Further clouding the short- term outlook is the possibility that the US
might not renew China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) access to the American
market, and the imminent death of Deng Xiaoping, China's diminutive and
increasingly frail senior leader.
Hong Kong is populated by gamblers and the smart money is on MFN renewal.
The calculation is based on two words and one set of initials: North Korea
and AT&amp;T. President Clinton cannot afford to add China to his list of
north-east Asian woes; on the contrary, he needs Beijing's support if he is
to achieve his aims on the Korean peninsula.
Mr Clinton also faces strong domestic pressure from US manufacturers who are
looking at the world's largest emerging market for high-tech imports and
manufacturing. Already, there are signs that moderates on Capitol Hill are
preparing the way for Mr Clinton to bury the MFN issue once and for all.
The effect of the death of Deng would be more problematical. Although much
talked about, few believe that it has been fully discounted in Hong Kong's
markets or psyche. One finance director of a large Chinese conglomerate was
only half joking when he observed recently: 'I'm not totally sure that the
old Chinese money won't be switched into Switzerland when Deng dies. No-one
knows, that's what makes this town so exciting.'
Capital flight, excitement and uncertainty are nothing new to Hong Kong. But
they were probably not at the head of the checklist which persuaded many of
the world's leading financial institutions recently to flock to the colony.
Since 1991, Hong Kong has increasingly looked like a centre they must be in.
They have been lured not only by the prospect of China and the role to be
played in the intermediation of its financial needs, but also by the
explosive growth in corporate Hong Kong's financing needs.
Getting a slice of that lucrative business has been one of the reasons
behind the startling expansion of investment banks in the colony. Goldman
Sachs' presence in Hong Kong is approaching 300 staff, up from about 130 a
year ago.
Similarly Salomon Brothers, which has put Hong Kong on an equal footing with
New York, London and Tokyo as one of its regional business centres.
Salomon's staff numbers have risen to 200 from 65 a year ago; it recently
announced the formation of a Hong Kong 'syndicate desk' which will be
responsible for Asian equity transactions.
The arrival of the Americans has had a large impact on Hong Kong's financial
markets. The US houses have kindled US investors' interest in Hong Kong
equities but, more than that, they have pushed aside the traditional British
brokers who have tended to be more narrowly focused.
US securities houses are at the forefront of market innovations (for Hong
Kong at least) such as 'book building' for a new issue. They have brought
expertise to the emerging derivatives market in the colony and have been
prime movers behind the creation of a corporate debt market in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong is laying siege to title of Asia's location for the arranging and
trading of syndicated debts. Virtually over night a 'dragon bond' market
emerged in Hong Kong last year. Some USDollars 3bn of bonds were issued last
year, most of which were lead-managed by Lehman Brothers. In the first
quarter of this year a further USDollars 1bn have been issued.
An indication of the tough competition in this sector of the colony's
financial markets was given earlier this month when most of the Lehman team
joined Peregrine, a local merchant bank and broker. Peregrine is firmly of
the view that equity-dominated Asia will have to develop a long-term bond
market to finance its development.
SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, agrees, believing there will be a
'spectacular' growth in the debt market in Asia on the back of
infrastructure development. Underlining Hong Kong's importance to Warburg is
its decision to station a main board director in the colony from this
summer.
In 1991, corporate Hong Kong tapped the equity market for HKDollars 37bn. In
1992, that had nearly doubled to HKDollars 67bn. By 1993, when corporate
debt also appeared on the scene, corporate Hong Kong - which by this time
included the first of China's state-owned companies to be listed in the
colony - raised HKDollars 87bn in equity finance and HKDollars 33bn in debt
finance, mostly convertible bonds.
The poor performance of the Hong Kong stock market - under pressure from
rising interest rates and the special uncertainties which China currently
poses - has done much to take the shine off the world of corporate finance.
In the first three months of this year, just HKDollars 8.6bn has been raised
in equity and debt - half the amount of the same period a year ago.
There is little doubt that many recent arrivals in Hong Kong have geared up
for the volume of issuance seen in 1993 rather than that expected in 1994.
But for those who can stay in the race, the rewards should be there.

FT  27 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical group Wellcome led the drug sector down as its shares tumbled
14 to 499p, the first time they have been below 500p for more than three
years. The slide was prompted by news that Rhone-Poulenc Rorer was making
progress with a new anti-AIDS treatment.
However, analysts were bemused by the effect of the news pointing out that
the French company had not even begun clinical trials. Mr Paul Woodhouse, of
Smith New Court, said: 'The market is not interested in vaguely encouraging
news but anything vaguely bearish hits the shares.'
Smith has just published positive research on the US sector arguing that
investors have discounted the economic recovery there and are beginning
switching back into defensive stocks. 'We should be watching the UK sector
very carefully over the next couple of months,' said Mr Woodhouse. Glaxo and
SmithKline Beecham shed a penny each to 553p and 375p.
Turnover in aerospace and motor component group Lucas Industries reached 40m
as dealers said the company's pension fund sold 20m shares to Smith New
Court at 206p. The broker placed them in the market at 208p. It was the
highest turnover recorded in the shares since 1987. Lucas shares slipped 5
to 210p.
Full-year results from Sears saw the shares marked down, closing 8 1/2 lower
at 123p with a hefty 25m traded, the highest in over a year. Although the
high street retailer produced figures largely in line with forecasts,
expectations had been raised higher by recent talk of strong sales. In the
event, Sears said trading remained tough, and analysts downgraded their
forecasts slightly for 1994-5 to a range of Pounds 145m to Pounds 152m.
Two big rights issue stories in the leisure sector sent shares in the
respective companies retreating sharply. Compass moved to stem the steep
fall in the shares begun early in the session, confirming rumours of its
interest in a US catering group. The proposed purchase of Canteen
Corporation will cost the UK caterer Dollars 450m, half of which is to be
funded from a rights issue. Compass shares closed 13 down at 316p.
There was increased speculation that Airtours, the tour operator and holiday
retailer, will also announce a rights issue to buy SAS Leisure, a subsidiary
of the Swedish tour operator SAS, for around Pounds 94m. Airtours shares
slid 14 to 466p.
A search for companies with large cash holdings and investments and liable
to suffer, like AB Foods, from a sharp drop in investment income following
the steep falls in gilt-edged stocks eventually focused on GEC, the UK's
flagship electronics group.
Electronics specialists said GEC shares retreated for much of the session on
a story that the company's investment returns on cash would be similarly
affected. Analysts pointed out that GEC had no exposure to bonds and that
its cash was mainly in top quality short-term deposits.
Nevertheless, one institution was said to have sold a block of 2m GEC into
the market at 306p. With those shares washing around the market the stock
price failed to respond to the general market upsurge, closing a net 4 off
at 309p. Turnover reached 9.2m.
The absence of a much-rumoured bid for Lasmo, the oil exploration company,
saw the company's shares ease back but failed to choke off the extremely
heavy activity in the ordinary shares, nil-paids and traded options.
However, dealers said there were strong rumours that Lasmo would attract a
bid before the week is out. The ordinaries closed 2 off at 153p with 18m
traded, the nil-paids fell a penny to 49p on 5.5m traded. Turnover in the
traded options was also high.
Talk of a break-up bid for Vickers inspired the shares to a rise of 6 to
194p with turnover at 3.7m. British Aerospace slipped back 7 to 478p on talk
of continuing tough trading in the regional aircraft business at the group's
agm.
Shell rose 4 to 728p after announcing it has sold an asset in the far east
worth Pounds 350m in net income in the second quarter. The company refused
to give details. BP rose 2 more to an all-time closing high of 391p on heavy
turnover of 17m shares. Oil analysts said UK fund managers were having to
fill in underweight positions in the stock.

FT  27 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kingfisher hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management changes at B&amp;Q, the home improvement subsidiary of Kingfisher,
unnerved the market and shares in the parent group fell 10 to 587p.
Kingfisher, denying an earlier market story that the entire B&amp;Q management
had defected to the rival Do It All camp, said the three B&amp;Q directors
involved had all transferred to other positions within the group as part of
the group's 'normal developmental changes.' However, some analysts took the
moves as a sign that all was not well at B&amp;Q amid talk of continuing tough
trading in the DIY market. Sentiment was also said to be marred by
disappointing French retail figures in respect of Darty, Kingfisher's
electrical retail subsidiary.

FT  27 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Welcome for BAT deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market had expected some move from BAT Industries but not necessarily in
the US and not in cigarettes. Nevertheless, shares in the tobacco to
insurance conglomerate leapt forward 23 on the news of its Dollars 1bn
acquisition from American Brands. Some of the shine was removed with the
release of US data prompting concerns of tighter interest rates. But BAT
ended the day 12 1/2 up at 456 1/2 p with 9.4m shares traded.
Analysts liked the deal, pointing out that BAT had boosted its share of the
US market by paying less than 10 times American Tobacco's current year
earnings.
Mr Nyren Scott Malden of BZW, the company's broker said: 'It looks like a
good deal. It is a business in which they have a relatively weak position
and it strengthens that position.' He added that it would give BAT around 18
per cent of the US market compared with 11 per cent previously.
Mr Chris Hitchings of UBS removed his sell recommendation and raised his
1995 forecast by Pounds 100m to Pounds 2.23bn. 'This deal is strategically
sensible, it's cheap and it's not Groupe Victoire,' said Mr Hitchings
referring to the persistent speculation that BAT had been preparing a bid
for the French insurance company.

FT  27 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: US bonds upset UK equities before the
close - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK stocks closed firmly but well off their best levels yesterday after a
session led by developments in markets in New York and elsewhere in Europe.
Both equities and British government securities stumbled badly in the second
half of the session when US Treasuries fell, albeit briefly, when the US
Conference Board announced a sharp rise in its Consumer Confidence Index.
The early part of the trading saw saw only favourable developments as shares
moved ahead in response to Wall Street's 57 point rise over and good
recoveries in bond markets across Europe.
The trend was emphasised when German markets responded favourably to
annualised growth of 15.2 per cent in March money supply, down from 17.5 per
cent in February and restoring confidence that the Bundesbank will continue
to cut rates; the German central bank confirmed that today's money market
repos tender will be at a variable rate.
By mid-session, the FT-SE was 31.6 ahead at 3,137.7, and investors seemed
little troubled by the comment from the chairman of the Confederation of
British Industry that there was no need to cut UK base rates any further;
the CBI had previously been a leading advocate for base rate reductions.
The stock market has lost most of its confidence in any further cut in rates
but the pound's sharp rise after the CBI chairman's comments was
discouraging for shares in the blue chip export companies.
But the fall in Federal bonds, quickly mirrored in a weak start on Wall
Street and a reversal of the 1 1/2 point gains in UK gilt-edged securities,
bit hard into the FT-SE, halving the morning's rise. Trading volume
increased as shares turned back.
Markets recovered themselves later, although the Dow Industrial Average was
still 7 points off when London went home. The final reading of 3,125.3 on
the FT-SE Index showed a net gain of 19.2. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed
10.1 off at 3,777.7 as nervousness spread across the second line stocks.
With US markets closed today for the funeral of the former President Nixon,
markets in Europe will await their next lead on Thursday, when the
Bundesbank policy council meets and the postponed auction of US Treasury
notes takes place.
There was no shortage of active features to boost Seaq volume to 753.6m
shares yesterday, compared with only 522.3m on Monday. Retail, or customer,
business was worth Pounds 1.67bn on Monday, confirming the continued
strength of underlying investment business in UK equities.
Shares in BAT Industries closed below the best as the stock market assessed
the planned Dollars 1bn acquisition of American Tobacco.
Sector analysts saw it as a cash generative move for BAT, increasing its
position in the large and still highly valuable US tobacco and cigarette
markets.
Bid speculation and share placings continued to enliven the market
background, and investors reacted strongly to the final profits disclosures
of the 1994 first quarter. While the undertone of the market appeared firm,
there was some disappointment that equities were still so clearly vulnerable
to developments in global, and particularly US, bond markets. With a further
tightening of credit policy by the US Federal Reserve still possible,
analysts sounded cautious on the near-term outlook for a UK stock market now
trying to focus on domestic fundamentals.

FT  27 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading in the London futures market took its cues from the US where the
release of some confidence data enlivened an otherwise lacklustre day,
writes Peter John.
A strong performance by the US equity and bond markets on Monday night
sparked off an early rise in London which took the FT-SE futures contract
for June to a high of 3,146.
Then the contract traded within an oppressive 19-point range for the rest of
the morning and early afternoon attracting minimal interest.
When dealing began in New York, the release of US consumer confidence
figures reactivated concerns that the Federal Reserve might tighten interest
rates and acted like a bucket of cold water on Treasury, bund and gilt
prices.
As a result, the Liffe contract slipped back sharply to trade at a discount
of about 8 points to cash and some 12 points below the current estimated
fair value.
However, the nervousness proved overdone and in the last half hour of
trading June re-established itself, and closed 9 above cash at at 3,134 with
turnover very thin at just over 10,000 lots.
Traded options volume of 27,793 lots was up on Monday's desultory level.
Guinness saw 2,678 lots changing hands but the volume principally
represented rolling over of contracts from May to August.

FT  27 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Reports elevate chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Heralded by excellent first quarter results from DuPont in the US on Monday,
progress reports from two of Europe's biggest chemical groups lifted shares
in the sector yesterday.
Hoechst, the first of the 'Big Three' German chemical groups to report
quarterly figures, came in measurably ahead of expectations with a 16 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits; its shares rose DM11.30, or 3.4 per cent to
DM346.50.
Bayer and BASF also rose; their quarterlies are due today, and tomorrow.
Analysts reckoned that the industry's profits growth would accelerate as
increased volume allowed it to raise product prices. 'Hoechst's statement
seemed to suggest that the thin years in the German chemical industry are
over,' said a trader.
In Amsterdam, Akzo Nobel, rated as the world's ninth largest chemicals group
following the merger between the Dutch and Swedish companies earlier this
year, pleased analysts with first quarter results at the top end of
expectations.
Mr Charles Brown, of Goldman Sachs in London, said that taken overall the
results were very encouraging, particularly as the merger was dilutive of
1993 and 1994 earnings. 'One has a sense that while business is currently
not exactly buoyant,' he said, 'it is certainly not getting any worse and is
running ahead slowly in Europe. Over the next year one will see benefits
from the merger filtering down into the bottom line.'

FT  27 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Sao Paulo up 2.08% in nervous trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil
Stock prices ended up 2.08 per cent in nervous trading on the Sao Paulo
stock exchange, hurt by signs that Congress will make no further progress on
the constitutional reform process.
The Bovespa index of 56 most-traded shares ended at 15,839 points, up 323 on
the day. Volume was moderate at CR258bn(Dollars 209). In Rio de Janeiro the
ISENN index slipped 1.6 per cent to end at 60,295 points.
Brazilian congressional party leaders failed to agree on an eleventh-hour
accord to save the long-stalled constitutional revision. Mexico
Equities ended strongly in late trading to close with a big gain in
expectation of a drop in interest rates and news of an Dollars 8bn swap
facility between the US, Canada and Mexico.
The key IPC index rose by 93.05 points, or 4.25 per cent, at 2,284.13 on a
volume of 100.3m shares.
The bolsa was up 49.15 points at midday but - off earlier highs - closed
with heavy buying.
Announcement of the swap facility raised hopes that interest rates would
fall in coming weeks.
Some analysts predict that rates for 28-day treasury bills, or Cetes, will
drop by as much as a percentage point in this week's auction.
The swap facility proved an immediate tonic as the peso gained 0.018 new
pesos against the dollar.
Advancing issues oputnumbered decliners 70-12 with Ggante B leading the way
with a 13.51 per cent gain. The rise was seen as a 'normal correction' after
the stock's sharp fall on Monday after the kidnapping of the company's
vice-chairman.

FT  27 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks edge lower as
profits are taken

Wall Street
US blue-chip stocks were mostly lower as investors booked profits after the
previous session's powerful rally, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 6.24 easier at 3,699.54, while the more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down a scant 0.84 at 451.87 in
moderate activity.
But the secondary markets improved, with the American FE composite up 2.23
at 438.20, and the Nasdaq composite 3.41 better at 734.21.
Stocks opened on a firm note, with the bond market continuing to provide a
favourable backdrop for a sustained improvement in share prices. In part,
the optimism which inspired Monday's surprising 57-point surge by the Dow
industrials carried over into the opening. But equity investors also drew
quiet comfort from the resilience which longer-dated government bonds were
showing in the face of the day's problematic economic data.
The potential obstacle was the Conference Board's April index of consumer
confidence, which came in at 91.7, from a reading of 86.1 in March. The
sharp increase surprised analysts, and suggested the possibility of a spurt
in consumer spending.
Bonds were thrown off kilter by the news, but soon regained their stride,
showing modest gains by midday. At the same time, stocks slipped into
negative territory and stayed there, as mild profit-taking across the board
prevented a rebound to opening levels. Many of the blue chips were showing
modest losses as the session drew to a close, though analysts were generally
pleased that the setback was not more severe.
Corporate earnings were again a driving force in the markets, and most of
the early gains were struck on better- than-expected first-quarter
performances.
Disney jumped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 after the entertainment group
revealed record revenues and net income up 16 per cent in the first quarter.
Elsewhere, Capital Cities/ABC gained Dollars 14 7/8 to Dollars 712 1/8 as it
announced a big jump in net income and strong operating results from the ABC
broadcast network.
In the energy sector, Chevron shed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 90 7/8 after
revealing a 23 per cent slide in net income as a result of low crude oil
prices. Texaco fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 64 3/8 and Arco Dollars 1 1/2
to Dollars 97 3/4 . Both groups posted disappointing results the previous
session.
One of the session's biggest casualties was UNUM, an insurance holding
company which had disclosed a slim earning gain before adjustments on
Monday. The stock plummeted Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 50 1/4 on volume of
2.1m shares. Tobacco stocks picked up value on the news of an agreement by
BAT Industries to acquire American Brands for Dollars 1bn in cash. American,
which makes Pall Mall and Lucky Strike cigarettes, climbed Dollars 2 3/4 to
Dollars 34 1/2 on the announcement. Philip Morris, the world's leading
marketer of tobacco products, jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 54 1/4 . RJR
Nabisco was Dollars  1/2 better at Dollars 6 7/8 . On the Amex, BAT ADRs
improved Dollars 9 1/16 to Dollars 13 3/4 .
Canada
Prices continued to climb in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index
rose 27.07 points, or 0.64 per cent, to 4,263.80. The rise followed a
69.57-point jump yesterday.
Advancing issues outpaced declines 460 to 322, volume of 65.01m shares
exceeded Monday's 52.44m shares, and trading value was CDollars 870.1m
compared with CDollars 675.3m.
Industrial products recorded the day's biggest increase, 1.68 per cent. In
that group, Northern Telecom soared 2  5/8 to 41 after reporting slightly
higher first-quarter earnings, with the latest period including a large
gain.

FT  27 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses respond to good
tidings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street's overnight gains, good chemical results and ecstatic buying in
Milan took bourses higher yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose 1.9 per cent, the Dax index closing 40.98 higher at 2,243.20
after a better than expected quarterly from Hoechst and reduced growth in M3
money supply growth.
The big three chemical stocks led the bourse higher, BASF - seen as the most
cyclical of the trio - outperforming its rivals with a rise of DM14.50, or
4.6 per cent to DM328.50. Hoechst's statement that it had seen a noticeable
economic upturn over the past few weeks added to the general enthusiasm, and
there was a suggestion that German institutions might finally be buying the
sector for its dividend payments, currently due.
Turnover rose from DM7.7bn to DM10.8bn. Professionals also noted stronger
bund and futures trading. Mr Thomas Nolten of B Metzler in Frankfurt said
that there was a story that Monday's equity trading had been depressed by
the expiry of a 2,200 OTC option on the Dax index and that, yesterday,
traders found themselves with short positions to cover.
AMSTERDAM, encouraged by first quarter results from Akzo Nobel recovered
most of Monday's fall, and the AEX index finished up 3.46 at 418.42.
The chemical group dominated interest, hitting a new 12 month high of Fl 229
before losing a little on profit-taking to end up Fl 6.40 or 3 per cent at
Fl 226.90. Hoare Govett sounded positive on the stock, noting that in spite
of recent strength the group remained the cheapest of Europe's chemical
stocks in p/e terms and had, prior to yesterday's rise, been trading at a 10
per cent discount to the equity market.
Heineken added Fl 3.30 to Fl 241, as the brewer said that it was calling on
European subsidiaries to provide supplies for the domestic market owing to a
six day old strike at its two main factories.
PARIS failedto recoup all of Monday's losses, the CAC-40 index ended at
2,130.91, up 14.62, after a session high of 2,138.57.
Equities remained trapped in a narrow range, with many institutions having
gone underweight in recent weeks and domestic investors distracted by the
UAP privatisation. The insurer lost FFr1.10 to FFr162.90 yesterday.
Accor rose FFr6 at FFr718 although Meridien hotels, for which it is bidding,
said that it preferred the offer from Forte, of the UK. Air France, which
holds 57 per cent of Meridien, is due to meet tomorrow to select the
successful bidder.
MILAN was swept to an eight year high by a fresh wave of domestic liquidity,
the Comit index rising 24.90, or 3.2 per cent to 801.98.
Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa Sim in Milan, said that the absence of
violent protest during Monday's Liberation Day celebrations had opened the
way for Mr Silvio Berlusconi to be asked to form a government. This, in
turn, would open the way for lower interest rates, while newly released
first quarter industrial output figures had provided confirmation that
economic recovery was under way.
Industrial blue chips led the advance. Pirelli rose L212 or 7 per cent to
L3,227, Olivetti added L158 or 5.4 per cent to L3,066 and Montedison put on
L81 or 5.3 per cent to L1,613 in volume of 77.6m shares.
Fiat rose L379 or 5.8 per cent to L6,992. Paribas Capital Markets, which has
downgraded the stock from a buy to a hold, said recent positive
developments, including cost savings and new production units, renewal of
the vehicle range and recovery of the European car and truck markets, had
been discounted by the market after the shares' sharp rise in recent months.
MADRID rose but Santander paid for its Banesto win, falling Pta440, or 7.2
per cent to Pta570 as the general index closed 3.07 higher at 322.06.
Turnover shot up again to Pta40.3bn. It was estimated that half of this was
in the banking sector where Banesto rose Pta113, or 15 per cent to Pta868
and the failed bidders, Argentaria and BBV, by Pta200 to Pta5,900, and Pta95
to Pta3,295 respectively. Elsewhere, the US-influenced Telefonica rose Pta45
to Pta1,815.
ZURICH ended below its best as Roche and Nestle turned back after an early
show of strength. The SMI index finished 12.7 higher at 2,776.2, after a
peak of 2,798.4 in response to firmer bond futures and an easing of worries
about the outlook for interest rates.
Roche was unchanged at SFr6,800 after a high of SFr6,890 and Nestle gave up
SFr1 to SFr1,210 after testing SFr1,225. Insurers, underperformers during
recent months, continued to recover. Zurich bearers added SFr21 to SFr1,252
and Swiss Re put on SFr16 to SFr590.
WARSAW went limit-down in most top stocks, and trading in nearly all of them
was suspended as the WIG index dropped 1,225.9, or 9.9 per cent to 12,221.7
after four sessions on the upgrade.

FT  27 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases on renewed
political problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed political uncertainty weighed on share prices, and the Nikkei index
fell on arbitrage-linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average fell 80.21 to 19,628.93 while the Topix index of all first
section stocks lost 6.51 to 1,597.92. The Nikkei opened at a high of
19,718.04 before falling to a low of 19,512.40 later in the morning.
The overnight announcement that the Social Democratic party was pulling out
of the coalition, leaving Mr Tsutomu Hata, the newly selected prime
minister, to lead a minority government discouraged investors.
Volume was flat at 240m shares as most market participants remained
sidelined. The Nikkei 300 fell 1.19 to 292.13. Advances led declines by 707
to 258 with 217 issues remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.09 to 1,307,36.
Some analysts said that they were becoming cautious over short-term
prospects because of the increase in long arbitrage positions, higher bond
yields and the strength of the yen against the dollar. Mr Jason James,
strategist at James Capel, said the Nikkei would hover around the low end of
the 19,000 to 21,000 range, possibly testing the downside.
The absence of foreign buying, which supported share prices during the first
quarter, also worried investors. However, some traders believed that
overseas investors would remain inactive while long bond yields failed to
ease.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y2,000 to Y886,000 while East Japan
Railway declined Y3,000 to Y480,000.
Multi-media theme stocks lost ground, Hitachi falling Y10 to Y956 and NEC
declining Y20 to Y1,130. Speculative shares declined on selling by investors
looking for profits: Sumitomo Coal Mining fell Y10 to Y955.
Furukawa Electric rose Y15 to Y690 on its patent approval to manufacture
shape memory alloys of nickel and titanium.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 116.96 to 21,912.54 in volume of 17.2m
shares.
Roundup
New York's overnight improvement brought gains to several markets in the
region.
HONG KONG moved on Wall Street and on fading concern about government
attempts to cool down the residential property market. The Hang Seng index
rose 192.53, or 2.1 per cent to 9,328.64 as turnover climbed from HKDollars
2.95bn to HKDollars 4.06bn.
The property sub-index closed 443.04, or 2.8 per cent higher at 16,109.58.
Cheung Kong was up HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 37.75, Henderson Land added
HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 40 and SHK Properties HKDollars 2.00 to
HKDollars 49. Brokers said that investors no longer feared drastic measures
in any government bid to halt the rise in property prices.
AUSTRALIA added a rise in the domestic bond market and buying, mostly from
local institutions, took the All Ordinaries index up 26.9 to 2,069.4.
Turnover, however, was light at ADollars 370.84m.
Industrials were generally strong, and oil stocks performed well after oil
prices hit five month highs on short-term supply worries. Ampolex and Santos
both rose 18 cents, to ADollars 4.38 and ADollars 4.08, and Woodside put on
12 at ADollars 4.30. NEW ZEALAND gained 1.8 per cent although here, too,
professionals pointed to light volume as the NZSE-40 capital index closed up
36.91 at 2,130.18.
Turnover was NZDollars 33.5m. Brokers also said that and a lacklustre debt
market inhibited the buyers, and pointed out that recent similar rises on
Wall Street had invariably been quickly snuffed out the next day by large
falls.
MANILA offered higher than expected first quarter profits from Meralco, the
electric utility, coupled with PLDT's rise in New York as the composite
index rose 29.19 to 2,867.59.
Meralco A rose 12.50 pesos to 447.50 pesos after the company announced a 129
per cent increase in first quarter net profits, and PLDT closed 15 pesos
higher at 1,780 pesos.
TAIWAN saw its highest volume since February 4 as heavy profit-taking took
the weighted index down 67.39 to 5,851.16 after a 57-point rise at the
opening. Turnover rose from TDollars 73.22bn to TDollars 89.91bn.
Heavy profit-taking in plastics triggered across-the-board selling.
Petrochemical stocks were especially weak, with China Petrochemical down 7
per cent at TDollars 26.60.
BANGKOK lost 1.1 per cent, the SET index closing 14.08 lower at 1,263.79 on
rising interest rates and political uncertainty.
KARACHI opened its new account with the KSE 100 index down 17.42 at
2,408.62.
BOMBAY ended lower in spite of a late recovery on buying by Indian mutual
funds. The BSE 30-share index fell 32.75 to 3,780.52.

The Johannesburg industrial index recorded an all-time high yesterday as
voting began in the country's first all-race elections. The index ended up
226 or nearly 4 per cent at 6,257, while the overall index added 172 to
5,240 and the gold index 60 to 1,906.
The market will be closed today. Voting continues today and tomorrow, with
initial results expected on Friday.
Other factors aiding the strong run in shares were a higher Wall Street and
gold's firmer showing. Among the session's best gains, Anglos improved
R16.50 to R232, Kloof added R2.75 to R46.25 and SAB gained R2 to R94.
De Beers rose R3.75 to R112. Sappi added R3 to R45 in spite of passing its
full year dividend and reporting sharply lower earnings. Dealers said that
the results had largely been discounted.

FT  27 APR 94 / Markets Report: Sterling finishes firmer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling had a better day on the foreign exchanges yesterday, bolstered by
the CBI quarterly industrial trends survey which suggested that interest
rates might have bottomed, writes Philip Gawith.
The UK currency finished nearly two pfennigs higher in London at DM2.5226
against the D-Mark from DM2.5049. It also closed one cent higher, at Dollars
1.5015, against the US dollar,the first time in six weeks that it has closed
above Dollars 1.50. The sterling index finished six basis points higher at
80.5.
Elsewhere, in a quiet day on the markets, the dollar remained weak. It
closed at DM1.6801 against the D-Mark, from DM1.6794, but was weaker against
the yen, finishing at Y102.925 from Y103.225.
The D-Mark was generally stronger in Europe, helped by the market view that
there is little scope for a further downward move in interest rates. It
closed at L958.4 against the Italian lira, from L957.7, and Pta81.69, from
Pta81.52, against the Spanish peseta. The French franc firmed to FFr3.932
from FFr3.435.
Despite the stronger performance of sterling, worries about the trade
balance and political uncertainty mean that there is little enthusiasm for
the UK currency. Yesterday's move appears mostly to have been a response to
comments by the CBI that a further cut in UK rates was unnecessary.
Although the survey showed manufacturing output had risen at its fastest
rate for five years, economists were sceptical about its contents, noting
that the balance of optimism had fallen.
In its daily money market operations, the Bank of England offered Pounds
770m assistance at the established rate of 5 1/8 per cent, after forecasting
a shortage of Pounds 750m.
Sterling futures finished the day slightly firmer, with the June contract
finishing at 94.58 from 94.57. Traders said the market had been fairly
'whippy', with volumes disappointing. There was some support for the longer
contracts.
The Bundesbank repo today will be closely watched. Yesterday the German
central bank announced both a one and a thirteen day variable repo. The
thirteen day period is the result of a public holiday, while the one-day
repo appears to represent an effort by the Bundesbank to prevent technical
factors impeding the downward path of interest rates.
Ms Phyllis Reed, fixed income strategist at BZW, said she believed the
Bundesbank had become worried about the bearish tone of German interest rate
markets. In the case of the euromark futures, for example, the past two
weeks have seen the bottom of the German rate curve come forward from March
1995 to September 1994.
The September 1994 contract finished at 94.85, discounting three month money
at 5.15 per cent then. This is only 25 basis points below the current rate,
which many analysts believe reflects too pessimistic a view on the outlook
for German rates.
Call money yesterday firmed slightly to 5.35/5.45 per cent from 5.30/5.40
per cent. This is still well below the current repo rate of 5.58 per cent.
Predictions about how much the Bundesbank will allow the repo rate to fall
vary from 6-12 basis points. Last week the fall of 12 basis points was more
than the market expected.
Ms Reed said she favoured another similar fall, on the grounds that the
German recovery remains fairly fragile and a turnaround in sentiment about
rates could damage the recovery, by denting confidence. This was why the
Bundesbank had allowed the call rate to stay fairly low, and taken steps to
prevent the monthly round of pension payments emerging as an obstacle to
lower rates.
If this interpretation is correct, it offers the unusual spectacle of the
Bundesbank coaxing the market to take rates lower - the reverse of what
normally applies.
Even a large fall in the German repo rate today is unlikely to help the
dollar shake off its woes. Yesterday the US currency was helped by a sharp
jump in the April consumer confidence reading to 91.7 from 86.7. Economists
were forecasting a slight decline in the reading.
The rise was shortlived, however, as the knock-on effect in US debt markets
soon curbed the dollar's attempt at a revival.
Developments in Japan are not helping the dollar either, with prime minister
elect Mr Tsutomu Hata weakened by the SDP quitting the ruling coalition. Mr
Robert Thomas, currency strategist at Natwest Markets, said the fiscal
stimulus package would probably still be passed, but 'there must be doubt
about whether Mr Hata will be more able on the trade side than Mr Hosokawa.'
South Africa's two currencies were buoyant as voting began in the country's
first democratic elections. The commercial rand rose by nearly three cents
to R3.585 against the dollar from R3.6138.
The more thinly traded financial rand, the vehicle for foreign investment,
rose by 20 cents to R4.695 from R4.895. This represents a 17 per cent
appreciation from the low of R5.6435 on April 11.

<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Silver demand is likely to outpace supply by as much as 250m troy ounces
this year, according to Mr Dennis Wheeler, chairman of Coeur d'Alene Mines,
the second-largest US producer of the metal.
Eventually this would be bound to push up prices, he said. Mr Wheeler
pointed out that silver was the best-performing metal in price terms last
year, moving up from a depressed Dollars 3.55 a troy ounce in 1992 to an
average of Dollars 5.37.
He suggested that annual demand for silver, mainly from the photographic,
jewellery and silver-ware industries, was still growing at a steady 2 per
cent a year, requiring an extra 20m ounces a year, but low prices at the end
of the 1980s had forced many mines to close.
Two mines in the Coeur d'Alene mining district of Idaho, in which his
company has an interest - the Coeur and Galena silver mines - are at present
temporarily shut down and on a care and maintenance basis. Mr Wheeler said
it would need a sustained silver price of Dollars 6 an ounce to make it
worth re-opening those mines. Last night silver closed in London up 5 cents
at Dollars 5.18 1/2 .
The Washington-based Silver Institute estimated last year that there was a
88.6m-ounce supply deficit in 1992 and predicted there might be one of
143.2m ounces in 1993 - a fourth consecutive year of deficit. The huge
stocks of silver that have enabled this gap to be filled have also depressed
the price.
The institute will be publishing its latest market review on May 12. Mr
Wheeler said this would be likely to show that consumption of silver for
jewellery and silverware had exceeded the metal's use in photography for the
first time in 25 years.
He suggested that new technology still posed no big threat to the use of
silver in photography. Last year's scare was caused by Polaroid's technology
for silver-free graphic art applications, but this would reduce annual
silver usage by only 15m ounces (out of demand approaching 600m ounces) even
if 100 per cent of the business moved to the new process - which was
unlikely because of its cost.

Amazon field

Maxus, the US oil company, has started production in the first of a series
of new oil fields in Ecuador's Amazon region. The Tivacuno and surrounding
fields have estimated reserves of 1.4bn barrels, of which Maxus expects to
extract about 200m.
As of yet the wells are being tested for their actual production capacity,
but Maxus expects to be producing 30,000 barrels a day within a month,
compared with the current 15,000 b/d.
Total investment for the exploration and exploitation of the area under
concession from Ecuador's state company PetroEcuador amounts to USDollars
800m. According to Mr William Hutton, general manager of Maxus Ecuador, it
is the largest heavy crude oil exploitation project now being developed
anywhere in the world.
With a crude oil density between 14.5 and 22 API, Maxus is the first oil
company in Ecuador to produce large quantities of heavy crude. To enable the
transportation of the oil it is first being heated and then mixed with
lighter crude before being pumped through the Trans-Ecuadorian pipeline
across the Andes to the Pacific Coast.
The nearby Bogi-Capiron field, with crude oil averaging an API of 18, will
come on stream within the next couple of months. The total production Maxus
expects to reach is 60,000 b/d. The production cost per barrel is put at
USDollars 3.30.
Mr Francisco Acosta, the minister of energy, said the country was entering a
new era of petroleum production. He emphasised the advanced technologies
employed to protect the environment. The use of clustered well sites,
synthetic road materials, and advanced water-oil separators among other
measures are to guarantee a minimal environmental impact.
Maxus enters the production phase more than eight years after the
five-member consortium it belongs to signed the exploratory contract with
PetroEcuador.

project

British Gas has signed agreements with Argentine, Chilean and US partners to
begin a Dollars 14m feasibility study of a proposed Dollars 1.65bn project
to pipe natural gas across the Andes from Argentina's Nequen fields to
Chile.
Pending satisfactory results of the year-long study, British Gas would take
a 30 per cent equity stake in the Gas de Chile consortium. Chilectra, the
national utility, would have 35 per cent participation and lay the 8,000km
distribution network to supply power plants, industry and homes at an
estimated cost of Dollars 450m. The project's transmission and generation
elements would cost a further Dollars 1.2bn.
British Gas would be technical operator of distribution and take charge of
marketing gas, expected to come on stream in 1998. Construction could begin
next year.
Mr Mike Fulwood, regional manager of British Gas, said: 'We are very much
looking forward to working with Chilectra and other partners on the
feasibility study.
The project has enormous implications for the energy industries of Chile and
Argentina and we feel honoured to participate'.
A second consortium, Gasoducto Transandino, would lay the 750-mile
transmission pipeline at a cost of Dollars 600m. Tenneco Gas of the US,
which would be a 25 per cent equity partner, would build and operate the
pipeline.
Chilectra would take a further 35 per cent stake in Gasoducto Transandino,
with 10 per cent each going to Chile's state oil concern, Enap, and YPF, the
privatised Argentine oil group.
The consortia will also study the feasibility of building thermal power
stations, with a total capacity of 700Mw, for which additional investment of
Dollars 600m will be needed. The plants, which would consume 45 per cent of
projected gas flows, are vital to the entire project.
The signing of agreements, after months of negotiations, was somewhat
upstaged by the announcement last Friday of a rival scheme to supply
Argentine gas to Santiago through a much shorter pipeline. The rival
project, put at a relatively modest Dollars 500m, is being proposed by
Canada's Novacorp and Chilean groups Chilgener, Gasco and Copec.

FT  27 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Surprise vote clears way for NY
exchange merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of New York's Commodity Exchange (Comex) and the New York Mercantile
Exchange (Nymex) have approved a historic merger, setting in motion a deal
that will create the largest commodity exchange in the world.
The affirmative vote, announced on Monday night, surprised even the
strongest backers of the merger plan, who engaged in furious last-minute
lobbying to win the required two-thirds majority at the Comex.
In the end the plan passed by a wide margin of votes at both exchanges. Its
strongest supporters are the futures dealing firms who stand to save
millions in operating costs when the two markets combine administrative,
surveillance, and clearing functions. The merger, scheduled for completion
before October, could set the stage for other market combinations in New
York.
Few in the futures industry believed that members of the Nymex and the Comex
would put aside a long history of antagonism and vote to merge, despite the
competitive advantages the plan.
As the futures business becomes more competitive globally, US exchanges in
New York and Chicago have been struggling to cut costs. Neither exchange was
forced into the merger - both have seen business rise dramatically in the
past year, and membership prices at the Comex have doubled in the past 12
months as interest in gold and silver derivatives has surged.
The agreement will result in the Comex, primarily a precious metals futures
exchange, being absorbed by the Nymex, the world's largest oil and energy
futures market. Comex's 768 members will lose voting rights at the new
exchange, but will be paid close to Dollars 70m over a period of five years
for the equity in their seats. Nymex will also distribute Dollars 21m to its
816 members as a sort of dividend for approving the merger.
Comex members will retain their rights to trade existing products, and gain
access to some of Nymex's contracts. Nymex members will gain some Comex
trading rights in return.
Strategically, the merger will generate immediate competitive benefits. Mr
Daniel Rappaport, Nymex chairman, has promised to consider establishing
trading in zinc, nickel and aluminium contracts for Comex members, and to
improve the spread margins between platinum and gold. Comex products will
also be listed on Access, the Nymex after-hours electronic trading system.
Additionally, the merger will clear the way for a new futures trading
facility in the New York area. The Nymex and Comex share a stuffy and
overcrowded trading floor in the World Trade Centre. They had been seeking
new sites independently, but will now combine efforts. Mr Rappaport said
site selection could be completed in the 30 to 60 days.

FT  27 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Amoco to limit gas exploration
in Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amoco has decided to limit its gas exploration activities in Poland dropping
a USDollars 8m concession won 18 months ago on two tracts totalling 2.7m
acres, one south of Warsaw and the other south east of Lublin near the
country's eastern frontier, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The company blames a fall in oil and natural gas prices as well as the
Polish government's failure to extend tax breaks.
Both Amoco and British Gas which won similar rights last autumn have made a
start to full scale exploration operations contingent on the extension of
tax concessions.
Amoco says it will nevertheless be bidding for new exploration tracts in
Poland and will continue with a USDollars 10m exploration programme for coal
bed methane on a 120,000-acre patch in Silesia.
Amoco had originally planned to spend USDollars 20m on exploration in
Poland. British Gas is planning a USDollars 20m programme and a Shell/Exxon
consortium is also negotiating with the Poles for exploration rights.

FT  27 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metal prices still
range-bound - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange trading saw all base metals prices hold in their
recent ranges, although COPPER and ALUMINIUM drifted from earlier highs.
Dealers said copper was supported early on by light Chinese interest and a
fall in LME warehouse stocks. The three months price reached Dollars 1,922 a
tonne but drifted under commission house liquidation and speculative selling
to settle at Dollars 1,914, down Dollars 11 from Monday.
Emerging physical interest and speculative buying stemmed a break below
Dollars 1,280 a tonne for three months aluminium, following earlier Japanese
selling.
PRECIOUS METAL markets maintained their early firmer tone, but activity was
fairly thin as dealers continued to focus on the tension surrounding South
Africa's elections.
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures failed to build on recent gains and
closed with moderate losses, although traders said the overall trend
remained bullish.
COCOA futures succumbed to further trade and investment fund selling.

FT  27 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME ready to meet challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange would immediately review its approach to the North
American market following the unexpected approval yesterday of a merger
between Comex and Nymex, said Mr David King, the LME's chief executive.
'The LME has worked long and hard to gain global supremacy in the contracts
it trades and if we have to work even harder to maintain that position, so
be it,' he commented.
'We will be more inclined to be pro-active rather than re-active (in the US)
after this merger. The North American market is very significant for the
LME,' he added.
This attitude seemed to leave little room for any joint ventures between the
US and London exchanges, although Mr King said the LME 'wished the new
organisation well'. He said there were often contacts between international
exchanges and the LME had a good relationship with Comex. But no specific
joint projects had been discussed so far.
Mr King refused yesterday to give any indication of what the LME's plans
might be, saying it would be unwise to alert the competition.
At present the only competition the LME faces in the US is from the Comex
copper contract. Copper is deliberately excluded from LME-authorised
warehouses in the US so as not to challenge this contract.
There is now likely to be increased pressure from some members for the LME
to establish copper warehouse facilities in the US, which they see as an
important step towards winning more North American copper hedging business.
The US accounts for about 25 per cent of the world's non-ferrous metals
market activity but only 15 per cent of LME business, so there is obvious
scope for business growth there.

FT  27 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rise as two-year auction draws
healthy demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US bonds posted moderate gains yesterday afternoon after a Treasury auction
of new two-year notes drew encouraging demand. The gains were struck despite
news of a surge in consumer confidence this month.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 ahead
at at 89 7/16 , with the yield slipping to 7.106 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 7/32 , to yield 5.538 per cent.
Bonds opened on solid footing, as the optimism which spread through the
market the previous afternoon carried over into yesterday's opening.
Over the past week, fixed-rate investors have become increasingly confident
that economic growth in the first three months of the year was more moderate
than they had feared just a month ago. As a result, bond prices have
improved markedly with the approach of Thursday's preliminary estimates of
first-quarter gross national product. Estimates centre on a 3 per cent
increase, compared with 7 per cent in the final 1993 quarter.
Expectations of slower growth have reinforced conviction among traders that
the Federal Reserve will lift short-term interest rates only one more time
this year, probably near the May 17 meeting of its policy-making arm, the
Federal Open Market Committee. With the Fed apparently moving to the
sidelines, bonds, especially at the long end of yield curve, have become
more resilient to unfavourable news.
Yesterday was a good example. The Conference Board, an industry trade group,
said its April consumer confidence index jumped to 91.7, from 86.7 the
previous month. Although analysts were expecting only a slight increase, the
long bond slipped, rather than plunged, and then regained its poise near
midday.
When the Treasury sale of Dollars 17bn in new two-year notes went off
smoothly in the afternoon, bonds across the board extended their gains. A
sale of Dollars 11bn in five-year securities is scheduled for Thursday.
Trading in the cash and future markets is suspended today as the country
observes a national day of mourning for former President Richard Nixon.
German government bonds ended a volatile day more than half a point higher,
regaining some of the ground lost on Monday. This was in spite of another
poor money supply figure.
German economic data provided the main talking point in the bund market
yesterday morning. March M3 money supply expanded at a seasonally-adjusted
annualised rate of 15.2 per cent, down from 17.5 per cent for February.
However, perversely, even though the M3 figure was well above the
Bundesbank's 4-6 per cent target corridor, traders said the market stayed
firm, helped by short-covering.
Yesterday also saw the release of inflation figures from the west German
state of Hesse, where consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent in the month to
mid-April, and by 3.2 per cent against a year earlier. Bond analysts said
the monthly rise was disappointing.
Yesterday morning, Germany's six leading economic institutes forecast that
the Bundesbank would continue to ease short-term interest rates and
predicted that pan-German gross domestic product would rise by 1.5 per cent
in 1994. The forecast matches the institutes' previous forecast for 1994,
issued six months ago, and is at the upper end of the German government's
own forecast of between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent.
The main focus for the market today will be the repo announcement. Many
market participants are expecting the Bundesbank to slice a further eight to
10 basis points off the rate. The lowest accepted rate at last week's repo
was 5.58 per cent.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 94.05 and reached a high of 94.52
before following the US Treasury market down in the afternoon, to a low of
93.88. The contract settled at 94.26, up 0.61 from the previous close.
UK government bonds opened firm and edged higher initially, following the
German market and helped by the release of the CBI quarterly industrial
trends survey late in the morning.
However, the market dropped back at lunchtime, then bounced back to end up
half a point on the previous close.
Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at SG Warburg Securities, said the CBI survey
should help to revive hopes of a base rate cut. 'The fall in business
confidence reminds us that after a week of strong data not everything is
hunky-dory. The survey is good for the gilt market: rate cuts cannot be
ruled out later in the year and price pressures are very subdued.'
The Liffe long gilt futures contract opened at 106.23 and fell from its high
of 107.11 to a low of 106.01, settling at 106.21.
Market participants expect today's auction of the 6 per cent stock due 1999
to go well, given the demand for this particular five-year issue, and
because the Bank of England's auction is relatively small at Pounds 2bn.

The Slovak National Bank will return to the international capital markets
this year with a bond issue to replenish currency reserves and supplement
help from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Reuter reports
from Vienna.
Central bank official Ms Elena Kohutikova said the bank planned a follow-up
to last year's Dollars 240m private placement lead-managed by Nomura.
Combined borrowing by the Slovak state and the central bank rose to Dollars
1.982bn at the end of 1993, from Dollars 1.625bn at the start of the year.
This represented a national debt of Dollars 683 a head, up from Dollars 562
at the start of 1993, and equivalent to 35 per cent of gross domestic
product at year-end, against 29 per cent, the official said.

taken into account in the structuring of the contracts, according to the
Matif. The new products are also targeted at fund managers.
Corporate treasurers often complain that currency options are too expensive
in the over-the-counter market. The Matif options could provide a cheaper
alternative, but there are concerns that the contracts will not prove
sufficiently liquid.
Currency options are already traded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. A
previous attempt by London's Liffe to trade foreign exchange options ended
in failure in 1990, when the contracts were de-listed due to chronically low
volume.
'I think we will have the same sort of clients as on the Philly, but with
more European participants,' said one broker. She noted that although the
Philadelphia exchange opened very early in the morning, smaller market
participants may not bother to call the US.
The associated brokers have undertaken to maintain a trading team in the
currency options pit, and to trade a minimum volume in each contract.
The list includes French subsidiaries of BZW, Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber,
as well as French brokers.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Bonds: Belgium makes historic return with
FFr5bn deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond market awakened from its recent torpor and saw several large
issues, including Belgium's first in the French franc sector since the
second world war. There was also a five-year Euroyen issue for Sweden and
two sterling deals.
Belgium issued FFr5bn of 6 7/8 per cent eight-year bonds, via joint leads
CCF and JP Morgan. The issue was 'the first of a long series of issuance in
the French franc market', said Mr Jean Basecq, director-general in charge of
debt at the Belgian treasury. He said Belgium's choice of French francs was
motivated by a desire for currency diversification. 'We have too much D-Mark
and Swiss francs in our portfolio, and will keep issuing in the French franc
market,' he said.
Meanwhile, Belgium's long-awaited DM1bn issue has been postponed, said Mr
Basecq. 'When the market is better and investors are ready to buy, we will
come to the D-Mark sector,' he said.
Belgium's bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points over the corresponding
OAT at their 99.55 re-offer price, which some dealers felt was a bit tight.
However, the leads reported solid demand, mainly from French institutional
investors. The bonds closed at 99.25 bid, with the spread slightly wider at
21 basis points over the OAT.
In the sterling sector, Eastern Electricity, the UK's largest electricity
distributor, made its Eurobond debut with Pounds 350m of 8 3/8 per cent
10-year bonds. Yielding 55 basis points over the benchmark gilt at the
99.596 re-offer, the issue was widely deemed to be well-priced. It slipped
to around 99.10 bid due to weakness in the gilt market, but the spread held
steady.
While lead managers BZW and CS First Boston reported healthy demand, others
said the issue had been slow to place. 'There currently isn't enough depth
in the market for that kind of size,' said one dealer.
Part of the proceeds was used to refinance two Pounds 59m tranches of 12 1/2
per cent bonds, said Mr Eric Anstee, group finance director at Eastern
Electricity. 'We wanted to take them off our books at 12 1/2 per cent and
refinance them at this attractive interest rate,' he said. The remainder of
the funds would be used to assist the growth of the group, he said.
Earlier in the day, Abbey National Treasury Services issued Pounds 150m of 8
3/4 per cent subordinated 10-year bonds via Salomon Brothers and SG Warburg.
Its 85-basis-point spread over gilts at re-offer attracted healthy demand,
mainly from UK investors. It also prompted switches out of Lloyds Bank's
recently-issued subordinated bonds, as well as other bank issues, one of the
lead managers said.
The Kingdom of Sweden tapped the Euroyen market for Y75bn of 3 7/8 per cent
five-year bonds via joint leads Goldman Sachs and Sumitomo Finance.
Structured to pay semi-annual coupons matching the benchmark Japanese
government bond, the deal was targeted at Japanese investors. However, there
was also demand from Hong Kong and Europe.

Kaiser Aluminum reported losses deepened in the first quarter to Dollars
29.3m, or 58 cents a share, excluding special charges, from losses in last
year's first quarter of Dollars 16.6m, or 29 cents a share. The company's
net loss for the first quarter, including a restructuring charge of Dollars
5.4m, was Dollars 34.7m or 67 cents per share.
'Most of our facilities reported good operating performance and strong
demand,' said Mr George Haymaker, Kaiser chairman.
Kaiser cut its US primary aluminium output by 25 per cent in the first
quarter of 1993, and this year intends to cut worldwide production by 9.3
per cent. It will now be operating at an annual production rate of 390,000
tonnes of primary aluminium, or 77 per cent of its total annual capacity of
508,000 tonnes.
Kaiser's first-quarter sales dipped to Dollars 415.1m in the first quarter
because of production cutbacks, down from Dollars 442.6m in the 1993 first
quarter.
Kaiser is 60 per cent owned by Maxxam, a diversified natural resources
company. Maxxam reported a first-quarter loss of Dollars 34.5m or Dollars
3.65 per share on sales of Dollars 489m, compared with a first-quarter 1993
loss of Dollars 25.9m or Dollars 2.74 per share on sales of Dollars 513.7m.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Tobacco slump hits American
Brands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
American Tobacco, the US cigarette maker that BAT Industries of the UK is
buying for Dollars 1bn from American Brands, was the parent company's
worst-performing business in the first three months of this year, American
Brands' quarterly results showed yesterday.
The domestic tobacco business's operating profits slumped from Dollars
102.5m to Dollars 55.4m in the first quarter, on revenues down from Dollars
407.5m to Dollars 376.5m - mainly because of the price war that broke out in
the US cigarette market in April last year.
The downturn was a big factor in cutting American Brands' total net profits
for the first quarter to Dollars 149.2m from Dollars 247.1m before last
year's accounting changes. Turnover fell from Dollars 1.89bn to Dollars
1.33bn and fully-diluted earnings per share fell from Dollars 1.22 before
accounting changes to 74 cents.
However, the domestic tobacco business was not the only poor performer.
Gallaher, the international tobacco business that is not included in the
sale to BAT, suffered because of a shift in the timing of the UK budget from
April to November. This caused the pre-budget sales bulge to disappear,
taking operating profits down to Dollars 126.2m from Dollars 165.1m.
The spirits business also showed a dip in operating profits, to Dollars
38.4m from Dollars 44.9m, in spite of last year's acquisition of Invergordon
Distillers. American Brands said this was because of a planned, one-time
reduction in inventory levels at Jim Beam.
American Brands said the disposal of American Tobacco would leave it with
profitable, strongly-positioned businesses that had performed well. It
warned that unusual factors 'may well result in unfavourable profit
comparisons' for 1994. But it lifted the quarterly dividend from 49.25 cents
a share to 50 cents.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp drop in credit losses and big capital gains allowed Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken, the leading Swedish commercial bank, to return strongly to
the black in the first quarter. It posted a SKr1.38bn (Dollars 175m) profit,
compared with a SKr608m loss in the corresponding 1993 period.
The performance puts the seal on a recovery which has taken the bank from
the brink of disaster in early 1993, when it was forced to seek government
aid, to a position of considerable financial strength.
The group was able last August to withdraw its request for state assistance,
largely because of lower interest rates, and recapitalise through a SKr5.3bn
rights issue.
The main influence on the first-quarter figures was a 46 per cent drop in
credit losses to SKr1.55bn. The recovery was also helped by SKr650m in
capital gains from the sale of Banque Scandinave en Suisse and parts of
FinansSkandic.
Problem loans amounted to SKr13.1bn at the end of March - 4.7 per cent of
total lending - compared with SKr24.7bn a year earlier.
Group income before credit losses was SKr2.93bn, up 22 per cent from a year
ago. The disposals helped lift overall income by 19 per cent to SKr4.88bn
from SKr4.09bn but expenses were 8 per cent higher due to increased
equipment and marketing outlays.
Net interest income rose only 3 per cent to SKr2.22bn. The bank was helped
by the reduced cost of financing problem credits, but lower lending activity
and tight margins limited the benefit.
The group said its capital adequacy ratio was 13.6 per cent at the end of
the quarter, compared with 8.5 per cent at the end of March 1993.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: US steel groups hit by winter
weather
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Steel and Bethlehem Steel yesterday revealed disappointing results for
the first three months of the year, underlining the impact of severe weather
on the sector's performance in the winter.
Both groups said they expected to improve in the second quarter as
production levels returned to normal.
US Steel, part of the USX energy group, suffered the biggest setback,
posting a net loss of Dollars 35m, or 56 cents a share, including the
effects of an accounting change, against a profit of Dollars 10m, or 13
cents, in the first quarter of 1993.
Sales improved 14 per cent to Dollars 1.38bn on a 9 per cent increase in
steel shipments and a modest upturn in prices.
The results, although unimpressive, were mostly attributable to factors
outside the company's control.
Record low temperatures and heavy snowfalls in January disrupted raw
material production and steel-making operations. The weather forced the
government to cut power supplies, which further reduced output.
Steel production was also affected by a 13-day shutdown of the Mon Valley
Works near Pittsburgh. Production returned to normal earlier this month.
Modernisation of a hot-strip mill in Gary, Indiana, also contributed to the
loss.
Bethlehem also suffered from the weather. Net income of Dollars 13m marked a
return to profitability after last year's loss of Dollars 41m, but earnings
of 2 cents a share were well below Wall Street forecasts of 13 cents a
share.
Revenues improved 11 per cent to Dollars 1.13bn, due to demand from the
vehicle, machinery and construction markets.
However, the company said severe cold and snow reduced operating results by
Dollars 20m.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Lower oil price cuts Chevron's
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chevron became the latest US oil group to report lower earnings in the wake
of the declining oil prices when it unveiled a 14 per cent drop in
first-quarter earnings to Dollars 424m yesterday.
After special charges of Dollars 36m to cover environmental remediation
costs and the resolution of certain royalty issues with regulators, the
group posted net income of Dollars 388m, or Dollars 1.19 a share.
Blaming lower oil prices for the fall in earnings, Mr Ken Derr, chairman and
chief executive, said the group's 'crude oil realisations averaged about
Dollars 4 per barrel less than in last year's first quarter'. He also said
that temporary stoppages squeezed the group's sales margins.
The negative impact of these developments was partly offset by higher
production volumes and downstream product sales margins from the
international operations, rising US natural gas prices, and lower operating
and administrative costs, which fell 5 cents a barrel to Dollars 6.47 a
barrel.
Total group revenues fell to Dollars 8.3bn, from Dollars 9.1bn in the same
quarter a year ago. The biggest decline was in upstream exploration and
production earnings, which dropped to Dollars 235m from Dollars 360m a year
earlier. Refining and marketing earnings, however, rose 32 per cent to
Dollars 161m. Capital and exploratory expenditures climbed from Dollars 778m
to Dollars 1.06bn, reflecting higher spending on the Tengiz oil field in
Kazakhstan and refinery construction and expansion projects by the group's
Caltex affiliate.
Chevron shares fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 90 7/8 on the NYSE.

<TEXT>
Amdahl, the US mainframe computer company, returned to profit in its first
quarter, following heavy losses last year blamed on restructuring.
First-quarter net income was Dollars 7.1m, or 6 cents a share, on revenues
of Dollars 378.8m. In the same period last year, Amdahl reported a net loss
of Dollars 239.7m, or Dollars 2.12 a share, after pre-tax restructuring
charges of Dollars 243m reduced net income by Dollars 1.57 a share. Revenues
were Dollars 380.7m.
Over the past year, the company has cut its workforce and manufacturing
capacity to bring expenses and production capabilities into line with poor
market conditions. Operating expenses, exclusive of restructuring charges,
declined by some 30 per cent against the same period last year. Gross profit
margins rose 34 per cent from less than 22 per cent a year ago.
Increased demand and improved profit margins on mainframes contributed to
better-than-expected first-quarter performance. Mainframe prices appeared to
be stabilising, said Mr Joseph Zemke, president and chief executive.
'We regard our return to profitability as a step in the right direction,' Mr
Zemke said. However, he cautioned that it was too early to call the
improvement a turnround.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Pakistan primes flagship for
sell-off - PTC could be be worth Dollars 9bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Pakistan government plans to appoint a group of consultants by the end
of this month to put a value on Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation
(PTC) in the first phase of preparing the company for privatisation later
this year.
The consultants' report is expected to be followed by preparation of a
schedule for the sale of 26 per cent of PTC's shares. The government wants
to sell those shares to a 'strategic investor' - a consortium or individual
company committed to technical modernisation of phone services. Another 25
per cent of the company will probably be sold through a public floatation.
The PTC is widely regarded as the flagship among Pakistan's government-owned
companies which are being offered for privatisation. The company has
expanded rapidly over the past three years, investing up to Dollars 1bn to
add phone lines to its network. As a result, the number of subscribers has
almost doubled to 2.2m. Another 670,000 customers are expected to be
connected within the next year.
One sign that the backlog of potential subscribers has eased came recently
when the company for the first time advertised in Karachi - Pakistan's
largest city and business capital - offering to provide instant connections.
The company's growth is reflected in profits and the value placed on its
assets. Government officials involved with promoting privatisation programme
say the company could be worth almost Dollars 9bn. Last year, PTC earned net
profits equivalent to just over Dollars 500m.
In spite of PTC's lucrative business potential, its privatisation has been
dogged by controversy. The process was held up for more than two years,
largely due to objections from the armed forces over fears that its takeover
by the private sector would be a threat to national security. But last
month, the government of Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, overcame
those objections after giving assurances that part of the money raised
through the PTC's partial privatisation would be used for setting up a
smaller communication network exclusively for use by the armed forces.
In spite of the government's determination to go ahead, many businessmen are
concerned over the future of the plan.
One, who has brokered three factory privatisations during the past three
years, said: 'This is a giant. It would be hard to find many investors -
institutional or private - who could easily bring together the financial
package to buy it out. I suspect it may take between two to four years
before private owners are able to come in.' He is sceptical of a Dollars 9bn
valuation. 'If there has to be a substantial lowering of price, that could
also cause a further delay,' he said.
Last month, representatives of donor countries such as the UK, Germany and
Japan, meeting with Pakistani government officials during the annual
aid-to-Pakistan consortium meeting in Paris, urged Islamabad to press ahead
with its plans to privatise telephone, gas and electricity companies. Some
Pakistani officials and economists acknowledged that such privatisations
offered the only hope of repaying part of of the country's foreign debt of
more than Dollars 28bn.
More than two-thirds of the country's annual budget of about Rs300bn
(Dollars 10bn) is taken up by on debt servicing and defence, leaving scant
resources for projects such as road construction, energy, healthcare and
education.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Simsmetal buys private UK group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Simsmetal, the Australian scrap metal company, yesterday announced that it
was expanding its UK operations with the acquisition of G. F. Denton &amp; Sons,
a private company based in London, but would not be proceeding with its
previously-announced plans to purchase businesses in the US.
No purchase price was given for the UK deal, but Simsmetal said its UK
trading operations would have an annual turnover exceeding ADollars 30m
(USDollars 21.3m), the majority of which would come from the newly-acquired
operations.
The UK deal came as Simsmetal announced a third-quarter profit of ADollars
11.8m after tax, and a pre-tax surplus of ADollars 18.1m.
Sales in the three months to end-March were ADollars 173m. This brings
after-tax earnings for the first nine months to ADollars 35.3m, or ADollars
54.6m at the pre-tax level.

Mount Leyshon Gold Mines, part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy
Poseidon group, yesterday announced an after-tax profit of ADollars 23.4m
(USDollars 16.7m) for the nine months to end-March, compared with ADollars
15.2m a year ago.
Mt Leyshon said production rose by 4 per cent, to 168,988 ounces, while gold
sales revenue reached ADollars 103.1m, a 13 per cent improvement. This was
attributed to the increase in production and the achieved gold price of
ADollars 612 per ounce - which compared with an average spot price of
ADollars 555.
Mine operating costs were ADollars 346 per ounce for the third quarter, a 2
per cent reduction over the previous quarter. Mt Leyshon said this figure
should fall as benefits of lower mining and crushing costs emerged from the
current plant expansion. Poseidon Gold, the gold arm of the Normandy
Poseidon, has a 75.6 per cent interest in Mt Leyshon.
Meanwhile, Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie, part of the Normandy Poseidon group,
reported after-tax operating profits of ADollars 20.3m for the same period,
up 2.6 per cent on the previous corresponding period. This included a
ADollars 4.2m abnormal unrealised foreign exchange gain, relating to the
translation of long-term US dollar convertible bonds.

<TEXT>
Tokai Bank, a Japanese commercial bank, and Mitsui Trust Bank announced they
will report evaluation losses on their securities portfolios as of March 31.
Japanese companies and financial institutions have been reporting unrealised
losses on their securities holdings over the past two weeks, due to the
sluggish stock market and weak earnings. Under Tokyo stock exchange rules,
companies must report unrealised securities valuation losses if they total
30 per cent or more of the previous year's pre-tax or after-tax profits.
The losses will not affect earlier earnings forecasts, as they had been
included into the projections. Tokai reported unrealised losses on its
securities portfolio of Y16.23bn (Dollars 149m), or 77.8 per cent of its
after-tax profit for the previous year. Mitsui Trust said it would post an
Y8.5bn evaluation loss on its securities holdings.
Last week, a total of 14 commercial, long-term credit and trust banks
reported losses, including Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank with losses of Y25.6bn,
Sumitomo Bank with Y24.8bn, and Sakura Bank with Y23.2bn.
Nomura Securities, the largest broker, reported an evaluation loss of
Y19.7bn, while Daiwa Securities announced Y9.89bn loss on its securities
portfolio.

Citizen, the Japanese watch and information equipment maker, has agreed to

Citizen said the deal covered notebook and sub-notebook computers but not
personal digital assistants. The products manufactured by Citizen would be
marketed and sold exclusively by Digital and its authorised channels, the
companies said.
The Japanese company will bring to the partnership its expertise in
miniaturisation and component technologies. Its tie-up with Digital would
provide it with opportunities to market the computer peripherals that

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Martin Marietta sales boosted by
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Marietta, the US aerospace group, yesterday posted a surge in
revenues and earnings for the first quarter, highlighting the success of its
strategy during the industry's post-cold war consolidation, writes Frank
McGurty.
Mr Norman Augustine, chairman and chief executive, attributed the strong
results to the 'synergistic benefits' realised through the group's
acquisition of General Electric's aerospace division last year. The deal
made Martin Marietta the largest supplier of aerospace electronics in the
world.
Overall, sales jumped 74 per cent to Dollars 2.03bn. The biggest
contribution was the electronics arm, which reported revenues of Dollars
850m, more than double the year-earlier level.
The space division's sales, at Dollars 650m, also showed improvement, as the
group awaited final approval of its purchase of General Dynamics' space
systems business, expected later this week.
Excluding a special item, earnings were 50 per cent better at Dollars
114.4m, against Dollars 76.4m.
Net income of Dollars 184.6m, or Dollars 1.47 a share fully diluted,
included a one-time, after-tax gain of Dollars 70.2m, or 56 cents.
Earlier this month, the group decided to drop its friendly offer to buy
Grumman, a New York-based aircraft maker, and avoid a costly bidding war
with Northrop.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak turns in flat
first-quarter result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eastman Kodak, the struggling US photographic group, yesterday said sales
and earnings, excluding special items, were virtually flat in the first
three months of the year.
Wall Street analysts were mostly disappointed with the results, but the
share price closed unchanged on the day at Dollars 41 3/4 .
Net income, excluding a Dollars 12m provision associated with the early
retirement of debt, came in at Dollars 94m, or 29 cents a share, well short
of analysts' mean estimate of 34 cents.
The 1993 figure was adjusted to reflect the spin-off last year of the
chemicals division and other divestments.
The reorganisation was initiated by Mr George Fisher, who took over as chief
executive last autumn.
The former Motorola chairman departed from the long-standing wisdom on Wall
Street that Kodak must slash costs by adding to the 10,000 job cuts it had
announced before his appointment.
Instead, Mr Fisher adopted a long-term approach, stressing stronger revenue
growth and faster product development.
In his first full quarter at the helm, sales edged 1 per cent ahead to
Dollars 3.59bn, prompting unease among some analysts.
'The combination of these weak results and the likelihood of continued weak
results in the upcoming quarters will cause people to start to get a little
impatient with Mr Fisher,' said Mr Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential
Securities.
However, operating earnings from Kodak's three main divisions - imaging,
information and healthcare - climbed 26 per cent in the quarter, from
Dollars 370m to Dollars 294m.
Sales in the core imaging business improved 6 per cent, offsetting a 3 per
cent decline in health, and a flat performance by the information arm.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Big jump in profits at Capital
Cities/ABC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Capital Cities/ABC, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a big
jump in first-quarter profits to Dollars 116m, with earnings led by another
strong performance from its ABC television network. A year ago, the group
recorded profits of Dollars 70.5m.
The comparison with last year's first quarter, however, is complicated by
three factors. The latest period included six more days than the first three
months of 1993; earnings from ABC's broadcast of the Academy Awards were
included in the latest quarter, but a year ago they were included in the
second quarter; and in the first quarter of 1993, Cap Cities took a Dollars
12.1m extraordinary charge to cover early debt redemptions.
Even with those three qualifications, the group put in an impressive
performance during the first three months of this year, due primarily to a
54 per cent increase in operating income from its broadcasting business.
Earnings from the ABC network and affiliated local television stations rose
sharply, helped by strong growth in advertising sales.
Cable and international operation earnings were also buoyant, especially at
the all-sports network, ESPN.
Other group segments that reported earnings growth included the radio and
publishing divisions, where the newspaper operations posted a significantly
stronger performance than a year ago.
Cap Cities' results pleased investors, and its shares rose Dollars 14 7/8 to
Dollars 712 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Washington Post said newspaper division revenue fell 2 per cent in the
first quarter from the comparable period last year, Reuter reports from
Washington.
The division suffered from lower advertising revenues at The Washington
Post, while Newsweek felt the impact of a soft market for national
advertising.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Cyprus Amax encouraged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cyprus Amax Minerals, the biggest US mining group, yesterday produced
'encouraging results' for the first full quarter since it was formed from a
merger in November last year.
Earnings were Dollars 28m, or 25 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 588m,
compared with Dollars 12m, or 24 cents, on revenues of Dollars 375m.
Mr Milt Ward, chairman, said the group was well on course to make the
planned annual cost savings of Dollars 120m. About Dollars 20m of these came
through in the first quarter and all but Dollars 10m to Dollars 15m would be
in place by year-end.
On March 31 Cyprus sold its non-core oil and gas business to Union Pacific
Resources for Dollars 819m gross or Dollars 750m net. In the first quarter
these operations contributed Dollars 9m after tax.
Mr Ward said Cyprus was in a strong financial position, with a cash balance
of Dollars 833m at the end of the quarter and long-term debt at only 35.7
per cent of equity.
Coal operations were on track to meet or exceed the 1994 production goal of
80m tons, 15 per cent higher than combined production in 1993. Coal
contributed earnings of Dollars 25m, compared with Dollars 6m, excluding a
1993 pre-tax gain of Dollars 23m. Coal was sold for an average of Dollars
15.48 a ton, against a Dollars 14.17 average cost of sales.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Strike-hit Heineken has to
import beer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heineken, the Dutch brewer, yesterday called on the help of its subsidiaries
around Europe to counter the threat of a shortfall in Dutch beer supplies
caused by a six-day strike at its two main plants in the Netherlands.
The two breweries, in Zoeterwoude and Den Bosch, produce 11m hectolitres of
beer a year, roughly a fifth of Heineken's worldwide output. The group
operates more than 90 breweries in 50 countries.
Supplies of beer were due to start arriving last night from subsidiaries in
European countries which produce the group's two flagship brands, Heineken
and Amstel.
Heineken declined to say which countries would supply the beer. Heineken and
Amstel are brewed by several subsidiaries from Ireland to Greece.
In the UK, Whitbread brews Heineken under licence from the Dutch company.
Heineken acknowledged the imports were 'curious' for the company, which is
the world's second biggest brewer but the largest exporter of beer.
Heineken has a commanding 50 per cent share of the Dutch beer market, which
is poised for one of the biggest days of the year on Saturday when the
country celebrates the queen's birthday at street fairs and outdoor
carnivals.
Exports to the US, where Heineken is the best-selling imported beer, were
not immediately threatened because the company has a week's supply in
reserve at the Dutch port of Rotterdam.
The strike, over pay and conditions, has divided Dutch unions. Two unions
have accepted a deal with the company but the country's largest union
federation has rejected it, and its members have blocked the exits of the
two breweries.

Shareholders in Merloni, the Italian white goods company, yesterday awarded
themselves a four-fold increase in their ordinary share dividend, following
a year in which the group's net profits rose to more than L32bn (Dollars

The shareholder assembly approved a dividend of L80 per ordinary share,

The company also announced that it had been granted a Dollars 100m
medium-term credit line by a consortium of Italian and foreign banks, headed
by Banca di Roma, Swiss Bank Corporation, and Union Bank of Switzerland.
It said that in the first quarter of 1994, consolidated turnover and
operating margins had grown by 20 per cent, compared with the same period
last year. In 1993, turnover increased by 34 per cent to L1,755bn from
L1,306bn.
Merloni's recovery, heralded in February, was based on higher margins,
partly due to the lower foreign exchange rate of the lira and the one-off
effect on 1992 earnings of a L24bn foreign exchange loss.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Akzo Nobel off to strong start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery in Europe helped push up first-quarter net profit at Akzo
Nobel, the Dutch-based chemicals group, by 30 per cent to Fl 281m (Dollars
148m), from Fl 216m a year ago.
The company, formed after Akzo acquired Nobel of Sweden last year, said the
improvement, which was almost across the board, underlined what it described
as a 'good start' to the fortunes of the merged group.
A 9 per cent sales increase in the first three months, to Fl 5.78bn, was
attributed to higher sales volumes, increased prices and positive currency
movements. A continuing programme of cost-cutting enabled Akzo Nobel to
limit the rise in operating costs to Fl 5.3bn, an increase of 7.2 per cent.
The company's shares, one of the strongest performers on the Amsterdam stock
exchange in recent months, ended the day up Fl 6.40 at Fl 226.90, a rise of
nearly 3 per cent compared with Monday's close.
Until the first quarter, Akzo Nobel had relied largely on better results in
North America to compensate for the weakness in European markets. In
February, it predicted that the recession in Europe had bottomed out.
The economic turnround in Europe was reflected in coatings, where all of
Akzo Nobel's European business units posted higher results than a year ago.
At the same time, coatings operations in North America continued their
upward trend. Overall, the coatings sector saw operating profit rise to Fl
92m in the first quarter of 1994 from a pro-forma Fl 61m in the same period
of 1993.
Akzo Nobel, the world's largest salt producer, also benefited from bad
winter weather in the US and Europe, which boosted demand for its road salt.
Besides salt, all other business units in the chemicals sector put in
improved performances, enabling operating profit in chemicals to rise to Fl
199m from Fl 149m in 1993.
Operating profit for pharmaceuticals rose by 19 per cent to Fl 161m from Fl
135m.
In fibres, Akzo Nobel reported higher sales volumes. However, the gain was
largely offset by lower average selling prices. Cost-cutting allowed it to
post an operating profit of Fl 28m in the sector - traditionally its most
difficult - compared with Fl 14m a year earlier.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Hersant sells stake in Hungarian
newspaper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hersant, France's largest newspaper publisher, is abandoning its investment
in the Hungarian national daily newspaper, Magyar Nemzet.
Socpresse, part of the French group, is selling its 92 per cent stake in
Magyar Nemzet, Hungary's fourth-largest national newspaper, to Hirlapkiado
Vallalat, the state-owned media holding company.
The parties to the deal refused to disclose the purchase price but it is
understood Hersant took a loss of FFr40m (Dollars 6.9m) on its investment.
The group has been an aggressive buyer of provincial titles in France and
newspapers in other European countries, but its acquisitions have a mixed
record.
Hersant's 14 newspapers in Poland, including leading national daily
Rzeczpospolita, have been generally profitable; but Diario 16, the Madrid
daily, has suffered financial difficulties, as has Magyar Nemzet.
Magyar Nemzet executives blame the publication's losses on Hungary's
overcrowded national newspaper market, in which 14 titles serve a population
of 10m.
News Corporation, the media group controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch, paid
Dollars 4m in 1990 for 50 per cent stakes in daily Mai Nap and weekly
Reform. Last year News exercised an option to sell its investment back to
the Hungarian partners.
Analysts believe only one national is clearly profitable - Nepszabadsag, the
largest circulation newspaper, controlled by Germany's Bertelsmann.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Income rises 16% at Walt Disney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a 16 per cent
increase in second-quarter profits to a record Dollars 248.4m. Growth in
income from animated films and consumer products offset disappointing
contributions from its live-action films and theme parks.
The strong earnings performance - achieved on record revenues of Dollars
2.27bn, up from Dollars 2.03bn - will be a welcome lift for Disney, which
has suffered several setbacks recently. These have included the financial
crisis at its 49 per cent-owned Euro Disney theme park outside Paris,
opposition to its planned Dollars 700m historical theme park in Virginia,
and the death in a helicopter accident of Mr Frank Wells, the group's
popular and highly-regarded president.
Disney said the financial impact of its investment in Euro Disney was not
included in the latest quarter's results, which covered the three-month
period ending March 31.
Mr Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive, said he was pleased with
the growth in earnings from classic and new animated films, which helped
boost revenues from the filmed entertainment division 19 per cent to Dollars
1.1bn.
Sales of home videos of The Jungle Book and Bambi, and its newer film The
Fox and the Hound, were strong, and compensated for the weak performance of
its new live-action films.
Revenues from the theme parks and resorts division increased only 3 per cent
to Dollars 802.4m. Disney said park attendance fell primarily because of a
decline in foreign tourists. The January earthquake in southern California,
home of Disneyland, also led to lower attendance.
The group's consumer products division reported 15 per cent growth in
revenues to Dollars 368.8m, due to the continued strength of the European
and Asian licensing and publishing businesses.
A deal to restructure Euro Disney's debt is being reviewed by the theme
park's lenders, under which Disney will inject another Dollars 750m capital.
Last year, Disney took a Dollars 350m write-down to cover its investment in
Euro Disney.
Disney shares rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<TEXT>
Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment supplier,
expects to see year-on-year profit gains in 1994 and a return to more
traditional profit levels in 1995, said Mr Jean Monty, president and chief
executive, Reuter reports from Toronto.
The group, 52 per cent-owned by BCE of Canada, posted a net profit of
USDollars 88m, or 35 cents a share, in the first quarter, after a Dollars
72m, or 29 cents a share, gain on the sale of its Saskatoon, Saskatchewan,
fibre-optic plant. This compares with Dollars 76m, or 30 cents a share, in
the first quarter of 1993.
Mr Monty had previously warned that Northern would suffer an operating loss
in the first quarter, but the company produced an operating profit of
Dollars 52m against operating earnings of Dollars 165m in the year-ago
period.
'We are pleased with first-quarter operating performance, as we had
previously anticipated an operating loss.
'Higher revenue growth towards the end of the quarter in certain product and
geographical markets combined with higher-than-anticipated margins
contributed to the positive results,' Mr Monty said.
'We are also encouraged with our progress on the restructuring activities To
date, we have accomplished or announced reductions in line with our targeted
cost improvement programme.'
He said more than USDollars 1bn in cash proceeds from asset sales would
improve Northern's financial flexibility, but added that there was still a
lot of work to do. Recent international contracts, particularly in Colombia
and China, provided a positive reinforcement for Northern's long-term
prospects.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Freeport back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world's biggest producers of copper, gold,
sulphur and phosphate fertiliser, moved back into the black in the first
quarter. Net income, after gains and charges, was Dollars 12.37m, or 9 cents
a share, against a loss of Dollars 55.35m or 39 cents last time.
The group was helped by higher sales volumes, a copper price protection
programme, higher gold prices, lower cash production costs and improved
phosphate fertiliser volumes and prices. Revenues rose to Dollars 449.6m
from Dollars 300.8m.
Freeport sold 155.7m lb of copper and 201,300 troy ounces of gold in the
quarter, compared with 138.1m lbs and 140,300 ounces. It expects to produce
720m lbs of copper and 800,000 ounces of gold in 1994 as a whole.
Nearly all copper production is covered by a programme that ensures a
minimum of 90 cents a lb, compared with yesterday's London Metal Exchange
three-month price of 87 cents. Lower ore grades pushed up copper cash
production costs from 50.2 cents a lb to 59.4 cents.
Fertiliser sales rose from 495,000 short tons to 534,000 tons, while sulphur
sales climbed from 465,000 long tons to 516,000 tons. Oil and gas sales were
up from 433,000 barrels to 823,000 barrels.

<TEXT>
The chairman of the French stock market watchdog yesterday urged Euro
Disney's creditors to make public their audit of the troubled leisure
group's finances.
Mr Jean Saint-Geours, chairman of the Commission des Operations de Bourse
(COB), said it was difficult to assess the fairness of the terms of Euro
Disney's FFr13bn (Dollars 2bn) emergency financial restructuring without the
detailed information contained in the audit, which was commissioned by
creditors from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group.
The COB stressed, however, that Mr Saint-Geours was not making an official
request for the audit to be made public.
However, it is investigating the dramatic movements in Euro Disney's share
price in the approach to the restructuring negotiations, to check whether
there were any leaks of information.
Euro Disney was one of 85 cases investigated last year by the COB. It handed
35 dossiers over to the French courts for further investigation during the
year, against 24 in 1992.
One of France's biggest insider trading scandals yesterday opened a new
chapter as the appeal began in the Pechiney affair, a case concerning
illegal dealing in the shares of the state-controlled aluminium and
packaging group on the eve of a large US acquisition.

Sun Microsystems, the world leader in computer workstations, and Fujitsu,
Japan's largest computer manufacturer, are to expand their long-standing
microprocessor technology partnership to include a co-ordinated approach to
technology development.
The companies plan to invest more than Dollars 500m over the next five years
in the design and development of new Sparc microprocessors and related
technologies.
Sparc is Sun Microsystems' reduced instruction set computing (Risc)
technology, which had until recently enabled the workstation company to
produce workstations that outperform those of rivals, including
Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment and International Business Machines.
Recently, however, Sun's competitors have leap-frogged Sparc performance. In
an effort to regain leadership, Sun and Fujitsu will now work together to
develop more advanced versions of Sparc.
Fujitsu and Sun Microsystems also agreed to a broad cross-licensing of
patent rights, and to ensure compatibility between the computer products
that each company develops based on Sparc technology. Fujitsu has also
extended its commitment to resell, distribute and service Sun products in
Japan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poor results from PepsiCo's drinks and restaurants divisions led to a
slowdown in earnings growth from 12 per cent last year to 9 per cent in this
year's first quarter, the company reported yesterday.
Net income rose to Dollars 282.8m from Dollars 260.4m before a Dollars 55.3m
charge for accounting changes, on turnover up 13 per cent at Dollars 5.73bn.
Earnings per share, excluding accounting changes, were 9 per cent ahead at
35 cents.
On the drinks side, world-wide revenues increased by 8 per cent to Dollars
1.8bn, but operating profits fell by 2 per cent to Dollars 177.1m.
International growth in drinks profits was driven by strong concentrate
volume, improved results in Spain and an initial shipment of Stolichnaya
vodka to Grand Metropolitan under a new distribution agreement.
Worldwide restaurant sales grew 14 per cent to Dollars 2.2bn, but this
division saw a 14 per cent fall in operating profits to Dollars 125.3m.
Pizza Hut suffered an 18 per cent decline, hit by lower profits in the US
because of price competition and lower sales, while price competition and
higher chicken costs cut Kentucky Fried Chicken profits 23 per cent.
The best performance came from snack foods, where sales rose by 16 per cent
to Dollars 1.7bn and operating profits rose by 24 per cent to Dollars
270.5m. New products and strong volume growth in the US and overseas helped
produce the gains.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Hoechst profits up 16% at three
months

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Hoechst, one of Germany's big three chemicals groups,
rose 16 per cent in the first three months of this year, climbing by DM70m
to DM506m (Dollars 295.90m).
Although the figures served to underscore the growing optimism in the
European chemicals sector as the industry pulls out of cyclical recession,
Hoechst warned that growth in profits for the full year would be restrained
despite the encouraging start to the year.
Hoechst, which suffered a 42 per cent drop in pre-tax profits last year,
said profits in the quarter benefited from growth in sales volumes in
markets outside Germany as well as the impact of cost-cutting.
But the company said it would have to bear the costs this year of further
restructuring. Last year restructuring charges amounted to DM1bn; the group
has cut 12,000 jobs in the past three years and plans to cut 8,000 more in
1994 and 1995.
It said business was likely to improve and that profits would increase
despite the restructuring costs. The business environment was steadily
becoming more favourable to the company's activities, it said, but recovery
in Germany was very restrained. The muted optimism contrasts with Bayer
which said last month that earnings this year would probably increase by 20
per cent.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Tenneco to sell 35% of Case unit
via IPO

<TEXT>
Tenneco, the Texas-based industrial company, is to sell 35 per cent of its
Case farm and construction equipment division in an initial public offering.
The long-awaited announcement, aimed at reducing Tenneco's exposure to
cyclical businesses, comes a day after Varity of the US revealed it is close
to selling Massey Ferguson, a big rival to Tenneco's CaseIH brand in world
tractor markets. Announcement of the sale of Massey to Atlanta-based Agco
could be made today.
Industry analysts estimate the Case IPO will yield about Dollars 500m for
Tenneco, which the company plans to use to repay short-term debt and to
pursue expansion of core businesses and new acquisitions.
Case, Tenneco's largest division, employs 17,000 worldwide. It is the
second-largest tractor producer in the US after Deere, and is second to
Caterpillar in the manufacture of construction equipment in the US.
In Europe, Case is one of the top three companies in the tractor market and
is a significant producer of construction equipment through Case Poclain of
France, of which it owns 98.4 per cent.
Case is enjoying an increasein demand from US farm and construction
industries. In the first quarter, it earned Dollars 81m, nearly matching
profits for full-year 1993 of Dollars 82m. But its European operations
continue to make losses.
Tenneco reported first-quarter operating earnings rose to Dollars 301m or 67
cents a share on sales of Dollars 3.3bn, from year-ago earnings of Dollars
275m or 46 cents on sales of Dollars 3.2bn.
Shares of the new Case Corporation would be listed in New York. Tenneco did
not include an offering price in its filing. Analysts said that with Dollars
1.1bn in equity and Dollars 1.5bn in debt, and projected 1994 earnings of
Dollars 300m, Case Corporation's 70m shares would be priced somewhere in the
range of Dollars 16 to Dollars 24.

first quarter
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of Mercedes-Benz cars rose more than 30 per cent in the first quarter
of this year in all the marque's most important markets, Mr Helmut Werner,
chairman, said yesterday. Deliveries of the bottom-of-the-range C-Class
model had exceeded expectations by reaching almost 200,000 since the launch
last summer, he said.
Total turnover at Mercedes, which is the vehicles arm of the Daimler-Benz
group, rose 28 per cent to DM16.1bn (Dollars 9.4bn) in the period, with
passenger vehicles contributing DM9.5bn of this.
Sales for the full year were likely to rise 7 per cent to exceed DM69bn, and
the company was now confident of returning a positive result for 1994.
Losses in 1993 totalled DM1.2bn, Mr Werner said.
Saying that Mercedes' performance was running counter to the continuing
down-trend in the rest of the car industry, Mr Werner said even the
loss-making commercial vehicles business was gaining market share in some
sectors.
Car registrations in Germany had risen 41 per cent to 67,300 in the three
months ended March, pushing up market share 2.2 points to 8.2 per cent.
Full-year registrations were expected to top 200,000.
Elsewhere in western Europe numbers rose 46 per cent to 45,000 vehicles.
Japan and the US both showed increases of more than 30 per cent, he added.
Mr Werner said factory capacity utilisation had been stepped up to 70 per
cent from 65 per cent last year, and boasted that the gap between Mercedes'
and Japanese manufacturers' productivity was closing rapidly.
Meanwhile, the truck, van and bus business was still 'somewhat strained' by
large numbers of relatively new vehicles taken off the road and mothballed
by their owners during the recession.
Foreign heavy truck operations, notably Freightliner in the US and Mercedes
do Brasil, increased output 17 per cent to 26,500 units.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Banesto bolsters Banco
Santander's ambitions - The bank sees the purchase as providing a balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Emilio Botn, chairman of Banco Santander, was once accused by a
shareholder at the bank's annual meeting being too conservative. 'There are
only two kinds of bankers,' he retorted, 'conservative bankers and bad
bankers.'
There were many analysts yesterday who wondered whether the third generation
Botn to preside over Santander's fortunes might have transformed his
family's reputation from one category to the other by paying Pta281bn
(Dollars 2.05bn) for Banesto.
The purchase comes at a critical time in Santander's quest to become the
best diversified Spanish commercial bank. It is seeking to balance income
streams equally between domestic and foreign business, and commercial and
investment banking.
The bank directors argued yesterday that Banesto would be a critical element
in establishing that balance. Yet doubters said its ambition to become
Spain's largest bank could have influenced its judgment of Banesto's true
value.
Santander paid more than last week's trading value in its bid of Pta762 a
share. 'Everyone said Banesto's market price was ridiculous, and Botn has
gone and paid more than the market,' said Mr Derek Bullman, a James Capel
analyst.
Mr Gary Weiss, director of the team at Merrill Lynch, the US investment
bank, that advised Banco Bilbao Vizcaya on its bid of Pta667 a share,
described the disparity between the bids for Banesto as 'a bit surprising'.
Since 1989, when it broke the Spanish interest rate cartel which prevented
competition between banks to gather deposits, Santander has struggled to
establish itself alongside rivals such as BBV and Banco Central Hispano in
retail banking.
At the same time, it has tried to build up international businesses. It has
done so by expanding its network in Latin America, devoting resources to
investment banking, and forming alliances with groups such as Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Yet its directors argue that it was in danger of achieving its hoped-for
balance too quickly by virtue of weakness in Spain. Its income from abroad
was 42 per cent of the total last year, and was likely to be 50 per cent
this year.
In spite of the drive to gather more deposits through its small network of
1,300 branches, it had raised its market share of deposits, mutual funds and
pension funds only from 5.19 per cent in December 1990 to 5.85 per cent this
January.
'It took us four years of enormous effort doing whatever was imaginable in
terms of aggressiveness and innovation to raise our share by 1 per cent,'
said Mr Matias Rodriguez Inciarte, Santander chief financial officer.
This is the reason for Santander displaying such interest in Banesto, which
despite its problems with lending which led to the replacement of the
previous management, has a strong loyalty among customers in Spanish rural
areas.
'We had started to ponder whether, if we stayed as we were, too much of our
income would come from foreign activities, and this re-establishes the
balance. Being a Spanish bank, half our income should come from there,' says
Mr Inciarte.
Santander and Banesto together will now have a 9.7 per cent market share in
deposits as well as 11.9 per cent of branches and 10.2 per cent of loans. Mr
Inciarte argues that Banesto can improve deposit taking even further.
'We have our hands full of things that we can do at Banesto to improve the
bottom line,' he says. He summarises strategy as 'savings, savings,
savings,' arguing that staff must be trained to expand lending without
taking excessive risk.
Santander is also likely to transform Banesto decisively into a pure retail
bank by shedding the portfolio of equity stakes in industrial companies over
the next two years, starting with its investments in media groups.
Nonetheless, Banesto's retail bank will have to perform better to recoup
some of the 15 per cent dilution of earnings per share created by the
transaction even before the planned Pta89bn rights issue.
Mr Inciarte emphasises the importance he attaches to the repeated
re-examination of Banesto's assets over the past two years by the Bank of
Spain, and under Mr Alfredo Saez, the BBV executive who will be retained as
Banesto chairman.
Apart from trying to sell more products, raising Banesto's net interest
margin from 2.7 per cent closer to Santander's 5.7 per cent, the emphasis
will be on cutting costs. Some of this may be achieved by combining central
functions.
Although an obvious way to achieve big cost cuts would be to merge the
banks, Mr Inciarte says this will not happen at least in the short term.
However, he says that lending to large companies by the two banks could be
merged.
Mr Inciarte expresses optimism that Santander can achieve benefits beyond
the minimum projections presented to fund managers yesterday. He describes
the return even on the 'very conservative' Saenz projections as 'very
acceptable'.
Yet Santander has a task on its hands to persuade others that its judgment
was not swayed by the wish to be big. Until Banesto starts to perform like
the bank it envisages, Mr Botn's remark may hang uneasily over his head.

FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Map of Spanish banking redrawn
after auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As an event, the auction of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), for many
years the biggest name in Spanish banking, came close to matching the
country's famous Christmas lottery, known as El Gordo or 'the Fat One'.
The result, announced after prolonged suspense on Monday night and broadcast
live on television and radio, was as unpredictable as the lottery. And there
could be no doubt that the prize awarded to Banco Santander, at a price of
just over Dollars 2bn for a 60 per cent stake, was indeed the Fat One - the
largest takeover and restructuring in Spanish history.
Restoring Banesto's balance sheet has required a total of some Dollars 3.7bn
in recapitalisation and support. With its sale of recently-created new
shares to Santander, Spain's Deposit Guarantee Fund reaps a profit of
Pta133bn (Dollars 971m), reducing by 40 per cent the amount the private
banking system and the Bank of Spain stood to lose in the operation.
The price paid by Santander - Dollars 255m more than the next-highest bid
from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) - caused some stupefaction in Madrid's
financial community.
But Mr Emilio Botn, Santander chairman, said it was 'a unique opportunity'.
It marked, he said yesterday, 'a definitive redrawing of the banking map of
Spain'.
The shape of Spanish banking has changed radically since the country joined
the EU eight years ago. What it had once thought of as big banks  - such as
Banesto - were dwarfed by the European competition.
The process began in 1987 when Banco de Bilbao tried to take over Banesto.
The following four years saw one more attempted merger and two successful
mergers among the leading banks, and the fusion of state banking interests
into the new Argentaria.
What used to be eight top banks - the private-sector Big Seven and the
state's Banco Exterior - have now become four large and one smaller group,
Banco Popular.
The new Santander-Banesto group, with about 11 per cent of total deposits in
Spanish commercial banks, will, according to Mr Botn, have a retail banking
network 'in line' with BBV and Banco Central Hispano.
BBV, with clear ambitions of leadership in Spanish banking, has now failed
twice to obtain Banesto. But it was never obvious how it would absorb such a
large network as Banesto's in addition to its own.
Argentaria, on the other hand, wanted Banesto's branches as much as
Santander, especially in small towns and rural areas. But the semi-state
bank entered the most timid bid - 25 per cent below Santander's. Its dilemma
was that the only way of making a takeover of Banesto politically acceptable
was to link it to further privatisation. And the higher the price it paid
for Banesto, the harder it would be to ensure a successful share flotation.
With fewer outlets than the other three big groups, Argentaria will now be
on the lookout for an alternative acquisition. The final touches have yet to
be put to the new map.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Float price values Hamleys at Pounds 42.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hamleys, the self-styled 'finest toy shop in the world', yesterday set its
flotation share price at 185p, valuing the group at Pounds 42.3m.
The estimated total proceeds of the placing and intermediaries offer, the
joint sponsors of which are Hambro Magan and Cazenove, are Pounds 12m net of
expenses. That will pay off Hamleys' remaining long-term debt.
The market capitalisation was slightly higher than the Pounds 40m previously
suggested. But the shares, on a notional historic p/e of 17.8 times, are at
a discount to the sector average of 19. A notional dividend of 4.7p for the
year to January 29 would give a gross yield of 3.2 per cent - higher than
the sector average of approximately 2.8 per cent.
The deadline for receipt of applications and cleared funds from
intermediaries is midday on May 4.
COMMENT
The question for Hamleys is whether it can capitalise on its retailing
expertise and the strength of its brand - demonstrated by its Regent Street
flagship - to grow the business. The strategy of opening small outlets in
airports and tourist centres seems sounder than failed attempts in the 1980s
to build full-range branches in UK provincial cities, although their profits
contribution may be unspectacular. Potentially more interesting is the plan
to operate concessions for other retailers, such as the deal recently struck
with House of Fraser. Earnings growth prospects may be modest, but the
business is soundly managed, the yield is good, and the price looks
realistic.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Edinburgh Investment Trust exceeds targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edinburgh Investment Trust increased net assets per share by 14 per cent
from 300.8p to 342.1p in the 12 months to March 31, its highest ever year
end level.
The increase fulfilled the trust's objective of beating the FT-SE-A
All-Share index, which rose by 10.9 per cent over the period.
It also achieved its aim of dividend growth above the UK inflation rate,
having recommended a final of 5.8p which makes a total for the year of 8.75p
(8.4p), a rise of 4.2 per cent.
EIT, managed by Dunedin Fund Managers, reported net revenue for the year of
Pounds 30m (Pounds 27.2m) for earnings per share up 10 per cent to 10.17p
(9.25p).
The figures benefited both from growth in investments and from enhanced
scrip dividends, which added 0.54p to earnings.
EIT said these dividends, which many companies paid last year for tax
reasons, were often worth 50 per cent more than the cash distributions, but
did not expect them to be repeated.
The company borrowed Pounds 100m in 1992 to invest in gilts but took capital
gains on its portfolio when gilt yields fell and in early 1994 transferred
Pounds 50m into equities.
EIT warned that the lower yields on equities, compared with gilts, and the
expectation of fewer enhanced scrip dividends in the current year was likely
to lead to a decline in earnings.
It added, however, that this would not impair its ability to meet its
dividend growth objective because of the strength of the revenue reserve
which had risen to 7.31p per share at the year end.
The company saw attractive prospects for capital and dividend growth in the
UK, where 87 cent of its equities are invested. The rest of its investments
are in North America with 3.7 per cent, Europe, 4.3 per cent, Japan, 4.2 per
cent and the Pacific Basin (excluding Japan), 1 per cent.

Shares of William Bedford dipped 2p to 32p after the antique dealer and
restorer accompanied its annual results with a guarded outlook on future
trading.
Despite the 'worst summer sales that we have ever experienced' the
USM-quoted group returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 95,652
(losses of Pounds 271,759) for 1993.
The directors warned, however, that the recovery was partly attributable to
devaluation of stock in dollar terms.
Turnover improved to Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 1.57m). Earnings per share were
1.8p against losses of 5p.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: S Lyles edges ahead to Pounds 113,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite continuing difficult trading conditions and problems in securing
'adequate' margins, pre-tax profits at S Lyles, the carpet yarn
manufacturer, edged ahead to Pounds 113,000 in the half year to December 31.
The rise from the comparable Pounds 102,000 came on turnover from continuing
operations of Pounds 7.76m (Pounds 6.71m). Mr John Lyles, chairman, said the
sales increase reflected changes in the product mix and pressure of selling
prices.
He added, however, that the first-half had ended on an encouraging note  -
particularly in domestic markets - and the improvement has so far been
carried over into the second half.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.14p (1.02p). The interim dividend is cut
from 1.55p to 1p, although the company intends to at least maintain the
full-year total at 3.3p 'if justified by the eventual results and other
considerations'.

Simon Engineering yesterday announced a further move in its restructuring
with the sale of Simon-Macawber to Clyde Blowers for between Pounds 4m and
Pounds 4.45m, depending on net assets at completion. A further Pounds
350,000 may also be payable.
Clyde is raising a net Pounds 5.2m by a 5-for-11 rights issue of 2.45m
shares at 237p. Its shares fell 15p to 290p.
Macawber makes pneumatic pressure and vacuum conveying systems. In 1993
trading profits were Pounds 350,000 on turnover of Pounds 11.9m. Net assets
at the year-end were Pounds 1.9m.
The aggregate value of the deal to Simon is Pounds 5.5m, taking account of
cash retained and waiver of inter-company loans. Simon's shares rose 4p to

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Air London lower with Pounds 300,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Air London International, the USM-quoted charter broker, reported lower
pre-tax profits of Pounds 300,000 for the six months to January 31, against
Pounds 411,000.
Although turnover improved from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 7.8m, operating
profits were affected by pressure on margins and a marginal increase in
overheads, Mr Anthony Mack, chairman, said.
The interim dividend is held at 1.6p, payable from lower earnings of 2.2p
(3.2p) per share.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cosalt swings back to profit
</HEADLINE>

Stronger performances from its fibres, holiday homes and workwear divisions
enabled Cosalt to swing from losses of Pounds 220,000 to profits of Pounds
765,000 pre-tax for the half year ended February 27.

charges to Pounds 397,000. Earnings of 4.11p compared with previous losses
of 1.64p and the interim dividend is lifted from 2.125p to 3p.

<TEXT>
Eadie Holdings, the general engineer, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds
768,353 to Pounds 1.96m over the 1993 year on turnover ahead 27 per cent at
Pounds 29.5m.
The shares, however, dipped 3p to 37p as the group expressed concern about
its contract with the National Health Service.
Mr Peter Bromwich, chairman, said most parts of the transport and
distribution division performed well.
The wheelchairs side had a good year, but uncertainties within the NHS have
led to a delay in the placing of the annual contract.
Mr Bromwich said there could possibly be a significant reduction in the
final level of orders received.
Earnings per share rose from 1.33p to 2.55p and the total dividend is lifted
from 0.5p to 1p via a final of 0.7p.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Huntleigh climbs 24% to Pounds 6.86m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Huntleigh Technology, the medical equipment manufacturer whose share price
has risen 10-fold in the last three years, increased pre-tax profits by 24
per cent, from Pounds 5.54m to Pounds 6.86m, over the 1993 year.
Sales rose 25 per cent to Pounds 35.5m (Pounds 28.4m), driven partly by
strong growth in the UK which accounted for 27 per cent (21 per cent) of
group turnover. There was a Pounds 2.99m contribution from acquisitions.
The company also announced that Mr Julian Schild had been made deputy
chairman in addition to his present role as finance director.
Mr Schild said his father, Rolf, now 69, had no intention of retiring as
chairman but added: 'He may devolve more of the bureaucratic side of running
the business.'
Profits included a contribution of Pounds 160,000 after financing costs from
Nesbit Evans, Huntleigh's first significant acquisition, purchased for
Pounds 11.8m in November.
The group ended the year with net borrowings of Pounds 6.2m, largely due to
the acquisition, representing gearing of 57 per cent. This is expected to
fall significantly in the current year.
Mr Rolf Schild said that all the group's divisions had started 1994 well and
he predicted another record year.
Earnings per share share rose 29 per cent to 17.3p (13.4p) and the total
dividend goes up 35 per cent to 4.5p (3.33p) with a proposed final of 2.5p.
The shares slipped 12p to 488p.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: A more effective way to fight the retail
war - A restructured Sears has seen its profits grow. Neil Buckley reports
on its recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hobby of Mr Liam Strong, the Irishman who is chief executive of the
Sears retail group, is said to be military history. It is an interest that
has come in useful in his two years at the UK's largest multiple specialty
retailer.
With close to 3,000 stores, Sears, when Mr Strong arrived, was a huge army
marching forward without direction or strategy. But with the imposition of a
bit of military discipline it is being turned into a more effective retail
fighting machine.
Like fellow clothing groups Storehouse, Next and Burton, Sears had become
bloated and unmanageable in the late 1980s. Like Next and Storehouse it
appears to have found the way forward.
In two years, profits have increased from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 138m, while
sales increased only slightly, from Pounds 1.98bn to Pounds 2.01bn.
While the results in the last two years have been obscured by a mass of
exceptional items, yesterday's figures showed a clear improvement and
analysts upgraded their forecasts from the Pounds 145m level to Pounds 150m
for the present year.
Operating margins increased from 5.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent, prompting Mr
Strong to claims Sears was 'no longer a recovery story but a growth story'.
The reshaping and rationalisation of the group, and especially of its shoe
retailing business, British Shoe Corporation, is largely completed. Now the
task is to keep on improving operational efficiency, updating the formats,
improving sourcing and ranging to pull more customers into the stores and
cut the level of mark-downs.
If its gets this right, Sears believes net margins can improve to 7 or 8 per
cent and beyond.
At BSC, where Mr Strong implemented a plan to close 350 stores and shed
1,800 staff, hopes are pinned on three new formats into which the majority
of the group, apart from the existing Dolcis chain, will be converted.
They include Shoe Express, a self-service, mass-market format; Hush Puppy, a
more upmarket store, and Shoe City, an out-of-town shoe super-store.
Sears has also launched an out-of-town superstore, Olympus Sportsworld, in
its leisure wear division. Nine have already been built, with a target of
50. At Olympus's high street chain, work is already under way on increasing
the percentage of own-label products to improve the margin.
In the women's wear business, Mr Strong sees the task as introducing new
formats and improving ranges to differentiate the Wallis, Warehouse and Miss
Selfridge chains from their competitors on the high street.
He says some success has already been had at Richards, where introducing
petite and large-size ranges, and a shoe offer, has led to a significant
increase in sales.
Analysts believe more tricky areas to get right might be Adams, the
children's wear business which is competing against a resurgent Mothercare
and saw a fall in like-for-like sales last year, and Freemans, the mail
order business that is number three in the UK market but where sales have
been static for some years.
Mr Strong counters that a new format at Adams will propel it forward, and
says improvements in efficiency at Freemans led to an improvement in net
margins and a 20 per cent increase in underlying profits last year.
Sears spent Pounds 78m last year on implementing its programme, and plans to
spend Pounds 85m to Pounds 90m this year on converting 190 shoe stores to
the Shoe Express and Hush Puppy format, building five to 10 Sportsworlds,
and introducing new distribution systems at Freemans.
The threats to Mr Strong's carefully-laid plans come from several
directions. One is that the recent tightening of restrictions on out-of-town
retailing announced by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, may curtail
the opening programmes of Shoe City and Sportsworld.
Potentially a more serious problem may be the arrival of other low-priced,
superstore formats. In sportswear, the powerful US chains Sports Authority
and Sports Unlimited are said to be eyeing the UK market greedily, while in
clothing TJ Maxx, the US discount retailer, is already here.
There is home-grown competition in the shape of Matalan, the Preston-based
private company which has quietly built up a thriving chain of 35 stores
offering a wide range of mass-market clothing at very low prices.
Mr Strong plays down the threat, believing Sears will have built up a
significant position in out-of-town sports retailing before the competition
arrives, and insisting his clothing chains will be focusing on offering the
best possible value.
For would-be military commander Mr Strong, the Sears retailing army has made
some important territorial advances, but the war is not yet won.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: PosTel Pounds 39m portfolio sale to TR
Property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PosTel, the UK's largest pension fund, is to sell Pounds 39m of properties
to TR Property Investment Trust in a transaction which will almost double
the size of the fund and leave PosTel as a 21 per cent shareholder in the
trust.
TR is buying a portfolio of 10 properties with a rental income of Pounds
3.14m. The deal will be satisfied through the issue to PosTel of 39m
conversion shares, which will be converted into ordinaries by November 15.
In addition, TR is raising Pounds 60m from the placement of 61m C shares,
21m of which are subject to clawback for an offer to existing shareholders
and to the public.
The placing and offer will raise Pounds 100m before expenses, compared with
the fund's market capitalisation of some Pounds 112m.
The properties were held by PosTel Properties, a property fund jointly owned
by the Post Office and British Telecom pension funds.
The company has been gradually selling this Pounds 1bn property portfolio.
It sold Pounds 143m of properties to Hammerson last month and other
properties are up for sale.
Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of PosTel Investment Management,
said that 'it is a question of greater flexibility, for as and when we want
to become net sellers of property'.
Mr Ross Goobey will join the TR board.
TR has existed in its current form since 1982 and has focused on investments
primarily in smaller listed and unlisted property companies.
One of its early forays into unlisted investment was its stake in the
consortium that won the contract to develop County Hall.
The consortium went into receivership with losses of about Pounds 50m after
facing problems with planning permission from Lambeth Council.
TR lost Pounds 10m and has since shied away from passive stakes in large
property schemes.
Mr Peter Duffy, director and manager of TR, said the latest deal 'gives us
the capacity to increase our property content at a time when we think direct
property is more attractive than property shares'.
He said TR might swap the properties for property shares in another company
at a later stage.
It will have 31 per cent of its gross assets invested in properties; some 46
per cent of the latest portfolio is industrial, 42 per cent office, and 12
per cent retail.
Also proposed is a 1-for-5 scrip issue of warrants, which will apply to the
new owners of C shares.

which took his remuneration to Pounds 521,454 against Pounds 388,373 in

The bonus was based on growth of earnings per share, which rose from 5.6p to
8.3p. Pre-tax profits in 1993 improved from Pounds 40.4m to Pounds 55.8m,
with significant help coming from translation of North American profits at a
stronger dollar exchange rate. Earnings were also helped by a lower tax
rate.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Britannia Marine to float in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flotation is an abiding concern for Britannia Marine, which operates safety
standby vessels for oil and gas companies on the UK continental shelf.
However, the Lowestoft-based company will be concentrating on a different
kind of launch when it comes to the market in June through a placing.
Britannia owns and operates nine standby vessels, which can evacuate staff
from drilling rigs and production platforms, and one supply vessel.
The listing will offer an exit route to the company's existing 1,120
shareholders, most of whom backed the company through two business expansion
schemes which raised a total of Pounds 4.2m.
Mr Charles Lister, managing director, said there was scope for further
consolidation in what was a very fragmented industry. In due course the
group would also be interested in diversifying into other shipping
activities.
The company was formed in 1987 as the vehicle for a management buy-out of
the safety standby fleet of Boston Deep Sea Fishers for the North British
Maritime Group. Mr Lister led the buy-out, which was backed by BES investors
through funds managed by Castleforth Fund Managers and Johnson Fry. In 1989
it bought Suffolk Marine for Pounds 9.3m.
Britannia last year increased pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.5m, compared with
Pounds 1.4m, on turnover ahead Pounds 1m to Pounds 13.8m.
The group said no new money would be raised through the issue of new shares
at the time of the listing since the company would have net cash and was
cash-generative.
Peel Hunt has been appointed sponsor and broker to the issue, with Smith &amp;
Williamson acting as financial adviser.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wheel of history goes full circle - A look
at BAT's Dollars 1bn US acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT's Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) purchase of American Tobacco, announced
yesterday, brings the wheel of history full circle.
At the turn of the century Buck Duke, the brilliant and aggressive founder
of American Tobacco, attacked the UK tobacco market. British companies
formed an alliance - Imperial Tobacco - to head him off.
In 1902 the two companies struck a truce: each would leave the other's home
market alone, while their overseas operations were merged in a new joint
venture - British American Tobacco.
By trapping both parents at home, the deal ensured their progeny would
ultimately outgrow them. For American Tobacco, the game was up in 1911, when
the US Supreme Court forced the sale of its BAT holding on monopoly grounds.
Then, in 1927, BAT entered the US market by buying Brown &amp; Williamson, now
America's third biggest domestic tobacco company after Philip Morris and RJR
Nabisco. American Tobacco, shrunk to a subsidiary of American Brands, is
number five.
Aside from the logic of history, the deal is in some respects a very odd
one. The US tobacco industry is under unprecedented pressure. From a peak of
617bn cigarettes a year in 1977, the market last year was a mere 485bn.
The Clinton administration is threatening new and sweeping curbs on smoking,
and the market has been ferociously competitive ever since Philip Morris
slashed the price of its Marlboro brand a year ago.
According to US brokers Sanford C Bernstein, industry profits last year
dropped from Dollars 9.6bn to Dollars 5.2bn. American Tobacco was worst hit
again: from over Dollars 500m in 1991 and 1992, its pre-tax profits last
year were just Dollars 169m.
In addition BAT, like Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco and American Brands itself,
has been using its cash flow to diversify. In BAT's case, the strategy since
the mid-1980s has been to specialise in financial services. Granted, buying
US tobacco assets at this point has an obvious contrarian appeal.
In addition, the deal is a neat opportunity to gain US ownership of brands
like Lucky Strike and Pall Mall, which BAT already owns elsewhere in the
world. But does it not make nonsense of the group's overall direction?
Not at all, says Mr Martin Broughton, BAT chief executive. The world tobacco
industry has been restored to growth status by one decisive factor: the
collapse of communism.
Vast markets such as China and the former Soviet Union, previously closed to
western companies, are now opening up. BAT is accordingly setting up joint
ventures in such places as Uzbekistan and the Ukraine. America, Mr Broughton
concedes, is in no sense a growth market. But it is cash-generative, and
thus complements the new joint ventures, which are long-term and
cash-hungry.
In addition, he says, until a couple of years ago a US tobacco deal would
have been ruled out on anti-trust grounds. Two things now convince him that
this deal will be allowed.
First, in a US court case in which BAT was involved two years ago, the judge
ruled that the US tobacco market, while oligopolistic, was highly
competitive. Second, the chaos caused by the Marlboro price war last year
shows competition working in practice.
Whatever BAT's arguments, it seems significant that American Brands' share
price jumped by Dollars 2 to Dollars 33 3/4 yesterday, in spite of poor
earnings figures reported for its first quarter. Clearly, one advantage
American Brands expects from the deal - besides a handy Dollars 1bn of cash
 -is relief from the downward pressure on its share price resulting from the
political storm over smoking.
Not that the deal takes it out of tobacco. Of its tobacco revenues of
Dollars 7.4bn last year - more than half the group total - four fifths came
not from American Tobacco but Gallaher, the international operation which is
Britain's and Ireland's biggest cigarette company.
But American Brands' drive away from tobacco has been single-minded. In the
last five years it has spent nearly Dollars 5bn on acquisitions, building up
a portfolio of consumer brands.
Its large distilled spirits division takes in Jim Beam, the world's
biggest-selling bourbon, and Whyte &amp; Mackay, which became the world's third
largest Scotch whisky producer with its acquisition of Invergordon
Distillers last year.
It also owns Franklin Life Insurance, MasterBrand locks and hardware, ACCO
World office supplies and Dollond &amp; Aitchison, Europe's biggest optician.
For a long time now, American Tobacco has long looked a weak player in the
US. With its Lucky Strike, Pall Mall, Tareyton, Carlton, American, Monclair,
Misty, Riviera, Private Stock, Prime and Summit brands, it has a small and
declining share of the market, now less than 7 per cent, and looks
vulnerable to further squeezing by the big companies in a shrinking market.
For Mr Broughton, this is part of the appeal. BAT's market share is 11 per
cent, making it a poor third after Philip Morris and RJR. American Tobacco
is fifth. Putting the two together increases BAT's volume by half. 'We see a
merger as being in the consumer's interest', Mr Broughton says - no doubt
with one eye to the anti-trust authorities. 'It makes us a serious third
force in the market.'
Whether that is a desirable position remains to be seen. It is worth noting,
though, that BAT's share price went up as did American Brands'.
The undoing of history, it seems, has its own rewards.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Shell disposal adds Pounds 350m to income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Dutch/Shell yesterday announced the disposal of an asset in the Far
East which is expected to add some Pounds 350m to second quarter net
profits.
The company revealed few details of the transaction, saying it had signed a
confidentiality agreement with the purchaser. Shell said the disposal was of
a 'non-operating asset', which did not form part of its day-to-day
operations.
The announcement had been made merely to satisfy stock exchange
requirements, and little further detail was expected when the second quarter
results are announced on August 11.
Countering suggestions that the transaction involved the sale of a Tokyo
property, the company said the deal had nothing to do with the Showa Shell
Sekiyu Japanese subsidiary. Last year, Showa incurred foreign exchange
losses of Y115.3bn. It is believed to be seeking ways to repair the damage
to the balance sheet.
Shell also said the disposal had nothing to do with the discussions on the
sale of the Billiton metals business to Gencor of South Africa. These
continued and were expected to be concluded by the end of this year, Shell
said.
The company has been focusing on cutting costs and restructuring businesses
 -such as its chemicals division - over the last year. In 1993 it incurred a
Pounds 496m restructuring charge. The group also sold Pounds 672m of assets
last year. Shell said it was not contemplating any other disposals of
similar size in the near future.
The company said it had no specific use for the proceeds.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Protests fly as new BAe chief appointed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small shareholders of British Aerospace yesterday staged a vociferous
protest against the appointment of an American as their new chairman at the
company's annual meeting.
Although the company secured an overwhelming majority of proxy votes in
favour of the appointment of Mr Bob Bauman, the former chief executive of
SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceutical group, a special resolution to enable
a non-UK citizen to become chairman of BAe was defeated by a show of hands
at the meeting to the embarrassment of the company's other directors.
Under new rules, a non-UK citizen can become a non-executive chairman or
director of the company but all executive directors continue to require UK
citizenship.
When Mr John Cahill, the outgoing chairman who never seemed comfortable
chairing his last AGM in his brief two year tenure of the BAe top job,
proposed the special resolution, a shareholder asked how could one ensure
that Mr Bauman had not been programmed by the CIA to oversee the sale of BAe
to McDonnell Douglas of the US.
Mr Cahill said the search for the new chairman had been exhaustive. 'Whether
or not he works for the CIA will be determined by our security forces', he
said.
Mr Bauman will receive a salary of Pounds 50,000 a year, will have options
on 120,000 BAe shares at a price of 550p, and would work at least two days a
week, said Lord Hollick, chairman of the renumeration committee, after one
shareholder suggested Mr Bauman would only work one day a month for BAe at
that salary.
Two protesters had to be dragged out by security guards while others kept
interrupting the proceedings with opposition to Indonesian arms sales
because of the East Timor conflict. More were protesting outside the hotel
during a meeting which had more than its moment of farce.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Stronger UK and US markets help Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tarmac yesterday became the latest UK construction and building materials
group to announce a sharp recovery in profitability in 1993 as it took
advantage of improving markets in the UK and US.
Pre-tax profits of continuing businesses quadrupled from Pounds 13.6m to
Pounds 55.7m thanks mainly to a strong performance by UK housebuilding.
After allowing for goodwill write-offs on disposals, the group recorded a
reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 43.1m (Pounds 350.3m).
The shares, which since the beginning of this year had out-performed the
sector, fell 8p to 178p on profit-taking and concerns that recovery in
housing profits could be undermined by higher land prices.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive, said group profits were expected to
improve further in the current year as Tarmac took advantage of rising house
sales and prices and better building material margins.
Prices of UK building materials rose by 5 to 10 per cent during the year and
by similar amounts in the US where the construction recovery was even more
advanced and widespread than in the UK.
Turnover of continuing businesses fell from Pounds 2.44bn to Pounds 2.37bn.
Losses per share were were 11.3p (36.4p). Pre-exceptional earnings per share
were 3.1p (0.4p losses). The group is paying a maintained dividend of 5.5p
with a proposed same-again 2.5p final.
Interest payments fell from Pounds 58.8m to Pounds 39.4m as the group cut
net debt, including auction market preferred stock, from Pounds 577m to
Pounds 194m, helped by last autumn's Pounds 214.9m rights issue. Gearing
fell from 63 per cent to 18 per cent.
The company, which planned to increase spending on housing land with a
provisional target of building 8,500 homes a year by 1996, said gearing was
not expected to rise above 40 per cent.
Mr Simms said that the group would not chase house sales at the expense of
profit. It would reduce sales if the housing market fell away or land prices
became too expensive.
The housing division produced the biggest improvement last year with
operating profits rising by 43 per cent to Pounds 55.2m (Pounds 38.6m) in
spite of a reduced turnover of Pounds 606m (Pounds 651m).
There was also a turnround in the building materials division which made a
Pounds 3.2m profit (Pounds 2.9m loss), and in the US, which moved from a
Pounds 1.4m loss to a Pounds 3.5m profit.
Construction, in spite of a difficult UK market, maintained profits at
Pounds 21.1m (Pounds 22.7m) on slightly lower turnover of Pounds 945.5m
(Pounds 978m).
Quarry products was the odd poor performer with profits falling by 24 per
cent to Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 26.6m) because of reduced sales of coated stone
in the UK and difficult conditions in France.

FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: John Wood edges ahead to Pounds 19.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Wood Group, the privately owned Aberdeen-based company which claims to
be the UK's biggest indigenous oilfield services group, experienced slower
profits growth in the year to December 31 but continued to expand turnover.
Pre-tax profits were up 3 per cent at Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 18.5m), having
jumped 10 per cent in 1992. Turnover was ahead 19 per cent at Pounds 242m
(Pounds 203.6m).
The company reorganised its North Sea oil and gas services operation in
order to cut costs in the face of ever-weakening oil prices, Sir Ian Wood,
chairman and managing director, said. It carried out sizeable contracts for
Shell Expro and is involved in its Brent field long term programme.
In overseas oil and gas markets, Wood concentrated resources in south-east
Asia, in addition to its operations in the US and the Middle East. It
acquired JP Kenny, the oil services group, which brought it an important
presence in several oil producing countries, including Norway and Malaysia.
Sir Ian said low oil prices would inevitably result in an overall reduction
in North Sea activity, but the company's own market share had increased
because of its ability to offer services throughout the life of the fields.
He expected its work on North Sea projects to be strong for the next two to
three years with some of the recommendations of the Cullen report still to
be implemented and some large secondary recovery projects in prospect.
Shareholders' funds rose 16 per cent to Pounds 57.7m.

FT  27 APR 94 / Sears returns to the black with Pounds 138.3m: Group raises
dividend by 5%; Shares fall on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears, the retailing group that includes names such as Wallis, Selfridges,
Dolcis and Olympus, confirmed its place in the ranks of retail recovery
stories yesterday with a return to full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds
138.3m after a Pounds 47.8m loss.
It said that trading in the first 11 weeks of the current year was
'satisfactory', with like for like sales growth - which excludes store
openings and closures - ahead of the 3.6 per cent achieved in the second
half. The dividend was raised for the first time in 18 months. The shares,
however, closed down 8 1/2 p at 123p. Analysts said brokers had been
profit-taking after the shares had risen sharply in recent weeks.
'There is a good story here,' said Mr Nick Hawkins, retail analyst at
Kleinwort Benson. 'They are making progress across all the divisions.'
Last year's loss was after Pounds 106.8m of exceptional items, while this
year's profit was boosted by Pounds 13.9m of profits on the sale of Sears
investment in Aspreys, the jewellers, and the realisation of its investment
in Satellite Information Services. But underlying trading profits increased
23 per cent from Pounds 100.5m to Pounds 123.6m.
Group turnover increased 3.8 per cent from Pounds 1.93bn to Pounds 2.01bn,
while the net margin was lifted from 5.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent.
Mr Liam Strong, chief executive, said reshaping of the group was largely
complete and efforts would be channelled into improving efficiency, boosting
sales densities and reducing markdowns to drive net margins higher.
The footwear division recovered from a Pounds 14.4m loss to a profit of
Pounds 33.7m. Like-for-like sales increased 2.9 per cent, although total
sales fell from Pounds 552.2m to Pounds 547.4m after the group closed 88
stores.
In the high street fashion division, which includes the childrenswear,
sports and leisurewear and womenswear businesses, trading profits improved
only slightly from Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 30.7m, although sales increased
from Pounds 570.2m to Pounds 660.7m.
Like-for-like sales fell 3.5 per cent in childrenswear reflecting strong
competition, but in the sports and leisurewear business, which includes
Milletts, the Olympus high street and Olympus Sportsworld chains,
like-for-like sales increased 3.3 per cent. The womenswear business, in-
cluding Wallis, Warehouse, Miss Selfridge and Richards, saw like-for-like
sales increase 2 per cent.
Profits at the home shopping division Freemans increased from Pounds 23.3m
to Pounds 30.8m, in spite of a fall in sales from Pounds 539.9m to Pounds
519.5m and a Pounds 5.5m charge - the result of closing Dutch mail order
operation ter Meulen Post.
The final dividend was lifted 7.2 per cent to 2.68 per share, taking the
total to 3.68p - an increase of 5.1 per cent. Earnings were 6.9p per share,
after a loss of 4.6p a share last year.

FT  27 APR 94 / American money brings new risks to markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American investors made more than doubled net purchases of Dollars 67.8bn
(Pounds 45bn) of foreign equities in 1993. That was actually a bigger total
than the aggregate net acquisition of non-US stocks by Americans in the
whole decade of the 1980s.
Such statistics, just released by the Securities Industry Association,
provide dramatic evidence of how the globalisation of portfolio investment
is transforming the world's capital markets. No wonder the financial
economist Mr Henry Kaufman has warned this week of the inadequacy of
regulatory institutions to cope with new risks. Much greater volatility of
securities prices will be a consequence, he says.
Of the Dollars 67.8bn almost half went into Europe, with much of the rest
split between Latin America (Dollars 12bn) and Asia (Dollars 17bn). Although
Hong Kong (Dollars 6bn) received a large proportion of the publicity and
glamour, Mexico (Dollars 5bn) received almost as much capital. The rush of
foreign companies to raise capital through Dollars 10bn of American
Depositary Receipt offerings may have influenced the country allocations,
especially towards Latin America: in all, the emerging markets (not
including Hong Kong) claimed Dollars 14bn of net equity investment. Out of
20 countries only Ireland is listed as the source of net repatriation by US
investors.
Americans were also eager buyers of bonds, with a threefold increase to
Dollars 60.8bn net. Here Europe had much greater dominance at Dollars 55bn.
Despite all the hyping of Latin American fixed-interest paper it seems that
only Mexico (at Dollars 6bn) attracted substantial amounts of capital.
As for flows in the reverse direction, foreigners bought Dollars 21.5bn of
US equities in 1993, after being net sellers in 1992. They were rather
bigger buyers of bonds, however, to the tune of more than Dollars 90bn. So
for all the cross-border rush by US pension funds and mutual funds the
overall net purchase of securities by the US was a comparatively trivial
Dollars 17bn in 1993 (actually only the second year since 1980 that the
chronically low-saving Americans have been net exporters of portfolio
capital). The statistics do not explain the disappointing performance of the
dollar over the past year.
About half of the overseas equity purchases by US investors may be
attributable to pension funds, the rest to mutual funds and other
shorter-term institutions. As for bonds, pension funds appear to have played
a smaller role, with the emphasis instead on mutual funds, hedge funds and
other short-term players. In fact the bond outflows were already tailing
away sharply in the final quarter and the global bond market tumble in the
first quarter of 1994 no doubt reflected attempts to withdraw.
Such cross-border flows are enormous by past standards: in the mid-1980s,
year after year, US net purchases of foreign stocks and bonds combined were
under Dollars 10bn. Growing correlation of market movements is a clear
consequence, with European bonds, for instance, tracking the gyrations of
dollar bonds even though the cyclical economic background is very different.
Last year's feature was the export from the US of volatility: instead of
marginal savings flooding into US equities, which rose only 7 per cent in
1993, they went abroad to Europe, Latin America and Asia, where markets rose
by up to 100 per cent (the World ex US Index rose 30 per cent).
Mr Kaufman's worries focus on the potential instability of this rootless
investment capital. Bond mutual funds in the US, for instance, increased
from Dollars 20bn in 1982 to more than Dollars 700bn today, with investors
shifting from savings deposits to riskier domestic bonds and now towards
global bonds. They have the right, in theory anyway, to sell any time a
panic grips them. The same applies, in spades, to stock funds, worth another
Dollars 700bn.
Hence Mr Kaufman's suggestion that 60 to 90 days' withdrawal notice should
be phased in for stock and bond mutual funds, starting with new purchases.
Investors attracted partly by instant dealing facilities should understand
that investments in long-term securities markets are not like instant access
accounts.
But they would have to decide whether the pleasure of travelling hopefully
was justified by the risk of arriving in the wrong market and being stuck
there for three agonising months.

FT  27 APR 94 / Compass plans rights to buy US caterer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Compass Group fell yesterday after the caterer and healthcare
company surprised the City with news of plans to buy a US contract caterer
for Dollars 450m (Pounds 308m).
Compass said it was 'in an advanced stage of negotiations in relation to a
substantial acquisition'. About half the purchase price would be funded
through a rights issue. The shares closed down 13p at 316p.
The target is thought to be Canteen Corporation of America, based in South
Carolina, which has an annual turnover of Dollars 1bn. It is owned by
Flagstar, which also owns restaurant chains. Flagstar, listed on Nasdaq,
incurred losses of Dollars 1.68bn after a Dollars 1.4bn goodwill write-off
in 1993 on Dollars 4bn turnover.
City analysts were surprised Compass had switched its attention to the US
from Europe.
Only last July the group, which has grown from a Pounds 167m management
buy-out from GrandMet in 1987 to a market capitalisation of Pounds 600m,
bought the airport restaurant and contract catering business of SAS Service
Partner, a subsidiary of the Scandinavian airline. The Pounds 71.9m
acquisition helped lift 1993 turnover by 44 per cent to Pounds 497m and
pre-tax profits rose 31 per cent to Pounds 41.5m.
One analyst said the speed of the deal suggested the group was seizing an
opportunity to get into the Dollars 80bn US contract catering market.
Mr Francis Mackay, chief executive, and Mr Roger Matthews, finance director,
were flying back to London and were not available for comment.

FT  27 APR 94 / Eurotunnel creates new class of debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel is planning to raise around Pounds 650m from a new class of
senior bank debt as part of its Pounds 1.3bn refinancing package.
The company and its four leading banks, or agent banks, are holding meetings
all over the world to win the requisite 90 per cent support of its 200 bank
creditors for the refinancing.
It hopes to have persuaded them by the middle of May, so that it can then
launch a rights issue to raise between Pounds 600m and Pounds 700m of new
equity.
'The indications are that enough banks will back the proposals', said a
banker. 'But it's bound to be a close thing.'
The rights issue cannot take place before the new bank finance has been
raised. The final deadline for securing commitments from the banks to avoid
a financial crisis is the beginning of June, according to senior bankers.
Unlike the previous refinancing in 1990, when Eurotunnel's commercial loan
facilities were increased from Pounds 5bn to Pounds 6.8bn, the banks are
this time being offered a new class of debt. 'It has an enhanced security
package and matures earlier', said a banker.
In other words, the new debt would rank ahead of the existing bank loans in
a winding-up. It is also scheduled to be repaid in approximately 10 years,
compared with the 2010 repayment date of the existing debt.
In a second difference from the 1990 refinancing, the company has recognised
that it will not be able to persuade all its banks to contribute to the new
loan. In particular, it believes that Japanese banks, who have to date
contributed 23 per cent of its Pounds 6.8bn commercial loan facilities, do
not have sufficient capital to fully participate in the new loan.
So banks' participation in the new credit line will be at their discretion
and not a fixed proportion of their existing exposure as was the case in
1990.
A banker said if the existing syndicate of banks was unable to provide the
required funds, the company would approach banks outside the syndicate,
especially US banks, which are under-represented.
Eurotunnel requires the new funds because of the late start of services
through the Channel tunnel, which means it will take longer for it to
generate cash to meet overheads and service its existing debt.
At the moment, it is in breach of its loan covenants and is drawing funds
under waivers from the banks.
A 90 per cent majority of banks also has to agree to change covenants to
'cure the waivers', in the words of a banker, prior to the rights issue.
If the refinancing is successfully completed, Eurotunnel will have raised
Pounds 10bn in debt and equity since 1986, far more than has ever been
raised for any private sector infrastructure project.

FT  27 APR 94 / Santander shares fall on Banesto takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Banco Santander, the Spanish banking group, fell 7 per cent in
Madrid yesterday after its successful bid to buy control of Banco Espanol de
Credito (Banesto).
Santander is to finance the Pta281bn (Pounds 1.4bn) acquisition - Spain's
biggest takeover - partly through a Pta89bn rights issue. The new shares
will be offered on the basis of a one for three already held, at a price of
Pta2,250, less than half the current market level.
Santander's share price dropped by Pta440 to Pta5,710. Banesto shares
meanwhile climbed 15 per cent to Pta868, close to their highest point since
the Bank of Spain intervened last December. Other bank shares also rose.
Santander's Pta762-per-share bid for 60 per cent of Banesto's stock far
exceeded most expectations and was well above rival bids from two other
banks. The shares come from a recent recapitalisation, part of a rescue
operation funded jointly by the Bank of Spain and the private banking
system.
Mr Emilio Botn, Santander chairman, said yesterday that part of the
shareholding might be taken up by associated institutions in the UK and the
US. These could include Royal Bank of Scotland, in which Santander holds
just under 10 per cent, and New Jersey-based First Fidelity Bancorp, in
which it has 24.5 per cent stake.
He said Santander intended to keep a stake of at least 40 per cent in
Banesto, after offering 8 per cent of the shares to its own shareholders.
He said the price was 'absolutely reasonable' and claimed the bank had
'sufficient arguments' for maintaining its AA credit rating. However, the
rating agencies IBCA and Standard and Poor's both said they were putting
Santander under review 'with negative implications'.
Mr Botin said Santander should still be able to increase earnings in line
with the trend in the first quarter, when consolidated pre-tax profits rose
9.7 per cent to Pta34.2bn. Banesto was expected to resume paying dividends
in 1997 or 1998.
Mr Alfredo Saenz, the caretaker Banesto chairman who is being kept on in the
job by Santander, said Banesto would focus on standard retail banking
activities.

FT  27 APR 94 / Economists see German upturn: Five out of six leading
institutes predict growth of 1.5 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Five of Germany's six leading economic institutes yesterday threw their
weight behind the most optimistic forecasts of German economic recovery,
while calling on the Bundesbank to cut interest rates by up to two more
percentage points.
The five - excluding the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research
(DIW) - predicted a 1 per cent recovery of the west German economy this
year, and a 1.5 per cent overall growth rate, including east Germany.
The report by the institutes coincided with a sharper than expected rise in
the country's March money supply figures, with the broad money supply
measure, M3, expanding by more than 15 per cent. Government bond prices
firmed nonetheless, with news of good first-quarter Mercedes-Benz sales and
profits from the Hoechst chemicals group lifting the economic mood.
The institutes warned, however, that unemployment would continue to rise.
They also called for firmer government action to deregulate the German
economy, including measures to tackle the 'monopolies and cartels' among the
energy utilities and the major private banks.
The DIW, the one dissident voice in the institutes' spring survey of the
German economy, suggested that the sharp reduction in real wages would
squeeze consumer spending and outweigh the benefits of increased export
orders, causing a renewed economic downturn in the summer. It forecast zero
growth for west Germany, and 0.5 per cent for the whole economy.
The latest Bundesbank money supply figures for March showed the broad M3
measure had dramatically overshot its target corridor for the fourth month
running.
M3 grew at a seasonally adjusted, annualised rate of 15.2 per cent last
month, down from still higher levels in January and February, but well
outside the central bank's 4 to 6 per cent target range for the year. The
Bundesbank blamed the high figure on a number of factors, the chief among
them being the lack of 'monetary capital formation' in March as interest
rate and bund market uncertainties encouraged investors to keep cash on
short-term deposit rather than making long-term savings which shift assets
out of the money stock.
The figure was at the worse end of market expectations and seems likely to
ensure that the M3 target for 1994 will not be met. Economists said the
figure was unlikely to interfere with the Bundesbank's policy of making
gradual cuts in interest rates.
Perversely, German government bond prices gained half a point in volatile
trading, despite the poor money supply data. Dealers said that a shortage of
paper in the market helped buoy prices.

FT  27 APR 94 / Korean cars to be made in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kia Motors is to become the first South Korean carmaker to assemble
passenger vehicles in Europe. The company, Korea's second largest motor
manufacturer, plans to build up to 30,000 vehicles a year at the Osnabruck
plant of German automotive and engineering group Karmann.
The Korean company announced yesterday it had signed a deal with Karmann to
produce its Sportage four wheel drive sports-utility vehicle at the Karmann
factory in northern Germany.
The agreement is a landmark in the development of the world's auto industry,
and signals the determination of Korean vehicle producers to break into
European and North American markets.
The move comes a decade after the Japanese motor industry took its first
steps into car assembly in Europe. Four Japanese vehicle makers now assemble
cars in Europe, and a fifth has a plant under development.
The Korean motor industry has embarked on rapid overseas expansion. Kia, the
second-largest Korean vehicle maker, recently began selling cars in the US
under its own brand after entering many European markets for the first time
last year.
Daewoo Motor, the third largest Korean producer, plans to enter the European
market in 1995-96 and recently established a technical centre for new
vehicle development and engineering in the UK.
Hyundai, the leading Korean vehicle maker, said last month it planned to
increase its vehicle production capacity by 60 per cent to 2m units by the
year 2000. It plans to build more foreign production sites to reinforce its
presence in overseas markets.
Kia said yesterday that production of the Sportage would begin in Osnabruck
early next year. Initial output is planned at 15,000 a year, but Kia said it
was aiming to double output later to 30,000 a year with both four-door and
two-door versions.
In the first phase the Sportage vehicles will be assembled from CKD
(completely knocked down) kits shipped from Korea, but Kia said that in the
medium term it planned to involve 'as many German and European components
suppliers as possible'.
In the longer term Kia plans to increase the European content of the vehicle
to around 60 per cent.
Karmann is a long-established German automotive engineering group, which
specialises in low-volume production of niche vehicles for other carmakers.
With a total workforce of 7,197 and a turnover last year of DM1.3bn (Pounds
520m), it assembles the Volkswagen Golf convertible and Corrado and the Ford
Escort convertible.

FT  27 APR 94 / Select committee backs levies to enforce training targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radical changes in industrial training policy are to be recommended by a
House of Commons select committee tomorrow.
The trade and industry committee, which will argue in its report that the
decline of UK manufacturing industry can still be arrested, will suggest a
levy on companies which fail to train their workers adequately.
The government has consistently set itself against compulsion in training,
but the imposition of training levies is central to Labour's industrial
policy.
The committee, in a wide ranging report which looks at issues including the
role of the City and trade unions, says: 'Our preference is for a voluntary
system, provided it can actually achieve what the UK needs.' There was some
evidence that the UK's voluntary system was delivering improved performance,
but the committee concludes that the UK's targets for training are not
'world class' and that there is some market failure in the voluntary system.
'There are market failures in this area, and it is too early to judge
whether recent government initiatives will provide what is needed,' says the
committee.
'Targets should be set on a sector by sector basis and, if it proves to be
the case that companies do not meet these targets, the government should
then consider introducing a compulsory element of training and some form of
remissable payroll levy in the relevant sector.'
Greater incentives to companies could be provided by additional tax
allowances for training, possibly linked to the Investors in People
standard, which seeks to assess whether a company's training programmes meet
its business needs.
The government should also provide more generous tax relief for individuals
paying for their training.
The committee says the establishment of national training targets, which
aim, for example, for 80 per cent of young people to have achieved level two
in a National Vocational Qualification by 1997, were an important step, 'but
they are not world class'. It suggests the government should work with other
bodies to upgrade the targets.

FT  27 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Banco Santander
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Santander's bid for Banesto looks all the bolder for being 14 per cent
above the next competing bid. The bank clearly believes it is buying a
recovery stock and one which makes strategic sense. Strip out unrealised
property gains, though, and it is paying nearly two times book value for a
purchase that will be initially dilutive. Banco Santander has a record for
shrewd expansion. Were it not for that, the natural suspicion would be that
ambition has got the better of it.
Since the terms of the deal require Santander to run Banesto as a separate
entity, the acquisition offers limited opportunity for cost-savings. The
official rationale is that Banesto's branch network will bring the group
critical mass in the retail deposit market, though quite how this will add
to earnings is not so clear. Santander also hopes to boost Banesto's
earnings through bad debt recoveries. That may be easier said than done.
After all Banesto has been through, it is hard to believe its problems have
been over-stated.
The real test will be whether Santander can restore Banesto's ability to
generate income from its focus on the domestic market. The comparison with
Banco Popular suggests considerable room for improvement on both revenue and
costs. If Santander can succeed in re-motivating Banesto's line management
and in reviving the confidence of its customer base, its gamble could pay
off. And it is still paying less than half Banesto's price before the
authorities intervened.

FT  27 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tarmac's management has done a fine job in getting from where it was two
years ago to where it is today. But that does not mean it is best placed for
tomorrow. Debt has been cut, peripheral businesses sold and the balance
sheet restored, thanks to a Pounds 215m rights issue. But by starting to
rationalise too late, Tarmac has been left with its capital deployed in the
wrong places at the wrong time.
Tarmac pulled out an impressive amount of working capital last year. But
that partly came from cannibalising its land bank. Capital employed in
housing has been cut from Pounds 581m in 1990 to Pounds 196m last year. The
company vows not to repeat past mistakes by chasing volume at the expense of
margin. But rival housebuilders are already better placed, having sunk
rights issue money into new housing land. The other worry concerns the US,
where Tarmac makes profits of just Dollars 5m on Dollars 724m of assets.
Either there is much scope for improving margins; or those assets are
overvalued.
Despite these drawbacks, Tarmac boasts great long term promise in quarrying
and contracting. Any company making a pre-tax margin of less than 3 per cent
on turnover of Pounds 2.4bn must have much room for profits growth. But
whether Tarmac can catch up with this business cycle is open to doubt.
Consensus expectations for 1996 earnings put its shares on a premium forward
rating. But by then, the cycle should have turned and building materials
stocks should be returning to a discount to the market.

FT  27 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Sears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears is no longer a recovery story but a growth story, according to its
chief executive, Mr Liam Strong. The snag is that, while cutting costs was
fairly easy, increasing sales will not be. Like-for-like sales growth of 3.8
per cent in the year to end-January and 3.6 per cent-plus since then is not
especially exciting. Equally, though headline pre-tax profits of Pounds 138m
look good, the figure is somewhat nearer Pounds 125m once non-recurring
items are stripped out. The share price, which had been ramped ahead of
yesterday's results, took an understandable 7 per cent tumble.
Mr Strong's growth story centres on the group's plan to step up capital
expenditure to an annual average of Pounds 100m over the next three years,
compared with Pounds 78m in the most recent year. The money will be invested
in two main ways: revitalising flagging old stores such as Adams and
building new out-of-town stores such as Sportsworld. Each scheme looks
plausible enough on its own but, given Sears' poor investment record, it is
questionable whether a steep increase in capital expenditure is in
shareholders' interests.
Even if it is, there is little shareholder benefit in Sears' accumulating a
cash pile. Despite the higher investment rate, net cash is expected to rise
in coming years from the year-end figure of Pounds 157m. Mr Strong rightly
argues it would be foolish to raise dividends to unsustainable levels. But
that should not stop Sears returning cash to shareholders through a special
dividend or share buy-back.

FT  27 APR 94 / The Lex Column: BAT's tobacco habit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight it might seem surprising that BAT Industries is investing
Dollars 1bn in US tobacco rather than putting its money, literally, in a
building society. Yet the acquisition of American Tobacco does not preclude
a move in financial services. Gearing of around 50 per cent by the year-end
looks perfectly comfortable, given BAT's ability to generate cash. Having
made the decision to stay in US tobacco, BAT badly needed to strengthen its
hand.
Even after the acquisition, BAT will be fighting from third place behind
Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco. But raising its market share to around 18 per
cent should bring greater clout. If promised efficiencies in manufacturing
and sales are delivered, BAT will also have scope to widen its margins. That
would leave it better placed to weather a price war if the market leaders
decide to absorb some of the US government's proposed tobacco tax. Despite
such commercial logic, though, one might still question the decision to make
a strategic investment in a declining market. Faced with similar arguments,
American Brands decided to get out.
There are certainly risks. The steady decline in US cigarette sales could
easily accelerate, while the one-off impact of the tobacco tax can only be
guessed at. BAT's gamble is that an exit multiple of around nine times last
year's earnings is cheap enough to compensate. Since the big US tobacco
companies are bundled within larger groups, that valuation is difficult to
test. But if the additional investment delivers a return in all but the most
trying market conditions, the group as a whole must be less risky as a
result.

FT  27 APR 94 / Leading Article: Eurosuperman step forward
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The next president of the European Commission, to be chosen in an obscure
political bargaining process in the next two months, will take over as the
European Union's chief executive at a crucial juncture in its history. At a
time when the US is hesitating over its future commitment to Europe, and the
regions east and south of the EU's borders are threatened by instability, it
is more vital than ever that the Union be vigorous and outward-looking. A
correspondingly open debate is required about the selection process. It is
time to set out the essential criteria that should govern the choice of the
person who, during the next five years, will represent Europe within the
continent and on a wider stage.
The president will take the helm when the EU's objectives are becoming more
disparate, more important, and more controversial. Disparate, because the EU
is shifting away from an exclusive focus on deepening co-operation among the
12 as it tries to extend integration northwards and eastwards. Important,
because EU membership is the main hope of future prosperity and stability
for central and eastern European countries formerly separated by cold war
division. Controversial, because many EU's objectives, or at least those
spotted among the confusing verbiage of the Maastricht treaty, have aroused
widespread public scepticism. Expectations of a sizeable anti-Maastricht
vote in the European parliament elections in June reflect not only the
effects of recession, but also the perception that those who govern Europe
are out of step with the governed.
Exceptional talents
The successful candidate will need to build on the strengths demonstrated by
Mr Jacques Delors, the incumbent since 1985. Mr Delors has for the most part
mounted an effective synthesis of policies that were practicable and
desirable, above all in launching and carrying through the single market
process, as well as presiding over reforms of the Community budget.
In three vital areas, the new president will need exceptional talents.
First, he (this time round, it seems unlikely to be a she) will need to be a
supreme administrator, capable of managing more efficiently a Commission
bureaucracy employing 10,000 people and with an annual budget of Ecu70bn.
Streamlining the Commission will be a priority after next year's planned
enlargement.
Second, in the economic field, the successful candidate must reinforce the
EU's support for an open world trade system and policies that avoid
subjecting wealth-creating business to unnecessary regulation. The emphasis
on labour market flexibility in Mr Delors' white paper last year was a step
in the right direction. More strong guidance from the top will be needed if
Europe is to catch up its competitive lag with the US and south-east Asia.
Political adroitness
Third, the next leader in Brussels will require political adroitness and
vision to foster accord on future priorities among the main member states. A
constructive partnership among Germany, France and Britain, in areas ranging
from defence and security to monetary policies, has been impeded by the
strains of post-cold war upheaval. The oppportunity for reaching consensus
will, however, improve as the European recession ends. Drawing up an
effective post-Maastricht agenda will be easier if the governments emerging
from elections in Germany and France during the next 12 months take a fairly
relaxed approach over the timetable for monetary union.
Of the three main candidates for the Brussels job currently in the running -
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene from Belgium, Mr Ruud Lubbers from the Netherlands, and
the UK's Sir Leon Brittan - none matches perfectly the exacting criteria set
out above. All display tough-mindedness, but none can claim to combine broad
appeal with visionary thinking. Unburdened by government office, Sir Leon
has at least done Europe a favour by running an open campaign for office.
The job of running the Commission is much too important to be determined by
a selection procedure with the transparency of a papal election. When the EU
decides its next but one Commission president, in 1999, the post should be
chosen through an open election process.

FT  27 APR 94 / Ray of sunshine after winter gloom: Experts detect the green
shoots of German economic recovery starting to sprout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his irrepressibly optimistic economics minister,
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, insist that Germany's economic springtime has come, after
a particularly vicious period of winter frost.
After the sharpest downturn in gross domestic product since the war - a drop
of 1.9 per cent last year - the economy is picking up again, they say.
They would of course, wouldn't they? They have to face a testing series of
elections this year, culminating in a general election in October, and they
need all the good news they can get.
Unfortunately, the one economic fact of life which no one expects to improve
in the short term is unemployment, with the grim figure of almost 4m
unemployed expected to linger all year.
But yesterday the politicians won the weighty support of five of the
country's independent economic research institutes, for their assertion that
there will be a slow but steady recovery of 1.5 per cent in all-German gross
domestic product this year - about 1 per cent in the west, and a good 7.5
per cent in the devastated east.
Only the staunch neo-Keynesians at Berlin's German Institute for Economic
Research (DIW) remain pessimistic in the annual spring review of the
institutes.
The DIW is convinced that the effect of the recession on domestic
consumption - a drop in total real income of no less than 3 per cent - will
outweigh any expected recovery in export demand. It argues that far from
picking up steadily from this spring, the economy looks set for a summer
'double-dip' recession, with no recovery before the second half of the year.
Overall, that means zero growth in west Germany, and 0.5 per cent for the
economy as a whole.
So who has got it right? A clear majority of government and industry, backed
by the analysts of the financial markets, is convinced that the worst is
past, except on the unemployment front. On the other side, the trade unions,
the opposition Social Democrats, and the DIW, fear that the desire to see
green shoots of recovery has overwhelmed perceptions of the reality, that
domestic demand remains stubbornly stagnating, and the economy urgently
needs an extra stimulus, such as investment subsidies, to pull it out of the
trough.
The other big question mark lies over the revival of the east German
economy, now showing signs of recovery from its collapse of 1990 and 1991,
when industrial production slumped by two-thirds. The upturn clearly depends
above all on the maintenance of huge public and private transfers from west
Germany to the east, running at about DM200bn (Pounds 80bn) a year.
There is still no sign of consumer spending supporting a self-sustaining
recovery, which depends on maintaining the level of investment. The question
is whether the initial surge in private sector investment, maintained last
year in spite of the western recession, can be kept going at the same rate.
None of the participants are showing signs of over-optimism - in the east or
the west. The Federation of German Industry (BDI) and the German Banking
Federation warned yesterday against excessive hopes about the prospects for
the coming year. The small business federation (ZDH) said it still had no
firm evidence from its members that the recession was over. And the German
wholesale and export traders (BGA) warned against exaggerated expectations
from foreign trade. A growth rate of 1.5 per cent was at the 'upper limit'
of likely recovery, the BGA said.
Even the five optimistic institutes see only a feeble ray of sunshine in
their forecast. 'The improvement in the economic situation clearly does not
mean that the scene is set for a strong recovery of the west German economy,
and for a high level of employment,' they said.
Their arguments in favour of recovery are based on three main planks: export
performance; significant improvements in business sector profitability
thanks to drastic rationalisation measures, with modest pay rises and
flexibility in wage contracts and working hours; and continuing relaxation
of monetary policy by the German Bundesbank.
As far as exports are concerned, the main hopes lie in the strengthening
economic growth both in the US and the south-east Asian markets. Recovery in
western Europe, by far the most important market for German products, is
clearly lagging behind - interdependent as it is on Germany's own
performance.
Optimistic forecasts depend on no further strengthening of the D-Mark
against other European currencies and, if possible, a slight weakening
against the dollar. The strengthening of the dollar and the yen against the
D-Mark over the past year has helped to improve German export
competitiveness.
That competitiveness also depends on the success of the rationalisation
programmes introduced across most of German industry in cutting the very
high costs of domestic production.
Business confidence has grown, as have profit expectations. After a year of
drastic losses reported from many of the blue-chip names of German industry,
most are forecasting a return to the black in 1994. IBM Deutschland
yesterday reported a loss of DM582m for 1993, but predicted profits again
this year, and even such a long-term sufferer as Krupp-Hoesch, the steel
group, believes it has done enough to break even next time round.
The chemical industry - traditionally first into a recession, and first out
of it - seems to be indicating the turn. Hoechst yesterday reported a 10 per
cent increase in turnover in the first quarter, and a 16 per cent profits
rise to DM506m.
As for the last of the three recovery planks, the continuing relaxation of
monetary policy by the Bundesbank may be the one most in question. The
institutes yesterday agreed that the central bank could afford to - and
should - cut another two percentage points from its short-term rates. This
in turn would ensure that the continuing attractions of short-term financial
deposits would be outweighed by the recovering profitability of long-term
industrial investment, and fuel the recovery, they said.
Financial analysts in Frankfurt are more doubtful. They believe that the
downward trend of interest rates is likely to end by the summer, with the
signs of economic recovery multiplying - and the Bundesbank still far
outside its own monetary corridor for the M3 broad measure of money supply.
On just such an assumption, the bond market remains extremely weak.
The stock market, on the other hand, is less influenced by interest rate
expectations these days, and more by the expectation of better profits from
industry. For the time being, there is a lot of liquidity because of the
retreat from the bond market, and the most likely destination seems into
shares.
What market observers do not seem to share is the outright pessimism of the
DIW. They point out that even if real wages are cut this year, they only
constitute about 50 per cent of disposable incomes. The latter include
revenues from property, dividends, and transfers from government, all of
which are more buoyant. Moreover, German consumers have shown a clear
tendency in the past year to reduce their savings to maintain their living
standards.
The cuts in working hours could also have another perverse effect: a boost
to the black economy, where increasing numbers of Germans work for cash to
boost their shrinking official incomes.
'These don't appear in the statistics, but they show up in consumption,'
said Mr Joachim Fels, international economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt.
'That is another reason why we are not so pessimistic.'
Whether all that cautious optimism is enough to save Chancellor Kohl's
political future in the coming series of local, state and federal elections
is another matter. But it shows why he has perked up appreciably on the
campaign trail, and started to talk of springtime.

While the City of London tries to get serious on the subject of sexual
harassment in the dealing room, turn to this month's issue of German
business magazine ]Forbes for a distinctly more irreverent spin on the
gender war.
'Ja bitte]' shouts the cover, claiming that romance in the workplace pushes
up creativity, performance and turnover.
Steamy details proved tough to elicit, though. Companies such as Audi stayed
primly taciturn, while Hewlett Packard was equally short on specifics.
'We mainly hire graduates at the marriageable age of mid to late 20s. You
can imagine the rest,' it panted.
The journal, which is in the Burda stable, did manage a dig at a rival.
Prominent on the list of bosses who had tied the knot with their secretaries
was Bertelsmann chief Reinhard Mohn.
Liz Beckmann was, moreover, 'piquantly the wife of one of his employees',
the magazine sniped.

Ever since the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901, American
financial markets have always paid tribute to the death of heads of state by
shutting up shop.
But in closing down for an entire session to mark the passing of Richard
Nixon, the New York Stock Exchange has ruffled a few feathers - and not
solely because people feel that Nixon, the only US president to resign in
disgrace, might merit something less than the full treatment.
At least two other exchanges, Nasdaq and the Pacific Stock Exchange,
unabashedly say they would have preferred to remain open but were forced to
follow the Big Board's lead for technical reasons only.
Wall Streeters were also quick to point out the damage that unscheduled
closings could inflict on the New York market's efforts to fend off its
competitors from overseas.
In deciding to close for the full session, the exchange is indeed affording
Nixon an honour denied another president 30 years ago.
In 1964, trading was suspended for only half the day after Herbert Hoover
died.
But then Hoover just happened to be in the White House in 1929, the year of
the mother of all stock market crashes.

Has John Major missed another trick? Lunch at Chequers with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl surely presented an ideal opportunity to persuade the German
leader that scares over BSE are no kind of excuse for a boycott of fine
Angus steaks.
But the PM has chickened out, it seems. Kohl will be eating pork.

FT  27 APR 94 / Observer: Whither WTO?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile, with Sutherland counting himself out of the top slot at the new
World Trade Organisation, how about a consolation prize for Sir Leon
Brittan, whose chances of securing the EU presidency look slimmer by the
day?
Only joking. Brittan's office was yesterday roundly quashing any such
flights of fancy and, with his lofty ambitions, Europe's trade commissioner
might be right to turn up his nose at Geneva. But son of Gatt obviously
needs to lure some other heavyweight.
Sutherland's happy blend of pugnacity, charm and political skill makes him a
hard act to follow; his performance certainly has made it highly unlikely
that the WTO would go for a trade bureaucrat, however skilful, of the kind
that used to run the Gatt.
As the world's trade policeman, the new organisation will need someone who
is not afraid to dress down governments that break fair trade rules. The
forum for continuing trade talks will also have to have as its boss a
skilled negotiator to deal with an expected membership of more than 100
nations, three-quarters from the developing world.
And hence to the small matter of nationality. While the Europeans squabble
over the division of a number of international jobs up for grabs at the
moment, they could find the WTO eluding their grasp. The Gatt may
traditionally have gone for a European, but this time developing countries
will be pushing a candidate of their own - as may Japan.

FT  27 APR 94 / Observer: One Delors closes . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jean-Luc Dehaene is not the most obvious candidate to succeed Jacques Delors
as president of the European Commission. Resembling a slimmed-down version
of Helmut Kohl, the bespectacled Belgian premier has little international
diplomatic experience - and a great face for radio.
Still, the German chancellor has taken a shine to Dehaene, and so people -
not least the British Foreign Office - are suddenly taking him seriously for
the top executive job in Brussels. UK interest in his chances is all the
keener because of Dehaene's enthusiasm for federalism, a bogey word in
Britain.
Dehaene wants faster political and economic European integration balanced by
greater devolution of power to the regions. It's the same model Belgium has
adopted in response to pressure for greater autonomy in Flanders and
Wallonia.
The man himself won't say if his hat is in the ring; nor will anyone in the
Belgian government. But contingency plans for his departure are forming.
Of course, he may still be blocked by the British and Dutch, who lean more
towards Ruud Lubbers. And, in spite of his protestations that he just wants
to go home to Dublin, Peter Sutherland, out-going head of the Gatt and a
former EU commissioner, will have to get used to hearing his name floated
repeatedly as the compromise candidate.

FT  27 APR 94 / Leading Article: Rethinking UK defence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's white paper on defence is pure politics. It is a holding
operation, designed to get the government through the forthcoming round of
local elections, by-elections, and contests for seats in the European
parliament. The camouflage is transparent.
The paper intimates, as might be expected, that defence is important. At the
same time it affirms that cost savings are being sought in response to the
budget cuts announced in November. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, has put on record his understanding that, if economies greater
than those asked for are found, the cash released may be diverted to the
front line forces. Savings in excess of the Pounds 2.3bn agreed with the
Treasury may therefore be anticipated.
Much of what may be expected is already evident. Civilians, who are cheaper
to employ, may be used for back-room tasks. Stock holding, and the storage
of spares, may be almost entirely privatised. Overall levels of support
staff may be cut. There may be fewer senior officers, following a management
downsizing equivalent to that undertaken in non-military enterprises.
Expensive institutions, such as Royal Navy and RAF staff colleges, may be
closed. The courses could be transferred to an army facility. The Royal Navy
has recommended that the base at Rosyth in Fife be shut.
Most of the items in the above list are of the sort that governments prefer
to avoid when they are about to face the electorate. Job losses and
redundancies are never popular. Defenders of Rosyth are already much
agitated. The Labour leader, Mr John Smith, has begun to taunt the
government for its 'piecemeal cuts'. He is hitting home. There is little
stomach in the Conservative party for further reductions in defence
spending. In consequence, nothing specific will be announced until July,
when the voting is over.
Overriding fault
The white paper's overriding fault, however, is that it is more likely to
set off a debate about candle-ends than a fundamental reappraisal of
Britain's defence policy. Accountancy has its place. Yet it is deep thinking
that is required. Mr Smith has called for a full defence review. Serb
expansionism has engendered a less dovish mood than is traditional on the
Labour benches. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the leader of the Liberal Democrats,
confessed on Monday that he had been wrong to advocate sweeping defence cuts
after the Berlin wall came down. 'It is now clear that we shall see not
peace in Europe, but vicious conflicts of a type which we thought we had
banished half a century ago,' he said.
Confusion reigns
Whether or not Mr Ashdown is right, Europe should certainly prepare itself
against the day when it must maintain its own stability. In its present mood
the US can no longer be regarded as the Atlantic community's policeman.
President Bush saw the conflict in former Yugoslavia as primarily Europe's
business, which it is. President Clinton, a reluctant ally, has resolutely
refused to commit US ground forces while the fighting continues. The US
remains attached to Nato, but the depth of its commitment may not remain
constant.
On the eastern side of the Atlantic, confusion reigns. Britain plans to
reduce defence spending to around 3 per cent of gross national product in
the late 1990s, as against 5.3 per cent a decade ago. Most European
countries, France excepted, plan to spend below Britain's projected level.
In the absence of a clear pan-European foreign policy framework no one can
tell whether these amounts are sufficient. The necessary framework cannot be
constructed while Germany remains uncertain about its future defence role,
or while France deludes itself that it can behave as a great power, or while
Britain distances itself from the continent.
In short, there is no cohesion of European thought or action, and little
underlying agreement on the future presence in Europe of US forces. A proper
white paper would set out the foreign policy options and the defence
decisions that flow from them. The starting point would be to focus British
eyes on both Nato and the European Union. That is more important than the
defence of Tory seats in a borough council or two.

FT  27 APR 94 / Corporate convalescence: Industry is beginning to benefit
from a period of radical restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edzard Reuter, 66, has seen winter turning to spring often enough not to
place too much faith in the appearance of the odd swallow. 'We are not
succumbing to any illusions despite the large number of positive
indicators,' the chairman of Daimler-Benz, said recently.
Germany's biggest industrial group was on the road to recovery after a
'truly devastating' 1993 when a record DM1.8bn loss obliged the group to cut
its dividend for the first time since the second world war, he said. 'But
our confidence is not based on a somewhat naive hope for an upturn in
economic activity,' he added.
By his reckoning, German exports would increase slightly this year, but the
rate of expansion would lag behind the overall growth in world trade.
Germany, he believed, could continue to lose share in its traditional
markets.
Mr Reuter's view that Daimler's brightening expectations are due entirely to
attempts to raise productivity and competitiveness through its own
restructuring efforts, is widely echoed elsewhere in German industry.
The difference in emphasis between business opinion and the more cheerful
forecasts from Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, may be explained in
several ways.
Industrialists feel proclaiming an end to the bad times now - while costs
and jobs are still being savagely axed - could risk resurgent demands from
unions which have so far accepted real wage cuts and the loss of most of the
jobs created in the late 1980s.
More important, while Mr Rexrodt and his coalition colleagues are facing a
hectic election timetable in the next few months, German industry's
restructuring agenda stretches ahead, beyond this October's federal poll.
In the short term, company results will benefit because most of the
financial provisions for restructuring this year and next have already been
set aside. But as Deutsche Bank board director Mr Ulrich Cartellieri has
said, nobody should be tempted to draw any false conclusions. Domestic
demand was dead, and even if exports rose 5 per cent this year, the increase
would not compensate for last year's 10 per cent decline, he noted.
Recent data present a muddy picture which by most expert reckonings shows
the German economy bumping sideways along the bottom of recession. The VDA
automotive industry association, gloomier than most, recently said car
output in the first quarter of this year fell 4 per cent below last year's
already miserable levels. The motor industry, Germany's top export earner,
is still stuck in the trough of the recession, it added.
However, there has been more encouraging news from the chemicals and
engineering branches, the country's two other main industrial motors, which
help confirm the impression of an exports-driven crabwise shift in the
economy.
Mr Manfred Schneider, president of the VCI chemicals industry association,
notes a return to stability on the strength of a rise in first-quarter sales
from DM41.9bn to DM42.7bn. Hoechst yesterday confirmed the trend,
attributing a 16 per cent increase in first-quarter pre-tax profits to
improved business abroad.
The Siemens electrical and engineering group this week reported flat
turnover and profits for the first half of the current year (after
adjustment for acquisitions), mainly because a 13 per cent rise in foreign
sales compensated for a further 9 per cent decline at home.
Brightest of all, Mercedes-Benz yesterday claimed to be beating the general
decline in the car market with a 28 per cent rise in first-quarter turnover
and increases of between 30 per cent and 46 per cent in registrations in all
its main markets.
The patchy pick-up in other European economies, which currently absorb 60
per cent of Germany's industrial exports, and the recovery in the US, which
takes a further 10 per cent, appear to have enough pulling power to lift
German industry out of its worst slump since 1945.
But the experience of the recession has taught lessons about over-reliance
on exports to over-supplied local markets which have far wider implications
for the longer term, particularly more globalised manufacturing. Last year's
restructuring of domestic pay agreements and deep cuts into over-blown
workforces was only one response to Germany's structural difficulties.
A second, potentially far-reaching response is the globalisation of
Germany's traditionally home-based manufacturing capacity. Last week alone,
BMW, currently building its first full-scale foreign car plant in the US,
said it was planning a new factory in Mexico. On the same day Mercedes-Benz
signed a joint venture to build E-Class limousines and engines in India.
Attention is also focused on new possibilities in south-east Asia. Siemens
chairman Mr Heinrich von Pierer this week pointed out that last year Germany
invested a mere DM3.3bn in the region compared with Japan's DM70bn.
As Mr von Pierer noted, if German industry fails to exploit the
opportunities in south-east Asia, the world's fastest-growing region,
Germany could pay a high economic price.

FT  27 APR 94 / They plough a lonely furrow: Why women farm-owners in
Britain are such a rare breed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Catherine Mack has come a long way since she and her husband bought five
Shetland sheep to act as a lawnmower on their single acre of precipitous
hillside.
Today she runs Britain's only organic farm approved by the Rare Breeds
Survival Trust - on 336 acres in the West Country, with a turnover of about
Pounds 250,000 a year. It boasts 14 breeds of sheep, six types of cattle,
four varieties of pigs, organic wheat, a shop, guided tours, goats and
ponies.
But her 14-year uphill struggle to success owed nothing to the
male-dominated farming establishment. She found the National Farmers' Union,
instead of welcoming her into the fold, was chauvinistic and clannish. 'I
went to a meeting one night about muck-spreading - a major problem because
of the pollution it can cause,' she said. 'I arrived and was told the
cookery demonstration for wives was upstairs.'
Women who own or manage farms in their own right are a rare breed. The Wye
agricultural college in Kent, part of London University, estimates only 1 to
3 per cent of UK farms are headed by women. This means women are largely
excluded from important decisions on agricultural policy. For example, the
83-member NFU council, whose views are influential in Whitehall, has only
two women.
Yet most farms would not function without an unpaid woman - the 'farmer's
wife' - on duty from dawn until after dark to do the paperwork, answer the
phone, deal with callers, cook meals and help with manual work. 'We have men
who still look at women as the second sex,' said Mrs Julia Duffield,
chairman of the Women's Farming Union. 'Yet women in agriculture do
everything their husbands do and more.' The organisation, set up to promote
British farm produce, has encouraged solidarity among farmers' wives - but
is dismissed by some wives for not being involved in heavyweight political
activity.
'Excluding women from managerial positions means denying the production end
of the agricultural industry 50 per cent of the potential talent when new
blood, new ideas, new approaches are needed,' said Dr Ruth Gasson,
agricultural economist at Wye college.
This undervaluing of women has not so far been a serious issue in the
industry. But Mrs Gillian Shephard, appointed agriculture minister last
summer - one of only two women in the cabinet - may change that.
Her appointment has provided a rallying point for women in farming. 'When I
go to NFU meetings, women come because I am a woman minister and a lot of
them say, 'I feel I'm involved - you understand that',' Mrs Shephard said.
Some are simply relieved the industry is at last represented by a woman; but
others want action. Mrs Shephard is planning to respond to that pressure
this summer by announcing a package of educational and other measures to
promote women in farming.
The biggest problem is inheritance. This is still the typical route into
farming and most farmers name their sons as successors, reflecting the
farming community's conservatism. Only one in five farmers, whose forebears
were also farmers, name a daughter as successor, according to a survey by Dr
Gasson. Yet the figure is almost one in three for farmers who have come from
another industry.
Mrs Sarah Ward, who owns a 800-acre mixed farm in Kent, said she had to be
'extremely strong-minded' to avoid being sidelined 15 years ago when her
younger brother showed no interest in inheriting the farm and her father
wanted to sell up. 'I felt, being business-minded, that it was a very big
asset that shouldn't have gone out of the family,' she said.
A former Woman Farmer of the Year and a member of the Countryside Commission
advising the government on rural issues, she believes 'women will only have
a more important role to play if they can get their hands on the money and
the property'.
For women who do not inherit farms, money or financial acumen - or a partner
with either - may be the only way to overcome obstacles to ownership. Mrs
Mack, a former state school teacher, is married to the financial director of
United Friendly, the life assurance company. 'George had the right contacts
and the earning power,' she said. 'I couldn't have done it.'
For farmers' wives - as opposed to women in control of farms - one way of
sharing the financial reins is via diversification. The incentives to follow
such a route are growing as incomes are squeezed in traditional sectors such
as dairying, hit by the introduction of Common Agricultural Policy quotas.
Diversifying into horse riding or bed-and-breakfast helps raise cash and
awareness of the woman's contribution.
New skills, such as the use of computer records or sophisticated financial
management, will also be needed as the industry is exposed to market forces
under CAP reforms and the Uruguay Round deal.
Mrs Marie Skinner, one of the two women on the NFU council, farms 500 acres
of cereals in Norfolk in partnership with her husband. She is responsible
for buying and selling the grain and uses options to hedge against
unexpected price changes. 'The way farming has changed has made it possible
for me to become involved because there's a lot more work that needs to be
done on the business side,' said Mrs Skinner, a former teacher who started
farming when her father-in-law died.
Her high profile in the NFU arose from a letter she wrote to a farming
magazine 10 years ago attacking the union for complacency. It caused such a
stir that she was offered a regular column on agricultural issues in
Farmers' Weekly, the trade magazine.
Although Mrs Skinner writes about general policy issues, rather than women
per se, she believes there are female strengths in farming: 'Where women are
better is in anything to do with diversification, anything that means
standing back and looking at the business in a new, more open way.'
That may explain why women are better represented in less conventional
areas, such as organic farming. 'It makes a lot more sense to women,' said
Ms Helen Browning, chairman of British Organic Farmers, which has six women
on its 12-strong committee. She inherited the tenancy of a 1,350-acre Church
of England farm near Swindon from her father and is converting it to organic
production.
Though a business with a Pounds 1m a year turnover clearly requires
financial ability, she argued women had different priorities to males.
'Conventional agriculture can be very macho,' she said, adding that
competitiveness led farmers to focus on producing more. 'But there's another
side of humanity which says: hang on a minute, are we just chasing our
tails? Isn't money better spent doing something more long-term and
enjoyable?'
Ms Browning believed women are barred from management positions by a lack of
all-round training opportunities. 'Women tend to be isolated in things like
calf-rearing which men see very patronisingly as a maternal thing. It's rare
to find a skilled female tractor driver or mechanic. But to get a farm
manager's job you need to be able to convince your boss you can handle that
side of things.'
At Harper Adams, one of the country's largest agricultural colleges, the
proportion of women graduating has nearly trebled to 30 per cent in the last
decade. But most train for jobs in marketing, food retailing, research and
advisory services rather than farm management - 'an area that's still
extremely difficult for women,' said Mr Tony Harris, principal.
Mrs Shephard sees training as the key to change: 'The more women train, the
more likely it is that when farms pass from hand to hand, women will have a
claim.'
So will Mrs Mack's eldest daughter Eleanor, aged 19, be taking over Norwood
Farm when her mother retires? That's far from certain. 'I want to be an
engineer,' she said.

FT  27 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: CEGB: unlikely origins of readiness
for a crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ERIC BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The inside story of the CEGB's role during the miners' strike of
1984-85 ('We kept the home fires burning', April 23/24) is a hair-raising
thriller.
As a former board member for engineering of the CEGB, I am able to add an
ironical footnote about the oil-burning stations which played a vital part
in maintaining the nation's electricity supply. The new plant programmes
which gave us Fawley, Grain, Ince B, Kingsworth, Littlebrook C and Pembroke
were embarked upon during the 1960s as a direct result of the CEGB's fear of
a coal crisis.
This was not an example of outstanding prescience on our part; we had heard
neither of Arthur Scargill nor Margaret Thatcher, and Walter Marshall was
the name of a bright young physicist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority.
Our fear was not directly of the National Union of Mineworkers but of the
National Coal Board, which seemed unable to manage its labour relations and
had shown itself willing to take more than reasonable advantage of its
captive customer, the CEGB. We feared worse to come and decided to increase
our heavy fuel oil buying capability.
The crisis which broke roughly 23 years later was not the one we had
envisaged. The CEGB's response had two main features: equipment which proved
more than equal to the task (oil burning, nuclear and other generating
stations); and a group of men who recognised their statutory duty to provide
the nation with a power supply and had the determination and ingenuity to
carry it out.

FT  27 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Remember, the taxpayer picks up the
tab
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C F FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, American taxpayers are currently paying some billions of dollars to
cover the losses incurred when their savings and loan institutions (building
societies) were deregulated. British taxpayers, therefore, would be wise to
be vigilant about the goings on between Lloyds Bank and the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society because they will have to pay depositors if
anything goes wrong.
To protect taxpayers governments have always insisted on prudential
financial practices at building societies. It is this conservative financing
that appears to have created the Pounds 2bn plus which Lloyds Bank is
proposing to divide between itself and the voters of the C &amp; G.
In the late 1980s and the early 1990s British clearing banks, by improvident
lending, lost many billions of pounds and there was a serious danger of
financial collapse. In a quiet conspiracy the Bank of England, the
government and the other regulators agreed that the banks should repair
their balance sheets by exerting their monopoly powers over small and
medium-sized business by sharply raising their charges. This process was
described by John Plender as 'leveraging' (The Long View, February 19). The
banks have now mostly recovered their capital but Lloyds Bank, which made
smaller losses than the others, has built up a cash pile of Pounds 1.8bn
which it is seeking to spend on the C &amp; G.
When all the banks have bought themselves a building society and the
societies have made some improvident loans, who will pick up the tab - the
bank shareholders, the depositors or the taxpayer?

FT  27 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK's strong bonds with Germany must
be re-emphasised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GILES RADICE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Showing he does not have his predecessor's hang-ups about the Germans,
John Major went out of his way in a speech in Bonn three years ago to
congratulate Chancellor Kohl on the 'enormous skill and quiet authority'
with which he steered German unity. I noted Mr Major's key message that the
Conservatives and Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats 'can achieve great things
together in Europe and for Europe'.
When Mr Kohl comes to London on Wednesday, I am afraid that the German
chancellor will not think the prime minister has delivered on that promise.
From a German perspective the British, under Mr Major's leadership, have
been almost as awkward and as unreliable as they were under Mrs Thatcher. It
is true that, in the negotiations leading to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade agreement, the British and German positions were almost
identical. Also, the British supported the Germans on siting the European
Monetary Institute in Frankfurt.
However, by consistently putting short-term party concerns before the
national interest, Mr Major has failed to create partnership with Germany.
At Maastricht, he used up much of his credit with Mr Kohl by insisting on
the double 'opt out' over monetary union and social policy. The recent
fiasco over qualified majority voting was mainly caused by Mr Major's
insistence on fighting a European battle to keep favour with Tory
Eurosceptics.
If Mr Major is wise, he will return to the strategy of emphasising Britain's
strong bonds with Germany in the economic, strategic and political fields.
Britain and Germany should jointly endorse the goal of allowing Poland,
Hungary, the Czech republic and Slovakia to join the European Union as soon
as possible.
The emphasis of next year's VE Day celebrations should be on the success of
our post-war reconciliation with Germany. To back this up, Britain needs to
expand massively its youth and school exchanges with Germany, along the
lines set out in your editorial, 'Anglo-German understanding' (April 11). It
would be disastrous if, by default, we allowed a revival of the Anglo-German
antagonism that was so harmful to Europe in the early part of the 20th
century.

FT  27 APR 94 / 1867 and all that: British foreign policy has developed
little over the past century

John Major on Monday enjoyed a modest reprieve from unfavourable publicity
when he hosted the launch of a four-power peace initiative for Bosnia.
Whether this new international 'contact group' will bring peace is an open
question. The good news is that the US, Russia, France and the UK will try
to work together; the bad news is that their efforts will still depend on
the goodwill and good sense of the Serbs, the Croats and the Bosnians. Since
those two commodities have long been in short supply, it is probably not
urgent for John Major to start ordering the champagne.
What is doubly urgent, though, is for him to develop a plausible British
strategy on Europe; and the first critical test of whether his government is
even looking for such a strategy will be his meeting today with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of Germany.
It is a critical summit because Germany will be setting the agenda for
Europe in the second half of this year, when it takes over the presidency of
the European Union; and this agenda, which it has said will include a
high-pressure timetable for opening Europe to the east, will also hurry
Europe towards uncomfortable choices over the dilemmas before the Union -
over where it is going, what policies it should have, and what kinds of
institutions it needs.
Some people seem to think this will be a wonderful opportunity for turning
the Union into a vast inter-governmental free trade area, without policies,
with a much smaller budget and much weaker institutions. That is obviously
one kind of European model; and perhaps it is the kind of Europe which
would, ideally, most appeal to the UK government. It is the kind of Europe
the UK tried to get in the 1950s; it failed.
But in today's world there are two relevant questions. First, has this kind
of Europe the smallest chance of acceptance by most member states? Second,
and more important, is the British government prepared for an open struggle
to bring it about?
The historical answer to the first question is clear: the founding members
and most subsequent members have consistently preferred a more politically
integrated Europe. They may change their minds. But we see how many European
electorates are disillusioned with their national political systems and the
EU because of unemployment and other deprivations perceived as having been
brought about by widespread economic 'restructuring'. Is it plausible to
suppose that most member states will be eager to throw away those parts of
the EU system, such as the Social Fund and social legislation, which are
designed to mitigate some of the inequalities of the free market? Moreover,
is it plausible to suppose that they will endorse a Europe advocated by
Britain?
The second question is more relevant because, if the British government
really wants to fight for a different kind of Europe, it should get ready
for the fray right away, with a coherent concept and a feasible strategy.
Any struggle over the future of Europe will certainly come no later than the
Inter-Governmental Conference of 1996 for revising the Maastricht treaty;
and it may come much sooner through German pressure to open to the east.
As of now, the UK does not appear ready for any uncomfortable choices. It
has just retreated ignominiously from a fatuous crusade over majority
voting, which was not just unwinnable but damaging to Britain's position in
Europe. But it appears to have drawn no strategic lessons from this
narrowly-avoided crisis. In the absence of a European manifesto, something
it dare not publish, the Conservative party appears hopelessly divided on
Europe, and its strategy is limited to empty rhetoric in the hope that
future choices can be finessed.
The oddity is that Britain has long enjoyed a luminous reputation for the
profundity and Machiavellian skill of its foreign policy; and people say
that Mr Douglas Hurd is the greatest foreign secretary in living memory. Is
this just an illusion?
Walter Bagehot, the great 19th century editor of The Economist chiefly
remembered for his analysis of the English constitution, also had trenchant
things to say about British foreign policy. Here* he examines the reasons
why it is 'not so good as it should be': 'There are two great causes at
work,' he says. 'The first of these causes is our ignorance . . . On many
parts of our administration the effect of our extreme ignorance is at once
plain. The foreign policy of England has for many years been, according to
the judgment now in vogue, inconsequent, fruitless, casual; aiming at no
distinct pre-imagined end, based on no steadily preconceived principle . . .
I entirely concede that our recent foreign policy has been open to very
grave and serious blame.
'But would it not have been a miracle if the English people, directing their
own policy, and being what they are, had directed a good policy? Are they
not above all nations divided from the rest of the world, insular both in
situation and in mind, both for good and for evil? Are they not out of the
current of common European causes and affairs? Are they not a race
contemptuous of others? Are they not a race with no special education or
culture as to the modern world, and too often despising such culture?
'Who could expect such a people to comprehend the new and strange events of
foreign places?'
It appears that little has really changed since 1867.

   From JEAN CASTELLINI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I very much enjoyed your 'Business Travel' (April 20), especially the
section on various 'airports of the world'. However, I have to say that Ms
Rawsthorn's report on Charles de Gaulle airport was typical of a certain
Anglo Saxon arrogant wit (whereas your other airport descriptions struck me
as being quite neutral), as well as a collection of all possible cliches you
may gather on France - the foie gras, the expensive clothes, the
Concorde-travelling top models, le 'glamour', quoi]
I must have flown into, and out of, Roissy a good 100 times over the past 10
years, and have never had to complain about my luggage being 'pillaged', not
even opened. As far as our 'sticky-fingered luggage handlers' are concerned,
they, too, probably would be happy to wear Chanel gloves to handle Ms
Rawsthorn's personal belongings.
Much to many people's surprise, France has less 'numerous national holidays'
than many other European countries (I have to admit, however, that the point
on public sector strikes was more relevant). And I honestly have to say that
I have never had 'to wait - and wait' for a bus at the RER station, whereas
I have been stuck at Acton Town for half an hour (at least) because of a
signal defect on a quite regular basis . . .
What Ms Rawsthorn needs, and must be eagerly awaiting, is the Chunnel. She
will be able to shop until she drops in downtown Paris, and then not have to
worry about struggling all the way to Charles de Gaulle. And then enjoy
frequent unexplained stops in the beautiful English countryside on her train
journey back to London. Bon voyage]

Lynda La Plante has turned to the sea for her next drama. The creator of
Prime Suspect and Civvies has landed on the lifeboatmen of a fictional
Pembrokeshire seaside town for The Lifeboat, nine stories in which the
private lives of the volunteers will doubtless mesh with their brave forays
out to sea. It is a cross between 999 and a soap opera, and opens with a
tale of illicit drug dealing (BBC 1, 8pm).
After all those films about how American vets returned from Vietnam all
screwed up, we now get Russians scarred by Afghanistan. Screen Two (BBC 2,
10pm) has a short Russian movie (with English sub-titles) Continental Drift
 -Zinky Boys Go Underground, which follows the lives of disabled former
soldiers trying to make ends meet by dodgy dealing in St Petersburg. It is
shot on the city's Metro.
Another of the old and lost Steptoe and Son films, which writer Ray Galton
unearthed, is smartened up and shown on BBC 2 at 8.30 tonight. It is
by-election time in 1970 and Ted Heath plans a photo opportunity at the
Steptoes' rag and bone yard. Father Albert is a fan, but son Harold supports
Labour.

FT  27 APR 94 / Arts: Dirty linen aired in public - Television in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The corpse of Mussolini dangling by his feet, and being prodded by jeering
Milanese, is not a pretty sight. Even seen at the distance of 49 years, the
image raises troubling questions about the human condition and how the once
mighty can be humbled to the point of indignity.
The Mussolini shot was one of many remarkable images from archive film shown
by the RAI state broadcasting organisation in the run-up to the celebration
of the anniversary of Italy's liberation from fascism on April 25. It was
the first time such a concentrated effort has been made to come to terms
with the more uncomfortable aspects of the period of 1943-45 when the
country was divided both because of those areas occupied by the Allies and
the Germans, and by the bitter civil war between those who still backed the
fascist regime and the 'partisan' guerrilla movement.
Quite by coincidence, this year's anniversary coincided with the imminent
entry into government of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance Party, which
draws its inspiration from Mussolini and whose leader, Gianfranco Fini,
recently declared Il Duce to be the greatest statesman this century. The
electoral success of the MSI has emboldened its supporters to embark on a
major exercise in historical revisionism, trying to highlight the positive
aspects of the Mussolini era and play down the negative side.
In this atmosphere, any attempt by television to deal with the 'liberation'
risked exacerbating existing prejudices and thus losing any educative
function. All the more so since the new right is determined to end the near
monopoly over cultural attitudes exercised by the Italian left since the
second world war - not least in television.
However, the RAI proved to its credit that television can be a highly
effective means of jogging the collective conscience as well as act as a
forum for national reconciliation. It is perhaps significant that the
commercial channels, dominated by the three owned by future premier Silvio
Berlusconi, produced nothing original or controversial for the occasion and
limited their contribution to the traditional chat shows which fill the
screens for up to three hours nightly.
The centre-piece of RAI's programming was a series called Combat Film, based
round previously unseen material contained in the archives of the US army in
Washington. (From the subsequent discussion programmes, it was clear the
material was also unknown to historians.) The film was shot by US combat
camera crews following the army through Italy and was shown often unedited,
giving an extra rawness to the images.
The style was incredibly matter of fact, a simple recording of events
without judgment or emotion, and shown on RAI usually without direct sound.
Some of the events were 'historical', like that of the dead Mussolini strung
up in Milan alongside his mistress, or the Allied entry in Rome. But much
was the casual incidence of war and fratricidal conflict: the fascist spy
calmly smoking a cigarette, arms tied to a pole a few moments before his
body crumples under the impact of bullets from a firing squad; orphans being
entertained by GIs at Christmas; a small barefoot boy striding ahead of a
column of gaunt refugees along a dusty road.
These images were constantly commented on in the studio - often by
interrupting the film or re-projecting selected passages - by a group of
historians. But from the general public's point of view, the events were
brought alive by the programme organisers researching some of the
individuals in the clips and bringing them into the studio. Others
subsequently rang in recognising themselves and their relatives. Thus the
bare-foot boy was found, a burly military man in his fifties; a partisan
came forward whose unit was betrayed by the shot spy who explained how the
man lived with them for two weeks dissimulating friendship.
The emotions of these people in the studio, confronted with the power of the
image on memory, managed (just) to avoid the sentimental. These were all
people caught up in events bigger than themselves. Although they had never
forgotten, or wanted to forget, time had produced if not a catharsis, at
least a sense of reconciliation.
As so often in Italian television, the impact is diluted by the length and
unstructured nature of the ensuing discussion programmes. Nevertheless, on
this occasion some of the historians had the merit to make brutal judgments.
One in particular observed that the 300,000 celebrating in Milan the April
25 Liberation Day was greater than the total number of partisans: in other
words most of Italy was caught in the middle and shifted from one side to
the other when the tide turned. This historian also caused one reel to be
slightly rewound to reveal a remarkable sequence in the liberation of
Bologna: a man is seen giving the fascist salute to a passing Italian flag;
a companion points out his mistake and the salute transforms rapidly into a
clenched fist . . . The image of changing Italy, he said . . .
But television has not only been the conscience of Italy's past. It is being
used to dramatic effect to expose the state of present corruption that has
brought down an entire political class. The final stages of the first major
corruption case to come to trial have been compulsive viewing over the past
week. It has been shown live for as much as four hours a day and all
channels have offered selective replays and commentaries in the evenings.
The trial is of Sergio Cusani, a cool disdainful figure who was one of the
key intermediaries organising the flow of illicit funds from big business to
politicians through a host of intermediaries. He is alleged to have handled
some Dollars 150m in four years.
The case has far more drama than a Perry Mason series: the nation is seeing
the dirty linen of a corrupt political system being washed in public. The
public prosecutor, Antonio Di Pietro, Italy's most prominent investigative
magistrate, has a marvellous down to earth sense of humour. And he has
conducted his summing up with the latest computer wizardry. For the first
time an Italian court has seen computer graphics (tracing the complex routes
of illicit funds) and audio-visual aids with replays of witnesses'
statements.
But is this fascinating trial by television legitimate viewing and does it
further the cause of justice? The cynics would say that television channels,
state and private, are desperately short of funds and this is a cheap and
easy way of providing entertainment. Even if this argument is not wholly
true, this 'video-justice' is served up basically as entertainment - rather
than as how a system of justice works, or as a didactic exercise in the
evils of the old corrupt ways.

FT  27 APR 94 / Arts: Real drama from the Maly - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The particular pleasure of the Maly Drama Theatre's current tour of Britain
is the opportunity it affords to watch this exceptional ensemble in one play
after another. A larger impression - it is too dark to be simply called a
pleasure - is the way in which all the plays reveal the tragic history of
Russia in terms of (often comic) human detail.
Stars in the Morning Sky and the two-part Brothers and Sisters - which other
parts of Britain have seen before, but which Manchester is seeing for the
first time - catch two different Russian communities at two different stages
in this century's history. In Stars four Muscovite prostitutes are
temporarily exiled to a barracks during the 1980 Moscow Olympics (so that
foreign visitors will not note such scum); Brothers and Sisters is about a
northern Russian village in the immediate postwar era. The lighting of the
Olympic flame thrills the prostitutes, but passes them by, just as the end
of the 1939-45 war seems like the dawn of a new era to the villagers of
Brothers and Sisters, until they find that the new era is just as tough and
more hopeless.
The great achievement of these plays is, however, not that they fill you
with gloom about Russia, but that they catch so broad a range of humanity.
Not one of the prostitutes in Stars is a 'type'. Each is distinct, with her
own peculiarities, and a nervous system brilliantly revealed. Strangest and
most forlorn is Maria (Anzhelina Nevolina), who seems at last to have found
love with Nikolai but who is doomed by her own past. Even as she nestles in
his lap, and tells him 'Only you treat me as if I am human', she wriggles
madly as if half-seeking escape. Most glamorous is Lora (Tatiana
Rasskozova), often speaking of her supposed career as a trapeze artist and
bearing herself like a ballerina. She finds (the play's greatest irony)
tenderness with Alexander, a patient from a mental asylum.
The dramatis personae of Brothers and Sisters is larger - 31 actors (men and
women; old people, young adults and children) - and the action takes them
through several years. We see two men talking about women; all the women in
the village talking about men; several different households; love-affairs
that last and others that evaporate. And we see the whole community, based
around the Kolkhoz (collective farm), coping with successive issues of moral
outrage, severe taxation, wedding celebrations, seasonal festivals, chronic
poverty. At the end you are sad simply because you want to know more of
these people. (A third play, House, to be seen in Glasgow and Newcastle,
covers the same characters 20 years later.)
There are several features of stagecraft (some of which I noted two weeks
ago apropos of The Cherry Orchard) that constitute a Maly house style. Best
of all, scenic economy. The lighting - coming from above, against a black
backdrop - works far better in these plays than in Chekhov. I still find
that too much of the action is symmetrical, and that too many speeches are
delivered on the centre-line of the stage facing into the audience, though
only in Chekhov do these really mar the play.
But I am astonished at the perfect naturalness with which this stage
ensemble interacts. The first act of Brothers and Sisters ends with a huge
long party that I did not want to end. One woman is shocked when another
woman flirts with her husband, but when people try to make her kiss her own
husband in public she is wooden. Everyone congratulates the young Mikhail,
returned from the war, and makes him drunk; but his mother suddenly wails
out loud about the husband she has lost. Laughter, tears, tenderness,
resentment, joy, despair - all present, all brimful, all utterly real.

FT  27 APR 94 / Arts: The Vienna smiles for Muti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leipzig, Amsterdam, Vienna: three great orchestras of the world converged on
London over the course of a long weekend. Baggage collection at Heathrow
must have been interesting, as assorted violins and cellos, trombones and
timpani fought for space going round on the carousel.
For its European series the Vienna Philharmonic is visiting Berlin, Paris
and London three times a year, each programme with a different conductor.
The last of this season's trio was Riccardo Muti, on Monday at the Royal
Festival Hall. In Salzburg Muti and the Vienna orchestra have become regular
partners, especially in Mozart operas, where Muti demands a highly-strung
intensity a long way from the laid-back playing most of his colleagues get.
That did not come across so forcefully in London. In the outer movements of
Beethoven's Eighth Symphony Muti was vigorous and emphatic, getting more
attack out of the violins than they would have given Bohm, but the inner
movements were featureless - not witty or pointed at all.
The Vienna musicians play Stravinsky less often, which may account for an
extra sharpness of concentration. The divertimento from the ballet Le Baiser
de la fee is uncharacteristically romantic Stravinsky and Muti drew rich
textures, lyrical phrasing wherever the opportunity presented itself. The
wind playing was immaculate, as ever, and he teased out a delightfully
Viennese lilt.
For the main work they turned to Tchaikovsky proper, the Fifth Symphony.
Like other Italian conductors, Muti is interested in Russian composers (not
only Tchaikovsky, but also Scriabin and Prokofiev). He takes a red-blooded
view of this symphony, wholeheartedly supported by the Vienna players in
full cry, but the high drama of the performance teetered on the
self-conscious. A Russian showman like Svetlanov is more likely to get to
the heart of the matter.
With the encore we perhaps came closer to Muti's heart: the Overture to
Rossini's Il viaggio a Reims, played by bubbling wind soloists, brass now on
a tight rein, and strings untidy but effervescent. Muti smiled and one
sensed that the orchestra smiled too. Next season the Vienna Philharmonic
returns for another European series, when the three conductors will be
Giulini, Haitink and Ozawa.

FT  27 APR 94 / Arts: Dutch triumph with Mahler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Barbican's ongoing series 'Great Orchestras of the World', some
orchestras have sounded distinctly less great than others. On Sunday
afternoon, however, Amsterdam's Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra displayed the
very standard we have been trying to remember. Fearlessly secure and
superlatively musical, Mahler's 7th Symphony, the sole work in its
programme, was marvellous to hear, and the standing ovation was fully
earned.
It would be hard to pretend that any London orchestra these days could
guarantee such a performance. If the trumpets do not crack somewhere the
horns probably will, and anyhow the violins will rarely have enough thrust
at climaxes to cut through Mahler's teeming orchestra and make themselves
felt.
By contrast, the absolute security and freedom of the Amsterdam players was
awe-inspiring. No doubt their enviable working conditions are conducive to
those virtues. The conductor was the Italian Riccardo Chailly, who inherited
his distinguished post in 1988 from the long line of Bruckner-and-Mahler
devotees who established the Concertgebouw Orchestra's reputation. Already
noted as a fine Stravinskian and a specialist in extrovert Russian and
French music, Chailly has had to win his spurs in that special Viennese
repertoire.
Mahler's Seventh was a bold choice for a London showcase, for it is
notoriously 'problematic'. Full of bold ideas, as experimental and
perversely chromatic as Mahler ever got (his choral 'Symphony of a
Thousand', would be broader-brushed and operatic, his Ninth grandly and
serenely backward-looking); but weirdly rounded off with a cheerful,
racketty C major finale in shameless Meistersinger-mode.
Chailly spelled everything out in richly idiomatic detail, very forward: if
the Scherzo was too muscular and up-front to count as schattenhaft
('shadowy'), like everything else it sounded brilliant. The trees stood out
so vividly that the woods rather receded; there was less sense of symphonic
arguments and inexorable conclusions than of unstoppable, overflowing
fantasy. In this exhilarating performance, that was more than enough to be
going on with.

FT  27 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: Finding a dustbin for
corruption - Worldwide Waste / The lack of dump sites has put Mexican
companies under intense pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Behind Mexico City's international airport lies one of the capital's biggest
waste disposal sites. A lorry enters the site every few minutes, the driver
invariably tips the security guard at the entrance, and then dumps solid,
and often hazardous, waste into a vast open-air pit that stretches far into
the distance.
Hundreds of scavengers, from young children to old men, walk around the
fly-infested pit picking up plastic containers, bottles, cardboard boxes and
anything else that can be reused or recycled. Some scavengers sell any
reusable waste they find directly to the union which runs the dump, others
pay the union boss about Dollars 20 a month for the right to sell it
elsewhere. Either way, most appear to earn much more than the minimum wage.
The dumps are owned by the municipal government. The unions controlling them
are powerful supporters of Mexico's governing party. Admirers point to the
undeniable efficiency of the system at recycling waste; detractors attack
the corruption that has made union bosses extraordinarily wealthy, and the
appalling health conditions in which scavengers work.
With no commercial toxic incinerators, just one authorised toxic waste site,
and few modern solid-waste facilities, almost all of Mexico's household and
much of its industrial waste ends up in such pits. What does not make it to
these sites is invariably dumped in rivers, the sewage system, or empty
fields.
The government estimates that industry generates about 6m tonnes of toxic
waste a year. But according to David Robinson, a consultant with Quimica
Omega, an environmental services company in Mexico City, total installed
capacity for treating toxic waste is about 200,000 tonnes. He says almost
all of the 800m litres of lubricating oil used every year is dumped into the
sewage system - equivalent, he calculates, to one Exxon Valdez spill a
month.
The problem for many Mexican industries is that while there is hardly
anywhere to put their waste, the government is increasingly forcing
factories to comply with environmental regulations. The government now has
about 500 environmental inspectors, compared with less than 100 in 1989, and
inspected 21,996 companies between August 1992 and March this year, against
1,380 in all of 1989.
The level of enforcement is still criticised by many as insufficient, and
industrialists say the technical expertise and equipment of the inspectors
lags far behind the US. But Mexico is catching up and penalties for
non-compliers are increasing. In the 20 months since the environmental
ministry was reorganised, some 1,577 industries were closed for
contaminating the environment through inadmissible air or toxic waste
emissions.
The increasing focus on enforcement and lack of existing environmental
infrastructure has attracted scores of waste disposal companies to Mexico.
The US Chamber of Commerce recently published a directory of more than 40
such companies in Mexico City, including world leaders such as Chemical
Waste Management, most of which have opened during the administration of
President Carlos Salinas.
David McConnell of Chemical Waste says revenues of the Mexican subsidiary
increased by 40 per cent last year, and he expects a similar rise this year.
His company is seeking to build a new toxic waste site in Mexico, and sister
organisations are working with local government on building and arranging
private financing of solid waste sites.
Some Mexican companies are also investing heavily to minimise their waste,
or are coming up with creative ways of getting rid of it. Jorge Martinez,
head of Grupo Sidek, a steel producer, says it now sells waste to a
neighbouring cement company that uses the product to fire its kilns.
Nevertheless, many small and medium-sized Mexican companies cannot afford to
invest in environmental technology, especially since the recession and the
opening of the country to more foreign trade have squeezed profit margins.
Investment in environmental infrastructure projects, while growing fast, has
been less than many hoped for.
Environmental consultants blame insufficient investment in infrastructure on
government regulation, which they say is arbitrary and gives too much
discretion to government authorities. Jose Antonio Ortega, head of
Corporacion Radian, an environmental services company, says there are no
regulations for construction of incinerators, for treatment facilities, and
that regulations on rubbish dumps are too broad and ambiguous - all of which
has deterred investors.
The effect of the lack of decent infrastructure is that the cost of
disposing of toxic waste has increased to between Dollars 200-Dollars 300 a
barrel - higher than in the US, according to Ortega. This has meant that
disposal has become too expensive for many small businesses which therefore
continue to violate the law.

FT  27 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: All eyes on efficiency - Can
electricity companies be serious about saving energy if profits are tied to
volume sales?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention energy efficiency to an electricity distribution company executive
in the UK and he is likely to wax lyrical about his company's initiatives in
the field. But behind the bluster, he might look a touch nervous.
Not everyone agrees that the industry is doing all it should to help both
customers and the system to improve energy efficiency, and the pressure for
change is growing.
Offer, the industry watchdog, is conducting a fundamental review of the way
it regulates the distribution businesses of the 12 regional electricity
companies in England and Wales and Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric in
Scotland. Energy efficiency is a key consideration.
The issue is dividing the industry. There is no mood within the sector to
abandon the form of regulation, favoured by Offer, which limits prices the
companies charge rather than their profits. Offer and the companies believe
this encourages the industry to be more efficient than would be the case
with profit regulation.
However, some regional electricity companies, backed by environmentalists,
say the way the prices are curbed encourages companies to increase sales
volumes rather than sell their customers energy-efficient measures.
Others argue that introducing a system that leaves companies indifferent to
the amount of electricity they sell would lead them to ignore customer
needs. This would increase prices and eventually sideline the industry at
the expense of competitors such as gas companies.
There is a consensus in the industry on the need to promote energy
efficiency. As Offer says, it helps keep customers' bills down and
potentially reduces the harmful sulphur and carbon emitted from electricity
generating plants.
But why should the industry care? John Roberts, chief executive of
Chester-based distributor Manweb, is refreshingly honest about the
industry's motives. 'It would be nice to say we are concerned about the
future of the globe and, of course, we are. But the fact is that we would
rather get into this in a voluntary way that we can control than have
something imposed upon us. We cannot stand back Canute-like while others
demand change.'
Manweb, in common with most other regional distributors, is receptive to the
idea of the regulator allowing regional companies to raise a specified
amount from customers to use on targeted demand-side management (DSM).
For example, companies could aim energy-efficiency measures at low-income
households which would otherwise not be interested in such activity. DSM
measures, common in the US, could reduce the costs of maintaining and
operating the distribution system to the benefit of all customers.
Even under the present price control arrangements, DSM can be cost effective
both for power companies and their customers - for example, where it enables
improvements to the network to be deferred.
However, as distributor Seeboard, based at Hove on the south coast, points
out, many DSM schemes are not pursued by distributors because they will
reduce the number of units sold. This is the crux of the debate over
regulation and energy efficiency.
Existing regulatory controls limit rises in use-of-system charges, which
form the bulk of distribution revenues. In England and Wales, these charges
can rise by up to 2.5 per cent above inflation a year, while in Scotland
they must fall by 0.5 per cent in real terms each year.
Crucially, however, the price control formula operates on a base price per
kilowatt hour (made up of a weighted basket of components). The effect is to
constrain the average revenue per unit distributed. This means total revenue
depends on the volume of sales.
Critics complain that this formula does not match revenues to costs, and
fails to supply the surrogate competition which is the point of regulation
in monopoly industries.
The current formula assumes that all distribution costs vary with the volume
of sales whereas in fact other factors include the number of customers and
fixed costs.
According to the Association for the Conservation of Energy, the result is
that regional distributors collect more distribution revenue from the sale
of the marginal unit of electricity than it costs to distribute. 'This
creates an inappropriate incentive to sell more.'
The association recommends there should be no volume incentive and
regulation should be based on fixed costs and the number of customers.
Seeboard, a regional power distributor, supports the idea that revenue
incentives should reflect underlying costs 'as this is consistent with the
aim of using regulatory measures to emulate competitive forces. The conflict
between the incentive to sell more units of electricity and the objective of
encouraging energy efficiency is clear and any revised price formula should
reduce or eliminate this conflict'.
Seeboard believes revenues should be linked to the number of customers
served and to fixed costs, as well as volumes. That proposal, however, is
anathema to companies such as Southern Electric. Henry Casley, Southern
chief executive, says: 'At the extreme, if the volume incentive was
eliminated, distributors would not want anybody to use electricity, since
extra sales would give rise to additional costs but no additional revenue.
The electricity industry could be sidelined.'
Southern denies that the industry has been lacklustre in promoting energy
efficiency. Over the past five years its energy marketing activities have
achieved cumulative sales of some 2,000 gigawatt hours which have displaced
6,000 GWh of competing fuels.
Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity, warns that if the link
between revenue and volumes is diluted, this would put a partial or full cap
on revenue and would reduce significantly the commercial incentive to
continue marketing energy efficiency. 'Inter-fuel competition, principally
between electricity and gas, would disappear,' he says. Electricity sales
would fall faster than revenue and prices would be allowed to rise.
The campaign by Southern and others for the 100 per cent volume incentive to
be kept seems unlikely to be fully successful. In its recent review of the
regional companies' supply businesses, Offer introduced a system which
related revenues to a mixture of volumes, fixed costs and customer numbers.
A private letter from Offer to the regional companies last week indicated
that this was likely to be the approach in the distribution review.
The question, to be answered on completion of the review in July, is how far
Offer goes.

FT  27 APR 94 / Management: No need to reward good performance - How to
manage intrinsic motivation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some jobs and tasks are intrinsically satisfying. By their very nature they
are interesting and pleasant to do. How they are enjoyable depends on the
preference, predilections and propensities of individuals.
Intrinsic satisfaction implies that merely doing the job is, in itself, its
own reward. Therefore, for such activities no reward and no management
should be required. But the naive manager might unwillingly extinguish this
ideal state of affairs.
Take the case of the academic writer scribbling at home on a research
report. The local children had for three days played extremely noisily in a
small park near his study. The noise was highly stressful because it was
simultaneously loud, uncontrollable and unpredictable.
What should be done? (a) Ask (politely) that they quieten down or go away;
(b) call the police or the parents if you know them; (c) threaten them with
force if they do not comply; (d) all of the above in that order.
The wise don used none of the above. Unwordly maybe, but someone whose job
depended on intrinsic motivation, he applied another principle. He went to
the children on the fourth morning and said that he was so delighted with
their games that he was prepared to pay them each Pounds 1 a day if they
carried on.
The youngsters were naturally surprised but delighted. For two days the don
dispensed the cash. But on the third day he explained that because of a
'cash-flow' problem he could only give them 50p each. The next day he
claimed to be 'cash-light' and only handed out 10p.
True to his prediction the children complained and refused to continue. They
all left in a huff promising never to return to play in the park. Totally
successful in his endeavour, the don retired to his study luxuriating in the
silence.
This parable illustrates a problem for the manager. If a person is happy
doing a task but is also 'managed' through explicit rewards (usually money),
the individual will tend to focus on these rewards, which then inevitably
have to be escalated to maintain satisfaction.
There is considerable research on the types of job which give the most
satisfaction. Contrary to popular belief, it is not merchant bankers or
high-flying company executives who report most satisfaction. Many in fact
yearn for early but 'comfortable' retirement. Nor is it social workers,
nurses or others in the care business.
It turns out that craftsmen and women report most job satisfaction. The
'crafts' vary: mathematicians are very job satisfied, as are furniture
makers. Goldsmiths, stone-wall builders, and other craftspeople report the
highest intrinsic satisfaction.
Craftspeople have intrinsic job satisfaction partly because of the pace,
timing and control they have in their work but also because of their
identification with the final product. However, once a fine furniture
builder becomes a successful businessman he may lose his thrill in design
and curving. That is why the best craftspeople have 'agents' who deal with
money matters. This is not only because craftspeople are frequently
inexperienced at running a business, but also because many do not like it,
despite the obvious monetary rewards.
Intrinsic motivation in part explains why some people continue at poorly
paid employment. They do not need motivating in the usual way - through an
astute mixture of carrot and stick - because they are intrinsically
motivated. But, like all of us, they still respond to praise for the product
or service that they supply.
For those limited few who enjoy doing what they do, working (like virtue) is
its own reward.

FT  27 APR 94 / Management: Nationality still matters - Christopher Lorenz
concludes a three-part series on ownership by examining what makes some
cross-border purchases easier to handle than others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few weeks before Renault's takeover of Volvo collapsed last December amid
a Swedish furore over the deal, an equally sensitive cross-border
acquisition sailed through almost unnoticed. Nobel, a Swedish chemicals
company, was bought by Akzo of the Netherlands.
At first sight, the contrast seemed to be one of national style. French
buyers have gained a reputation for putting national interests first. Unlike
Renault's French management, which had taken an arrogant line towards the
Swedes, the Dutch took great pains to consider Swedish interests, in spite
of the fact that Nobel was in a far worse financial state than Volvo. Akzo
not only agreed to run the merged group's key coatings interests from
Sweden, but also undertook to continue Swedish research and development.
Akzo's chairman said he did not underestimate the difficulties of merging
the two cultures, but added prophetically that there would probably be fewer
difficulties between the Swedes and Dutch than between, say, Swedes and
French.
But nationality is not the only contrasting factor between the two cases.
There are three other fundamental, but less obvious, differences.
First, Akzo's operations were more complementary with Nobel's than Renault's
were with Volvo's - there was much less overlap, and therefore less room for
argument about what should be done in which country. In only one area of the
merged chemical group's activities was it obvious that capacity needed to be
rationalised.
Second, Akzo has far more experience than Renault in handling takeovers.
Third, the Dutch company has developed a more enlightened attitude to the
geographic dispersal of highly skilled technical activities and managerial
decision making. It is, in management jargon, closer to operating as a
'transnational'.
Factors such as these are vital to the outcome of cross-border acquisitions
such as BMW's controversial takeover of Britain's Rover car group, and the
examples examined earlier in this series.
But that is not to say that nationality and culture are irrelevant. Michael
Heseltine, the UK's newly internationalist trade and industry secretary, was
wrong when he reacted to the fuss in February over BMW's takeover of Rover
with the declaration that 'ownership is unimportant'. In an ideal world, it
would be, but the reality is that the nationality of a parent company
frequently still influences its location of key technical operations, and of
managerial decision making.
The relative weight of these influences is disputed by experts in the field.
Lando Zappei, the Munich-based head of Booz Allen Acquisition Services, says
the two key factors in a cross-border takeover are the strategy behind it,
and whether integration of the acquired company is handled well.
Surprisingly, he argues that the latter is more important than the former.
As Zappei argues, takeovers tend to be relatively easy to handle where the
prime motive is the complementarity of the two businesses, and the scope for
transferring skills between them. Nestle's acquisition of Rowntree, and the
US-UK pharmaceuticals merger between SmithKline and Beecham, are two such
examples. Far more problematic are those where the main logic is the
rationalisation of overlapping businesses with excess capacity - which was,
in part, the case with Renault-Volvo.
It was even more true of two former British companies whose UK production is
being closed this year and transferred abroad by their new foreign owners:
Thorn EMI's lighting output (being transferred by American GE to Hungary);
and Bryant and May's last match line, which is being shifted by Swedish
Match to its home base.
In view of the fact that many industries across Europe are in pressing need
of rationalisation, such production shifts across borders will become even
more common in the next few years.
But this does not mean that they will always be to the detriment of the
acquired company. Zappei argues that if capacity rationalisation is properly
planned, it frequently turns out to be reasonably even-handed. Only if
unexpected emergency measures have to be taken is there 'a strong tendency
for acquirers to make cuts in the country with which they are least
familiar' - in other words away from their home base.
This tendency is particularly strong in countries such as France and Italy,
where the home government exerts pressure to protect domestic interests.
Germany also tends to be shielded by the problems encountered in closing
plants and shedding staff.
Philippe Haspeslagh, a Belgian-born acquisitions expert at Insead, the
international business school near Paris, makes less of a distinction than
Zappei between the impact of 'rationalisation acquisitions' and those where
the motive is complementarity. To him, the key factors are the extent of the
acquirer's prior takeover experience, and the company's overall degree of
organisational sophistication. A decade ago Thomson, the French electronics
group, had a blazing row with its newly acquired Telefunken subsidiary in
Germany, but since then 'it has gained a lot of experience in how to handle
foreign acquisitions', he says.
This has stood it in good stead with the reasonably successful integration
of RCA, its largest US acquisition. But it did not protect Thomson from
allegations of national bias when - in a series of salami-like cuts - it
gradually closed the UK research and production operations of Ferguson, the
former TV offshoot of Thorn EMI.
Haspeslagh also differs from Zappei in the importance he attributes to
nationality. 'It's hard to disentangle inexperience from nationality bias,'
he says. 'Certain cultures tend to be less enlightened than others.' He
denies that French companies are especially bad in this respect: as he says,
both Rhone-Poulenc, with a string of recent US chemicals and pharmaceutical
takeovers, and the Lyon-based SEB Group, with its acquisition of Germany's
Rowenta appliance company, have shown their readiness to retain highly
skilled activities - and some managerial decision making - in the acquired
company's country.
By contrast, he argues that Finnish engineering companies, which have been
involved in many cross-border takeovers, tend to want excessively
centralised corporate structures which create tension with newly acquired
foreign subsidiaries.
As Haspeslagh stresses, it is relatively easy for a company to disperse R &amp;
D and other skilled jobs around the world, but far harder to distribute
significant decision-making power.
Yet this needs to be done if companies are to become more responsive to
market differences, and attract more top-class international managers.
'There's a limited benefit in having software engineers in India or
designers in the English countryside if decisions are still made in
Detroit,' he says.
Companies are unlikely to disperse much divisional and corporate
decision-making away from their home base until they internationalise the
mentality of their top management. In the meantime, home country influence
over decision-making - one aspect of the so-called 'head office effect' -
remains overwhelmingly powerful in all but a handful of 'transnational'
companies, notably Nestle and ABB.
For the rest, including almost all US and Japanese multinationals and the
majority of Europeans, nationality still matters very much indeed.

FT  27 APR 94 / People: Alan Winter lays new foundations at Trafalgar House
property
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Winter, managing director of Legal &amp; General's property division, has
been given the job of reshaping the UK commercial property business of
Trafalgar House, the big conglomerate which has suffered three years of
heavy losses.
Trafalgar House has been without a property boss since the end of last year
when David Calverley, 52, resigned after 25 years with the group. Winter,
44, who will take over as managing director of the group's UK commercial
property business in the summer, fills one of the last gaps in a top
management team which has changed substantially over the past year.
Although he is not replacing Calverley on the board, and does not have
responsibility for house-building, he takes charge of one of the more
troublesome parts of Trafalgar House's business. Trafalgar House was a very
active property developer in the 1980s and over-extended itself at the time
of the recession.
Most of the old management have been replaced, the balance sheet has been
repaired with a Pounds 400m rights issue, and Trafalgar House has decided to
withdraw from the US commercial property market. However, it has made a
'firm commitment' to remain in UK commercial property. Winter's task will be
to change the focus of the business from 'speculative development to the
creation of income producing assets'.
Winter, a chartered surveyor who joined Legal &amp; General from Hillier Parker
in September 1989, admits he is moving into a smaller job. At Legal &amp;
General he has a staff of 100 and looks after a Pounds 2.5bn property
portfolio, which he says is comparable in size to that of MEPC or British
Land. At Trafalgar House he will have around 50 staff and around Pounds 220m
invested in property.
However, Winter says that Trafalgar House has 'some interesting problems to
solve' and he was tempted by the salary. He has tended to 'stay a few years
and then move on' at a series of property-related jobs ranging from Ford
Motor to Capital and Counties. But this pattern has not hurt his record in
the industry. Last week he was runner-up in the property fund manager of the
year award sponsored by his old firm Hillier Parker and Pensions World
magazine.

FT  27 APR 94 / People: Anna Walker promoted at Oftel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anna Walker likes competition. Not necessarily in a personal sense, although
yesterday she radiated quiet satisfaction at her triumph in the
cross-Whitehall contest for the post of deputy director general at the
Office of Telecommunications. She replaces Bill Wigglesworth, who retired
last month.
The competition for which her passion seems boundless, however, is the
interplay between private and public organisations, the cut and thrust
between utilities emerging from the protection of state ownership and
younger challengers and the erudite accounting issues surrounding charging
structures.
A graduate in history from Oxford, she joins a small female elite among the
industry watchdogs which includes Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry
regulator. After university, she had spells with the British Council and the
Confederation of British Industry, where 'I began to see what government
gets up to'.
She joined the Department of Trade and Industry in 1975 and worked on a
succession of regulatory and privatisation issues, including the reform of
legal services, coal and rail privatisation and the early stages of the
Citizen's Charter.
She has been with Oftel for some 30 months as director of competition, and
says the job has 'real interest and real responsibility'.

FT  27 APR 94 / People: Usborne suspends pig director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Usborne, the grain trading and pig production company, yesterday announced
it had suspended on full pay Michael Brown, managing director of its Daisy
Hill Pigs unit, pending the result of an investigation into substantial
losses in the pig operations.
'As the managing director of the pig company, he has not yet been able to
elucidate on why we've lost this money,' said Mike Adams, a director of
Usborne and managing director of the grain trading side, but reported that
Brown was co-operating with the investigation.
Last week the company said that trading difficulties had been compounded by
a breakdown in management control of the pig operations, including
accounting systems.
Richard Clarke, a farm business management consultant, has been appointed
general manager with responsibility for day-to-day operations of Daisy Hill
Pigs. 'With the breakdown, we're wanting to make a complete reassessment of
what future policy should be,' said Adams. 'We're going to make further
appointments.'
Shares in the company, whose chairman is Lord Parkinson, the former
Conservative cabinet minister, were suspended last week at 19 1/2 p after it
warned of the first-half losses.
The Daisy Hill operation markets 5,000 pigs a week and accounts for about
Pounds 30m of Usborne's annual turnover, compared with Pounds 180m from
grain trading.

FT  27 APR 94 / Recruitment: Officers on the march into new careers -
Tapping management potential in the armed forces is an option for change in
the business world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do officers leaving the armed forces make good managers? About 3,500 came
onto the UK jobs market last year and while yesterday's Defence White Paper
did not specify further cuts in personnel, the rate of retirements is
unlikely to tail off for some time.
Not so long ago a commission in the forces was considered a good stepping
stone into a management career. But is the right stuff for the forces
necessarily right for today's businesses, when so many organisations are
undergoing radical changes in the way they run their workforces?
Officers who have taken the leap to civvy street under Options for Change,
the defence manpower reduction programme, say the transition is far from
easy and suggest the best way to succeed is to find some qualification to
give a competitive edge in job applications. Once the change is made,
however, the surprise for many has been how similar the role of management
has been out of uniform. Often the differences have been cultural.
Colin Gordon, a former major in the Gloucestershire regiment, resigned his
commission two years ago to take a one-year Master of Business
Administration course at Cranfield School of Management.
Even though he had passed through Staff College, the army fast track to
higher rank, his ambition to command a battalion on the way to gaining the
coveted pips of a brigadier had been effectively thwarted by plans to merge
the Gloucesters with the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment. He said: 'I was
told quite candidly there wasn't going to be a battalion to command.'
At 40 he could have ambled on in the services as a lieutenant colonel but
decided to choose his own ground for leaving. 'I didn't want to be cannon
fodder for someone else's redundancy plans,' he said.
The services have a system of resettlement training running over two years
from the time that servicemen and women opt to leave. It offers a wide range
of courses and briefings, running from a half day to 28 days. Some of these
are company placements.
Gordon spent a month with Mercedes Benz while continuing to draw his army
salary. As a fluent German speaker, he was able to help the company with
translation work as it established a new contract and hire operation. 'At
the same time I learned a great deal about how a large organisation
functions.'
None of this, however, prepared him for the MBA, which he said was demanding
and expensive but worth the outlay. 'Getting a job is bloody tough and
something that you have to retrain for. If you have the time you should take
a course that is well regarded and that will differentiate you from everyone
else coming out of the forces,' he says.
Today he is working on a short-term contract, heading the restructuring of
BIAS, part of the P and G Bland Group of commercial insurance brokers in
Leicester. This is one more step, he says, in compiling a commercial track
record. The next stage is to find a job that demands a combination of his
latest experience, language abilities, MBA qualification and the command
experience gained in the services.
Grasping modern management-speak, says Gordon, has not been difficult.
'Human resources management has familiar ideas using different terminology.
It is another sort of jargon and once you know the language you find you
have been doing these things for umpteen years,' he said.
The message should not be lost on Mike Bett, the former deputy chairman of
BT, who is less than a month into heading a review that aims to make armed
service structures and terms and conditions 'appropriate to the needs of the
21st century'. It is focusing on the relationship between responsibility,
rank, trade and pay, including the concept of performance pay.
Bett has hinted at what might be in store. In an interview with Personnel
Plus Magazine, he said: 'If civilian organisations are developing flatter
structures with fewer layers, perhaps we should be asking whether the same
should be happening in the forces.'
The comment might find some sympathy in the German army. Gordon said that
when he served for a time as executive assistant to the German chief of
staff in Nato's Northern Army Group in Europe, a German major-general had
confessed to being staggered at the number of generals in the British army.
'I would think there would be scope to cut at the top, but they should not
meddle around with the lower ranks,' said Gordon. The 30-man structure of
the platoon had proved to be an ideal team size in military and civilian
structures.
Bett could find many of the new practices envisaged by the review akin to
reinventing the wheel. The armed forces, whether in the UK or elsewhere,
have been the source of many management techniques used in business today.
Psychometric testing was a product of the US armed forces going back to the
second world war. Assessment centres, administering a series of tests and
interviews, which are becoming increasingly popular for employee selection
among large companies, have been used to choose commissioned officers for
years.
One of the difficulties facing officers leaving the forces is that their
service role is not well understood in business. Stereotyped images in film
and television have not helped. This lack of perception, even, perhaps, fear
of the officer class among civilian managers, has not helped. Even the most
able officers have sometimes found difficulty finding work.
Sir Jeremy Moore, who commanded the British land forces in the Falklands
war, spent 18 months looking for work after leaving the service life in
March 1983. Today he is a defence consultant.
Brigadier Neville White, who left the Army in 1987 with considerable
management but no commercial experience, said that he sent his CV to 60
companies and public organisations, with three showing interest. He was
offered the job of managing the external affairs at Slough Estates, the
property company, and now combines the role with managing administration. He
said: 'I was able to transfer all my communications skills, but if I had
entered as a marketing manager or gone into the professional property area I
would not have made it to first base.'
Like Gordon, he encountered management systems that had been developed first
in the forces but noticed that, applied commercially, many had increased in
sophistication. 'I found we no longer had an edge,' he said
One of the biggest differences between the military and commercial sectors,
suggests White, is that military life is 95 per cent training and 5 per cent
'for real'.
'One has to remember that in the forces you are training for one fundamental
basic thing, which is killing the enemy. You are training for war.'
It may be that preparedness for the sort of wars the British fought in the
Falklands or in the Gulf is becoming less of a priority. The evolving
peacekeeping role of mixed forces not yet fully defined by the UN and Nato
in Bosnia may emerge as the most consistent military function of developed
nations in the future. In that case the structure of the services could well
change.
Whatever happens, there is no denying that the military still provides some
of the most effective training to be found in the UK and that its people are
a valuable potential resource for the corporate sector. At present some 80
per cent of those who leave have jobs within three months of leaving and 55
per cent have jobs the day they leave.

FT  27 APR 94 / Water row may drown Scots Tories: A look at the party driven
to say no to privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish Conservatives last week began issuing leaflets with the unusual
headline: 'Tories say no to privatisation.' The leaflets emphasised that the
government had no intention of privatising Scotland's water and sewerage
industry in spite of claims to the contrary from opposition parties.
Water has become the big issue in next month's elections for Scotland's nine
regional and three island councils. The regions are due to be abolished in
1996 and replaced by about 30 all-purpose councils absorbing the 53
districts, so councillors elected on May 5 will serve for only two years.
This may have made the election campaign almost invisible on the doorstep,
but has not stopped the parties arguing. The opposition sees the water issue
as a good way of pointing out the ideological differences between themselves
and the Tories.
The subject stirs feelings in Scotland which have little counterpart in
England and Wales where water services are in private hands. Most Scots
believe water is a God-given asset that must be left in public hands. It is
therefore surprising that a government which has taken care since the 1992
general election not to offend the Scots allowed the issue to gain such
momentum. The Conservatives contemplated privatising the Scottish water
industry to manage water services after the abolition of the regional
councils which now run it.
In spite of very early signs from opinion polls that privatisation was
highly unpopular, even with Tories, the government was slow last year to
declare unequivocally that it was off the agenda. Its solution, to create
three publicly owned water authorities, aroused anxiety because they would
not be under local government control and could be privatised later.
In March some 97 per cent of people voting in a referendum in Strathclyde
region, which is centred on Glasgow and contains about half the Scottish
population, said they wanted water to remain in local government hands. The
turnout in this postal ballot was 71 per cent.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, denounced the referendum as irrelevant.
But two weeks ago he emphasised that councillors would be on the water
authorities' boards, possibly in a majority. The government was not
privatising water 'by the front door, the back door or any other door' and
that would remain the government's policy 'for many years'.
However the opposition shows no wish to drop the idea that the Tories will
privatise water. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, was
pictured by a reservoir denouncing privatisation, while Mrs Jean McFadden,
Labour leader of Glasgow district council, wrote in the Glasgow Evening
Times that water privatisation was 'the latest stage in the government's
systematic plundering of public assets for private profit'. Pensioners, she
said, would have to 'think twice before they make a cup of tea'.
The misrepresentation of the Tories' position has probably invigorated their
election campaign, leading them to denounce the opposition for deceit. Yet
they face a tough fight, standing at only 13 per cent in the Scottish
opinion polls, their lowest-ever level, and blamed for income tax rises and
the imposition of VAT on fuel. They control none of the regional councils
and hold only 52 of the 453 regional council seats being contested.
The reform of local government has some, largely silent, supporters outside
the Tory party, but more see it as an attempt by the Conservatives to regain
lost ground in local government by gerrymandering the boundaries of the new
single-tier councils.
Labour dominates local government in the central belt: it controls four
regions - Strathclyde, Central, Fife and Lothian - and governs Tayside
(centred on Dundee) and Grampian (around Aberdeen) in coalition with the
SNP.
Labour is fielding 350 candidates, about the same number as the
Conservatives, but Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, says it
will do well to hold the gains it made in 1990 when it took 44 per cent of
the vote at the height of Tory unpopularity over the poll tax.
The SNP stands at 26 per cent in the opinion polls and thus claims to be the
second party in Scottish politics. It is fielding 370 candidates, more than
any other party, and claims good prospects of becoming the biggest party in
Grampian and Tayside.
Its main challenge is to Labour which it accuses of doing nothing to save
Scottish water and of allowing the Scottish local government bill to
complete its committee stage last week with few significant changes.

FT  27 APR 94 / Debts to exporters fall by 15%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The amount of money outstanding to British exporters through late payment of
bills by customers in key European Union countries fell by 15 per cent in
the year to March, NCM Credit Insurance, the UK's largest supplier of export
credit, said yesterday.
Losses caused by non-payment of debts by these countries also went down over
the same period, although the position in the rest of the EU worsened
slightly, it said.
The company said the drop in cost of payment delays reflected a gradual
lowering of interest rates in continental Europe.

FT  27 APR 94 / 148 more jobs go at Swan Hunter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further 148 employees of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder which is in
receivership, are to be made redundant and 237 will be laid off while the
company fights for more work, it was announced yesterday, Chris Tighe
writes.
The redundancies and lay-offs, to take effect late next month, have been
caused by a gap in workload once the Type 23 frigate HMS Northumberland is
handed over on May 24. Its departure leaves only one vessel at Swan Hunter.
Union leaders regretted the new round of job cuts, but welcomed the decision
of receivers Price Waterhouse to lay off, rather than make redundant, the
majority of the 385 surplus employees. Those affected include manual,
clerical, technical and managerial staff.
Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the French company negotiating to buy
Swans, met defence ministry officials yesterday to provide information about
its finances and structure.

FT  27 APR 94 / Shergar damages case fails
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in the kidnapped Derby winner Shergar yesterday failed in a
High Court attempt for Pounds 200,000 damages over their failure to recover
an insurance pay-out for the loss of the horse.
Racehorse trainer Mr Vincent O'Brien, his wife Jacqueline, Mr John and Mrs
Susan Magnier, and Mr Robert Sangster's Swettenham Stud, as joint owners of
the Coolmore Stud in County Tipperary, bought three Pounds 280,000 shares in
Shergar, prized as a breeding stallion, when he was syndicated by the Aga
Khan in 1981.
They had paid the first instalment of Pounds 100,000 each when the horse -
valued at Pounds 10m - was kidnapped in February 1983, probably by the IRA,
from Ballymany Stud Farm, County Kildare. The horse has never been
recovered.
Insurers at Lloyd's of London refused to pay out under a Pounds 200,000
policy covering two-thirds of the initial instalments because the horse had
been covered only against death, not theft.
The Coolmore shareholders brought a damages claim against bloodstock agent
BBA (Ireland), which had arranged the insurance, and Lloyd's brokers
Hughes-Gibb, which placed the cover with underwriters. They claimed
negligence and breach of duty in failing to ensure that the cover included
theft.
But Mr Justice Rattee ruled that Coolmore had never asked for such cover and
the defendants were not negligent in failing to obtain it.
The action was dismissed and the Coolmore shareholders were ordered to pay
the defendants' legal costs.

FT  27 APR 94 / Stock Exchange awarded two grudging cheers: A look at the
long-awaited initiative for small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Erratic trading in the shares of smaller companies has been a thorn in the
side of the London Stock Exchange since the onset of the last recession in
1990.
Small companies took it on the chin as the recession went from bad to worse
and the flow of capital through the market to the sector slowed to a
trickle. The exchange was often accused of being a fair-weather friend to
the smallest companies whose shares it lists.
The exchange's long-awaited initiative to encourage capital into small
companies, announced yesterday, goes some way towards meeting that
criticism.
But some venture capitalists argue privately that much of the exchange's
plan simply amounts to repackaging some of what it was already doing, and
the most significant new initiative - a marketing plan - is no more than
what some of its fiercest critics have been urging for some time.
Mr Ronald Cohen, chairman of Apax Partners, the venture-capital group, said:
'If you boil it all down, the stock exchange is proposing a low-regulation
market as a stepping stone to the official list, and that the official list
should cater for all larger companies.'
Mr Cohen is a member of Cisco, the City Group for Smaller Companies, which
has argued for a new, pan-European small company exchange under separate
management from the exchange. It is not at all clear that the latest plan is
sufficient to deter the competitive threat.
At the heart of scepticism about the new effort is a question mark over
whether the exchange is really prepared to undergo a cultural transformation
and become an organisation which aggressively markets itself and its
services. 'We have never been very active in marketing what we have,' Mr
Lawrence said.
To this end, Mr Giles Vardy, director of market development, was given the
additional title of director of marketing earlier this month.
A key element of the exchange's small companies' plan involves meeting
regional stockbrokers to encourage them to promote shares of locally based
companies. The exchange's network of regional exchanges which performed this
function were phased out in a cost-cutting and restructuring exercise in the
late 1980s.
Scottish Enterprise, the government-backed economic development body, will
aid the exchange in its efforts.
Besides enhanced marketing, there are three other critical elements to the
plan - improving the trading technology for small company shares, codifying
the regulations for small companies and creating a new index against which
institutional investors can benchmark performance.
Shares in 236 companies now trade under section 535.2 of the exchange's
rules - a section of the rulebook with no formal listing requirements of its
own. While some of these companies' shares are traded no more than once a
year, others trade several times a day.
Mr Lawrence was vague on the degree of regulation the 535.2 companies would
have, but venture capitalists and stockbrokers say the sector needs to be
more stringent in its requirements than the exchange's official list.
'The 535 market needs beefing up,' said the head of corporate finance at a
City stockbrokers. 'It needs to be regulated. It's not a market many people
understand but it's becoming more active.'
Unless investors feel confident that the market is well regulated, they will
not devote additional capital to it.
Some market participants said the exchange had fended off some possible
competition in the small-companies sector by deciding to build an
order-matching capacity into its new Sequence share-trading system. This
will allow those wishing to dispose of illiquid (infrequently traded) shares
to offer them at a set price to any willing participant.
'That's a good move,' said the investment director at one leading UK
institutional investment group. 'We were considering taking Tradepoint (a
competing trading system to the stock exchange) so we could get that
facility for small company shares.'

FT  27 APR 94 / Global Forum faces Pounds 1m shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only eight weeks before 600 delegates from all over the world arrive in
Manchester for the Global Forum '94 environmental conference, organisers are
still nearly Pounds 1m short of being certain of financing the Pounds 3.6m
event.
The EU has agreed to give Pounds 1.6m, although a contract has still to be
completed, while Manchester City Council and Manchester Airport have
guaranteed Pounds 500,000 each. Siemens, British Telecommunications and
Co-operative Bank are corporate sponsors and more are being sought.
Sir Gil Thompson, chairman of the event and president of the airport, said
yesterday the government was 'still thinking about it' after a presentation
to Mr John Gummer, environment secretary.
The forum will follow up the event which ran parallel to the Earth Summit in
Rio in 1992. The summit itself was followed by an inter-governmental
conference called Partnerships for Change in Manchester last September.
The forum was to be staged then but was postponed because of organisational
and funding difficulties.
Mr John Major committed the UK to both events when he attended the Rio
summit, but only the inter-governmental conference was guaranteed public
funds.
However, Mr Major may not be able to attend the forum as it will overlap the
next EU summit in Greece.
The forum itself has been slimmed to a core conference on the sustainable
development of cities. It will report to the United Nations Commission on
Sustainable Development, which monitors progress on environmental
improvements agreed in Rio.
The report will then go to next year's Habitat 2 conference in Istanbul,
organised by the UN Commission on Human Settlement.

FT  27 APR 94 / NHS staff morale at record low, says Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday sought to capitalise on the reorganisation of the health
service to boost its campaign to win London seats in the local government
elections next week.
A report by the London group of Labour MPs called for a strategic authority
to plan NHS services in the capital, and accused Mrs Virginia Bottomley,
health secretary, of pursuing unjustified hospital closures. The report
claimed that London had lost 22,000 hospital beds in 12 years while 165,000
people were on waiting lists and 75 hospitals had closed. A further 16
hospitals faced closure while others might be merged, it said.
Launching the report, Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's spokesman for London, and Ms
Dawn Primarolo, shadow health minister, claimed that morale among NHS staff
was at an all-time low.
Mrs Bottomley told MPs at question time in the Commons that Labour MPs had
misunderstood the need for reorganisation of the health service in London.
'There is no recognition . . . of the population shifts or the changes in
medical science to which the NHS in the capital must respond,' she said.
'All (Labour) can contribute to the debate is a litany of uncosted spending
promises.'
In a separate report, Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, accused
the government of wasting money by spending more than Pounds 600,000 to send
pamphlets to NHS managers.
The funds would have paid for 20 junior doctors for a year, he said.
'Bureaucracy has come before patient care in the implementation of the
government's NHS changes.' The report - Bottomley's Bureaucracy - also
highlighted the number of additional managers taken on by Family Health
Service Authorities since NHS reorganisation took effect.
It said that more than 1,000 new management posts had been introduced since
1989, when there were only 30. The numbers reached 640 in 1990 and 1,040 in
1992.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, said it was vital for everyone in
the NHS to know what was going on. 'Most fair-minded people would expect the
NHS to keep its staff informed, and would rightly criticise us if we did
not,' he said.
The Liberal Democrats called for a freeze in the motorway programme to
release Pounds 4.4bn from the government's 1994-95 budget for spending on
public transport projects. The party said 17 major projects would benefit,
including the Crossrail scheme for a new east-west mainline rail link under
London.

FT  27 APR 94 / Labour says defence statement is a cover-up: Up to 20,000
redundancies expected; Military bases may merge; Some activities face
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence yesterday released its annual statement on defence
expenditure several months earlier than usual and without the usual
statistical details.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, presented the document as a
commitment to maintaining or even increasing Britain's fighting capacity.
He said that high performance by the armed forces was one of Britain's
greatest strategic assets and would not be compromised. The annual statement
was unusual in containing virtually no change in defence policy.
The timing of the statement prompted a storm of Labour complaints that the
government was covering up its plans for an overhaul of support services in
the armed forces which are expected to involve heavy job losses.
Labour MPs said the government was postponing announcements of large cuts
and heavy redundancies until after the local and European elections.
Labour criticised the document for failing to give details of the cuts which
would come from the review of costs, which is called Front Line First.
Mr Rifkind confirmed that more than 30 separate studies of possible savings
were under way and that the defence ministry was studying more than 3,000
proposals for saving money from its own workforce and ordinary service
staff. However, no final decisions had been made.
The minister said that the breadth and capacity of Britain's armed forces
was matched only by that of the US, Russia and France. Mr Rifkind added that
the government intended to maintain that position.
At the same time, however, he came under attack from Conservative
backbenchers for jeopardising frontline forces through cuts in support
staff.
Front Line First is expected to recommend mergers of bases, privatisation of
some services and up to 20,000 redundancies among support personnel.
Under the proposals Rosyth naval base in Scotland could close, and several
headquarters could be merged. Up to 90,000 vehicles may be leased instead of
owned, and much of the Royal Air Force's maintenance could be handled by
private companies.
Tory MPs expressed deep concern yesterday about the effect of impending cuts
in the defence budget, in spite of Mr Rifkind's assurances. Sir Nicholas
Bonsor, the Tory chairman of the Commons defence select committee, said he
wanted to see what Front Line First would show, but warned that sweeping
cuts in military support staff could reduce frontline effectiveness.
'We have to be very careful that we don't leave our troops unsupported,' he
said. 'We have to make sure that they have real back-up.'
Mr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, said: 'This is a whitewash, not
a white paper. The Tories are running scared on defence.'
But Mr Rifkind was supported by Sir Archie Hamilton, a former Tory defence
minister, who said: 'I am being constantly reassured that the the savings
are there.' But he said some proposals would face strong political
opposition.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
FRONT LINE FIRST: THE OPTIONS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Transport vehicles and aircraft leased rather than purchased

FT  27 APR 94 / Rosyth closure threatens 2000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Closure of Rosyth naval base in Fife would put 1,600 naval jobs and 400
civilian posts at risk. Its operations have been scaled back in recent years
and the small ships handled there may be transferred to Portsmouth. Rosyth
dockyard would not be affected.
The RAF's support services are also a target because maintenance of aircraft
is particularly labour-intensive and costly.
The Logistics Command employs 13,000 people and could be transferred to the
private sector. Some defence analysts, however, expect a substantially
slimmed-down operation to run in tandem with private-sector maintenance
companies. Other large manpower cuts might include slimming the Procurement
Executive, responsible for buying forces' equipment, and running down
medical and veterinary services.
Old inter-service rivalries may be challenged. Analysts think consolidating
all three staff colleges into a single base at Camberley would be logical.
Staff from the RAF headquarters at High Wycombe and the army headquarters at
Wilton may also be squeezed into a unified command at the Navy's base at
North-wood.
Smaller targets for the MoD knife may include chaplains and music.

FT  27 APR 94 / Orders soon for attack helicopters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If anyone expected more windfalls from the end of the cold war, those hopes
were dashed yesterday by a defence policy statement that committed Britain
to unflagging engagement in the defence of a fast-changing Europe.
It described the armed forces as a 'valuable and prestigious national asset'
which could not be surrendered without grave damage to the 'security and
reputation' of Britain.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is now firmly insisting that all
future savings in expenditure will neither eat into the country's fighting
strength nor rest on any over-hasty assumptions about diminishing risks.
Far from running down Britain's fighting strength, Mr Rifkind 'hoped for
some enhancement' in front-line capacity as a spin-off from the efficiency
drive now in progress. He emphasised the 'broad range of capabilities'
Britain could deploy.
The statement reaffirms Britain's commitment to a wide-ranging renewal of
its aircraft, helicopters and tanks. It also vigorously defends the
performance of the armed forces in Northern Ireland, noting that the
frequency of terrorist attacks is now only a fraction of the peak reached in
1972.
The paper's robust tone makes plain that the defence ministry has fought off
veiled suggestions from the Treasury that a major land war is now so
unlikely that Britain could dispense with much of its heavy armour.
It describes developments in Russia as 'perhaps the key factor' for British
security, and acknowledges that the evolution of that country is almost
impossible to predict. 'We will not know for many years to come whether it
will develop into an economically successful and stable democracy, and a
permanent friend,' it says.
Apart from endorsing the Partnership for Peace programme, which invites the
former Warsaw Pact nations to engage in military co-operation with Nato, the
document also lays stress on bilateral co-operation with eastern Europe.
It says Britain has plans for a joint exercise with Poland this year and may
hold one with Russia next year.
Ironically, the statement's release yesterday coincided with an announcement
from President Boris Yeltsin that he was turning against the idea of joint
military exercises with the US. On arms control issues, the paper commits
Britain to playing a 'positive and constructive role' in negotiations on a
test ban treaty though it had 'not been an entirely easy decision' to make.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, criticised the government's lack
of enthusiasm on this issue and said Britain should take the lead. He said
it made little sense for Britain to drag its feet over nuclear tests when it
could conduct them only with the goodwill of the US, which now favoured a
moratorium.
The main procurement plans the document reaffirms are:
The purchase of 259 more Challenger 2 tanks, the details of which are being
negotiated with Vickers.
Plans to purchase a fleet of up to 100 attack helicopters, for which six
tenders have been received; the Apache, produced by McDonnell Douglas, is
widely seen as a front-runner.
An order for about 45 support helicopters, to be divided between Boeing's
Chinook and the EH-101 made by Westland.
Plans to order more of the 'Trafalgar' class of nuclear submarine, which
will replace nuclear hunter-killers near the end of their operational life.
A tender for this is to be announced shortly.
Participation in the four-nation Eurofighter project, now in development;
Britain has repeatedly pledged to buy 250 of the new aircraft.

FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of civil servants resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Robin Butler, head of the civil service, is resisting an independent
survey of civil servants to find out if management changes have affected
morale or weakened the public-service ethos.
The survey has been proposed by the Commons Treasury and civil service
committee as part of its probe into the impact of the changes on the civil
service.
In the light of evidence in the arms-for-Iraq inquiry, the committee is
considering whether a statutory code of ethics is needed to protect civil
servants who are asked by ministers to behave unethically or mislead
parliament.
Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, has promised to consider the
idea. However, Sir Robin told the committee yesterday that he feared a
survey might prejudice the political neutrality of the civil service.
'The questions proposed go into matters of political controversy,' he said.
'The results could be used to bring the civil service into political debate
with the government on matters affecting the management of the civil
service.'
Mr Mike O'Brien, a Labour member of the committee, pointed out that a survey
of top civil servants by the Cabinet Office's efficiency unit had found a
strong belief that the public-sector ethos was being eroded. The committee
wanted to find out whether this opinion was held among the rest of the civil
service.
Sir Robin said that allowing a body outside the Whitehall management
structure to carry out a survey could have damaging consequences.
'If you seek to separate the civil service as an independent body of opinion
from ministers, then ministers will want to ensure sooner or later that that
body of opinion is amenable to them,' he warned. 'That will lead to the
politicisation of the civil service.'
He said that the committee should ask witnesses such as himself about the
state of morale. 'There is a good deal of evidence already available,' he
said.

FT  27 APR 94 / Schools feel the pinch as boarder numbers decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The numbers of boarders in UK schools dropped 5.2 per cent last year as
independent schools continued to be squeezed by the recession.
Following a fall of 6.2 per cent last year, boarding numbers have now
dropped by almost an eighth in two years. However, the Independent Schools
Information Service claimed that the figures, which it released yesterday,
heralded a 'sooner-than-expected recovery' because the number of day pupils
rose 0.1 per cent.
Total pupil numbers fell by 0.96 per cent following a drop of 1.5 per cent
last year.
Mr David Woodhead, director of Isis, said the impact of this month's tax
increases on parents' disposable incomes would now be critical to
recruitment for next September. He said: 'Tax is one of the great
imponderables . . . parents are looking at their choice of schools very
pragmatically.'
The decline was sharpest in boarding preparatory schools. Among boys there
was a drop of 13.4 per cent in 10-year-old boarders from 2,526 to 2,188,
while the number of boarding 11-year-olds fell 10.2 per cent to 3,467.
Mr Roy Chapman, headmaster of Malvern College and chairman of the
Headmasters' Conference, which represents the largest boys' schools, said:
'Boarding schools have to face up to the realities of the marketplace in a
way which they've never done before.'
He added that in those 'halcyon' days schools had 'leapfrogged' each other
to produce new capital developments. Spending on buildings and equipment
peaked in 1991. This year it was cut by 9.6 per cent, from Pounds 513 to
Pounds 468 per pupil.
Rising use of funds from the government's assisted-places scheme, and from
school bursaries and scholarships, emphasised the impact of the recession,
with 127,522 pupils - 27.3 per cent of the total - receiving some aid.
Take-up of the government scheme rose by a further 2.4 per cent, with a
record 32,307 pupils now receiving state help.
Nursery education was the only significant area of growth, with the number
of two-year-olds in independent schools rising 12 per cent from 3,082 to
3,452 while the number of 3-year-olds increased from 9,570 to 10,383.
Heavy marketing in the far east and eastern Europe led to a 10 per cent
increase in foreign pupils coming to the UK - to a record of 6,422 compared
with 5,859 last year. The numbers recruited from continental Europe rose
from 1,537 to 1,796, while recruits from the Far East outside Hong Kong
increased from 1,140 to 1,261.
The drop in numbers occurred in spite of a sharp fall in school fees
inflation, which at an average of 2.6 per cent rose less than national
average earnings for the first time since the survey began in 1983.
But Mr Michael Oakley, chairman of the Independent Schools Bursars'
Association, predicted that fees inflation might increase as private schools
would feel obliged at least to match the 2.9 per cent pay award for state
teachers.

FT  27 APR 94 / Smith hits out over tax 'waste'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Smith, Labour leader, yesterday accused the prime minister of a
'grotesque waste of taxpayers' money' in employing outside consultants at a
cost of more than Pounds 500m a year to produce savings of just Pounds 10m.
The government reacted defensively to Labour's charges, which followed a
report in the Financial Times on the findings of a Cabinet Office efficiency
unit report which has yet to be published.
Downing Street said the report had been commissioned because ministers were
concerned about consultancy spending, but stressed that it was still not
complete.
Mr Alan Milburn, chairman of Labour's backbench treasury committee,
published figures from ministerial answers showing that the transport
department alone had spent almost Pounds 200m on consultants last year. The
Scottish Office spent more than Pounds 100m and the Department of Trade and
Industry more than Pounds 29m.
During questions to the prime minister in the Commons, Mr Smith said
families paying a big rise in taxes would 'bitterly resent this further
example of this government's now legendary incompetence'.
Mr Major said: 'If there was an intention to hide anything, perhaps you
could explain why we established the scrutiny in the first place? It was
precisely to determine that the expenditure is conducted properly.
'If it confirms that the expenditure is producing good results we will
maintain it. If not we will make the changes required.'
Earlier, Sir Robin Butler, head of the civil service, said that it was right
for the government to investigate the value for money from spending 'very
large sums' on consultancy. 'It is creditable that the government is doing
this and that it will publish the results when it is completed,' he said.

FT  27 APR 94 / Senior Tories join ranks of the doubters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's document lists 31 separate areas of engagement for the forces.
But several ex-colonial duties (Belize, Bermuda, Hong Kong) are soon to
disappear, and if by 'breadth' Mr Rifkind means the geographical extension,
the fourth place in the global pecking order will not last long.
Some Tories say they are not convinced by Mr Rifkind's claim to appreciate
the value of breadth.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence committee, says the
government fails to see the advantages of deploying troops overseas.
'I am extremely angry about our withdrawal from Belize,' he said yesterday,
claiming that the UK was losing an important area of influence.
Sir Jerry Wiggin, Tory MP for Weston-super-Mare, said the quality of British
servicemen was enhanced by the wide range of locations in which they
operate.
'I would like to see our servicemen train in every climate and zone to which
they might be deployed,' he said.
Mingled with an attachment to the legacy of empire that is tinged with
sentiment, there is a more substantial point. Yesterday's document
repeatedly suggests that the quality of Britain's armed forces is one of its
principal assets in the international market-place.
To borrow a phrase coined by Mr Douglas Hurd, a high-performance army is one
of the things that enables Britain to 'punch above its weight' in world
affairs.
As Mr Michael Clark, director of the Centre for Defence Studies, points out,
this is a new argument for the defence establishment as it takes on the
Treasury. It is a strong argument: the selection of Britain to train South
Africa's new defence forces, and the prominence of British forces in Bosnia
are two recent examples of the prestige the UK has earned through the
pursuit of military excellence.
If defence chiefs can convince Whitehall that they represent one of
Britain's comparative advantages in the world, the UK can still play a role
far beyond its shores long after all its colonial business is finished.

FT  27 APR 94 / Settling for fourth place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK

<TEXT>
For much of the post-war period, British politicians have been embarrassed
to boast about their country's military prowess; but now Mr Malcolm Rifkind
has suggested to Britons, and above all to his own rightwing supporters, a
new source of pride - it might be dubbed the importance of being fourth.
'Only the United States, Russia and France can deploy as broad a range of
capabilities . . .' as Britain, Mr Rifkind said yesterday, in one of few
real sound-bites he had to offer reporters.
His definition of strength is a carefully chosen one: there are many
countries with far bigger land armies - Turkey, for example - and, by next
year, the Royal Navy's total of 35 main surface ships will leave Britain as
little better than a middle-ranking sea power.
However, the basis for his statement is clear enough. By retaining its
submarine-based nuclear deterrent, a land army in Europe and a host of minor
ex-colonial commitments, Britain can certainly claim to be carrying out an
extraordinarily wide range of duties for a country of its size.
Yesterday's document lists 31 separate areas of engagement for the British
armed force: from the Falkland Islands to Belize to Gibraltar to Hong Kong.
But several of the ex-colonial commitments are due to disappear imminently,
and if by 'breadth' Mr Rifkind is referring simply to the geographical
extension of Britain's commitment, then the country will not hold its fourth
place for long.
Britain will soon withdraw land forces from Belize and Berlin and and its
naval presence in Bermuda is also due for the axe. By 1997 it must quit Hong
Kong.
Mr Michael Clark, director of the Centre for Defence Studies, points out
that the document confuses two things: the fact that Britain retains some
minor colonial commitments, which are an accident of history, and the fact
that Britain is still highly respected for the quality of its armed forces.
The reputation of the British military should ensure the country a role  -
in training, peace-keeping and as an arms exporter - far beyond its shores.

FT  27 APR 94 / Review fails to calm fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY

<TEXT>
Few of the uncertainties hanging over the UK's armed forces were resolved by
the white paper yesterday.
The results of Front Line First, the review of defence costs ordered after
the last Budget, will not be published until the end of July, said Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary.
The review is aimed primarily at saving money in the armed forces support
staff and should not affect fighting strength. But base closures,
privatisation of some services and up to 20,000 job losses are expected.
Rosyth naval base in Fife could face closure under the review, putting at
risk 1,600 naval jobs and 400 civilian posts. Its operations have been
scaled back in recent years and the small ships handled there may be
transferred to Portsmouth. Rosyth dockyard would not be affected.
The RAF's support services are also a target because maintainance of
aircraft is particularly labour-intensive and costly.
The Logistics Command employs 13,000 people and could be transferred to the
private sector. Some defence analysts, however, expect a substantially
slimmed-down operation to run in tandem with private-sector maintenance
companies. Other large manpower cuts might include slimming the Procurement
Executive, responsible for buying forces' equipment, and running down
medical and veterinary services.
Leasing vehicles is another possibility. The initiative is unlikely to
extend as far as tanks and the armed forces' stock of 90,000 cars, Land
Rovers and trucks may not be attractive to the private sector. But new
batches of vehicles may be leased from private companies, which would also
be responsible for maintenance.
Old inter-service rivalries may be challenged. Analysts think consolidating
all three staff colleges into a single base at Camberley would be logical.
Staff from the RAF headquarters at High Wycombe and the Army HQ at Wilton
may also be squeezed into a unified command at the Navy's base at Northwood.
Smaller targets for the MoD knife may include chaplains and music, though
both may arose strong sentiments. Regimental bands have been protected
before and privatising spiritual support may also face opposition from
Conservative backbenchers. The review team even has a working party studying
the cost of armed forces regulations.
Mr Rifkind yesterday acknowledged that it was a time of uncertainty for
armed forces support personnel, though he emphasised that cuts would not
compromise the effectiveness of front-line forces.
If the review produced savings beyond the Pounds 750m a year by 1997
required by the Treasury, then the Ministry of Defence would be able to
spend the money on improvements to fighting forces.

FT  27 APR 94 / Insurer to step up direct selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Accident, one of the UK's largest insurance companies, is to step up
its direct sales operation following research indicating that as many as six
out of 10 customers are prepared to buy home and motor insurance by
telephone.
The company is to recruit an extra 110 staff to the Glasgow offices of its
telephone sales operation, General Accident Direct, and increase spending on
advertising.
Direct insurers, which sell through media advertising and telephone sales,
account for about 20 per cent of the motor insurance market, according to
industry figures.
GA's research, carried out by NOP, shows that 53 per cent of women and 63
per cent of men are happy to arrange insurance by telephone, indicating that
the market share of direct writers and new telephone brokers could rise
rapidly.
A number of leading UK insurance companies have recently set up telephone
operations, but the industry still depends on independent brokers and other
retailers for many of its sales.
Direct Line, the market leader, already insures more than 1.4m motorists,
more than 7 per cent of the UK market, and is increasing its share of the
home insurance market.
'We sense that the market is poised to go the same way in home as it has in
motor,' said Ms Avril Scanlan, the manager of General Accident Direct,
reporting a rise in the number of telephone enquiries for home insurance. Ms
Scanlan said that after sharp price rises, home insurance had become a
'high-profile item on people's shopping lists'.

FT  27 APR 94 / Banknote thieves told to pay Pounds 1/2 m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England yester-day won its High Court action against three
former employees whose families it claimed had been living the 'life of
Riley' on more than Pounds 500,000 stolen from its banknote destruction
depot.
But it was believed last night that the Crown Prosecution Service had ruled
out criminal action against Mrs Christine Gibson, 44, Mr Kenneth Longman,
34, and Mr Michael Nairne, 39, because there was insufficient hard evidence
to secure a conviction.
Judge Norman Rudd ruled that the three had systematically stolen cash from
the depot at Debden, Essex, between 1988 and 1992.
He said they had been fully aware of where the money had come from. Their
explanations for their extravagant lifestyles were 'wholly incredible and
totally unsupported'.
It was alleged that Mrs Gibson had smuggled thousands of pounds out of the
depot by stuffing it into her underwear.
Mrs Gibson's husband, Mr Peter Gibson, who the Bank claimed had never done
an honest day's work in his life, sniggered and said 'prat' as the judge
gave his finding.
He ordered the Gibsons to return Pounds 250,000, the Longmans Pounds 150,000
and the Nairnes Pounds 110,000. Enforcement of the judgment was suspended
for 28 days pending an appeal and the Bank was granted a continuation of
asset-freezing orders against the three families.
The families, who are all from Loughton, Essex, were also ordered to pay
costs estimated at Pounds 400,000. The costs order against the Longmans and
the Nairnes was not to be enforced without leave of the court as they were
on legal aid.
Another former Bank employee, Mr Kevin Winwright, admitted three counts of
theft totalling Pounds 170,000 and was jailed for 18 months in January 1993.

FT  27 APR 94 / Virgin considering Channel 5 bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Virgin group is working on plans for a new general entertainment
television channel and has expressed interest in launching it on Channel 5.
Mr Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin Communications, confirmed yesterday
that he had had talks with the Independent Television Commission about the
possibility of bidding for the franchise.
The ITC has said it would like to decide at its May meeting whether to
advertise a Channel 5 franchise, but is waiting to hear from the government
whether the necessary franchises will be made available.
A complex debate is going on within the government on the extent to which a
Channel 5 using existing analogue technology would impinge on the future
development of digital terrestrial television.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, has made it clear he hopes to
have the government's verdict in time for an ITC decision next month.
Three significant groups have now been publicly identified as potential
bidders for the channel, which could reach about 70 per cent of the UK
population.
The others are NBC, the US network company, and a consortium grouping Time
Warner, MAI - the company that owns Meridian and Anglia Television - and
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.
Mr Devereux stressed yesterday that the level of his interest would depend
on the size of the bill for retuning video recorders likely to face
interference from the Channel 5 signal.
The main target audience for the Virgin television channel would be under 40
 -similar to that for Virgin 1215, the Virgin national commercial radio
station.
Mr Devereux said a launch on satellite had not been ruled out if Channel 5
did not go ahead.

FT  27 APR 94 / BBC in Polish radio application
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BBC World Service Radio has teamed up with GWR, the Bristol-based commercial
radio group, to apply for a commercial radio licence in Warsaw, Raymond
Snoddy writes.
It is believed to be the first collaboration between a language section of
the BBC World Service and a UK commercial broadcaster.
Under Polish law foreign broadcasters are only allowed to hold a 33 per cent
stake. The two British broadcasters would team up with Zycie Warszawy, the
Warsaw daily newspaper.
GWR, through a subsidiary, Central European Broadcasting - which already has
an interest in a Prague radio station - would probably take a one-third
stake. The BBC would have an option for 10 per cent of that stake. Its main
role, through its Polish section, would be as a news and programme supplier.
The decision on the licence is expected next month.

FT  27 APR 94 / 'Spectacular incompetence' alleged at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's underwriters were guilty of 'incompetence on a spectacular scale' it
was alleged yesterday on the opening day of the UK's biggest legal action to
date, brought by loss-making Lloyd's Names.
Mr Geoffrey Vos QC, representing 3,095 lossmaking Gooda Walker Names, told
Mr Justice Phillips that underwriters had 'wholly ignored the basic, obvious
and accepted principles of the reinsurance market'.
The Gooda Names are seeking compensation of some Pounds 629m from 71
members' agents who placed them with four syndicates formerly managed by the
Gooda Walker agency. The syndicates specialised in catastrophe reinsurance
business, reinsuring other reinsurance companies and Lloyd's syndicates. The
underwriters either 'didn't know the scale of their likely exposures' or had
'wholly ignored it', alleged Mr Vos. They bought 'inadequate' reinsurance
protection and were overwhelmed by losses from a series of catastrophes -
ranging from the Piper oil rig explosion to hurricane Hugo - between 1987
and 1990.
Total losses of the four syndicates - 164, 290, 298 and 299 - in seven
separate years of account amount to more than Pounds 850m.
The outcome of the case, likely to last three months, is expected to be a
pointer to the prospects of thousands more Names planning similar action. A
case by nearly 2,000 Feltrim Names, who were also placed on reinsurance
syndicates, is scheduled to begin in the autumn.
Lloyd's losses since 1988 amount to more than Pounds 7bn. The market expects
next month to report a loss of more than Pounds 2bn for the 1991 year of
account.
'The claim is simple,' explained Mr Vos. 'The plaintiffs allege that each of
the underwriters fell below the standards to be expected of a reasonably
competent underwriter.'
The losses of each of the four syndicates were wholly 'disproportionate'
both in relation to the profits received by Names in earlier years and the
rest of the market. In 1989 the four syndicates' total losses of Pounds 685m
accounted for about 30 per cent of the market's overall loss.
'The aim of reinsurance is to spread the loss. The Gooda Walker syndicates
succeeded in concentrating a large part of the market's losses on their
Names,' added Mr Vos.
'It would be charitable to describe these underwriting methods as gambling,
(but) a roulette player at least knows how much he has put on the table and
how much he can lose.'

FT  27 APR 94 / BBC close to launching European news service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC is close to launching a 24-hour television news and information
service to add to its existing channel in continental Europe.
Mr Bob Phillis, the BBC deputy director-general, yesterday told a conference
organised by Voice of the Listener and Viewer, the pressure group, that he
hoped the new channel could be launched by the end of this year.
No agreement has been signed but Mr Phillis said talks were under way with a
number of potential partners and had made 'significant progress'.
The channel is believed to be primarily designed to serve audiences in
continental Europe. It would be similar to those brought to Asia, Africa and
the Middle East by BBC World Service Television.
WSTV will soon be beamed into Japan, and an Arab-language version aimed at
the Middle East will begin broadcasting on the Arabsat satellite from the
end of June. In the Middle East deal the BBC will be the programme supplier.
Mr Phillis, who is also head of the World Service, emphasised that the BBC's
editorial control was protected by contract and that if editorial
independence were threatened the BBC had the right to terminate the
contract.
Mr Phillis told the conference that in a more competitive broadcasting world
it was the BBC's duty to supplement licence-fee income - so long as
commercial activities did not conflict with the corporation's core purpose.
He promised that commercial activities would never determine what programmes
were to be made.
The Voice of the Listener and Viewer yesterday decided to write to Mr
Marmaduke Hussey, the chairman of the BBC, expressing dissatisfaction with
BBC Radio.

FT  27 APR 94 / BCCI official 'withheld data'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An official with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
helped to boost the bank's profits artificially by almost Dollars 250m by
manipulating loan accounts, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.
Mr Anthony Evans QC, prosecuting, said Mr Imran Imam, who was an account
officer at BCCI's London headquarters, also withheld crucial information
from Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors, which allowed a false picture of
BCCI's profitability to be presented to the outside world.
Mr Imam is charged with six offences including two of conspiring to conceal
documents, three of furnishing false information and one of conspiring to
falsify records. He denies all the charges.
Mr Evans said that Mr Imam worked alongside the two most important men in
BCCI - Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, its former president, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, its
former chief executive.
Although junior to both men, Mr Imam played an important role in the
multi-million-dollar fraud which led to the bank's collapse, he said.
In one part of the alleged fraud, Mr Imam was involved in inflating profits
by falsifying documents relating to loans apparently made to eight wealthy
individuals, Mr Evans said.
These loans were not genuine, he continued. Shares in the Dutch
Antilles-based company Credit and Commerce American Holdings, which were
used as security for the loans, were held by the individuals only as
nominees. Mr Imam was aware of this and failed to report it. Documents also
showed that BCCI never expected the loans to be repaid.
However, the bank's accounts showed that between 1982 and 1989 Dollars 500m
was charged to the bank in the form of interest and fees, Mr Evans said. Of
this, Dollars 248m was charged between 1987 and 1989, the period covered by
the charges against Mr Imam.
The trial continues today.

FT  27 APR 94 / Clergy income reform planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New ways of financing pensions for Church of England clergy will be proposed
later this year following an Pounds 800m decline in the Church
Commissioners' income-producing assets, the Commons social security
committee was told yesterday.
Dr George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, and other church leaders faced
questioning by the committee as part of its inquiry into the operation of
pension funds.
Under existing arrangements, the commissioners finance clergy pensions out
of annual income.
However Mr Phillip Mawer, secretary-general of the Church of England general
synod, told the committee that if this arrangement continued, pension
liabilities were likely to consume the commissioners' entire asset income by
2010.
The alternative of a contributory scheme is being considered. Present
thinking, said Mr Mawer, was that dioceses rather than individual clergy
should make the contributions.
Dr Carey gave a firm undertaking that the church had 'resources to manage
the pension issue'. Clergy pension rights were not in danger.
The Church of England is being forced to raise more money from parishes
following the heavy decline in the commissioners' assets, due largely to
over exposure in property investments. Dr Carey said that a Financial Times
report which first detailed the commissioners' difficulties two years ago
had been a 'stunning blow to many of us', although he had been aware to some
degree of the seriousness of the problem before that.

FT  27 APR 94 / Free-market gunslingers lose their fire: A look at an
organisation true to its code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Institute of Directors prepares for a change of leadership, Britain's
main organisation for business leaders is stoical about its future.
The organisation which chose 'thriving on change' as the theme for
yesterday's annual convention has no plans to do so. The event was only just
saved from being a flop by the vigour of the mid-afternoon speech by Mr
Peter Morgan, the outgoing director-general.
Last year's affair was a hard act to follow, with Mr Bill Gates of Microsoft
among speakers who pulled in some 3,200 delegates. This year's poor
attendance - fewer than the 2,800 delegates registered - was evidence of a
deeper problem for the IoD.
A standard bearer for enterprise, the free market and free trade, the IoD
was in its prime during the Thatcher era. But whereas in the 1980s it was
pushing on an open door in its pleas for de-regulation, it is now meeting
more resistance.
With a member seconded to the Department of Trade and Industry to explore
and promote ways of cutting regulation, the IoD claims it is still scoring
victories for its small-business constituency.
But it admits that the climate has changed. What it disputes is that the
change has made it redundant.
'We are not in a popularity contest,' says Mr Gordon Leak, head of media
communications. 'We are there to represent our members. The political
pendulum is not a factor in the IoD's thinking - principles are.'
The change makes its lobbying function more necessary rather than less so,
it argues. But, more than that, it believes that the nature of the recovery
is going to raise its profile as an educator and promoter of small business.
'Employment in the private sector will never be the same again,' Mr Morgan
declared yesterday, echoing the IoD belief that growth is going to rest
principally on a rise in entrepreneurs.
Where the IoD differs from the resurgent Confederation of British Industry,
it says, is in the IoD's emphasis on the individual.
Its members certainly believe that to be the case. 'The IoD represents the
small businessman, where the CBI is more the organisation for big business
like the ICIs - although the CBI would deny this,' said one delegate
yesterday.
In spite of such loyalty, the IoD has come off the boil, with membership of
about 33,000 in Britain and 48,000 worldwide, down about 5,000 from its
peak. But recruitment is picking up and the IoD can expect to lose fewer
members to bankruptcy.
Holding true to the faith, its loyal core may argue in stronger and stronger
tones that being out in the cold makes the organisation's voice ever more
necessary, but it is also likely to make the annual convention ever more of
a fringe event.

The National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade body, is to
fund an independent inquiry into long-term pension provision and has pledged
to publish its findings even if they could harm its members' interests.
Mr Ron Amy, association chairman, said it was making the unusual move
because 'there is a danger that vested interest and ideology will drive the
debate about pensions; the purpose is to make sure that the policy formation
process is well-informed.'
Mr Amy said the government's drive to promote personal pensions 'was about
making everybody into mini-capitalists,' and did not sufficiently consider
whether it was achieving better pension coverage for the lowest cost.
Mr Amy did not disclose the cost of the inquiry, which will be headed by Sir
John Anson, former second permanent secretary to the Treasury, who retired
in 1990.
Sir John said yesterday: 'Today's decisions on pensions policy will affect
those who retire in the first half of the next century. The purpose of the
inquiry is to consider whether changes need to be made to provide a stable
and affordable structure for pension provision in the long term which will
enable people to make informed choices with confidence.'
Among the inquiry board's members are Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the
Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has recommended ending the provision
that allows for a tax-free lump sum to be available on retirement. The
association has strongly opposed this.
Also taking part are Mr Terry Banks, chief researcher on a report for the
Carnegie Institute on old age; Lady Wilcox, who chairs the National Consumer
Council; Mr John Harris, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses; Mr
Roger Lyons, general secretary of the MSF general technical union; and Mr
Giovanni Tambur, co-ordinator of the European Commission Observation Network
of Occupational Pensions.
The review will consider the roles taken in the industry of the state,
employers and individuals.

The UK has emerged as the favoured site for the first international research

'The UK is becoming the centre of the European pharmaceuticals industry,'
said Dr Masahiko Fujino, general manager of Takeda's discovery research
division. 'We are looking at other European locations but the UK is most
suitable.'
The initial investment would be small, perhaps Y300m (Pounds 1.95m), said Dr

FT  27 APR 94 / Ticket agencies aim to curb touts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ticket agencies plan a self-regulating organisation to curb touting and deal
with complaints, Tim Burt writes.
Executives from some of the largest agencies have drafted a code of practice
and proposed a Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers to improve the
industry's reputation. They said action needed to be taken against touts
charging exorbitant prices and pledged to curb intimidation and forgeries.
Under the code of practice, up to 4,000 ticket outlets would agree to 10
pages of regulations covering items such as 'fair value', booking fees and
compensation, funded from annual fees paid by agencies adopting the code.
The move follows frustration among theatre owners and event promoters that
the government has decided to make touting illegal only for football
matches.
Agencies said the code would be recognised by the Office of Fair Trading and
the Department of Trade and Industry.

FT  27 APR 94 / Young hits at Europe 'obsession': IoD convention opens to
poor attendance; Regulation causes despair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British society is being divided by a futile obsession with Europe while its
industrial advantage evaporates, Lord Young warned the Institute of
Directors annual convention yesterday.
The IoD president said the European Union was wasting its time 'in
inward-looking arguments about lost causes' while the economies of Asia were
set to become larger than those of Europe and North America within six
years.
'By the millennium, the number of Asian households with an income of Dollars
30,000 or more will rise to 50m. How many homes in the UK have an income
that high? Perhaps 3m and not more than 4m. Out there is a fast-growing
market, perhaps 15 times greater than our own home market, for luxury and
quality goods.'
Yet the EU was 'fiddling whilst the Treaty of Rome burned', worrying over
causes such as single currencies and political union.
Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, echoed Lord Young's sentiments in an
attack on the German social market and French economic nationalism. Mr
Morgan said Europe needed to change its wasteful regional, agricultural and
industrial policies radically if it was to meet the challenges of the
emerging markets.
Both speakers emphasised the need for de-regulation in Europe, but Lord
Young was particularly concerned over failure to remove trade barriers.
Reflecting the feeling among many of the Institute's members that Europe was
marginalising itself through over-regulation, Lord Young said the EU
intergovernmental conference in 1996 was 'probably our last chance to wake
up before the world passes us by'.
'It could take an axe to the institutions of the union and let in the spirit
of enterprise. It could make a bonfire of directives and give real meaning
to subsidiarity,' he said.
'Even the IMF has woken up to what we now have to do. Last week, they called
for the EU to reverse two decades of rising unemployment by reforming
employment protections, minimum wage laws, and unemployment insurance
schemes,' said Lord Young.
'We are now at a crossroads,' he said. With Asia emerging as the new centre
of gravity for commerce, it was 'high time' for British business to capture
markets.
Lord Young also appeared confident about the future of relations with Hong
Kong. 'I met the president of China less than two weeks ago and he told me
that nothing would affect business relationships with the UK,' he said.

FT  27 APR 94 / Inflation pressures tamed, says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few signs of overheating or inflationary pressures in the UK economy appear
in the latest quarterly trends survey from the Confederation of British
Industry.
The proportion of companies working below capacity rose slightly to 59 per
cent this month from 57 per cent in January, while 92 per cent had
sufficient capacity to meet expected demand.
'The outlook for inflation remains positive, with no sign of cost and price
pressures emerging,' said Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic
affairs committee. The same number of companies reported that unit costs had
fallen during the past four months as reported an increase, and only a
balance of 2 percentage points expected a rise in costs over the next four
months.
A balance of 1 percentage point said domestic prices had fallen over the
past four months, and there was the same balance for companies expecting
prices to fall further over the next four months. The CBI calculates most of
its figures by subtracting the percentage of companies expecting a decline
in a variable from those reporting an increase, and by then expressing the
result as a balance.
The CBI also found that companies had been cutting their export prices. This
runs counter to official figures which appear to have shown that exporters
have been increasing prices. Mr Sudhir Junankar, associate director of
economic affairs, said the CBI was comfortable with its figures, which had
been prepared on a consistent basis - unlike the official trade figures
which recently introduced the Intra-stat system.
Figures for output and orders were positive, with the balance of 16
percentage points reporting higher total orders during the past four months
being the best figure since January 1989. 'As yet, there is no sign of
manufacturing output faltering in the face of the tax increases introduced
at the start of this month,' the CBI said. However, growth in output and
orders was at a slightly lower rate than had been expected when the sur-vey
was last conducted in January. British companies are making significant
progress towards world-class status, says a report out today, Graham Bowley
writes.
Researchers from the London Business School interviewed 21 manufacturing
companies including Shell UK, Rover Group and Courtaulds to find out if, and
how, British-based companies are striving to become world-class.
They found that all the companies they visited had achieved substantial
improvements over the past five years across a range of performance
indicators such as productivity and customer service.

FT  27 APR 94 / Howard blames lawlessness on parents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY, JENNY LUESBY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday accused parents, teachers
and social workers of failing to instil into children respect for authority
and the difference between right and wrong. He told the delegates at the IoD
convention yesterday: 'Clearly these failures create conditions in which
crime and law-breaking can thrive.'
Mr Howard, defending his controversial criminal justice bill to business
leaders ahead of its second reading in the House of Commons, insisted that
there was no specific evidence directly linking rising unemployment to
rising crime, and urged inner-city small businesses to co-operate more fully
with police.
His speech sparked a political row, with one MP denouncing him as 'bonkers'
while another said he was right and parents should be punished for their
children's crimes.
Mr Howard said the contentious aspects of his bill, including secure
training centres for young offenders and a weakening of the right to silence
in custody, would remain part of the bill. He also defended stronger powers
for courts including tougher sentences.
Mrs Alice Mahon, Labour MP for Halifax, said: 'His ability to lay the blame
with anyone else except himself is breathtaking. Just to blame parents is
ludicrous and shows how bonkers he is.'
But Mr Terry Dicks, Tory MP for Hayes and Harlington, said: 'If parents were
made responsible for the crimes of their children, juvenile crime would drop
overnight. Some parents should be sent to prison for the sins of their
offspring.'
Last night Mr Howard called on the Commons to overturn a key change made by
the House of Lords to the police and magistrates' courts bill.
He accepted most of the amendments made when the government was defeated in
the Lords during sustained attacks on the bill, but insisted that their
refusal to accept planned new procedures for weeding out unsatisfactory
police officers could not be allowed to stand.
He also gave notice that MPs would be asked to reverse an amendment made by
the Lords which would prevent disciplinary proceedings being brought against
officers in respect of matters for which they had been tried and acquitted
in the criminal courts.

FT  27 APR 94 / Mobile phone network gets the Orange light: Hutchison
Microtel is back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hutchison Microtel makes its second attempt to carve out a share of the UK
mobile telephone market this week.
Tomorrow it launches Orange, a personal communications network, promising a
broad range of services made possible by digital - computer-based -
transmission. The launch comes just six months after the company wrote off
Pounds 100m by ending its low-cost Rabbit mobile service.
Orange will be Britain's fourth mobile phone network after Vodafone, the
largest, and Cellnet - both of which use analogue transmission - and Mercury
One-2-One, which pioneered digital transmission in the UK but is still
limited essentially to the London area. It plans to extend to the 30 largest
conurbations by 1996.
Hutchison Telecom, owned 65 per cent by Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa,
30 per cent by British Aerospace and 5 per cent by Barclays Bank, will
target the million or so small and medium-sized businesses which do not yet
use mobile phones.
Orange has become the largest single investment in telecommunications for
the Hong Kong group. Mr Hans Snook, group managing director for Hutchison
Telecom (UK) said investment to the end of this year, when the service
should reach 70 per cent of the UK population, would be Pounds 450m.
Some 900 base stations, filing-cabinet-sized pieces of equipment to receive
and transmit calls, were in place and a further 550 sites had been bought.
He said the peak funding requirement, including all capital expenditure,
operating expenditure and operational losses would be about Pounds 700m.
Break-even is planned for 1997.
Much will depend on the tariff structure, to be announced tomorrow. Mercury
One-2-One is widely credited with creating the breakthrough in mobile
telephony for domestic users by offering free local calls in the evenings
and at weekends, but Mr Snook says Orange will not follow suit.
'I do not see One-2-One as a competitor,' he said. 'It is still a regional
operator. It is going to grow but it takes an average of 15 months to
acquire, equip and commission a base station site. When I look at where we
are now and where I understand One-2-One is, they are about 18 months
behind. Our biggest competitor is Vodafone followed by Cellnet.'
Mr Snook said his chief aim was to broaden the market: 'If there are still
four operators in the market by 2000, I would be happy with a 25 per cent
share.' He thought the market for domestic use would not grow substantially
until the end of 1995 or 1996.
Orange handsets double as radio pagers and have screens which can display
messages. Each handset can support two telephone lines distinguished by
different ringing tones. Their batteries support more than an hour's
continuous conversation.

FT  27 APR 94 / Howard criticises Lords on police bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard,the home secretary, last night called on the Commons to
overturn a key change made by the House of Lords to the controversial police
and magistrates' courts bill.
He accepted most of the amendments made when the government was defeated in
the Lords during sustained attacks on the bill, but insisted that their
refusal to accept new procedures for weeding out unsatisfactory police
officers could not be allowed to stand.
Mr Howard said the existing system did not allow police managers to review
an officer's behaviour and performance as a whole and this was 'totally
unacceptable'.
He also gave notice that MPs would be asked to reverse an amendment made by
the Lords which would prevent disciplinary proceedings being brought against
officers in respect of matters for which they had been tried and acquitted
in the criminal courts.
In a concession to the Lords Mr Howard said that police would continue to
have the right to be legally represented if they were at risk of dismissal,
forced resignation or facing a reduction in rank.
Mr Howard also bowed to the Lords in keeping the rank of chief inspector
while abolishing that of chief superintendent. This change was aimed at
securing a less top-heavy management structure.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's shadow home secretary, said the bill, although
'severely mauled' by the Lords, had not been changed nearly enough.

FT  27 APR 94 / South Africa Votes: Soweto's elderly finally come of age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PATTI WALDMEIR

<DATELINE>
   SOWETO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Lena Tshabalala, 85, voted for the first time yesterday.
Nearly 350 years after European settlers landed in the Cape, 72 years after
the founding of the African National Congress, 46 years after the National
party took power, and nearly five years after Mr Nelson Mandela walked to
freedom, black South Africans by the hundreds of thousands went to the polls
to choose the party that would govern them.
Mrs Tshabalala, seated on the grassy green verge at the entrance to the
Soweto Home for the Aged, had no doubt as to where the credit for this
historic day lay.
'First, Jesus,' she said. 'Second, Nelson Mandela.'
Did outgoing President F W de Klerk deserve any credit? In a tone of steely
Christian charity, Mrs Tshabalala delivered her judgment. 'We shall pray for
Mr de Klerk.' Fellow voter Mrs Monica Hancock concurred: 'It wasn't him. It
was that poor old man who suffered in jail for so many years.'
Behind them stretched a queue whose dignity transcended their afflictions.
Arthritic and crippled, elderly and infirm, many wrapped in blankets and
wearing bedroom slippers, hundreds waited to cast their 'special votes' in
South Africa's first all-race elections. They stood hunched over canes,
obviously suffering from the long delays which had already kept them
standing in the sun for several hours. The Independent Electoral Commission,
charged with running the elections, appeared to have made few concessions to
the fact that all the voters for yesterday's polling were either elderly,
infirm, handicapped or heavily pregnant.
Only a handful of chairs, no water or first aid facilities were provided.
One old woman, close to tears with the strain of standing, pleaded with a
white woman journalist to vote on her behalf.
'I'm so tired. Take my dompas,' she said, holding out the hated 'passbook'
which today serves as an identity card for voting, but was used to keep
blacks out of cities in the bad old days of apartheid. 'Do it for me.'
Several hundred yards further back in the queue, the complaints were
vociferous. 'Nothing has been done. They're not doing their job,' said one
woman forcefully, as the queue seemed never to advance toward the polls.
Polling was due to finish at the Soweto home at 2pm, but by 11am only a
fraction of the queue had voted.
Elsewhere in Soweto were countless similar queues, outside primary schools,
hospitals and old age homes, waiting under blue skies on a crisp autumn day.
At Baragwanath Hospital, the massive public hospital which serves Soweto's
3m people, queues of patients in hospital gowns and nurses in uniform also
waited their turn to vote.
But electoral officials said they would probably have to abandon plans to
carry ballot boxes from bed to bed, to allow critically ill patients to
vote.
They simply hadn't got the staff.
Back at the Soweto Home for the Aged, Monica Hancock spoke for many.
'We never thought this day would come. It's a miracle,' she said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Capping a volatile run-up to South Africa's first all-race elections, which
has at various times seen the Johannesburg stock exchange hit new highs and
the currency crash to record lows, the markets reacted with palpable relief
to the start of voting as the industrial index closed 226 points up at a new
all-time high of 6,257, a rise of nearly 4 per cent on the day.
In a wave of across-the-board buying, the market shrugged off news of the
rash of bombings round the country, and a bomb threat to the exchange
itself, as some blue-chip shares rose as much as 10 per cent. The gold
index, which has been under pressure from a weaker bullion price, rose 60
points to 1,906, while the overall index closed at 5,240, a rise of 172
points.
The financial rand, the currency used for transactions by non-residents and
the best barometer of foreign sentiment, also had a good day, closing at
R4.68 to the dollar, 5 per cent up on Monday and nearly 20 per cent up on
the record low of R5.71 reached only three weeks ag - after the initial
failure of talks to bring Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party
into the election.
The commercial rand, the trading currency, strengthened to R3.58 from
R3.614, while long bond yields dipped further to 12.69 per cent from a
recent high of 13.39 per cent reached after the summit failure.
There had been concern among dealers that news of bomb blasts in
Johannesburg and the nearby town of Germiston might cause jittery foreign
investors to sell their holdings, but when it was clear that no one was
panicking both local and international buyers started looking around for
bargains. 'The market seems to have decided that the election was going to
take place whatever happened, so people who were a little underinvested
wanted to get on board,' said Mr Richard Jesse of stockbroker Martin and Co.
The business community seems to have already discounted the possibility of
right-wing violence, regarding unrest as inevitable but unlikely to have a
serious bearing on political or economic events. Despite the upbeat mood,
analysts agree that the market is still largely driven by political factors,
and will continue to be jumpy until the final results are known and business
can begin to come to terms with the economic policies of the new government.
'The key phrase is still cautious optimism,' said Mr Tony Twine, an
economist at consultant Econometrix. He said business was relieved to have
reached the election, but will wait to see 'the new set of rules' and who
the main players will be.

FT  27 APR 94 / South Africa Votes: Expatriates join in creating real
homeland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Outside their embassy in Trafalgar Square, the queue of South Africans
stretched around the block. Their wait to enter the polling booths was
lightened by cheers and chanting as anti-apartheid luminaries arrived, and
by a dose of spring sunshine which would not have been felt amiss in the
Cape.
The line, one of dozens in cities around the world yesterday, comprised
visitors to London and expatriates. The all-race poll was the final step in
eradicating that bleak and previously numerous third category: no one needed
any longer to call themselves exiles.
Although the embassy was only one of seven polling stations in the UK,
nearly 8,000 voters were thought to have passed through its doors alone.
One of their number was Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, president of the
Anti-Apartheid Movement, who pronounced the election 'a miracle - I truly
believe it has been miraculous.'
Afterwards, in an embassy library with walls bearing the coats of arms of
colonists Dutch and British, and shelves of bound records of the white
parliament since union in 1910, the 80-year-old archbishop said he would
'never ever forgive the evil of apartheid'.
While branding as 'traitors' those whites who opposed change, he said a new
administration, led by Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, for
which he had voted, 'must be a government of all South Africans.'
The first South African to cast a vote yesterday, in Wellington, New
Zealand, was Ms Nomaza Paintin, a niece of Mr Mandela. South Africans form
one of the largest immigrant groups in New Zealand. There was an upsurge of
last-minute interest among the South African community in Australia, which
at some 60,000 ranks alongside that of the UK. Local newspapers there and in
other countries had run advertisements on behalf of the Independent
Electoral Commission publicising the poll.
The 700 or so South Africans in Hong Kong turned out in such force that the
consulate ran out of ballot papers. Among those who managed to vote was Ms
Elizabeth Dikgale, a domestic helper who is the only Zulu resident in the
colony. 'South Africa is a golden country, and now we can get back to golden
times,' she said.
The 20,000 or so Jewish South Africans who have emigrated to Israel find
themselves caught between two peace processes, each of which has taken a
heavy toll in violence. But as one in the long queue to vote at Tel Aviv
Show Grounds put it: 'If the whites and blacks in South Africa can get it
together, we should be able to do it here too.'
Pockets of South Africans elsewhere in Africa were also able to vote, even
though full diplomatic relations with much of the continent do not yet
exist.
The polling station for Kenya was a sports club in the outskirts of Nairobi
where Mrs Nomtha Nkolombe, a 62-year-old physiotherapist who left Cape Town
30 years ago, said: 'It is an opportunity both my parents missed.'
In New York, two polling stations were set up in tents on a lawn outside the
United Nations building. One white voter maintained: 'Every South African I
know will be voting today. This is one hell of a vote.'
That much is indisputable. It was taking two to three hours in the Trafalgar
Square queue yesterday to get to vote. Some, however, had been waiting all
their lives.

A China Airlines aircraft bound from Taipei in Taiwan to Nagoya in western
Japan crashed and exploded yesterday in Japan's second worst airline
disaster.
Officials said 261 people died and 10 survived when the Airbus A300-600R
plunged headlong into the grass to the right of the runway at Nagoya Airport
and burst into flames. Rescuers searching the charred wreckage took nine
hours to account for the last people missing after the accident.
Of the passengers, 158 were Japanese, 63 Taiwanese and 33 were of other
nationalities, officials said. The immediate cause of the disaster was not
known but airport control confirmed weather conditions were moderate and the
view clear at the time.
Witnesses said that the Airbus, whose wheels were not visible, approached
the airport's runway, then suddenly turned its nose upwards as if to take
off, before plunging within seconds almost at a 90-degree angle into the
ground. The aircraft was scattered into bits across several hundred metres
and the parts burst into a sea of flames which burned for 40 minutes as
rescue teams tried to free passengers trapped inside.
Airbus said last night three engineers had left for Nagoya. It declined to
comment on possible causes of the accident, but said it was the first
A300-600R to have crashed.
Japan's worst air disaster was on August 12 1985 when a Japan Air Lines
Boeing 747 crashed into a mountain north-east of Tokyo, killing 520.

FT  27 APR 94 / Land hoarders under fire from HK bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's largest financial institution yesterday implicitly criticised
property developers for hoarding land but warned the government against
drastic measures in cooling the colony's overheated property market.
The Hongkong Bank said in a report that the best way to bring high property
prices down was to increase the supply of land for development. A 'more
desirable pattern of price behaviour' could be achieved if steps were taken
to ensure this better land supply was developed quickly and 'not simply
added to developers' land banks'.
But the bank warned the Hong Kong government, which has initiated an inquiry
into high property prices, against taking any precipitate action. The
colony's economy would be severely damaged if the government adopted a set
of measures leading to a collapse in the market, it added.
Most personal wealth in Hong Kong is bound up in property, either through
direct ownership or the stock market. More than 50 per cent of the earnings
of stocks included in the Hang Seng index are directly dependent on
property. The property market last cracked in the aftermath of the Tiananmen
massacre in June 1989.
Earlier this month, the government set up a task force to recommend measures
the administration should take to curb the market. It is expected to report
to Governor Chris Patten in three months, but there is evidence that the
announcement of this inquiry has already had an effect.
Property agents have reported a fall-off in transactions this month, as
would-be purchasers hold back awaiting the government's measures. Prices
have responded, with values for a standard 600 sq ft to 800 sq ft flat
falling about 10-15 per cent.
In the first three months of the year, prices reportedly rose 20-30 per
cent. They have been propelled upwards by mainland Chinese investors, many
whom pay in cash, buying into the market as a hedge against inflation and a
possible devaluation of the yuan.
The Hongkong Bank highlighted the role of property developers as financiers.
In the first three months of this year, developers provided finance for more
than 60 per cent of the new properties offered for sale.

FT  27 APR 94 / World outlook for jobs 'gloomy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world outlook for jobs and wages remains gloomy, with growth in
employment internationally failing to match the growing labour force, the
International Labour Organisation said in its annual report yesterday.
The world labour force is growing by 43m would-be workers a year, it said,
but average per capita income fell last year for the fourth year in
succession.
Slow growth in the developed market economies was passed on to developing
countries through falling demand and lower commodity prices. Except for the
swiftly growing East and South-East Asian economies, employment levels could
only be sustained by falling wages.
Long-term unemployment had increased sharply across Europe. Some 28.1 per
cent of unemployed people in the UK had been without jobs for more than a
year. In Ireland the percentage is 60.3, in Germany 45.5 and in France 38.7.
This contrasts markedly with Sweden (4.4) and Finland (9.1).
Employment conditions, said the ILO, would continue to be determined by two
important characteristics: economic globalisation, allowing capital to seek
cheap and productive labour anywhere in the world, and liberalisation
affecting most of the OECD economies and many former communist bloc
countries.
'For millions of workers around the globe, employment prospects will, at
best, remain uncertain for years to come'.
The ILO is raising concerns about the number of deaths among workers using
pesticides and agricultural chemicals, particularly in developing countries.
The report said an estimated 4m third world workers showed signs of
pesticide poisoning. Some 99 per cent of deaths caused by agro-chemicals
occurred in developing countries which used only 20 per cent of the world's
pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers. Disasters such as at Bhopal tended
to obscure the damage caused by daily handling of chemicals.

FT  27 APR 94 / Hata struggles to remake coalition

<TEXT>
Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's recently elected prime minister, made no progress
yesterday in persuading the Social Democratic party to rejoin his crippled
coalition.
The deadlock threatens to prevent him forming a majority government, so
increasing the chance of an early general election. The opposition Liberal
Democratic party, encouraged by the break-up of the coalition, yesterday
called on Mr Hata to hand over power.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman, refused to reply to Mr Hata's invitation
to discuss the socialists' decision early yesterday to leave the government
coalition, so removing its parliamentary majority.
The SDP, formerly the coalition's largest member, walked out in protest
against the formation of a new alliance, called Kaishin, by five
conservative groups led by Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party.
Only hours earlier, the SDP had cast a decisive vote for Mr Hata's prime
ministerial nomination in parliament. This was 'betrayal', said Mr Murayama.
The socialists had got the 'wrong impression', Mr Hata maintained.
Mr Hata should step down because he had lost the basis for his nomination as
leader, Mr Masaharu Gotoda, an LDP elder, said. 'Is it OK to entrust the
future of the people to such an insincere government?' asked Mr Yohei Kono,
LDP president.
Undeterred, Mr Hata said he planned to form a cabinet as soon as possible.
JRP officials say he needs to form a government by tomorrow at the latest.
The SDP has said it would co-operate with the government in passing a budget
for the current year. This has been blocked for more than a month by a
parliamentary row over former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's financial
propriety, then by the coalition policy row following Mr Hosokawa's
resignation. The government is ticking over on a provisional budget, which
expires on May 20.
The socialists have also offered to co-operate on economic pump-priming
measures, but will not support tax reforms, the most important piece of
legislation facing the new government.
The socialists' departure was 'only natural', the Asahi Shimbun newspaper
said yesterday. The party had been out of line with its former partners on
most issues, ever since the coalition was formed last July after the LDP's
first election defeat in 38 years.
The Asahi and other newspapers questioned Mr Hata's ability to exert strong
leadership and suggested the formation of Kaishin showed the increased
behind-the-scenes influence of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom
strategist. Mr Ozawa was virtual 'owner' of the Hata administration, the
Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial daily said.

FT  27 APR 94 / Dhaka business halted by strike

   DHAKA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, was brought to a halt yesterday by the
second general strike in a month called by opposition parties in an effort
to put pressure on the government of Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister.
The parties are calling for an early general election under a caretaker
government well before Mrs Zia's term expires in 1996. They want to take
advantage of what they see as waning support for the ruling Bangladesh
National party, which fared badly in municipal elections last month in Dhaka
and Chittagong, the second city.
Mrs Zia, widow of the murdered former president, General Zia ur Rahman,
shows no sign of acceding to demands of the opposition - the Awami League,
headed by Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Sheikh Mujib ur Rahman, Bangladesh's
independence leader, and the Jatiya party of the former president and
military dictator, General Hossain Ershad, who was overthrown in 1990 and is
now in jail on corruption charges.
Diplomats say much Bangladeshi politics consists of feuds between Mrs Zia,
Sheikh Hasina and Gen Ershad's followers in which policy differences are
unimportant.
Nevertheless, the recent council elections showed some voter opposition to
Mrs Zia's economic policies - especially a World Bank-endorsed
liberalisation programme which includes plans for cuts in state-owned
industries.
Opposition parties claim that, because the government was defeated in the
council polls, the Bangladesh National party will try to rig the general
election. They argue that the fact that the 1990 poll won by Mrs Zia was
fought under a caretaker government is a useful precedent. A senior aide of
Sheikh Hasina argues that caretaker governments are a good way of ensuring
fairness and stability in a young democracy.
Businessmen fear that the strikes are already disrupting trade and
undermining efforts to promote the country among foreign investors.

FT  27 APR 94 / Reward offer highlights China venture problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unusual advertisement being placed by a British businessman in Asian
newspapers could embarrass a state-owned Chinese company against which he
has waged a four-year legal battle.
Mr Richard Gosling is offering a Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 340,176) reward for
information on the 'assets, cargo and bank accounts' of China Tianjin
International Economic &amp; Technical Co-operative Corporation (CTIETCC), his
partner in a failed joint venture.
The company is effectively the commercial arm of the government of Tianjin,
an eastern Chinese port city.
Mr Gosling wants to locate Dollars 4.5m of the Chinese company's money in
order to enforce a 1992 judgment made in the High Court in London against
CTIETCC.
Although the scale of Mr Gosling's investment was relatively small, his case
highlights the absence of legal redress in China for foreign investors whose
ventures go wrong. Chinese officials admit that developing a better legal
system is a high priority in the country's economic reform.
Not only are there few legal avenues in China, but Chinese companies often
have complex corporate networks, making it difficult to pin down a legal
entity which can be pursued.
Mr Gosling's joint venture with CTIETCC, formed in 1989, was to produce
printed circuit boards as well as other goods such as car tyre foot pumps.
But, it was alleged no circuit boards materialised, nor did the pumps meet
specifications.
The case underlines the need for foreign companies to build up their
contacts and knowledge of China before investing, to negotiate carefully,
and to work closely with joint venture partners after signing an agreement.
Mr Gosling obtained a judgment for Pounds 1.86m, since inflated by interest
and legal costs, in the English High Court, and has since been seeking
CTIETCC assets so the judgment can be enforced.
His latest step follows his failure to win a garnishee order against the
Bank of China's London branch which sought to recover money from CTIETCC
bank accounts in China.

FT  27 APR 94 / Confusion, collapse and cynicism: Japanese coalition
flounders in political mire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's foreign partners could be forgiven for gaping in astonishment at the
political antics of the world's second largest economy over the past 24
hours.
No sooner had Japan's politicians ended two weeks of wrangling to elect a
new prime minister, Mr Tsutomu Hata, than his attempt to form a government
collapsed in confusion and recrimination.
The cause of the crisis, which might provoke an early general election, was
a walk-out by the Social Democratic Party, the coalition's largest member.
The SDP felt insulted and betrayed by the formation of a new conservative
grouping, called Kaishin (Innovation) by centre-right members of the
alliance only hours after the socialists had voted Mr Hata to the
leadership.
The SDP walkout leaves the remaining members of Mr Hata's coalition 56 votes
short of a parliamentary majority, without precedent for any post-war
government. The socialists, some of whom seemed almost relieved to be in
opposition again, have pledged to co-operate on passage of the current
budget and measures to stimulate the economy.
Beyond that, Mr Hata has little chance of being able to govern, unless he
can somehow win the socialists back. The stakes are high and the odds poor.
If he cannot produce the income tax cut before the summit of the Group of
Seven industrial nations in July, this will stoke US frustration, push up
the yen and jeopardise fragile recovery prospects.
At least two evening newspapers yesterday forecast an early general
election, which would make Mr Hata's administration one of the shortest on
record. 'The ruling coalition has virtually collapsed. Their power game. . .
has failed,' said Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal
Democratic party. 'The time for a showdown has come,' he said.
'For the first time, it looks as if things have got so bad that the deadlock
might have to be resolved by going to the people,' said Mr Jesper Koll,
chief economist at S G Warburg Securities in Tokyo.
Should they wish to precipitate an election, the SDP and LDP have enough
combined weight to win a parliamentary vote of no confidence in Mr Hata, who
does not yet have a cabinet or a government.
A vote of no confidence could happen sometime after the passage of the
budget, possibly in June, on the assumption that all involved believe it
would be irresponsible to dissolve parliament without assuring the
government's finances for this year.
Some analysts believe the LDP and SDP might be tempted to go to the polls.
Larger traditional parties would do better in a snap poll under the existing
multi-seat constituency system. The new system, due to come into effect
towards the end of the year, will comprise mixed single seats and
proportional representation and is likely to favour smaller parties.
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, who as deputy leader of Mr Hata's Japan Renewal Party is
the new prime minister's political mentor, is widely assumed to be the
guiding hand behind the new Kaishin grouping.
He appears to have been hoping to attract enough defectors from the SDP and
the LDP to summon a majority. But it looks as if this latest strategem of Mr
Ozawa has badly misfired. There were no new defections yesterday. Instead
the socialists, the New Harbinger Party - another disaffected former
coalition member - and the LDP closed ranks.
'This is typical of Mr Ozawa's high-risk tactics. It could either be a
stroke of genius or a disaster. On the evidence so far, it looks like a
disaster,' said a western diplomat.
Mr Hata has come out of this badly. His claim on television to know nothing
about plans to form a new group on the grounds that it was a purely JRP
matter, sounded unconvincing to at least half the audience, since Mr Hata is
head of the JRP. To the half that did believe Mr Hata's protestations of
innocence, the new leader looked foolishly ignorant of Mr Ozawa's
machinations.
Few people fault Mr Ozawa's perception, shared by Mr Hata and Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa, the former prime minister, that Japan is evolving a two or three
party system of two large groups. Kaishin's formation marks a lurch towards
that system, albeit faster than most people expected.
The vision might be right, but Mr Ozawa's method aroused widespread aversion
yesterday. A poll by TV Asahi yesterday found that three-quarters of
respondents opposed this forceful style of driving out the socialists.
A straw poll unearthed a mixture of disaste and admiration with some arguing
that the JRP had flouted its obligations to the SDP embodied in an almost
sacred Japanese concept of giri (duty).
'What I don't like about Mr Ozawa is that he pulls the wires behind the
shadows,' said Mrs Sonoko Yoshimura, a Tokyo housewife. 'I'm more cynical
than angry,' said Mr Akihiko Ohkura, a print worker.
On the side of those prepared to forgive Mr Ozawa's tactics, Mr Akira
Terayama, deputy general manager at Okasan Securities, argued that force is
needed to achieve political progress. The socialists were set to pull out of
the coalition at some time, he argued. They were, however, probably hoping
to do it in a less cataclysmic fashion.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US consumer confidence has risen this month to its highest level in nearly
four years, indicating that economic growth remains robust. Separate figures
show little upward pressure on wages despite the strong recovery.
The Conference Board said its index of confidence rose five points this
month to 91.7, a 36 per cent increase from April last year.
Confidence is running at levels 'which have historically signalled a strong
economy', said Mr Fabian Linden for the board. The rise in confidence from
March mainly reflected more positive assessments of current economic
conditions; consumers were slightly more optimistic about economic
conditions in the next few months.
Confidence varies regionally, with the strongest gains in the mid-western,
southern and mountain states. Confidence remains relatively subdued on the
east and west coasts.
Labour Department figures yesterday showed little evidence of upward
pressure on wages, despite rapid economic growth. The employment cost index
(the broadest measure of wages and fringe benefits) rose 0.7 per cent in the
first quarter and 3.2 per cent in the year to March, against gains of 0.8
per cent in the fourth quarter and 3.5 per cent in the year to December.
The growth of benefit payments, such as healthcare, has slowed sharply since
the late-1980s but still outpaces wage and salary increases.

The deal, signed at Plzen, is a coup for GE, which has negotiated the
agreement in the past few weeks in spite of long, intermittent talks between
the Czech company and Siemens of Germany.
Mr Ronald Pressman, chief executive of GE Power Systems Europe, said that
Skoda would be supplying mainly steam turbine components to GE.
The US company expects to place about Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m (Pounds
3.35m-Pounds 6.7m) in orders with Skoda in the next two years, with
commitments expected to increase after that.
GE will supply gas turbines and combined-cycle engineering for
Skoda-designed power plants in eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, the
Middle East and Vietnam.
Both companies have also agreed to explore opportunities for co-operation in
individual power plant construction projects elsewhere.
Skoda has been wooed by westerners since the opening of the old Comecon
markets in the early-1990s. GE had also talked with the company at that
stage, said Mr Pressman.
Skoda reached agreement in principle on a broad co-operation in power with
Siemens in 1991.

US failure to approve the implementing legislation of the Uruguay Round
trade accord would be 'equal in magnitude' to the US failure to approve the
League of Nations after the first world war, Sir Leon Brittan, EC
commissioner in charge of trade, said yesterday.
He was nearing the end of two days of talks with US officials, senators and
congress members. Sir Leon said defeat by the US Congress of a trade accord
approved with US and EU leadership would be devastating. At a time when US
leadership is needed to handle problems around the world, the inability of
the US administration to get the trade pact approved would impair its
ability to lead.
The administration has not been seriously worried about Gatt passage but
opponents may be making headway with their contention that the new World
Trade Organisation would involve a loss of US sovereignty. Mr Newt Gingrich,
second ranked Republican in the House of Representatives, has talked of 'a
very real chance' he might vote against the deal.
Some US officials are concerned that failure to approve the WTO this year
would give the opposition time to build strength. But the administration has
been unable to agree on a way to raise the estimated Dollars 13bn (Pounds
8.7bn) needed to compensate for tariff cuts.
Sir Leon suggested numerous solutions, including a waiver of the US budget
act requirement that all expenditure be offset by new taxes or cuts. He said
failure to pass the implementing legislation this year would be 'unwise to
the point of being irresponsible.'
Sir Leon said he had discussed with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, the option of allowing China to become a founder member of
the World Trade Organisation this year, before its economic liberalisation
is complete. WTO members would be allowed to use safeguards against Chinese
imports.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Physicists have found evidence of the existence of the top quark, the last
of 12 subatomic building blocks believed to make up all of matter, the New
York Times said yesterday, Reuter reports from New York.
The newspaper said that, after nearly two decades of searching, an
international team of 439 scientists at the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, was due to announce its findings.
If confirmed, the newspaper said, the discovery would be a big milestone for
modern physics because it would complete the experimental proof of a theory
known as the Standard Model, which defines the modern understanding of the
atom and its structure.
'The exciting thing is that this is the final piece of matter as we know it,
as predicted by cosmology and the Standard Model of particle physics,' Dr
David Schramm, a theoretical physicist at the University of Chicago, was
quoted as saying. 'It is the final piece of that puzzle.'
If the top quark could not be found, the newspaper said, the Standard Model
would collapse, forcing scientists to rethink three decades of work in which
governments around the world had invested billions of dollars.
Matter is made of atoms but, nearly a century ago, physicists discovered
that atoms, long considered to be the smallest units of matter, were
composed of smaller, subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons. These
particles later showed signs of being made of smaller building blocks.
The field was mired in confusion for many years until a unifying theory was
developed by Dr Murray Gell-Mann, a physicist at the California Institute of
Technology. He sought to explain the structure of subatomic particles in
terms of new units he called quarks.
He theorised that there were six different kinds of quarks and that the
quark family was parallel to a six-member family of lighter particles known
as leptons. Various combinations of these 12 particles are thought to make
up all matter.
Five of the six quarks were eventually found, but the sixth remained elusive
for nearly two decades until the scientists at the Fermi laboratory found
evidence of its existence.

FT  27 APR 94 / Venezuela bank chief quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Ruth de Krivoy, president of Venezuela's central bank, resigned last
night after facing heavy pressure from the government of President Rafael
Caldera to change the bank's monetary policy and force reductions in
interest rates.
Mr Omar Bello, the first vice-president at the central bank, will
temporarily replace Mrs de Krivoy, who is an internationally respected
economist. She was viewed as playing an important stabilising role in
Venezuela's public sector.
Mrs de Krivoy's resignation represents a serious blow to the image of the
Caldera government, which began a five-year term in February. Beset by
economic and financial problems, the Caldera administration has developed
policies aimed at placing it in the middle ground between free market
economics and heavy government intervention.
As part of this programme, the government recently began pressing the
central bank to force domestic interest rates downward even though inflation
remains high. Mrs de Krivoy apparently rejected these pressures, saying in
her letter of resignation that she could not carry out policies that
violated economic principles.
Mrs De Krivoy insisted on the need to maintain a tight policy to stop
speculation in the money markets, to fight inflation and to protect foreign
reserves that have fallen because of a banking crisis.
Authorities have spent about Dollars 5.9bn - the equivalent of half the 1994
budget - to support banks. About Dollars 2.7bn was spent to bail out Banco
Latino, previously Venezuela's second biggest bank, which was taken over by
the government after failing to meet financial commitments.

FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: US, Canada edge towards farm curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Canada, pressed by their farm lobbies, will soon begin
negotiations that could undo, at least in the short term, much of the
agriculture trade liberalisation so painfully negotiated under the North
American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
Even as the trade ministers in Marrakesh were signing the Uruguay Round
deal, US and Canadian negotiators were in another room negotiating deals to
protect their farmers.
Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture secretary, said talks in Marrakesh broke
down over Canada's refusal to increase US market access for dairy, poultry
and eggs, and its insistence on maintaining wheat exports at current levels.
Unable to reach agreement, the US on Friday said it would act in 90 days to
limit grain imports under Article 28 of Gatt.
Canada has responded by threatening reprisals against apples, bourbon,
bread, chicken, rice, tomato products and wine.
Besides Canada's restrictions on dairy, poultry and eggs, the US is
complaining about Canadian exports of peanuts, sugar and sugar-containing
products.
At the root of the disputes - as has long been the case - is the similarity
of farm production in the two neighbouring countries. Neither government is
ready to let freer trade take its course.
What could result from the current stand-off is a far-reaching deal across
sectors which could limit access to the Canadian market for dairy and
poultry while curbing sugar and grain imports to the US.
A deal to change tariffs would have to get US congressional approval.
That ordinarily would be attached to the Uruguay Round implementing
legislation, but the Clinton administration has yet to find the money in the
budget to compensate for the lower tariffs agreed in the round.
Furthermore, the administration, which has been forced to act on earlier
promises to prairie state senators, is now finding new opposition. Eighteen
senators from states producing pasta and poultry have threatened to block
adoption of a deal.
To the disgust of its farm lobby, US officials are determined to act on
Canada's grain imports under Gatt's multilateral rules, instead of acting
unilaterally under a US law which allows the US to impose tariffs or quotas
if imports are having a negative impact on the US farm programme.
Mr Mace Thornton, spokesman for the American Farm Bureau, said the US has
repeatedly opposed the use of Article 28 - by the EU for example - and
threatened retaliation if it were used.
For the US to use it and at the same time withdraw tariff reduction
commitments negotiated under Nafta would 'set a bad precedent'.
The Farm Bureau, the most ardent supporter of the Uruguay Round, wants the
administration to delay action until completion of a study by the
International Trade Commission on the effects of imports on the US price
support programme.
If this finds negative impact, it wants action under US law.
The US could then avoid paying compensation, but would risk a full-blown
trade war with its biggest trading partner.

Britain is to push for a restructuring of the World Bank's activities so as
to give a greater role to the International Finance Corporation, the World
Bank affiliate that provides finance for the private sector in developing
countries.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, yesterday hinted that Britain wanted to
discuss transferring resources from the bank to the IFC, so as to reflect
the growing importance of private-sector finance in developing nations.
'Over time, the relative balance between bank lending and IFC investments
will inevitably alter, with IFC growing faster than the bank. We must
explore ways of expanding the IFC's activities without further early calls
on shareholder resources,' he told a meeting yesterday of the development
committee of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
He is concerned that, for every Dollars 19 (Pounds 12.75) provided for
development by the World Bank, the IFC invests only Dollars 1. Britain
believes that the IFC's activities need to be strengthened to build on its
work of providing support for private-sector investment, financial
institutions and capital markets, and on the private provision of
infrastructure and services in developing nations.
The chancellor's concern about World Bank activities was echoed by Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, US treasury secretary. The development committee meeting yesterday
adopted a proposal from Mr Bentsen to create a task force in order to review
the role of the World Bank and other multilateral development banks.
The task force, which has yet to be appointed, will focus on cutting out
overlapping activities. It aims to report by October 1995.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The president of the US textile industry association has called on industry
leaders to accept the reality of international trade and focus on export
growth, even in developing countries which produce the goods flooding into
the US market.
Mr Henry Truslow III, president of the American Textile Manufacturers'
Institute, told an industry conference in Florida exports cannot counter the
damage caused by phasing out of textile and apparel quotas, but 'we have -
and will have - some extraordinary opportunities to do business in other
countries.'
Textiles companies have been among the most protectionist of US sectors.
Since the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, the industry
has been split over proposals to favour export strategies, made possible by
large productivity gains achieved in the past decade.
Mr Truslow called on the industry to 'commit to an export strategy, squeeze
every penny out of costs, ensure that the industry has access to raw
materials at world prices, encourage the (US) government to make foreign
markets an ongoing high priority, and promote tax initiatives, such as a
value-added tax which benefits exporters.'
Sen Ernest Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat and an industry supporter,
says the industry now 'has its eye on the hole not the doughnut.' In the
last 12 years, the US has lost more than 500,000 textile jobs and has a
Dollars 29bn (Pounds 19.5bn) trade deficit in textiles and apparel.
Exports have been growing, but slowly - from Dollars 9.4bn in 1992 to
Dollars 10.3bn in 1993. They dropped by 0.8 percent in the first two months
of 1994, mostly due to recession.
The manufacturers' institute has yet to decide whether it will support the
Uruguay Round global trade pact.

<TEXT>
Continental European finance ministers have put greater exchange rate
stability back on the international monetary agenda.
But any idea of creating a new world monetary system or extending Europe's
experience with the exchange rate mechanism to other countries stands
virtually no chance of acceptance by the biggest industrial nations.
Following the meeting this week of the policy-making interim committee of
the International Monetary Fund, Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance
minister and committee chairman, disclosed that the Fund's executive board
had been asked to study 'possible ways to introduce a greater degree of
discipline in the present exchange rate system'.
The Fund board was asked to report back to the committee by its next meeting
in Madrid in October.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, made clear he believed there was
little chance of a new system to stabilise exchange rates and that the
problem was better addressed through strengthened co-ordination of economic
policies.

<TEXT>
The Mexican government has set up a commission for public security in an
effort to tackle the growing wave of organised crime in the country.
President Carlos Salinas has named Mr Arsenio Farell, labour minister over
the past decade, to head the commission. He will co-ordinate federal and
state police, and work with the interior ministry and secretary of defence.
This follows the kidnapping of a prominent Mexican businessmen on Monday. Mr
Angel Losada Moreno, vice-chairman of Grupo Gigante, Mexico's second largest
supermarket chain, was seized from his car by six people.
The Mexican press yesterday published extracts from a letter by the
kidnappers of another prominent businessman, Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, president
of Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest bank, who was seized last month. The
letter said a ransom of less than Dollars 100m was demanded.
The kidnappers accused the bank's principal directors of coldly trying to
sacrifice their partner by not paying.
The commission is likely to try to encourage police departments to deal with
the pervasive federal and state corruption. Kidnappers and drug
organisations in Mexico generally enjoy protection from police who are in
their pay, and are often themselves made up of ex-policemen.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US, Canada and Mexico agreed yesterday to set up a permanent Dollars
8.8bn (Pounds 5.9bn) swap arrangement to help cushion sharp fluctuations in
the foreign exchange markets.
Officials from all three countries - the partners in the North American Free
Trade Agreement - said they did not anticipate drawing on the facility in
the near future. However, they said they had decided to set up the
procedures so as to have the money available in case of 'significant
turbulence'. 'Its purpose is to promote orderly exchange markets,' said Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary.
The new arrangement will combine a long-standing Dollars 2bn reciprocal
US-Canada credit line with the Dollars 6bn temporary credit established for
Mexico by the US last month to guard against any sharp drop in the peso
after the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's
candidate for the presidency. It will also include a Canada-Mexico credit
line, increased yesterday from CDollars 200m (Pounds 98m) to CDollars 1bn.
The accord contributed to a strengthening of the Mexican peso yesterday,
with the 48-hour rate reaching Ps3.30 to the US dollar. Despite the
volatility of the financial markets after the assassination, no call has
been made on the swap facility over the last month. 'I don't expect it to be
drawn on more, but it's something that you put in place, in the event (of)
very volatile markets,' said Mr Gordon Thiessen, Bank of Canada governor.
Mr Bentsen said the formalisation of the arrangement would make it easier to
confront any future instability in the currency markets.
Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, said the Mexican government had
responded to volatility in the financial markets after Mr Colosio's
assassination by increasing interest rates, depreciating the exchange rate
and using some of its reserves.

FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: S Koreans to assemble carsin Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kia Motors is to become the first South Korean carmaker to assemble
passenger vehicles in Europe in a project to produce up to 30,000 vehicles a
year in Germany.
The Korean carmaker said yesterday it had signed a deal with Karmann, the
German automotive engineering and production group, to build its Sportage
four-wheel-drive sports-utility vehicle at the Karmann plant in Osnabruck,
north Germany.
The agreement is a landmark deal in the development of the world car
industry, and signals the Korean vehicle makers' determination to break into
the developed markets of Europe and North America.
The move comes a decade after the Japanese motor industry took its first
steps into car assembly in Europe. Four Japanese vehicle makers now assemble
cars in Europe; a fifth has a plant under development.
The Korean motor industry has embarked on a rapid expansion overseas. Kia,
the second-biggest Korean vehicle maker, recently began selling cars in the
US for the first time under its own brand, after entering many European
markets for the first time last year.
Kia said yesterday that production of the Sportage, a compact sports/utility
vehicle to compete against vehicles auch as the Suzuki Vitara, would begin
in Osnabruck early next year. Initial output is planned to reach 15,000 a
year, but Kia aims to double output to 30,000 a year for both four-door and
two-door versions.
In the first phase, the Sportage vehicles will be assembled from CKD
(completely knocked down) kits shipped from Korea. But Kia said that,
medium-term, it planned to involve 'as many German and European components
suppliers as possible'. Longer-term, Kia planned to raise the number of
components bought from German and European suppliers, with the aim of
increasing the local European content of the vehicle to around 60 per cent.

project returns
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Beijing is to relax rulings on returns offered to foreign investors in power
projects in China. Unofficial guidelines issued at the start of the year,
setting a target of 12 per cent, have been lifted to 16 per cent, said Mr
Gordon Wu, Hong Kong's civil engineer turned business tycoon, whose own
power plant proposals have been put on ice because of the poor returns on
offer.
Speaking at an FT conference on Asian Electricity in Hong Kong yesterday, Mr
Wu said Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, is now suggesting foreign
investors be offered no more than 15 to 16 per cent. 'So he has relented a
little, although by international standards it is still a low return,' said
Mr Wu.
Bankers have been reporting a delay in power plant project financing deals
since the start of this year, when it became clear Beijing was planning
strict curbs on rates of return. The introduction of schemes of control,
offering staggered returns, was also under consideration.
In December, Beijing pulled a Dollars 180m (Pounds 121m) financing package
put together by Goldman Sachs for an existing power plant in Shandong
province. A private placement would have put 30 per cent of the project into
foreign hands. Instead, capital is now to be raised on the Hong Kong stock
market. It is understood that the level of returns on offer to foreign
investors was at least partially behind the decision to scrap the original
deal.
Mr Wu added that Beijing was being forced to make a more realistic appraisal
of foreign investors' expectations. However, he reckoned 16 per cent to be a
fair return, if coupled with a short cut through Beijing red tape.
Also at the conference, Mr Thomas Marshella, managing director of Moody's
Investors Service, referred to a World Bank survey which puts the total cost
of power development in Asian developing countries in 1995-99 at Dollars
277bn, with China and India accounting for three quarters of that.

<TEXT>
Telecom Australia, the state-owned telecommunications group, and Optus, its
private sector rival, are joining forces to build an optical fibre
telecommunications cable between Western Australia and Indonesia. This, in
turn, will provide Australia with access to the proposed Asia-Pacific Cable
Network.
The aim is for this link eventually to replace the existing
Australia/Indonesia/Singapore analogue coaxial cable, which was commissioned
about eight years ago. The new link will have much greater capacity and will
use more recent optical amplifier and synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH)
technologies.
The project is a three-way co-operation by Telecon, Optus and PT Indosat,
the Indonesian carrier. However, only the two Australian companies will fund
the ADollars 140m (Pounds 68m) cable network, with Telecom providing 69 per
cent and Optus the remaining 31 per cent.
The new cable is expected to come into service by the end of 1996. Tenders
for the supply of the 2,100-km cable are likely to be sought in July.

FT  27 APR 94 / World Trade News: EU attacked over shipping policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is sharply criticised for its shipping policy, in
the annual report of the A P Moller group, which operates one of the world's
largest merchant fleets.
Moller claims that, because of Commission policies, shipping business and
jobs are being exported to the Far East. The Commission, says Moller, 'has
cast doubt on the right of the liner shipping companies to rationalise their
operations and hence for the European companies to operate profitable liner
services to Europe.'
This refers to a claim by the Commission, in a current dispute with the
container-carrying liner shipping companies, that the companies can only
offer rates from port to port, not from the point of production of goods to
the final destination. The Commission maintains that this practice distorts
competition with land-based hauliers.
The liner shipping companies have always offered customers transport, not
only from port to port but also from the inland point of production to the
inland point of reception.
The Commission is trying to stop this natural service to customers, which is
'difficult to understand,' says Moller.
'The consequence is that a growing share of this trade, and therefore an
increasing number of jobs, (is) being exported to Far Eastern shipping
conmpanies,' says the Danish group.

FT  27 APR 94 / Peugeot relents on lobby group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PSA Peugeot Citroen, the French carmaker, has ended its three year boycott
of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (Acea) and has decided
to join the industry's main lobbying group in Europe. Peugeot has been
isolated in the European motor industry since late 1990, when Mr Jacques
Calvet, chief executive, refused to join the new lobbying group in a
disagreement over voting rights. Mr Calvet, the most vociferous opponent of
Japanese car imports in Europe, had insisted the association should operate
with the principle of unanimous decision-making, but the rest of the
industry had refused to grant the French carmaker a right of veto.
It is understood Peugeot has now decided to join Acea partly out of concern
that it might become isolated from future pan-European research and
development projects in the motor industry. The industry is about to form
the European Council for Automotive Research and Development (EUCAR) in
order to enhance the scope of European R&amp;D collaboration.

Germany said yesterday it was now seeking a European solution to its row
with Britain over stronger measures to stop the spread of 'mad cow' disease.
Last month it had threatened to take unilateral steps, including a ban on
beef and veal imports from Britain. 'Germany wants action at Community
level,' German farm minister Jochen Borchert told a meeting of EU farm
ministers.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, British agriculture minister, told reporters: 'To that
extent it is clearly a retreat by the Germans, as at one stage they were
saying they would take unilateral action.' But earlier Mr Borchert said if
the EU approach failed, Germany would have to look at the matter again. He
urged the Brussels Commission to present fresh proposals to combat 'mad cow'
disease by the next meeting of EU farm ministers at the end of May.

Mr Gerard Longuet (left), France's trade and industry minister, said
yesterday he was 'astonished' and 'a little disconcerted' at a judge's move
to widen an investigation into his Republican Party's finances by probing
into Mr Longuet's own property purchases. Mr Renaud Van Ruymbeke, a judge in
Brittany who has also pursued irregularities in the Socialist party's
funding, has been investigating a 1988 commission of FFr4.4m (Pounds
510,000) from Pont-a-Mousson, a pipe-making company based in Mr Longuet's
home region of Lorraine, which allegedly reached an RP councillor in Nantes
via the Swiss bank account of a local industrialist. Mr Longuet, who was
national treasurer of the RP at the time, confirmed yesterday that the judge
was trying to find out whether any of the Pont-a-Mousson money ended up in
Mr Longuet's properties in Paris and the south of France. Mr Longuet, who
yesterday said he had 'all the serenity of someone who is on the right side
of the law and the tax authorities,' has been tipped to succeed Mr Edouard
Balladur as prime minister if the latter becomes president.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute,
yesterday joined a growing consensus in Europe that the path to a single
currency no longer lies via a resurrection of the old exchange rate
mechanism. In testimony to the European parliament, Mr Lamfalussy said he
had changed his mind about the need to revive the ERM's narrow fluctuation
bands. Currency stability was the fundamental objective, he said. Mr
Lamfalussy expressed cautious optimism about exchange rate stability,
tempered by a warning to member states to reduce their record budget
deficits. Failure to do so risked an increase in long-term rates, which
could choke off the incipient recovery in Europe.
Mr Lamfalussy's remarks on the future of the ERM reflect a new consensus
among central bankers, the European Commission and the Bundesbank that the
15 per cent fluctuation bands - introduced as a crisis measure last August -
have helped not only to deter speculators but also to reinforce currency
stability. The EMI president said he favoured keeping the wide bands for as
long as possible. The unexpected success of the crisis measures still leaves
ministers with a dilemma: how to reconcile the 15 per cent bands with the
Maastricht treaty's provision that a currency must be a member of the
'normal' ERM bands for two years to qualify to join a future single
currency.

FT  27 APR 94 / French to beat deficit target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government is aiming to reduce its budget deficit to between
FFr275bn (Pounds 31.8bn) and FFr280bn (Pounds 32.3bn) for 1995, compared
with a target of FFr300bn this year, ministry officials said yesterday. The
objective is in line with the government's five-year budget plan, which
seeks to reduce the public sector deficit to 3.5 per cent of gross domestic
product next year and to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 1997. In 1993, the deficit
represented just over 4 per cent of GDP.
In a letter to ministers, Mr Balladur, the prime minister, said 1995 'should
mark a new step in the redress of the public finances'. He called on each
ministry to present proposals which would enable a 1.6 per cent reduction in
government spending, excluding debt servicing. Productivity gains of 1.5 per
cent will also be sought from public sector employees, although the prime
minister made no mention of job cuts.
The targets revealed yesterday are the first step in forming next year's
budget. Estimates of revenues are expected to be finalised by the autumn,
after which the budget law will be presented to the cabinet and parliament.

FT  27 APR 94 / Big powers promise a united front on Bosnia: Diplomats plan
to restrict Serbs to 49% of republic as fears grow of renewed fighting in
north-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The newly established four-power 'contact group' on Bosnia promised
yesterday to present a united front as they apply pressure on both Bosnian
Serbs and Moslems to agree a negotiated settlement.
The group - comprising Russia, the US, the United Nations and the European
Union - resolved at its first meeting in London to avoid the splits between
the west and Russia which have dogged attempts to secure an accord between
Moslems and Serbs.
The group's representatives - aiming to capitalise on an apparent easing of
tension as the Serbs withdraw from the enclave of Gorazde under threat of
air strikes - hope to travel to Sarajevo tomorrow. They will then visit
Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters.
The group's plans were announced by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary
of state, in Geneva after a meeting with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian
foreign minister.
In a gesture of western keenness to include Russia in the peace process, Mr
Christopher took Mr Vitaly Churkin, Moscow's chief negotiator in former
Yugoslavia, with him when he flew from London to Geneva on his US Air Force
jet.
The contact group hopes to revive a peace plan under which the Serbs would
limit their share of Bosnian territory to 49 per cent - they hold 70 per
cent now - while the remaining territory would be occupied by the new
Croat-Moslem federation.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of UN operations in former Yugoslavia, said early
today that Bosnian Serbs had effectively complied with a Nato ultimatum to
withdraw their heavy weapons from within the 20km (12 miles) exclusion zone
around Gorazde. As a result, there was no need for immediate air strikes.
'On the basis of information available right now, and subject to further
verification, I have come to the conclusion there is no need to ask Nato for
air strikes at this time,' he told reporters in Zagreb.
Bosnian radio yesterday accused Serb forces of shelling Moslem positions
near the north-eastern town of Brcko, at the narrowest point of the corridor
linking Serbia to Serb-held Bosnia and Croatia.
Serb media meanwhile accused the Bosnian Moslem army of planning an imminent
offensive in northern Bosnia.
The exchange of allegations follows reports from witnesses that the Bosnian
Serbs are preparing to launch an offensive in that area, and charges that
Croat forces have been massing to the north.
Preservation of the self-styled 'Serb Republic' in Bosnia depends on
main-taining the land corridor.
There were reports from Serb sources, confirmed by some independent
observers, that Moslem forces had violated the ceasefire in Gorazde by
trying to trap a Serb unit within the enclave so it would become a target
for Nato airstrikes when the ultimatum expired today.

FT  27 APR 94 / Russian gas shares to be offered in the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gasprom, the world's biggest gas producer, is to offer up to 10 per cent of
its shares to foreign investors after completing in a month's time the
biggest domestic flotation in Russia's privatisation programme.
Mr Valery Remizov, deputy chairman of Gasprom, said yesterday it was too
early to say when and where this 10 per cent stake would be offered to
investors as the company was still working on a western-style presentation
of its accounts and a market estimate for the value of its shares. But he
confirmed that Gasprom was likely to offer some, if not all, the 10 per cent
in the west.
Following last Monday's public offering of 28.7 per cent of Gasprom at
auctions for privatisation vouchers reserved for Russian citizens, Gasprom
will also be buying 10 per cent of its own stock at its artificially low
Russian book value, of just Rbs236.7bn (Pounds 89.7m). It is this 10 per
cent which may be offered to foreigners. The aim is to enable Gasprom to
re-sell these shares to the highest bidder to raise funds it needs to
develop new deposits in the Yamal peninsula and elsewhere. Gasprom staff
already own 15 per cent of the company, while another 5.2 per cent is being
reserved for inhabitants of the Yamal-Nenetsk autonomous region in the far
north. The state holds the remaining 42 per cent.
Mr Rem Vyakhirev, Gasprom's chairman, said yesterday it was 'pointless'
using figures to illustrate the company's financial position, however,
because not all customers in the former Soviet Union paid their bills.
Although he said Gasprom earned Dollars 6bn to Dollars 7bn a year from
exports to the west and last year sold Rbs36,000bn (Dollars 20bn) worth of
gas to customers in the former Soviet Union, the latter still owed it
Rbs5,000bn. This meant that little had been left over for investment and any
profit figure existed 'only on paper'.
The government on Monday launched a series of Gasprom auctions to be held in
60 regions of Russia for individuals holding privatisation vouchers -
excluding even the Russian investment funds which have bought stakes in
privatised Russian companies on behalf of small investors.
'We want to reserve this sale for ordinary citizens who have not yet used
their vouchers,' Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister for
privatisation, said yesterday.
His aim is to ensure that all of Russia's 150m citizens use the voucher they
received free of charge by the time the voucher programme expires on July 1.
Mr Chubais, who fought stiff opposition to incorporating this jewel of
Russian industry in the programme giving away shares to the public for
vouchers, said he expected the sale to attract 20m vouchers, or up to 20m
small shareholders.

<TEXT>
Switzerland's seasonally adjusted monetary base rose SFr350m (Pounds 166m)
or 1.2 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 from the fourth quarter of last
year, the Swiss National Bank said. The adjusted monetary base (bank notes
in circulation plus bank reserves held with the central bank divided by
seasonal factors) is the SNB's chosen measure for tracking medium term
monetary policy. It averaged SFr30.078bn in the first quarter, slightly
higher than the SFr29.9bn forecast, due to lower interest rates and a
pick-up in the Swiss economy.
French consumer spending on manufactured goods was 1.8 per cent higher in
March 1994 than March 1993, according to detailed seasonally adjusted
figures released yesterday by Insee, the national statistics institute.
Dutch seasonally adjusted manufacturing output rose 1 per cent in February
from January but was almost flat year-on-year, the Central Bureau of
Statistics said yesterday.
Consumer prices in the western German state of Hesse rose 0.3 per cent in
the month to mid-April and were up 3.2 per cent from a year earlier, the
state statistics office said yesterday.

Poland's Solidarity trade union yesterday called on the government to remove
state sector wage controls and limit planned energy price rises as a
condition for suspending strikes by power workers. The demand came after Mr
Marek Pol, the industry minister, told strikers at the Belchatow power plant
that he would drop plans to restructure the opencast lignite mining sector
which has until now been the strikers' chief demand. In response the miners
agreed to step up coal supplies to one third of Poland's generating
capacity, thus removing the threat of power cuts, but said that the action
would be resumed tomorrow if wage controls were not lifted. Solidarity has
called an eight-hour general strike in Warsaw tomorrow to back the demands
which include the implementation of collective wage bargaining procedures
promised last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British government yesterday reacted with dismay to signals that
Chancellor Helmut Kohl may back Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime
minister, for the presidency of the European Commission.
On the eve of talks at Chequers later today between Mr John Major, the UK
prime minister, and Mr Kohl, Downing Street made no formal comment on the
potential candidacy of Mr Dehaene. A senior prime ministerial aide would say
only: 'We don't know much about him.'
Although officials in Bonn confirmed that the question of the successor to
Mr Jacques Delors as Commission president would be an important item on the
bilateral summit agenda, they certainly do not want anything to sour a
determined effort to repair the two governments' recently rather tattered
relations.
Both sides agree the main focus of today's meeting will be on a long-term
strategy to bring the former communist countries of eastern Europe steadily
towards eventual membership of both the European Union and Nato.
Mr Kohl, who faces a series of elections this year in Germany, is acutely
conscious of the internal political pressures on Mr Major, and does not want
to give any ammunition to his opponents. On the other hand, he is obviously
disappointed at the erratic European policy-making of the British
government, not least on the issue of enlargement of the Union.
'We have worked together extremely well in the past, and we want to do so
again,' a German official said. 'We want to develop a common policy (on
central and eastern Europe). This is an example of the sort of concrete
alliance Mr Major has also talked about.'
However, the determination of both sides to stress their common ground was
belied by the visible dismay among British ministers and officials that Mr
Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand may be preparing to back another
avowed European 'federalist' to succeed Mr Delors.
Ministers predicted such an appointment - supposed to be made at the EU
summit in Corfu in June - would provoke uproar among the growing band of
Eurosceptics on Tory backbenches at Westminster.
In his talks with the German Chancellor today Mr Major is expected to press
again the alternative candidacies of Sir Leon Brittan, the British
Commission vice-president, and Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Netherlands' outgoing
prime minister.
But Whitehall officials said Mr Major did not want to find himself in the
position of threatening to veto Mr Dehaene only to find himself forced
subsequently to retreat, as he was forced to over European Union voting
rights.

Mr Lubbers, 54, the longest-serving prime minister in Dutch history, is
leaving national politics after three consecutive terms in office. His
departure is a serious blow to his Christian Democrat party (CDA), which
traditionally dominates Dutch politics but which is now struggling in the
polls.
When the Lubbers era began in 1982, the country's crippling public debt, its
rigid labour market and its dual problems of inflation and unemployment had
spawned the pejorative term 'Hollanditis.' But as he prepares to leave
office, possibly to fight for the presidency of the European Commission in
Brussels, Mr Lubbers leaves behind a surprisingly muscular economy.
In the early 1980s, his 'no-nonsense' approach and radical (by Dutch
standards) cuts in social benefits earned him the nickname 'Ruud Shock'
abroad, making him one of the few Dutch prime ministers whose name is known
to foreigners.
Mr Lubbers exploited the recession of the early 1980s to cut the pay of
civil servants and scale back unemployment and disability benefits. In his
12 years in office, he also cut the budget deficit from 10.1 per cent of net
national income to 3.8 per cent, although the absolute level of public debt
has continued to rise.
In normal times, Mr Lubbers' anointment of Mr Elco Brinkman as his successor
as party leader would have been enough to ensure that Mr Brinkman would also
succeed him as prime minister. The CDA has had a place in every government
coalition since the second world war, and it usually provides the prime
minister. This year, however, the Dutch electoral race is wide open, and the
CDA's support is crumbling.
Part of the problem is the transition from a popular, well-tried politician
in Mr Lubbers to Mr Brinkman, who has led the CDA in the lower house of
parliament for the past four years.
Mr Lubbers has clearly become an institution. In a recent newspaper
interview he admitted: 'There are whole generations of people who think only
of Ruud Lubbers when they hear the word prime minister. Younger voters have
experienced only me. From a democratic perspective, it's good to turn this
page.'
But the handover to Mr Brinkman has been messy, culminating in signs of
disagreement and friction between the two men. Mr Lubbers first signalled
his preference for Mr Brinkman after the CDA's last electoral victory in
1989, putting his successor in the uncomfortable and visible role of 'heir
apparent' for nearly five years.
Matters were not helped by the presentation of the CDA platform in January,
when plans to freeze old age pension payments sparked a storm of protest.
The chairman of the CDA, Mr Wim van Velzen, resigned to take the blame but
much of the fault was apportioned to Mr Brinkman.
Then, in early April, it emerged that Mr Brinkman held a non-executive
directorship at a company linked to his wife's uncle who was known to have
had run-ins with the tax authorities. The episode has dominated news
reporting in the crucial weeks before the elections.
Mr Brinkman can draw some comfort from the fact that Mr Lubbers, too, began
his tenure as premier facing low popularity and high scepticism, both inside
and outside the party.
The two men share other similarities. . Although Mr Lubbers is a
Jesuit-educated Catholic while Mr Brinkman grew up in a conservative
Calvinist area east of Rotterdam, both men were high-fliers who attained
national office early.
Mr Lubbers, scion of a rich Rotterdam industrialist, was minister of
economic affairs when he was just 34 and became prime minister at 43, the
youngest in Dutch history.
Mr Brinkman, son of a small-town mayor, became minister of culture and
health at the age of 34. Now aged 46, he has a stiff and forbidding image
that belies his youth.
Both men launched their bids for the prime minister's job from their
positions as leader of the CDA in parliament. But the truth now is that the
outlook for the CDA is so grim that the unthinkable may happen: the
Netherlands' 'party of government' could be transformed into a party of
opposition.

FT  27 APR 94 / SFr200m frozen in Schneider's accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Swiss prosecutor has frozen some SFr200m (Pounds 94m) in accounts in
Geneva banks connected to the fugitive German property developer, Mr Jurgen
Schneider, for whom a Frankfurt court yesterday issued an arrest warrant.
The 59-year-old entrepreneur, who has been missing since early this month,
is charged with fraud and falsification of documents in connection with a
DM45m (Pounds 18m) loan obtained from Deutsche Bank for financing the 'Les
Facettes' development in the centre of Frankfurt.
Mr Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, a prosecutor in Geneva, said he took the action
to freeze Mr Schneider's assets last week following a formal accusation of
money laundering made in Geneva 'by a Frankfurt bank'. The accounts were
'directly or indirectly' related to Mr Schneider, he said, and were held at
'several Geneva banking institutions'.
He would not name the banks, and Swiss bank secrecy law prevents the banks
themselves from revealing whether Mr Schneider is a client.
The SFr200m sum is close to the DM219m that Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief
executive of Deutsche Bank, on Monday accused Mr Schneider of taking out of
his group before fleeing Germany. Mr Kopper claimed that Mr Schneider had
transferred the money during March from time deposit accounts at German
institutions to foreign accounts. Mr Hellmut Hartmann, Deutsche Bank's press
spokesman, refused to confirm yesterday that the money had been frozen at
the bank's request.
The Schneider group collapsed on April 15 with debts of more than DM5bn. On
Monday Deutsche Bank, which is owed DM1.2bn, blamed the collapse of
Schneider on systematic fraud. The bank admitted its image had suffered as a
result but said the direct financial losses would be limited to a few
hundred million D-Marks, to be written off in the 1994 accounts.
The Swiss prosecutor responded immediately to the German bank's complaint.
Under Swiss law, a prosecutor can act if a victim of a suspected financial
crime, even if foreign, submits charges. It is no longer necessary to wait
for the customary government-to-government lettres rogatoires. He can also
open an inquiry if, as in this case, charges of money laundering are filed.
However, the party making the charges cannot have access to the results of
the investigation.
There is no limit on the time the accounts can be frozen, although the
account holders may appeal against the freezing.
In another development, Mr Dieter Vogel, the spokesman for the German
government, said yesterday that some 250 small construction companies had
registered themselves as affected by the collapse. They are based mainly in
the Leipzig and Frankfurt areas and are owed a total of DM250m, Mr Vogel
said. Most had 20 employees or less.
The government, acutely conscious of the knock-on effects of the affair on
the small business sector in an election year, has committed itself to help
companies weather the storm. Mr Vogel said that the Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau, the public sector bank specialising in development credit,
would provide bridging credits to the stricken companies.

FT  27 APR 94 / France takes the offence out of D-Day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday unveiled its secret weapon to win its diplomatic battle to
mark the 50th anniversary of the allied landings on the beaches of Normandy
without offending Germany, its erstwhile enemy but bosom buddy of today.
It is a 700-tonne 'memory machine', or metal pyramid, that will form the
stage for 2,400 young actors to enact an allegory of war, peace and
reconciliation in the Norman city of Caen on the night of June 6.
Unveiling plans for the spectacle yesterday, Caen's mayor, Senator
Jean-Marie Girault, said he hoped that it would send out 'a message of peace
and hope', and that even young Germans would take part in it.
Some German members of an international school in Berlin had already
volunteered to do so, said Mr Girault, whose earlier plan to have Chancellor
Helmut Kohl join allied leaders in Caen failed to win government
endorsement.
Outlining plans for his FFr30m (Pounds 3.5m) spectacular - a far cry from
the 'spam-frittering' activities in Hyde Park originally envisaged as
Britain's cultural contribution to the D-Day commemoration - Mr Jean-Pascal
Levy-Trumet, the 36-year-old organiser, said the pyramid would initially be
covered in green-for-peace verdure that, as the 60,000 spectators took their
seats around it, would be stripped off gradually to mark the approach of
war.
Symbolising the onset of war, the pyramid would appear to crack up with
red-lit fissures which would then sprout flames of lights to mark pockets of
resistance as well as landing strips for allied aircraft.
As for D-Day itself, the young actors pouring out of the top of the 16-metre
high pyramid will represent paratroopers; those approaching its base the
beach invaders. Having transformed itself into a cross-studded cemetery for
the dead of all sides, the pyramid extravaganza will end with the rather
more predictable release of white balloons.
French television has complained that the spectacle is too difficult and too
late in the evening to broadcast direct, but Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture
minister, was yesterday confident of wide TV coverage.
He added that among other events he was organising was a round-table
discussion on the wartime allies' influence on Europe - a subject on which
he is evidently ambivalent. Next week, Mr Toubon will be presenting the
national assembly with his bill to promote the use of French, and restrict
that of English, in French public life.

FT  27 APR 94 / Coalition set to change its hue: Christian Democrats could
be shut out for first time since the war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch need not be experienced pollsters to know that next week's general
election will result in a coalition. Coalitions, their creation and their
downfall are the very stuff of Netherlands politics, and the election on May
3 will be no exception, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
This year, however, the prospect of a 'purple' coalition - one embracing the
Labour party, with its traditional red logo, the left-of-centre D66, and the
'Tory' blue right-wing Liberals - is exciting the population. Such a
left-right alliance would be all the more unusual because it would shut out
the centrist Christian Democrats, linchpin of every cabinet since the second
world war and force them into opposition.
The precise composition of the next government will take weeks, and perhaps
even months, to work out. It is already clear, however, that this election
will be the closest in years. Support is falling sharply for the Christian
Democrats and Labour, the two parties (traditionally the largest) which
comprise the present governing coalition. At the same time, the two smaller
'swing' parties, the Liberals and D66, are gaining ground.
Recent polls indicate that these four parties will each win between 25 and
35 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament. This implies that the
next coalition will need, for the first time since the 1970s, to include at
least three parties to create a majority.
'These is the most dramatic shift within the political arena that I've ever
experienced,' says Mr Ger Schild, director of research at Nipo, the
Netherlands' leading polling organisation.
The swing away from the Christian Democrats reflects their internal
divisions as the party's veteran prime minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers, makes way
for his successor, Mr Elco Brinkman. The latest Nipo poll gives the party
just 29 seats, against its current 54.
The Labour Party, by contrast, is still suffering in the polls because of
the role it played in reforming disability insurance, a central part of the
country's generous welfare state system. This alienated the party's
traditional voters and Labour is forecast to drop to 35 seats from 49 seats
in 1989. However, this represents a gradual recovery from late last year
when the party was forecast to win less than 25 seats.
Labour has been helped by the cross-party popularity of its leader, Mr Wim
Kok, who is finance minister in the current centre-left coalition. One
recent poll showed that almost a quarter of people questioned wanted Mr Kok
as the next prime minister compared with less than 6 per cent for Mr
Brinkman.
Even more telling, however, is that the favourite for prime minister is Mr
Lubbers. He commands a rating of more than 40 per cent even though he has
insisted for the past five years that he will not serve again.

FT  27 APR 94 / Bonds volatility 'defies realities'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Recent turbulence in world bond markets seemed more a reaction to myths than
to realities, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said yesterday. The
volatility was hard to explain partly because financial markets were not
necessarily governed by logic, he told the American Council on Germany in
New York. Financial transactions had come uncoupled from the real economy.
'In addition to cyclical factors the underlying reason may have been a rise
in inflationary expectations, especially in the US. But that does not say
anything as to whether that rise has been justified.'
In any case, the scale of the response was out of proportion to the
relatively modest changes in economic prospects, Mr Tietmeyer added.
Noting that 'markets sometimes over-react', he suggested that other factors
such as more activist portfolio managers and the widespread use of
derivatives might have contributed to the volatility.
Although the Bundesbank has shown increasing concern over the implications
of free-for-all activity in financial market derivatives, Mr Tietmeyer's
comments were relatively restrained. Globalisation trends in capital
markets, cross-border investments' rising share of assets under management
and other factors might increase the potential for volatility, he said.
There was no need for panic, but learning to live with the new situation
implied a need to understand market behaviour and analyse risks for the
banking system. This did not require legislation, but market transparency
and disclosure requirements had to be improved and 'risky activities' of
institutions had to be underpinned by adequate capital, Mr Tietmeyer
proposed. The best way to avoid distortions of competition was through
international co-ordination.
Although he suspected he might be accused of 'carrying coals to Newcastle',
Mr Tietmeyer felt obliged to bring up some of the adverse consequences which
had accompanied globalisation and liberalisation of capital markets.
These included the 'bubble' or surge in asset prices in some countries which
was later to collapse.
Even small changes in capital flows could have profound effects on foreign
exchange and capital markets, let alone the massive speculation in Europe in
the last two years which led to a shake-out of the European Monetary System.

FT  27 APR 94 / BAT buys American Tobacco for Dollars 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and insurance giant, is to buy American
Tobacco of the US for Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) cash. The deal turns the
tables on almost a century of history, since BAT was formed in 1902 as a
joint venture between American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco of the UK.
The purchase gives BAT control in the US of the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall
cigarette brands, which it already owns elsewhere in the world. It also
obtains the rights to the Silk Cut brand outside Europe.
American Tobacco, owned by the diversified US group American Brands, is the
fifth largest tobacco company in the US, while BAT is third largest. The
deal will increase BAT's US sales by some 50 per cent, while still leaving
it in third position.
BAT's move comes at a time when the US tobacco industry is under heavy
pressure. The Clinton administration is threatening far-reaching legislation
to curb cigarette smoking, while the market has been fiercely competitive
since Philip Morris, the market leader, slashed the price of its Marlboro
brand a year ago.
BAT's move is also seen as unexpected, as in recent years it has
concentrated on diversifying away from tobacco, using tobacco cash flow to
expand in financial services in the UK and US.
Mr Martin Broughton, BAT chief executive, said that policy remained in
place. BAT is known to have been searching recently for an insurance
acquisition in continental Europe, and has expressed interest in buying a UK
building society. Mr Broughton said BAT was still looking for opportunities
in both areas.
While the American Tobacco purchase will bring BAT's balance-sheet gearing
to 50 per cent, Mr Broughton said he would be happy to raise the figure to
70 per cent for the right purchase. 'We don't see this as inhibiting us,' he
said. 'We could easily cope with another Pounds 1bn-plus of borrowings as of
now.'
Referring to a US broker's circular this week suggesting that a BAT-American
Brands merger might result in cost savings of Dollars 200m, Mr Broughton
described that figure as 'a bit aggressive'.
BAT said the deal, which will be financed from its existing resources, would
improve its earnings from the outset. The price represented between nine and
10 times American Brands' earnings.
American Brands will retain Gallaher, its international operation, which is
the largest tobacco company in the UK and Ireland.
The group said transaction would 'remove potential uncertainty' from the
group - a reference to anti-smoking pressures - and that the move would
enable the group to focus on businesses with greater long-term profit
potential.

FT  27 APR 94 / CBI says cut in interest rates is not necessary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry said yesterday it saw no need for a
cut in UK interest rates, despite some weaker than expected indicators in
its latest quarterly industrial trends survey.
The survey showed that, since January, manufacturing output had risen at its
fastest rate for five years. But City analysts were disappointed by the
survey's findings on waning optimism among manufacturers.
The CBI has often been forthright in calling for interest rate cuts in the
past, but Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee,
said the panel had been unanimous in deciding that the survey did not
justify an immediate cut in interest rates.
'I think there's clearly a strong feeling in industry which says that
interest rates are probably now pretty near the bottom and what industry
really needs, and is beginning to get, is a period of stability in both
exchange rates and in interest rates,' he said.
Sir David added that a quarter of a percentage point cut, which then had to
be quickly reversed, would be more damaging to confidence than allowing
rates to bottom out at the current level. Only if the tax increases which
took effect this month showed signs of causing the recovery to falter,
should the issue of rate cuts be revisited, he said.
The balance of manufacturing companies which said they were more optimistic
than four months previously dropped to 13 percentage points in April, from
27 points in January. Large companies (those with more than 5,000 employees)
have become more pessimistic over the last four months.
Sir David said he thought the tax increases may have cast a shadow over the
optimism indicator. Traditionally, respondents are most optimistic in April,
but the change in the Budget's timing may have altered this seasonal effect.
Nevertheless, some analysts described the optimism figures as disappointing.
The survey had some good news on inflation with slightly more companies
planning to cut, rather than increase, prices over the next four months.
Growth in orders, output and exports is expected to continue.
However, investment intentions remain modest, with only a small balance
planning to invest in plant and equipment over the next year. Manufacturing
companies are still planning to shed jobs over the next four months.
The CBI concluded that 'the momentum of recovery will be maintained into the
summer months. Rising manufacturing output will be accompanied by higher
domestic, and more particularly, export orders.
Net exports seem well placed to add to overall economic growth in the UK
economy in the months ahead.'

FT  27 APR 94 / 'New dawn' for South Africa: Mandela hails disorganised but
peaceful start to first all-race poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa made a disorganised but largely peaceful start to democracy
yesterday as citizens of all races voted together and as equals for the
first time in the country's history.
At special polling stations around the world, South Africans formed long
queues, matched at home by lines of elderly and infirm 'special voters' for
whom yesterday had been set aside.
'Today marks the dawn of our freedom,' said Mr Nelson Mandela, president of
the African National Congress and almost certain successor to state
president F. W. de Klerk. Mr Mandela urged all South Africans to go to the
polls and help in the birth of a new South Africa: 'Today is a day like no
other before it.'
At midnight last night, the blue, white and orange flag of the old South
Africa was ceremonially lowered around the country for the last time,
closing an era of white domination that began in 1652. As the new flag
fluttered aloft, choirs in Cape Town, Johannesburg and other regional
centres sang the moving hymn of African nationalism, Nkosi Sikele i'Afrika
(God bless Africa).
Although voters gathered outside stations well before the opening time of
7am some had to stand for hours. Ballot papers were delivered late, there
were shortages of polling officers and the voting process to select
candidates for both the country's national assembly and nine provincial
legislatures was cumbersome.
At some stations, the closing time of 7pm was extended. With 22.3m eligible
voters, the high turnout expected today coupled with yesterday's
difficulties may mean that voting, scheduled to end tomorrow night, may have
to continue on Friday. Results are due to start being released from Friday
morning unless polling is extended.
The ANC complained that several voting stations in the Transkei and Orange
Free State had opened late or stayed closed for the day, and accused
officials of the Inkatha Freedom party of intimidating voters.
However, Mr Pallo Jordan, ANC information head, said he saw no need for any
annulment of results and was confident that the Independent Electoral
Commission, responsible for organising the poll, would be able to address
the 'teething problems'. The IEC's vice-chairman, Mr Dikgang Moseneke,
conceded that the commission had 'hopelessly underestimated' the problems.
The IFP - which decided only eight days ago to participate in the elections
 -said many ballots were without the sticker carrying the party's logo and
photograph of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, its leader, which is supposed to
have been fixed to the bottom of the paper. 'It savours of sabotage,' said
Chief Buthelezi, who said he had requested that the IEC allow for an extra
'two or three days' of voting.
Any ballot without the IFP sticker will be counted as a spoiled ballot,
according to IFP officials. The electoral commission intends, however, to
exempt from that requirement those who voted outside the country.
Mr Mandela, due to cast his vote today in Natal, dismissed fears that the
rash of recent bombings might hamper the polling. He said the full force of
state intimidation had never stopped the struggle for freedom.
No serious incidents of violence were reported as more than 100,000
soldiers, police and reservists were deployed in and around 9,000 polling
centres. Bomb blasts since Sunday have killed at least 21 people and injured
over 160 in attacks attributed to extreme right-wingers.

FT  27 APR 94 / Exchange launches plan to promote smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange yesterday launched a seven-point plan to promote
the interests of smaller companies and to encourage greater investment in -
and trading of - their shares.
The exchange also said that for the first time it would actively market
itself and its services for small companies and for others whose shares it
lists.
'We need to get a much stronger marketing focus at the exchange,' said Mr
Michael Lawrence, chief executive.
The exchange plans to extend its marketing activities outside the UK and
will actively encourage non-UK companies to seek listings in London.
The exchange has been under pressure to improve its facilities for small
companies since December 1992 when it announced it would close the Unlisted
Securities Market, on which shares of some smaller companies are traded. The
City Group for Smaller Companies, an interest group of venture capitalists,
stockbrokers and corporate financiers, has urged the creation of a new
exchange to promote trading in small company shares, under the Stock
Exchange's aegis.
Yesterday, the exchange stopped short of endorsing that goal, announcing
steps which would 'obviate the need for a new exchange', according to Mr
Giles Vardey, director of markets development and marketing. He said some of
the measures would have been necessary because of changes in European
legislation.
The main points are:
The development of an equivalent of the Stock Exchange 'Yellow Book' to set
listing requirements for those companies not on the official list whose
shares are traded under section 535.2 of the exchange's current rules.
Creation of a specialist smaller companies group within the exchange and of
a dedicated marketing team to educate companies about the benefits of the
exchange's markets and to champion 'smaller company issues'.
The exchange has proposed to the FT-SE Actuaries steering committee a new
index which would draw in those companies now too small to fall into the
FT-SE Actuaries All-Share index.
Enhancement of the trading system to allow prices of less-liquid securities
to be displayed on screens to encourage trading.
Development of the exchange's regional role. It will encourage regional
brokers to promote investor interest in locally based company shares and
will work with Scottish Enterprise on a pilot scheme to be introduced
elsewhere.
Creation of a proposed new venture capital investment trust sector within
the FT-SE indices to encourage fund managers to set aside capital for the
new trusts which qualify for tax relief under the November 1993 Budget.

FT  26 APR 94 / Incentive bid values Cardo at SKr8.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Incentive, a key company in the Wallenberg family empire, yesterday launched
a bid for Cardo, a Swedish investment group, after buying a 44 per cent
stake in the company from Volvo for SKr3.7bn.
The offer, which values Cardo at SKr8.4bn (Dollars 1.07bn), is designed to
give Incentive control of Gambro, one of the world's leading medical
equipment groups. Cardo has a 58 per cent voting stake in Gambro and 43 per
cent of the capital.
Mr Mikael Lilius, Incentive managing director, said the group wanted to
invest aggressively in medical technology.
'This is a market leader with a substantial growth potential,' he said.
Gambro is particularly strong in the renal care field.
With an annual turnover of SKr16.7bn, Cardo is a bigger company than
Incentive which has sales of SKr12.3bn. Apart from its holding in Gambro,
the company has industrial operations spanning industrial doors, pumps, and
train brakes, and a significant investment portfolio.
Mr Lilius said Incentive planned to reintroduce Cardo as a public company,
but it would also sell the company's equity portfolio. The portfolio, which
includes a 4.8 per cent voting stake in Volvo, has a total market value of
some SKr2.7bn.
Mr Lilius said Gambro fitted well with Incentive's diversified engineering
operations, which include transport, materials handling and processing. But
he said there were no plans to bid for the rest of Gambro, which last year
achieved profits of SKr976m on turnover of SKr9.05bn.
Terms of the Incentive offer are SKr500 per Cardo share and SKr325 per
warrant.
The Volvo disposal is a swift demonstration of the vehicle group's new
strategic focus on core transport operations, following last week's
announcement that it planned to shed around SKr40bn worth of non-core
assets.
Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive, said yesterday that the disposal was
'fully in line' with its new strategy. 'At the same time, I believe this is
a favourable solution for Cardo, industrially and in terms of ownership.'
The disposal, which will generate a SKr2.6bn capital gain, represents a
further dismantling of tangled cross-ownership links designed to protect
Volvo from takeover during the 1980s.

A group of Indian environmentalists has threatened mass suicide by drowning

thousands of tribal people in three central states, Reuter reports from New

tribespeople in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, would
be displaced if the Sardar Sarovar Project on the river Narmada were
completed. They say that with seasonal monsoon rains set to break over the
three states next month, 1,500 tribal families face an immediate threat of
flooding unless the government opens up sluice gates which have already been
built for the dam.

The Philippines has one of the world's worst records for pirating computer
software, an alliance of the world's leading software companies said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Manila.
Mr Ron Eckstrom, vice-president of the Business Software Association (BSA),
said about 99 per cent of computer software in the Philippines was pirated
or illegally copied and distributed. This translates to losses of tens of
millions of dollars, he told a business conference.
Mr Eckstrom gave no exact figures for the losses but said they compared with
Indonesia and Thailand which both showed 99 per cent incidence of illegal
use of software programmes. BSA estimates that losses from software copying
and counterfeiting amount to Dollars 14bn a year, or 33 per cent of their
global revenues.

<TEXT>
Hundreds of thousands of Italians took to the streets yesterday to
commemorate the liberation of the country from fascism 49 years ago and, in
many cases, to protest peacefully against the victory of the right-wing
Freedom Alliance in last month's Italian election.
Italy's left and centre parties, roundly defeated by the Freedom Alliance at
the polls, were prominent in yesterday's demonstrations. In Milan, where
heavy rain failed to deter tens of thousands from attending one of the
largest rallies in the city since the 1970s, representatives of the
federalist Northern League, another member of the Freedom Alliance, were
barracked and jostled by demonstrators. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's
leader, had to be escorted by riot police to the cathedral square, focus of
yesterday's events, after he and League officials were surrounded by a crowd
whistling and shouting 'fascisti' and 'buffoni' (fools). The far-right
National Alliance, inheritor of the neo-fascist MSI and one of the three
victorious parties in the Freedom Alliance, called yesterday for the April
25 national holiday to be transformed into a 'festival of reconciliation'.

FT  26 APR 94 / Allies seek four-month ceasefire in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia, the US, the United Nations and the European Union are to seek a
four-month ceasefire in Bosnia as part of a fresh effort to resolve the
Bosnian crisis through negotiation.
As part of the deal, the US will help to finance the full complement of
10,500 additional peace-keeping troops sought last month by General Sir
Michael Rose, the United Nations commander in Bosnia.
The release of US funds will increase the UN force by several thousand
troops, easing the peacekeeping difficulties faced by General Rose. However,
no US ground troops are likely to be involved.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Moscow's chief envoy to former Yugoslavia, announced the
establishment of a 'contact group' on Bosnia involving his country as well
as the US, the UN and EU. He was speaking after a meeting with Mr John
Major, UK prime minister.
The announcement followed a day of consultations over Bosnia in London
involving Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, Mr Alain Juppe,
French foreign minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary.
The meetings were a sign of renewed emphasis on diplomatic, as opposed to
military, approaches to settling the Bosnian dispute.
Mr Churkin's original programme called only for meetings with British
diplomats, and the fact that he was received by Mr Major was a gesture of
reassurance to Russia that it will not be excluded from peace efforts.
The contact group is expected to hold its first meeting in London this
morning. The group's priority will be to negotiate a full cessation of
hostilities for four months, during which negotiations on a comprehensive
settlement would be held with Serb, Moslem and Croat leaders.
Earlier Mr Hurd told the UK parliament that General Rose must retain a veto
over the launching of air strikes against the Serbs.
Britain's strong insistence on the veto was in contrast with the position of
the US, where officials have expressed impatience with the UN's cautious
attitude to the use of air power.
Mr Hurd said that under current arrangements for co-operation between the UN
and Nato, 'either can propose air strikes, both have to agree'. He said this
'dual key' was essential if commanders in the air were to work in harmony
with ground forces.
Mr Jack Cunningham, foreign affairs spokesman for the Labour opposition,
complained of 'considerable confusion' between Nato and UN leaders and
warned that 'indecision' would only help the Bosnian Serb 'aggressors'.
Mr Hurd refused to lay blame on any one warring party and stressed that
Britain 'was not involved in fighting on one side or the other'. He believed
the Bosnian Serbs were withdrawing all their heavy weapons at least 20km
from Gorazde by tonight.
However, he repeated warnings that the alliance could still mount air
strikes.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (28): Hankering after the old
days - Zipperhead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH

<TEXT>
Mainframe computing specialists are wasting their time if they apply for
jobs at the London International Financial Futures Exchange. For Liffe only
wants young people with personal computing and Unix experience and its
advertisements spell out that mainframe people are unlikely to fit the bill.
Liffe says such people tend to have expertise in specific technical areas,
whereas today's computing person needs an open attitude and greater
adaptability.
Such views among organisations moving to networked personal computers and
office systems have led to the emergence of the term 'zipperhead.' The
research company Xephon, in its annual handbook of IBM terminology, defines
a zipperhead as 'someone with a closed mind, typically a middle-aged person
who remembers the days when you could carry a mainframe operating system
around as a deck of punched cards - and wishes you still could'.
Job prospects for dyed-in-the-wool zipperheads are certainly falling. The
National Computing Centre's annual survey shows that programmers now make up
14 per cent of systems staff, compared with 34 per cent six years ago. The
demand now is for end-user support people, who have come from nowhere in
four years, to account for 13 per cent.
In addition there will be just four per cent growth in demand for
programmers over the next five years - compared with more than 30 per cent
for end-user support people and 40 per cent for network staff.
These findings are underlined by annual counts of job advertisements by
Salary Survey Publications for trade journal Computer Weekly. These show
that skills in local area networking and in desk-top computing products such
as Windows, Oracle and Ingres have moved into the top 10 skills in most
demand in the last three years at the expense of expertise in specialist
mainframe products.
Older people (in computing anyone over 35 seems to be seen as old) tend to
have the traditional mainframe skills. Indeed, age has a role in the
zipperhead debate. Older people might have had PCs thrust upon them, the
argument goes, but young people have grown up with them. And if the average
age of the PC or client-server team is 25 and even the manager is only 30,
how can a 45-year-old fit in?
All these issues are summed up by Mr Ian Maclachlan, professional services
director at client-server systems specialist RCMS, which has helped
companies like Bass and rank Xerox move to client-server systems.
'Mainframe staff are used to long development cycles; get heavily involved
at systems level; are programmers of logic; do not believe client-server
technology can replace the functionality and performance of legacy systems;
and understand and appreciate rigorous development methods for big
applications,' he says.
'PC staff are used to short development cycles; only work at application
level; understand personal productivity tools; expect high recognition for
their work; and have no disciplined approach to development.'
However, Mr Maclachlan's contrasting lists show room for beneficial
compromise. For example professional management of computing projects has
become a key topic in the last 18 months following government and other
reports highlighting poor quality. A national examination has been
introduced by the British Computer Society's Information Systems
Examinations Board.
The fact that traditional mainframe people have been brought up with
disciplined approaches to development is one reason why recruitment agency
Neville John Associates, in Chester, has launched a contract computing
service based on older people. As the company says, older people have seen
it all. Far from being stuck in the past, they have been through change many
times as technology has moved forward. They can bring experience, realism
and a cautious restraining hand to organisations which might be tempted to
rush for the latest over-hyped 'new' product or approach.
Research into staffing needs by the Institute of Data Processing Management
and the Women into Information Technology campaign concludes that
organisations should 'retread' existing people 'instead of replacing them by
cheaper or supposedly flexible youngsters.'
The learning curve of the latter group can be expensive, the research report
says. It adds that 'retreading should include business, marketing,
management and personal communication skills training' to enable computing
specialists to work more effectively with end-users, especially managers.
Neville John Associates and others point to another role for experienced
older people. Although today's talk is all about PCs and client-servers
systems, many important corporate systems run on mainframes. Most programs
are still written in the long-established Cobol language and there are many
in the esoteric Assembler machine language and in PL/I, dating back 12-15
years yet well proven and in daily use. Maintenance of such programs is just
the job for diehard zipperheads.
Age has long been an issue in employment and various organisations have
lobbied for years to get age discrimination outlawed, just as sex and race
discrimination are.
The arguments will probably go on forever - unlike the people involved in
them. For today's bright young thing is inevitably tomorrow's zipperhead.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (26): The last word on Unix -
X/Open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The definition of an Open System has always been open to question. Dr
Johnson, were he still labouring over his dictionary, would have to turn to
the body called X/Open for the definitive description.
X/Open, the new owner of the name Unix, has a definition that would
overshadow Johnson's own life work; 24 volumes weighing half a hundredweight
(unless delivered on compact disk).
Most associate 'openness' with Unix, the operating system adopted in the
1980s by so many minicomputer vendors that it overcame the proprietary
interests of any one, including IBM.
Ten years ago, not everyone was convinced that this committee-inspired camel
with unconventional pedigree would win out over their sleek proprietary
horses. Many backed both, just in case. But in a decade, Unix has become the
undisputed mid-range standard, which has changed the face, and more
prosaically the pricing structure, of computing.
X/Open - a collaboration of interested parties, yet also an authority over
all of them - has the job of moving the industry towards a single, unified
specification for the Unix operating system. As in religion and politics,
the most bitter fighting has been internal.
According to Geoff Morris, president of X/Open and the high priest of open
systems, there is only one way ahead and it is open.
'The world's major businesses report their external spending on open systems
will dominate 58 per cent of the world market by 1996,' he said. Mr Morris
has more detail to back up this claim. It comes from X/Open's annual market
research, called Xtra, and more than 80 IT user organisations serving on
X/Open's user council.
VESTED INTERESTS
There have been a confusing number of organisations campaigning for various
Unix causes, mostly driven by allied vendors with a vested interest. But the
Open Systems Foundation (OS/F), the defunct Unix International, and even the
Common Open Software Environment (Cose), have all been more concerned with
vendor-issues than user-led issues. X/Open works with OS/F, (whose work will
now reference X/Open's Xtra requirement process) as well as through a number
of committees and other associations such as the Object Management Group and
the Network Management Forum.
The real change for X/Open is more to do with users than vendors. Users, at
last, are demanding a place in the forum and some input into the
decision-making, especially in committee. This is perhaps the least
perceptible development, but the most significant and promising long-term
one, because 'open' is not just about new systems, and not just about Unix.
Mr Morris said, 'X/Open has suffered from being dependent on the vendor-led
community but by 1993 only half its income came from vendors, and by 1995,
it will be less than a quarter.'
Richard Jaross is director of Uniforum, an organisation set up to represent
the many different bodies with an interest in open systems. He is among
those seeking to broaden the definition - 'an open system makes it possible
for users to run their applications seamlessly across computer platforms, no
matter who wrote the underlying systems software, or who made the computing
hardware,' he said.
The market has caught up with this idea because, as Xtra confirmed, users
now put 'openness' high on the list for new systems. The spread of
client-server systems, usually with Unix-based systems at the centre, is
part of the user-led drive to downsize. But power on the desktop is more
useful if it can interface with other systems.
LONG-AWAITED MOMENT
Symbolically, in October 1993, X/Open became the owner of the name Unix.
Novell, which acquired the Unix system last year, granted its trademark
rights to X/Open for use as one of its standard brands. This marked a moment
that many Unix proponents had long hoped for, when no single vendor would
own Unix.
In September last year came the technical embodiment of this aim: Spec 1170.
This is the single specification devised to replace existing incompatible
versions after 1994, to which all products using the name Unix must comply.
The 1170 tag itself, was a reminder of how far Unix had come since it was
discovered by a generation of students doing their own thing on DEC
PDP-11/70s.
Spec 1170 is the blend between a single and a multiple Unix, which allows
individual suppliers to add extras to their products to improve performance
and functions, just as they always have.
'The events of the last year have forced the hand of Unix vendors, bringing
a more practical slant to the Unix debate,' said Mark Kusionowicz, manager
of systems product marketing in the server systems division of UK systems
supplier ICL. 'In effect, the unwelcome advance of NT has had a positive
influence on the supplier industry.'
According to an end user, Rob Winterbourne, the Unix systems support team
manager at Barclays Computer Operations, the issue of 'Unices' is less
relevant as the movement advances.
'The major benefits are in the portability of applications,' he said. 'To us
as a business, the formalisation of 'middleware' and the ability to put
pressure on suppliers is important. For Joe Developer, it shouldn't matter
if he's working on an IBM RS/6000, an HP9000 or a DEC Alpha. Spec1170 is an
indication that X/Open, while still dominated by suppliers, really is
bending towards users.'
X/Open's latest initiative is to address a marketplace not even dreamed of
when Unix was used on teletype terminals: the information highways leading
to the desktop (see D for Desktop Video). The X/Open Desktop Working Group
will address the co-existence of many different environments on one screen.
X/Open specified products will be tested - the tricky bit - and 'branded.'
Unix is the key to most Open Systems solutions and it is that rare
phenomenon in the computer industry - a standard reached by consensus. This
consensus was not achieved without casualties but the whole idea was that
some people would have to give up their own idiosyncratic interpretations of
Unix in the cause of standards.
X/Open has survived and flourished in spite of the various Unix sects, by
concentrating on deliverables like the Application Programming Interfaces
specified in 1170. Along with the most successful collaborations in the
motor industry, the pooled resources should result in developments for the
common good.
'X/Open has customers,' Mr Morris said. 'It can demonstrate where it adds
value. A few years ago, no one would have thought that of a standards
organisation.'
X/Open was set up in 1984 to oversee the technical nitty-gritty of
specifying an applications environment for Unix. Its mission statement
(aptly named given the religious fervour of its proponents), was 'to bring
greater value to users through the practical implementation of open
systems'.
Ten years ago, not everyone was convinced Unix would work, let alone X/Open.
The organisation carried all the hopes and fears of the Unix community.
Early commentators thought it a well-meaning cause doomed by political
in-fighting. To succeed it had to persuade its constituents, the suppliers,
to abandon some of the very things they had done to make Unix a more
appealing option on their particular hardware.
FRAGMENTATION
X/Open, the aim of which was to eliminate industry fragmentation, stayed
dignified throughout the so-called 'Unix wars' in which vendors aligned
themselves under separate banners, bickering over such standards as
graphical user interfaces.
Unix itself had unpromising antecedents for a universal operating system. It
was owned, not by the giant IBM but by AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications
group, which in the late 1970s was not allowed to compete in the computer
market. This resulted in text peppered with the famous trade mark, 'Unix is
a trademark of Bell Laboratories', and the farcical situation that anyone
wanting to provide Unix had to license it, debug it and badge it by some
other name - inevitably, one with an X in it.
Unix represented an opportunity for the rest of the Bunch (the term used to
describe the also-rans who competed with IBM) to create a common platform on
which applications would be portable.

Yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan owes its image as a hothouse of technology to manufactured items, with
computer hardware and components forming the bedrock of its IT industry. It
has yet to produce its own software giant, like Microsoft.
Yoshikazu Nishura, known as Joe to his colleagues at Sharp electronics in
London, spent eight years in the US. He doesn't share the West's perception
of Japan as being light years ahead.
'I felt the US is very dynamic and fast. I have a lot of worries about the
future of Japanese industry,' he says.
Nishura cites the openness of US society and the degree of co-operation
between universities and industry as strengths that Japan currently lacks.
He believes: 'In general white collar productivity is much higher in the US
than in Japan.' So where does the success of companies like Sharp spring
from?
'The Japanese are very good at certain specific tasks. Our hardware
capability is very strong because we get information from studying
manufactured items. And quality control is an area where we are very
strong.'
Quality was the key to Japan's eminence in computer chip manufacture - their
engineers are famed for their refusal to tolerate bugs and minor errors. And
Yasuo Fukami, a systems manager with Nomura Research Institute in London,
agrees this is crucial. 'Whatever you build - computers, tools or radios -
quality is important. And the Japanese are very strict on quality.'
Owned by Nomura Bank, NRI is a systems house with 5,000 clients. Prominent
among its successes is a 15 year contract with 7-11 Stores in Japan. NRI
manages the systems needs of 7-11 in a very long-term relationship,
providing the stability Japanese companies thrive under.
Software development is not a stable science as projects are notoriously
difficult to manage. Do the Japanese shy away from the prospect of
open-ended research?
Fukami thinks Japanese technologists like to know where a programme is
taking them - 'writing software is not that different from producing high
quality hardware. But we Japanese like to know what the final goal will be,'
he says.
The world of vogue high profile software products has had a hard time
breaking through in Japan. This could be evidence of a healthy scepticism.
Japanese IT directors are not easily swayed by the latest buzzword, says
Fukami. 'We have no interest in fancy words. That means Japanese companies
won't implement a new trend until they've seen it working successfully
elsewhere.'
Given the recent history of European companies embracing over-hyped
concepts, this sounds like good practice. But it has drawbacks.
'People in the UK are keen to apply technology for trial use, they're
interested in trying out new things,' says Fukami, who thinks his
countrymen's natural caution has probably inhibited the adoption of advanced
software. In the 1983 the Japanese Trade and Industry Ministry launched
Sigma, a huge project to encourage common software development standards.
Sigma ran for six years, but Japanese IT professionals are only just
learning its lessons.
Richard Hinder was Technology Counsellor at the British Embassy in Tokyo
between 1988-93. He rates Sigma as a success. 'Japanese firms took a
strategic view. The idea was to standardise software development and Sigma
created that policy. It was a typical MITI collaborative project, that
involved real action by industry.'
Hinder witnessed Japanese companies attacking software development with a
vengeance when he visited Kawazaki, south of Tokyo. 'Hitachi Information
Systems are based there,' he says.' I saw 6,000 software engineers all using
the same tool to tackle different projects.'
To some western companies this is the stuff of nightmares - an army of
programmers beavering around the clock to blow their product line out of the
water. Should the West start to worry?
Kyocera is a Japanese company that made its name in high-tech compononents
and innovative printer technology. Kyocera UK general manager Phil Murphy
has visited the parent company in Japan 10 times in the past three years.
Murphy points out the Japanese have no problem writing games programs, but
admits they still lag behind in the commercial arena.' The software issue
sticks out like a sore thumb,' he says.
The software side of Kyocera's work is carried on in California, lending
weight to suggestions that the West still has the creative mindset necessary
to make breakthroughs in complex coding.
US software giant Oracle has generated vast profits by persuading businesses
that they need its sophisticated systems. But until recently the Japanese
marketplace kept the formidable Oracle sales machine at arms length.
According to John McLevy, a senior consultancy manager at Oracle, a sea
change is under way. He organised what he considered 'a pretty boring
two-day event, a few speakers in a big hotel room' in Tokyo last September.
He was staggered by the response - 'we had 750 people on the first day,
around 1,000 the next. The Japanese have definitely woken up to the latest
software issues.'

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (25): Users link up with
groupware - Workgroups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workgroups have rocketed to prominence in technology circles through the
rise of groupware.
Groupware is software that ties together a scattered band of users working
on one project. Every amendment to a document is instantly reflected in the
overall picture, with the object of recreating electronically the sensation
of everyone working in the same room.
Lotus has dominated the groupware scene with its phenomenally successful
Notes program. However, the idea of using information technology to link up
disparate teams of people predates Notes. Any network of computers creates a
workgroup. Observers point out Notes merely takes an existing capability and
markets it in a fresh sense.
This is a little unkind, as Notes links constellations of users across a PC
network at an affordable price. And it has notched up 750,000 users
worldwide, so there is a real demand for groupware. But workgroup facilities
have been around for years through networking.
The key to current workgroup thinking is the need to disperse information
across a corporate body. Commercial survival, according to the management
mantra is dependent on sharing every scrap of information the company
possesses. Keep your people communicating and create a corporate knowledge
base that has the edge over competitors.
The rush into 'flat structures' has involved wholesale massacres of the
workforce so the diminished payroll needs to pool its experience and sharpen
its wits. Workgroups are a potential route to productivity among white
collar staff.
Pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo employs Cooperation, a workgroup software suite
from AT&amp;T's NCR arm, to manage assorted computer applications. Cooperation
sits on top of desktop systems at Glaxo's headquarters at Ware in
Hertfordshire. The company uses it to control existing programs, known in
the trade as legacy systems.
'Our primary use of Cooperation is as a tool to hide the legacy systems,'
says Peter Swinburne, head of IT at Glaxo. The 100 users in manufacturing,
planning, new product development and customer services get a standard
computer procedure through the groupware shell.
This is groupware promoting productivity, and with a total investment of
Pounds 300,000. Swinburne regards it as 'an integral part of our IT
strategy'. It is estimated the market in workgroup products will reach
Pounds 3.5bn by 1998, which includes consultancy and installation as well as
software sales for US corporations.
The business implications are profound enough for a UK consortium to launch
a joint project with the DTI. Computer Supported Cooperative Work is a
Pounds 13m scheme intended to promote workgroup practices in the
restructured company of the 1990s.
ACT Business Systems is managing one of the CSCW projects, the imaginatively
named Business Flight Simulator. This is a best-selling computer game that
resides on PCs across the world as an entertaining alternative to work.
BFS is a Pounds 530,000 venture that gathers up current and imminent
groupware products to create an infrastructure to encourage their use. The
Post Office and Cheshire County Council are trialling these programs, tied
together in a local area network
BFS is not about technological innovation. 'We aim to use standard
products', says Paul Ballard, senior consultant at ACT.
Instead, its objective is to test the principles of decision-making in
groups linked by IT.
Action support is one of the key BFS motifs. This means decisions are not
left hanging but are communicated to those people responsible for following
through. Management should be able to monitor what actually happens after a
brainstorming session via the PC and its groupware.
Despite CSCW's high-powered image, it ran straight into a traditional brick
wall. 'We recognise that giving senior managers the technology and expecting
them to use it is a problem,' says Ballard. The difficulty - diplomatically
couched as 'humanistic' - is that senior staff still know a lot less about
IT than their secretaries. The BFS will only really take off when
participants are truly at ease with a keyboard and screen. Naming the system
after a popular computer game may be one way of breaking down resistance.
British Aerospace is another participant in the CSCW movement. Designers as
Users of Co-operative Knowledge ('Duck') aims to allow engineers to work as
if sharing a single office. The vehicle for Duck is simultaneous multiple
access to a project log, relying on a computer network. Distributed
engineering teams are common to BAe, and anything that streamlines their
working practices stands to save money.
Workgroups will thrive. They've been around long enough. The immortal image
of the Battle of Britain's operations room, where people shoved symbols
across a map of the South Coast with billiard cues, was an example of a
workgroup in action. If 1940s technology could successfully co-ordinate the
expertise of an entire air force, CSCW should be able to enlist managers in
the battle for business.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (24): Glimpse of alternative
worlds - Virtual Reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The computer's ability to create alternative worlds has been one of its
great fascinations.
Recent advances in technology have taken this idea to the limit and a
computer user can now be 'transported' to a virtual reality, where, in
theory, all things are possible.
At one extreme, it is now possible to dress in a body suit equipped with
sensors, put on a headset with built-in sound and vision and step into
another world. At a more mundane level, the same technology can be used to
manipulate molecules, design drugs or re-design your garden.
Despite the recent hype surrounding virtual reality, it is still a long way
from the total experience written about in science fiction stories. The
so-called 'immersive' virtual reality experience, which uses headsets and
body movement sensors, is still at the level of a fairground ride with all
that this implies.
Users complain of disorientation after only a few minutes which is fine for
a fairground but of little use in business.
At the practical, non-immersive end - where the user sits at a desktop
screen and controls the software with a keyboard and mouse - the technology
is proving to be useful in a number of commercial areas.
Market researcher Frost &amp; Sullivan forecasts an overall growth rate of 65
per cent a year in the US, with revenues exceeding a billion dollars by
1997.
Leisure-based applications are expected to dominate throughout this period
and show the largest growth. But commercial applications of virtual reality
on the desktop are likely to be the most profitable - with training, data
visualisation and computer-aided design leading the way.
The breakthrough in computing which has made virtual reality possible comes
from the emergence of interactive, three-dimensional graphics systems. These
systems have evolved from two distinct areas of computing: computer-aided
design (CAD) and games software. Both areas need software which lets users
interact with three-dimensional images. They both need hardware which is
fast enough to make the images appear 'real'.
Advantages for users
Until recently, CAD and games software developed separately. CAD
developments were restricted to expensive, specialised workstations and
games software concentrated on intuitive interfaces. The emergence of
concepts like multimedia and virtual reality has drawn them together.
At the same time, the price/performance improvements in standard personal
computer hardware have made it possible to spread these advantages to a
wider number of users.
Desktop personal computers - like the Apple Macintosh or PC's based on
Intel's 486 and Pentium processors - are powerful enough to handle
three-dimensional graphics and convey an impression of 'space' to the user.
This makes it possible to 'walk' around buildings which don't exist and
'visit' places on the other side of the world without leaving the desk.
The number of VR applications for desktop computers is growing. Superscape,
a software tool from the UK company Superscape VR (formerly Dimension), can
be used to show the effects of drugs on the human body. The software allows
a user to navigate around a representation of the body and 'see' the effect
of a drug at the molecular level.
About 30 applications have been built with Superscape so far - with most
ideas coming from customers. Superscape has also been used to build
environments as diverse as a telecom network simulation for British Telecom
and an exhibition modelling system for Dragon Exhibitions.
Tyne and Wear Development Corporation has created a virtual reality model of
the Pounds 180 million Quayside development in Newcastle. The virtual
reality Quayside is being used to show prospective investors what the
development will look like before it is built.
Faberushi, another UK VR specialist has built a multimedia virtual
exhibition system (VES) which re-creates the sound, look and feel of an
exhibition floor.
Maxis, a US software company, has built a package which simulates the Wall
Street Stock Exchange in the form of a casino. Prospective 'investors' can
risk their funds and enjoy themselves at the same time.
It is still early days for virtual reality and attention will continue to
focus on the extremes rather than on practical applications. But companies
exploring the practical applications of virtual reality are likely to be
among tomorrow's leaders.
Virtuality, a UK company specialising in the commercial area, came to the
London Stock Exchange near the end of 1993 and has been one of the fastest
growing stocks in the UK. Superscape VR is to follow Virtuality to the stock
market this summer.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (23): Why users remain sceptical
 -'Upgrades'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An upgrade used to be a liberation sought by users. They were running out of
space, they needed more capacity, there was some wonderful software that
required extra hardware. Or the old software had a few bugs in it, and the
new version had some lovely features instead.
An upgrade was equally a concept which struck horror to the heart of all in
the IT department, who knew from bitter experience that nothing worked as
well after the so-called improvement. It did, however, keep IT staff in
work, ferreting out the bugs and explaining to users why they had lost two
days' work because of a slight incompatibility between the old system and
the new.
That was in the old days. In the 1990s, computing is a populist occupation,
and everybody has their own favourite tools. They know what they like, and
oddly enough, it happens to be what they know. You might need more capacity
to run beefier software, or to go from a single-user to a networked version
of your product, but the problems in upgrading are no longer to do with the
hardware, nor software. It's in convincing people that there is anything in
it for them. The IT department has a new challenge: keeping track of who is
using what, and trying to move everyone on to the same version of the same
software.
The acronym 'Wysiwyg' appeared in the 1980s to sum up the new guise of
computing: What You See Is What You Get. No-one, however, came up with a
sobriquet to sum up the conundrum with which generations of developers and
users have wrestled. The closest contender is 'Whynger' - When You Never Get
Exact Requirements, (an acronym devised by the judging panel of CA's
Business Software Challenge). The need for upgrades, new releases, new
improved versions, is driven by the fact that users never know exactly what
they want until they've got it, and then it's never quite right.
You have to suffer to be upgraded - 'I upgraded to DOS 6, hit a double-space
and lost all my data,' laments Barry Denton, who as director of client
services for Barclays Computer Operations, is responsible for tens of
thousands of end-users of Barclays Bank computer systems. Denton believes
that the real problem posed by upgrading is testing.
'Clients now have such variety of software and hardware that exhaustive
testing is impossible, and even the smallest change can cause problems that
ricochet. The suppliers always presume that people want to upgrade, but more
than two-thirds of the users want to 'stay put' because there is always a
light element of suspicion that there'll be problems.'
These days suppliers want to move you on, because it's expensive to support
multiple versions of a product. The over-the-counter PC software market
actually relies on 'add-on sales' for revenue, (rather than annual licensing
as in larger systems) and has a vested interest in moving users on to the
next version.
'FREE' UPGRADES
In early days, operating systems (OSs) were proprietary. This meant a
certain change of operating system when moving from one computer to another.
This was the case even when sticking with the same supplier, such as ICL or
IBM, and moving up the mainframe range. Software was licensed (still is, in
many products with a mainframe heritage) and upgrades 'free' within the
annual fee.
Digital Equipment, the first company to propose a real alternative to the
mainframe with its famed PDP 11 range, seized on and perfected the idea of
having an 'upgradeable' operating system. DEC's VMS allowed users to start
small and progress up through hardware upgrades without any software
changes.
Other mid-range suppliers followed by adopting the now standard Unix
operating system. This 'openness' makes hardware upgrades easier within such
a 'platform.' IBM put the same lesson into practice with its 'upgradeable'
mid-range AS400 computer.
Hardware homogeneity makes upgrades much easier for software developers to
provide. The personal computer software industry was quick to exploit the
potential of a platform that everybody shared.
The PC explosion started with CP/M, the universal eight-bit microprocessor
OS. When IBM picked Microsoft's MS-DOS for its PC, it provided the
foundations of today's PC software industry and Microsoft's own greatness.
Concepts such as interoperability, portability, connectivity, have become a
reality, taking the fear out of changing environments. But what users really
want is to stay cosy, with what they know, (such as Lotus or Excel
spreadsheets) sacrificing nothing, but at the same time having access to the
smorgasbord of goodies available through the mainframe.
Alongside 'standard' operating systems, client-server systems allow users
power on the desktop, with the flexibility of hooking into databases
elsewhere when necessary. For example, Lotus Notes users can access
'enterprise-wide data' from mainframe and mid-range databases. Trinzic's
InfoHub provides access to 'legacy' databases for PC users.
In recognition of the innate conservatism of users, software development
tools have appeared to move users ever onward and upward. Ian McPhee,
president of Watcom, talks about 'scaleability' and 'shrink-wrapped
client-server' when explaining Watcom's Powerbuilder desktop version - 'the
whole thrust is to upgrade people's skills, to move them out of the PC
database environment,' he says.
Flexibility is wonderful for users, but difficult to support. Devolving
power to the users often means ending up with a mess of incompatible
systems, not as 'open' as people had hoped, and very expensive to maintain.
Keeping hardware and software in step is a skill of its own.
Many companies with their origins in proprietary hardware manufacture
(Olivetti, Unisys, Siemens Nixdorf, to name but three) fervently embraced
Unix and the Open Systems principle. They discovered that, where most things
were equal in hardware terms, their services had to be distinguished by
'added value' - consultancy and services.
They have become single source suppliers, a one-stop-shop selling,
implementing and subsequently supporting complete solutions, also taking on
board all the hassles of upgrades. Olivetti's Customer Support Group's
Supportnet service includes a 'software audit' that determines who is using
what, and provides advice on how to upgrade by staying in step with new
versions.
Lee Francis, general manager of the Siemens Nixdorf PC business unit,
suggests leasing, and pursuing a forward-looking purchasing strategy - 'by
choosing the right IT partner, an IT specialist that can provide total PC
solutions, including support, training, and finance, organisations can enjoy
the most up to date PC platform,' he says.
Even Legent, the supplier of mainframe performance software, is making a
move into supporting client server. 'The thing people do least well is to
manage the three aspects of performance, capacity and finance in an
integrated way,' says Legent marketing director Steve Hughes. 'The move to
distributed software brings that home. There are new tricks for users to
learn in systems management: we have 25 years experience.'
Oracle's Jocelyn Hartland-Swann, vice president of business process
re-engineering, sums up 'the people aspect' of upgrading in four words -
'All change is loss,' he says. 'But providing information to people does
help to redress the balance, reminding them of the unpleasantness that is
being removed, and the good things to come.'

Software builders have tried to apply engineering disciplines to software
production for more than a quarter of a century with the hope that one day
software can be produced as easily as automobiles.
But only recently - with the advent of new techniques such as
object-oriented design - has some progress has been made outside a few
specialist areas.
Software for use in 'life-or-death' applications such as aerospace and
defence has made most use of the engineering approach using standard
components and production engineering processes.
The large development budgets available to build these systems make it
possible to use expensive procedures to control the design and development
of software. Such development methods emphasise meticulous early design,
tight project control and the use of tried and tested 'components'.
Commercial software production - with its tighter delivery schedules and
limited budgets - has not, so far, been able to take much advantage of
engineering techniques. Despite attempts to introduce computer-aided
software engineering (CASE) development methods, commercial software
production remains more a craft than an engineering discipline.
This looks set to change in the next few years.
The main drive towards the engineering approach has come from
object-oriented computing, which is now widely accepted as the most
important future direction for software design.
The use of standard 'parts' or 'components' is a key concept in
object-oriented design. In the same way that a motor car manufacturer buys
in parts such as gear boxes and engines, the object-oriented software
developer builds systems from proven software components.
Most software tool developers are using object-oriented (O-O) techniques to
reinforce the engineering approach: 'Object-oriented computing is now
showing promise because it can deal with repeatable development processes.
It has reached a level of maturity where components can be re-used and,
slowly, the dream of software engineering is being realised,' says Mr Don
Kavanagh, European consultancy manager from software tool developer
Interactive Data Environments (IDE).
'But it goes well beyond simple code re-use. Objects let you re-use
high-level concepts too. You can build high-level enterprise objects which
are like engineering blueprints.'
He adds that applications of the future will be built like Lego models -
which will make it easier for non-programmers to engineer their own
applications from kits of parts. This has profound implications for the
software industry - 'the structure of the software industry is changing in a
way which poses a threat to traditional assembly line programming,' says Mr
Dave Thomas, founder and chief executive of Object Technology International,
which specialises in O-O software tools - 'we are seeing a move to creating
high-level user objects which are business specific. Banks like Morgan
Stanley and Credit Suisse are building object-oriented financial options
'components' which they could publish for general use,' says Mr Thomas.
This trend has been highlighted recently with the foundation of the Business
Object Management Special Interest Group (Bomsig), which aims to create
applications objects for specific industries.
There are certain processes which all companies in an industrial sector use.
In the past, they have each developed their own expensive software to deal
with such issues as industry standards and government legislation. Bomsig
participants hope to create standard 'parts' appropriate to particular
industries which all companies can license.
NO EASY ANSWERS
But this will not be without its problems. Dr Robert Rockwell, chief
technology adviser at German software engineering specialist Softlab
suggests that the origins of O-O design place a question mark over the long
term success of the engineering approach: 'The concept of engineering
software is one of the Holy Grails of the software industry. But there is a
large class of software which can't be produced in this way,' he says.
'Engineering is about standard parts and standard procedures. Objects
certainly give you standard parts - but their background runs counter to
standard procedures.'
Dr Rockwell says object technology comes from institutions with flat
hierarchies with no bosses and no standard procedures - such as universities
and research laboratories. This puts it in direct conflict with the
traditional business approaches to building software - where procedures are
imposed from the top.
The main problem with software is, of course, that it is unlike any other
human artefact. Analogies with other production processes while useful are,
therefore, bound to be inadequate. This makes software production hard to
define formally and, ultimately, difficult to 'engineer.' There is no doubt
that the object-oriented approach is a step forward. It will help to
reinforce a more disciplined approach to creating applications software
through use of tried-and-tested components.
Whether it will lead to a golden age of genuine software engineering,
however, remains unclear.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (22): Software star of the
Olympics - Transaction Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the stars at this year's Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway,
was, according to IBM, a 25-year-old software package.
Known by the initials CICS, this veteran program was responsible for
managing the results and information network installed at the games.
The journalists and commentators in Lillehammer were unaware that they were
CICS 'users' as the intricacies of the technology were hidden by a
user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs - with their pull-down menus,
icons and overlapping windows). But they joined millions of people around
the world who, unknowingly, rely on CICS software every day.
You probably are a CICS user yourself. Many of the automatic teller machines
(ATM) operated by banks and building societies are controlled by CICS and
most large companies use it.
CICS - an acronym for for Customer Information Control System - is the most
successful example of a transaction processing (TP) monitor. It addresses a
persistent problem in computing: how to share a single resource among many
users.
Typically, TP monitors like CICS are used to control access to important
data and ensure it does not become corrupt.
In a banking system a TP monitor controls access from ATMs to individual
accounts. The standard procedure involves entering a magnetic stripe card
into the machine's reader, typing in a personal identification number (PIN)
and requesting a service, such as cash withdrawal or balance statement.
The ATM sends a series of messages to a central computer, where the account
details are checked. If the user is authorised, a message is sent back to
the ATM to carry out the customer's request. With all of these messages
moving around the network, it is easy to imagine that an important one might
get lost. This is where the TP monitor comes in, by ensuring that messages
get to the right destination and that appropriate data files are updated. It
also synchronises changes to data and makes sure that users do not have to
wait too long for a response.
As the longevity of CICS illustrates, TP monitors are well-established in
large-scale mainframe data processing. PC networks, however, do not as yet
have mechanisms like this. But with a move to client-server computing, (see
page four), they are being expected to provide the security and the
resilience to equal mainframes and minicomputers.
A COMPLEX TASK
Controlling communication traffic between many computers and environments
attached to a network is a complex task at any level. But the software
structures needed to make an open network of personal computers and servers
match the mainframe for performance and reliability are only now beginning
to find their way on to the PC agenda.
The root of the problem lies in how business transactions are processed.
These involve far more than passing an 'e-mail' message or a request for
data to a server - functions which a PC network can perform adequately
enough. Processing business transactions demands a solid foundation of
management software to make sure that it is properly controlled.
When, for example, a company receives an order, a whole sequence of
processes is set in motion. The customer's credit is checked, the ledger is
updated, stock counts are reduced and so on. Some of these processes follow
each other and others can happen in parallel. Above all, they must be
controlled and managed - or orders may be lost or duplicated.
If the order processing application is distributed across a client/server
network, a high-level, transaction 'manager' - a sort of 'super' TP monitor
 -is essential.
There are a number of possible candidates for this role. Conventional TP
monitors are being extended from their proprietary base to cope with 'open'
client-server systems and IBM has extended CICS to all of its main hardware
platforms and operating environments - in addition to licensing it to other
manufacturers. Novell is developing the Tuxedo monitor, which it inherited
from its takeover of Unix Systems Laboratories, to compete with CICS in
client-server systems.
Database software developers are also building transaction management
features into their database products. Oracle, Ingres, Sybase and Informix
all offer some level of transaction management as part of their products.
Emerging standards in object-oriented computing (see software engineering,
this page) also include transaction management features.
It seems likely that the problem of managing transactions in an open
client-server environment will be solved by a combination of one or more of
these approaches. What is clear, however, is that it is a problem which will
continue to grow and demand the attention of software developers across
every aspect of modern computing.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (19): A help in reducing the
risks - Quality Programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Standards Institute (BSI) has a lot to answer for. When BS5750
was introduced as a national standard for quality management systems in 1979
it launched a whole raft of management trends, with associated jargon.
Attaining BS5750 became a significant totem in the burgeoning religion of
Total Quality Management (TQM). Quality itself is no bad thing but BS5750
certification appears to generate enthusiasm for the number as much as the
ethos it represents.
Mark Churchward is an Oxford-based independent technology consultant who
greets the rise of the quality culture: 'I've been an evangelist for
quality. BS5750 is a bit like a creed. When you say you're going to do
things a certain way, you have to do it that way.'
But he concedes that getting a quality stamp is no panacea - 'there isn't
any inherent yardstick which ensures that staff work towards a better
quality company.' In other words, without a tool to measure your quality
process, the whole affair degenerates into yet another exercise in nebulous
management jargon.
A company applies for BSI accreditation. The BSI or an approved outside body
works with the applicant to ensure that its quality principles are applied
rigorously across the board. Registration, costing upwards of Pounds 990
(for the smallest firm) is then awarded, after which the company can expect
at least two booked inspections a year from the BSI or the outside body. So
measurement is an extremely practical step; it keeps the inspectors happy.
Can software meet this need for measurement? Ajay Sood was advising on
technology requirements at Peterhead Polytechnic when he realised 'that
quality assessment management had problems.' Sood believed that BS5750 was
'becoming a paper exercise.' His answer was to defect from academe and enter
the commercial fray with a Peterhead colleague. Their company, Orchid, is a
small software house based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne dedicated to writing
programs that put BS5750 into practice.
Orchid was launched on the back of thorough research: 'We picked the top 200
companies in the north-east and booked an hour to talk with the quality
managers.'
Apparently these people feel themselves to be a neglected and misunderstood
species and Sood's survey offered them some much appreciated therapy. It
emerged that quality managers are finding the much-vaunted quality standard
a bit of a bind.
Over 84 per cent of the quality managers questioned described themselves as
'computer novices,' although the vast majority used some form of computer
records. But the reports generated from quality management activity varied
from site to site. Without a fixed format the national standard was being
monitored in an imprecise way.
'The trouble with BS5750 is that it really is one big headache in terms of
paper,' says Sood. Not that this deters the rush to quality certification -
'there are companies going for it for its own sake.'
Orchid's balm for the hard-pressed and isolated quality manager is a progam
called Computerised Quality Management (CQM). Written for the IBM-PC and
costing between Pounds 750 and Pounds 7,000, CQM controls the documentation
spawned by BS5750. CQM lists the staff responsible for quality assurance and
assigns relevant documents to them. It sets up an internal audit trail that
allows the quality manager to review procedures, note achievements and
isolate failures of quality.
Among practical benefits claimed by Orchid is a diary generated
automatically by CQM to outline the quality manager's future activities in
any given week.
Dunlop Hydraulic Hose at Gateshead is a CQM site. Quality assurance manager
Alan Donnelly points out that BS5750 amounts to a good operating procedure
'that you'd expect to find in any successful company.' But a dedicated
quality program formalises his task. That in turn keeps BSI certification on
board. CQM proves to the inspectors that the job is being done.
Software development is a notoriously risky business. Projects fall
hopelessly behind schedule and run over budget. Praxis is a Bath-based
software house set up in 1983. Chairman Martyn Thomas has always felt that
software could benefit from a strict regime of quality control. Praxis
achieved BS5750 registration in 1986.
According to Mr Thomas, this meant much more than another certificate to
hang on the boardroom wall - 'we put in place a quality management system
that has saved us a huge amount of money. We have standards for notation,
how plans are signed off, who has final approval. The whole principle is
that we think about how to assure quality to begin with.'
Praxis feels confident bidding for fixed-price contracts - 'the running
costs of quality assurance add no more than 1 per cent to the cost of a
project. But it takes the risk out of the system. Our average variance from
cost estimates is 10 per cent. Before we started to apply quality management
it was 20 per cent.'
For Praxis, quality means knowing a contract will bring home a profit.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (20): Advances in large scale
storage - Raid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAID stands for 'redundant array of inexpensive discs,' a term coined by
computer scientists at the University of California in 1987 and now
increasingly embodied in disc storage products for systems of all sizes.
However, significant advances in disc technology since 1987 have complicated
the RAID argument just as manufacturers are expanding their RAID offerings
from office systems into the mainframe computer market.
The original research aimed to ease a problem caused by increases in
computer speed. Processors were held back by the time it took to access data
stored on electro-mechanical discs systems.
So researchers replaced a single large disc with several smaller ones.
Performance improved, because several drives were working simultaneously on
recording or retrieving a piece of information.
However, increasing the number of discs also heightened the risk of failure
of the total system. Traditional mass storage discs (known as SLED for
'single large expensive discs') were far more reliable than the 5.25-inch
disc drives of 1987, which typically broke down once every 25,000 hours:
this meant that an array of 10 would hit a problem every 14 weeks.
The researchers therefore built in redundancy, so that a problem in one
drive would not bring down the entire system. They specified what they
called five RAID levels, later expanded to seven. Some have been largely
discarded because of their impact on performance.
TWO BROAD TYPES
The RAID levels fall into two broad types: one involves recording all data
simultaneously on two discs, so that one is an exact copy of the other. This
is known as disc mirroring or shadowing. Data retrieval is faster than on
single discs because data is retrieved from both discs at once. If one disc
fails, the system continues without interruption, because all the data is
still available.
The other RAID technique is known as striping: here data is recorded, or
'striped,' across the array of discs. If one disc fails, the system can work
out the lost data by performing arithmetic on check digits stored with
related data on the other discs.
In some RAID striping levels the check data is stored on a disc of its own.
Recovering the lost data can take 20 minutes or more in a big system and,
while the recovery is going on, the performance of the overall system is
significantly affected.
Side benefits of RAID systems include the fact that they use less power and
generate less heat than traditional large disc drives. They also occupy less
floor space: the disc drives, typically placed on top of each other, are
standard 3.5 or 5.25-inch units found in personal computers, compared with
the traditional big discs measuring up to 14 inches.
Most RAID suppliers have focused initially on networked PCs and business
minicomputers, typically Unix machines and the IBM AS/400. Supplier
Hewlett-Packard says the PC market in particular is receptive to the RAID
idea.
'PC users expect disc drives to fail and are accustomed to cheap,
low-capacity, keep-a-couple-of-spares-handy units,' the company says.
'They are also likely to see disc drives, like PCs, as commodities and buy
on this basis rather than worrying about a quality system from a big-name
supplier.
'In addition, PC data tends not to get backed up regularly: the network is
typically a part-time responsibility for one person in the office. Users
therefore see RAID offering protection against failure and reducing the need
for back-up.'
Most manufacturers are only just launching RAID products in the mainframe
market, partly because here the PC arguments are all reversed.
Computing managers expect disc systems to have high reliability, capacity
and performance; they also have specialists whose jobs include regular
back-ups.
However, EMC Computer Systems, which has been in the mainframe market since
1990 with a RAID level one disc mirroring system, believes that disc
technology has progressed so quickly that debates about which RAID levels
are best have become irrelevant.
The company supports its case by pointing to the fact that after three years
it has become the third biggest supplier of mainframe disc storage, with a
15 per cent market share. EMC director Mr David Facer says that the
reliability of small discs has leapt to between 0.5m and 0.8m hours between
failures.
Simultaneously, capacities of these discs have increased from 200 megabytes
(1m characters) when the RAID research was being done to 2,000 megabytes or
more today. These figures mean that an array of 10 discs, equalling the
capacity of a single big mainframe disc drive, should only break down only
once every six to nine years. Indeed, EMC is so confident about today's disc
drives that the RAID level one mirroring feature is merely an option: the
disc redundancy issue is removed altogether. Instead, EMC uses fast
electronic memory to provide fail-safe facilities. Such memory is
increasingly being built into disc systems to hold frequently-used data and
thus reduce the need to access electro-mechanical disc storage.
Studies from research firm IDC support Mr Facer when he argues that the
falling cost of disc drives has brought the price of mirrored systems down
to that of striped systems, especially when the extra costs and performance
overheads of controlling the striping are taken into account.
Demand for data storage is said to be growing at 40 per cent a year. As more
and more information goes on-line, demand for faster and faster access is
likely to increase.
As Mr Facer puts it: 'The issue isn't about RAID: it's about
high-performance reliable storage at the right price.'

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (18): Giants line up for a battle
royal - Power PC/Pentium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though it would be easy to consider the competition between Complex
Instruction Set Computer (CISC) processors and Reduced Instruction Set
Computer (RISC) processors as a straight fight for world supremacy between
Intel's x86 family and the IBM/Motorola/Apple PowerPC, the situation is not
quite that simple.
There are other factors in the equation, such as what happens in the world
of operating systems and workstations. But a battle royal does seem likely.
For the first time in 12 years Intel's dominance of desktop and personal
computing processors has been threatened. Its designs are tied to a
pantechnicon of baggage from its past successes. Every new design has to
make sure that applications written five or even 10 years ago can run in the
new environment.
RISC processors, on the other hand, have been specifically designed to run a
set of instructions that have been optimised to meet the needs of desktop
applications. As such, they are ready to take on the demands of new
operating systems and new applications requirements like multimedia,
communications and complex, rich document structures. They also have enough
power to emulate the 'old world' of the PC, if those applications are needed
in the newer environments, while leaving much of the baggage behind.
Intel's response to RISC processors came a year ago with the launch of the
Pentium, but the circuit is big, hot and offers only marginal performance
improvements over the 486 processor. It's also still expensive, costing
around Dollars 700 each in lots of 1,000.
Although the Pentium is still in production, this year it has had a
significant redesign which reduces the chip size by 45 per cent, reduces the
voltage required from 5V to 3.3V, and reduces the design geometries from 0.8
micron to 0.6 micron. Most important of all, the clock speed goes up from
66MHz to 90MHz, with 100MHz available in limited quantities.
Known as the P54C, this solves many of the problems with the earlier device,
nearly doubling performance on industry-accepted benchmarks. It also reduces
heat dissipation, making it much more amenable to use.
The PowerPC, designed by IBM, Motorola and Apple, is by far the strongest
rival Intel has had to face. The first processor, the PowerPC 601, has
recently been upgraded from 66MHz to 100MHz and its performance is ahead of
the P54C. Its price is down to Dollars 238 each in lots of 20,000.
The alliance has a range of other processors in the family, including the
603 for low-end, low-power consumption applications and the 620 for high-end
workstations.
PowerPC is such a strong contender because it is the first RISC processor to
be manufactured by a merchant-market semiconductor producer, Motorola. While
Motorola makes only the component, all other RISC processors are
manufactured as part of a larger business model - where they are an integral
part of, and so funded by, the sale of complete workstations.
Motorola's processor families, the 68xxx and 81xxx, have either been beaten
in the market by Intel or other RISC processor suppliers. The company
therefore has a strong vested interest in seeing PowerPC succeed and is
prepared to use the tighter margins and aggressive marketing common in the
semiconductor industry.
The workstation market itself is changing. Workstations are usually
powerful, expensive, specialist systems, but the arrival of Pentium means
that a typical PC can now provide similar performance at far more aggressive
price points.
Perhaps the most important question, however, is in software. Intel and
PowerPC can, or will be able to, run the leading operating systems for the
forseeable future, such as Microsoft's WindowsNT, Unix (especially the
unified X/Open variety), OS/2 and the WorkPlace OS coming later this year.
PowerPC's advantage in the field of software is that it can also run Apple
Macintosh applications. Though often sidelined as a niche product, the
Macintosh accounts for about 15 per cent of the desktop market and has a
number of applications, especially in areas such as multimedia, crying out
for higher performance hardware. Intel is unlikely to take this threat lying
down. It has the resources to be aggressive in the market and is bound to
respond. But as Compaq Computer's announcement in February - that it is
seriously considering using PowerPC - demonstrates, for the first time Intel
has a real fight on its hands.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (17): Heart of the software
conflict - Operating Systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Operating systems software has been at the centre of epic struggles in the
computer industry for over a decade - when attention first started to shift
from hardware to software. The choice of operating system continues to be
one of the most contentious issues in software and is at the heart of a
battle for dominance between three of the world's largest software
suppliers: IBM, Microsoft and Novell.
These three suppliers are responsible for developing the three most
important contenders in the future operating system market: OS/2, Windows NT
and Unix.
Operating systems provide the link between applications software and
hardware. They insulate the user's software from hardware changes and make
it possible to move applications to other hardware platforms. This is why it
is so important for users to choose the right operating system environment.
If they choose wrongly, they could find themselves out of the mainstream and
lose the advantages of a mass market.
There are parallels with the earlier battle for dominance in the proprietary
large systems market, from which IBM emerged as the winner.
The current three-cornered conflict is complex and has its origins in the
changes which began a decade ago. In the 1980s, a shift in the economies of
scale to chip production led manufacturers away from proprietary hardware
development to standard 'commodity' products for two different markets. They
built personal computers for the small 'stand-alone' use and 'open'
multi-user systems for medium-size applications. In both cases, they adopted
common operating systems: Microsoft's MS/DOS for the PC and Unix for the
larger multi-user systems.
Standard operating systems brought advantages both to software suppliers and
to customers. The spread of Unix in the technical and engineering computer
market in the 1970s helped to create today's 'open' systems. And the spread
of MS/DOS during the 1980s created a mass market for software products. This
has brought prices down and increased competition.
As hardware advanced and the demand for new applications increased, the
limitations of both Unix and MS/DOS became apparent, however. The main
problem is that MS/DOS could not be used to scale up applications. This gave
Unix an opportunity to plug the gap. Unix had become widely available on
smaller computers and threatened the dominance of MS/DOS.
But although it was more advanced than MS/DOS, Unix, too, had its
limitations.
First, there were many different versions. The hardware manufacturers found
it difficult to break their proprietary technology habits. As a result, they
'enhanced' their versions of Unix, making it difficult to move applications
from one version to another.
Second, Unix's background meant that it was not suited for business use.
There were no access security features, the user interface was complex and
its data file system was primitive.
It was this, and other limitations, which led IBM and Microsoft back to the
drawing board in 1987. They announced the development of OS/2, a new
operating system which aimed to overcome many of the problems of MS/DOS and
fight off the threat from Unix. Progress was slow, however, and Microsoft
continued to develop its Windows graphical user interface (GUI) in parallel
to make life easier for MS/DOS users. More important, OS/2 demanded large
hardware resources and required that applications be completely re-written.
Although it became possible to run MS/DOS applications under later versions
of OS/2, the timing was too late.
In 1989, Microsoft launched Version 3 of Windows, which quickly became one
of the fastest selling software products of all time. The launch coincided
with a bitter split between IBM and Microsoft, leading to the latter's
withdrawal from the project.
Meanwhile, application developers flocked in their thousands to build
products for Windows, which was a relatively easy step forward from MS/DOS.
Windows 3 brought the added advantage that it could run most existing MS/DOS
applications, in addition to those developed specifically for the GUI. Many
developers abandoned their OS/2 products or put them on the backburner.
Windows 3 became the foundation for subsequent Microsoft operating systems:
Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT which competes technically with both
OS/2 and Unix, with the added advantage of backwards compatibility with
Windows. Meanwhile IBM has continued to develop OS/2 and sell it to its
traditional corporate customer base. And the Unix market has drawn together
to agree a common specification.
Last year, the responsibility for Unix development passed to network
software supplier Novell when it took over Unix System Laboratories (USL)
from AT&amp;T.
CONTENDERS
During the late 1980s, Novell plugged a gap left by Microsoft and IBM -
networking software for MS/DOS personal computers. It dominates this growing
market, but is itself under threat. Windows NT and OS/2 include their own
networking control software, making Netware unnecessary.
Novell aims to combine Unix with its Netware networking software, which has
projected it into the front-line of the operating system battle. All three
contenders are seen as viable winners. But a more likely result is that the
battle will slowly fizzle out. New techniques for building software, such as
object-oriented computing, make it less important where the underlying
control software comes from and the three products seem likely to converge
in the long term.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (14): No longer a Cinderella
sector - Mass storage devices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mass storage has always been something of a poor relation to other, higher
profile forms of information technology, but the arrival of the CD-Rom
(compact optical disk with a read-only memory) has improved its status.
Now, with the advent of multimedia - the latest technology which
incorporates text, graphics, sound and video - the CD Rom is set to come
into its own. Multimedia needs huge quantities of fast, cheap mass storage,
something CD Rom can provide.
The CD-Rom combines a high capacity for data storage with reasonable (and
improving) data retrieval times, reasonable writing speed and a cheap
platform for publishable data.
Compact disc technology is now well known through the wide use of the
laser-based CD players found in most hi-fi systems, which use the same basic
digital data storage system. Two of the three types of CD-ROMs will affect
the development of multimedia.
The first is the read-only CD-Rom. This is an increasingly popular form for
applications for both consumer and business to business users.
Those applications can include general business packages, such as word
processing, spreadsheet and databases. Here CD-Roms are far more
cost-effective and convenient than floppy disks. One CD-Rom has space for
several programs, whereas anything up to 20 floppy disks may be needed to
carry instructions for one program.
Program installation is therefore easier, and the disks have enough space to
provide demonstrations of other programs so users can experiment. If they
decide to buy the application, the supplier will give them the information
to unlock the rest of the program.
CD-Roms are also useful for publishing databases and companies such as
Microsoft have not been slow to see the information and education
possibilities. Encyclopedias, reference works and art collections are just
three areas now available on database.
The second CD-Rom to affect multimedia is the magneto-optical rewritable
disk. This is similar to the magnetic floppy and hard disk, as data can be
written and rewritten on it. Its advantages are again a high capacity and
low cost but its slow writing and reading speeds compare unfavourably with
magnetic disks.
The technology is continuously being improved. Drives for the popular 5.25
inch diameter disks are now being replaced by drive units capable of running
cheaper and smaller 3.5 inch disks.
Furthermore, access times to the stored data are now down to 300
milliseconds and below, and manufacturers are moving the digital signal
processing from 16-bits to 32-bits, which will improve the access times and
data throughput.
Double-speed drive units now transfer data at 1.2 Megabytes a second, but
the quad-speed units currently being developed should bring this up to
around 4.8 Mbytes/sec.
Because CD technology combines high storage capacity and high data transfer
rates with low unit costs, it is particularly suitable for use with
graphics-based applications such video imaging and animation, which are
integral to multi media but need large storage capacity.
A single, whole-screen four-colour video image can take up as much as 2
Mbytes of space if uncompressed. so the storage needed for a typical video
clip makes the standard magnetic disk an expensive solution.
Other forms of mass storage will still be used for other existing areas.
Magnetic media in the form of both floppy and hard disks continue to
dominate the online storage marketplace, while tape drives, particularly the
Digital Audio Tape are making inroads into the data archiving market.
As multimedia evolves beyond its origins in entertainment and education, it
is likely to change the way we think about and use data. Developing this
technology will need huge amounts of data in a cheap, accessible and
reliable form. For storage capacity, access speeds and cost, the compact
disk in all its forms seems unlikely to be equalled for some time.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (15): New ways to cope with fuzzy
data - Neural Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parallels have always been drawn between computers and the human brain.
Early references to computers persistently spoke of 'electronic brains,'
despite the fact that they were nothing of the sort.
Brains and computers work in entirely different ways and each has its
virtues and problems.
Current views on how the brain works suggest that it is more like a network
of several computers - rather than only one. Power is distributed rather
than centralised.
Studies of the workings of the human brain have provided models for building
computers and their software. One of the most promising is a technique
called neural networks.
Conventional computers emulate the human brain - but not the way it works.
By contrast, neural computers work on similar lines to the brain, using a
network of interconnected parallel processes.
Although the theory of neural computing dates back to the 1940s, it was only
recently that it has crept out of the shadows of conventional computing.
Advances in hardware technology now make it possible to build neural
networks and employ them to do useful tasks.
The basic unit of computing in a neural computer is called a neuron. Each
neuron can accept one or more inputs - known as connections - and generates
only one output. Each connection is weighted according to its importance and
this is used to calculate whether an output signal is produced.
The neuron works by multiplying the input signals by their weighting value
and then adding them all together. If the value exceeds a predefined
threshold value, the neuron generates an output signal. If the threshold
value is not reached, then no output signal is generated.
A single neuron is, of course, not much use on its own. Neurons must be
connected together in a network if they are to be useful.
Unlike conventional computers, neural networks must be 'trained' rather than
programmed. There are several techniques to achieve this, with so-called
'supervised training' the most popular.
This is comparable to the method used to train a paint-spraying robot in a
factory. The part to be painted is carried on an overhead conveyor belt and
a human moves the paint gun to cover the required areas. Each move is
recorded by the robot's built-in computer and can be 'replayed'
automatically.
A neural computer is trained by feeding it with input examples and expected
output results. As input signals percolate through the network, the
weighting calculations are performed by each neuron and fed to the next
level until they reach the output stage.
Here, the results are compared to the expected values. The difference
between the two is used to alter the weighting values until the desired
output is produced. This exercise is repeated with thousands of examples
until the network produces correct results consistently. At this point the
weighting values are frozen and the network is ready to be used.
The main advantage of neural networks is their ability to cope with
incomplete or 'fuzzy' data. This makes them ideal for applications where
complex data are involved, such as pattern recognition or financial
forecasting.
Although it is still early days for neural technology, several companies
have developed applications in these two areas. The German computer
manufacturer Siemens Nixdorf, for example, demonstrated practical
applications of its Synapse-1 neural computer at the CeBIT computer fair in
Hanover earlier this year.
'Our research into neural computing has enabled us to build the concept into
a processing engine and put a workstation on the front end,' says Mr Andy
Smith, UK marketing manufacturer for Siemens Nixdorf.
'At Hanover, we demonstrated a real-time currency and interest rate
fluctuation simulator, which is being used by German financial institutions,
and a fast fingerprint recognition system which we are showing to the UK
police.'
EDS, the giant software consultancy, has also built a neural computer-based
fingerprint recognition system - this time to help combat credit card fraud.
The system, now undergoing field trials, can store the information needed to
recognise a fingerprint in less than 64 bytes, making it possible to store
it on the magnetic stripe of a credit card.
A number of UK banks, including Barclays, are watching the progress of the
trials 'with interest'.
The UK government has provided funding for neural computing research and
development though the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). At the
beginning of last year, the DTI started an awareness scheme to promote
business applications of neural computing in the UK.
About 150 companies in the UK are now active in neural computing research
and the first applications have started to appear. These include a system
used by the BBC to predict audience ratings and one developed by IBM to spot
soldering faults in circuit boards.
These early applications of neural computing show great promise in what
could be a very large market.

SOFTWARE AT WORK: the FT review of business software
Themes for the September issue of Software At Work will include:
INTEGRATED ACCOUNTING:
The history of commercial computing started with accounting, as a financial
function, but in many companies has moved to centre-stage, dealing with
marketing, manufacturing, and other core activities. Integrating these
activities with accounting allows a company of any size to streamline its
operations.
MANUFACTURING:
'Just-in-time' and other manufacturing philosophies enable companies to
become more efficient, but to operate successfully, the system often has to
pervade every area of operation, forcing workers in the office and on the
shop floor to take a new view of jobs and priorities.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (13): Rival for desktop systems -
Laptops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is fast becoming one of the accepted facts of personal computing life
that the laptop computer is an acceptable replacement for the desktop
system.
Many companies now equip their executives (and not just the ones 'out on the
road') with such machines, and the benefits are clear to be seen. But this
trend is bringing with it some problems that are not, at first, apparent.
If an executive becomes more dependent on a laptop system, remote
communications with the corporate network become more important, and once
out on the road the reliability of the computer is a cause of concern.
Over the last year or so, the laptop computer has made a breakthrough as a
real alternative to desktop systems. The specifications of some of the
newest systems are equal to any desktop PC.
The latest system from the current market leader Compaq (according to market
research company, Dataquest) is its LTE Elite. This can sport up to 24
megabytes of memory, up to 510 megabytes of hard disk storage, a 9.5 inch
colour display and the latest, fastest implementation of Intel's 486
processor, the IntelDX4.
This is equivalent to the best desktop machines but is about the size of a
fat, A4 magazine, weighing around 6.5lbs.
Even advanced PCs used in design work are under threat from the laptop
invasion. The UK company, Tadpole, is leading the assault recently producing
its latest SparcBook. The company has also launched the PowerPC-equipped IBM
N40, which it designed and is manufacturing.
As laptops become standard equipment for executives, reducing their weight
and size have become particular targets for manufacturers. The 'notebook'
and 'sub-notebook' classes of laptop are regularly introduced, with
manufacturers vying to have the best specification in the smallest
functional form. Full PC specifications still brings some size limitations,
and machines such as Toshiba's T3400CT mark the current typical limits. This
is 20 per cent smaller and 30 per cent lighter than a classic laptop, but
holds a 486SX processor, up to 20 megabytes of memory and a 120 megabyte
hard disk.
For an increasing number of users the power of the laptop is only part of
the story. For the machine to be a genuine replacement for a desktop system
(where the executive has it as their only machine, whether at the office, on
the road or at home), much more is now needed.
The ability of the user to connect easily to the office network is a
priority. This can be achieved with a desktop docking system which
automatically seeks to update files. But one problem with deskstations, is
matching the files stored on the two systems. Apple's DuoDock, a deskstation
and PowerBook laptop combination, has software routines that specifically
seek out changes to files and update the relevant system.
MODEM LINKS
Connecting to the host system via a telephone and a modem is another
important capability, but this is not as easy as it sounds.
Network systems are only just starting to be able to handle connections of
this type for simple tasks such as file transfer and e-mail.
More complex tasks that require the use of network services, such as remote
printing, scheduling meetings or accessing a database can cause problems if
the remote computer is not managed properly.
A variety of solutions are appearing, ranging from simple bulletin board
systems for messaging, to networked servers dedicated to managing incoming
calls from remote laptops.
Remote communications may prove to be the solution for the other big problem
with laptops: the reliability of the machines.
Desktop systems have maintenance contracts with fast support, but a laptop
user can be in Oswestry one day, and Rome the next, making maintenance a
significant problem. It is also one for which no watertight solution has yet
been found by either suppliers or insurance companies, save machine
replacement and insurance against loss of data.
Remote users may be able to keep all their relevant data on the network.
Then in the case of a failure a replacement machine could be loaded as
required. But this would require users to backup every transaction as it
occurs, which is an unlikely scenario.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (12): A pool became an ocean -
Kermit was one of the first pieces of software used to transfer files
between computers / Kermit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kermit's early popularity stemmed from being reasonably standard at a time
of great flux - and, more importantly, being free. Programmers liked the
fact that the source code was published, which saved the effort of writing
their own version.
Kermit may be old but it remains in widespread use. It is often the lowest
common denominator between two machines that are trying to communicate. It
has been enhanced to allow connections over the Internet as well as dial-up
connections which were always its forte.
Kermit lacks some of the features (such as a graphical interface) found in
newer software. Modern programs also manage far more of the low-level
interaction with the other computer. Kermit merely acts like a terminal on
the remote system and requires the user to know how to log in and access the
various services. Newer software provides a friendly front-end for the user
and hides most of the complexities.
For many people, Kermit was a doorway into the world of communications,
allowing them to connect to different systems all over the world. This has
become much wider and has formalised into the Internet, and it has become
impossible for all but network gurus to navigate their way around. As a
result, there are numerous books on the Internet and ways to get around it.
Take the simple problem of trying to find the latest copy of the Kermit
software. There are thousands of computers connected to the Internet.
Many of them will have Kermit somewhere on them but it would require you to
log on to each in turn and then search through all the files looking for it.
To minimise the pain of searching, a database has been developed (known as
Archie) that keeps a list of all the programs that other local systems hold.
Using Archie you could ask which machines had a copy of Kermit and where to
look for it. There are many systems running Archie all around the world to
avoid a single system becoming overloaded. They regularly exchange
information with one another to keep up to date.
Once you have found the location of the software using Archie, you would
then call the system that holds Kermit and request it. The Internet is very
open and there are a very large number of systems which allow anyone to log
on using a name like 'anonymous' or 'guest.'
It is a continual surprise to Internet newcomers how much software is
available for free. Often it comes with the source code allowing you make
changes to it yourself, if required.
Archie has limitations - it still only keeps an index of the program by
name. If the Kermit software we were looking for were in a file called
'K290994' then we would not find it. Most systems use meaningful names, but
it is not guaranteed.
The Internet is not just one large bulletin board containing programs, it
also is a repository of vast libraries of information. From your desk, you
can access databases as diverse as the Columbia Law Library, the CIA
Factbook, and the Acoustic Guitar Digest. To make these accessible online,
the 'WAIS' program was developed.
WORD SEARCHES
When documents are stored in a WAIS database, it builds an index of every
word used in the document. To perform a search, you simply ask your WAIS
software to find all documents that contain the particular combinations of
words you supply.
To make it manageable, you usually specify particular libraries to search. A
list of libraries is available from a central WAIS database and the software
is supplied with the ability to get this information on start-up.
Most WAIS databases are maintained through volunteer effort and access is
free. Some commercial information providers (such as Dow Jones) also
maintain WAIS format databases but, naturally enough, charge a fee for
access to them.
The newest service on the Internet is the World Wide Web (WWW) which
provides a hypertext database. A hypertext database is one where selected
words in the text can be expanded at any time to provide a fuller
definition. World Wide Web also allows links between items so that this
article about Kermit might contain a link to an article about the Internet
itself.
If you wanted to know more, you would follow that thread while still keeping
a bookmark where you were.
One real advantage of WWW is that there are versions with a graphical user
interface which makes searching much more convenient and intuitive for the
non-guru. It also provides a far more uniform interface to systems that may
be completely different underneath.
The pool that Kermit was spawned in has now become an ocean. Nonetheless, it
still forms an important jumping-off point for new users.

whirl - Jargon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The word 'platform' is among the latest to have fallen prey to the jargon
merchants of the computer industry. It joins the ranks of 'server' and
'environment' as a new way to describe the humble computer. In fact, systems
no longer run on computers but in environments, notably in Unix environments
and in PC environments - where everything is Wysiwig ('what you see is what
you get'). And minicomputers (remember them?) are now called mid-range
servers.
Words are given new forms or are invented from other words. Take 'leverage,'
which is fast becoming a verb. Network company Novell said last month: 'Only
a minority of desk-top systems leverage the network services available to
them.' What does that mean? We could ask the same of outsource, rightsource,
rightsize, downsize.
Is deriding words like these taking a Canute attitude to change in the
language or is it providing examples to support the Oxford English
Dictionary's definition of jargon as 'barbarous or debased language'?
Or again, is jargon more sinister, a language invented by marketing people
to create the impression their product is bringing something new?
A director of the research company, IDC defined so-called client-server
systems, currently a subject of much marketing and customer activity, as
merely the latest in a line of over-hyped concepts masquerading as
solutions.
The point is the computing industry is still relatively young and is
progressing at extraordinary speed. There is no clear way forward for
businesses. Ten years ago they wondered about the role of personal
computers; today they look at the implications of being able to mix moving
pictures and voice with standard data on machines which can be carried in
briefcases.
In the early 1980s, fourth-generation languages were the answer to system
development problems; then came computer-aided systems engineering and now
there is rapid application development, with object-orientated development
and software re-use complicating matters.
Each 'new' development brings its own jargon. Suppliers latch on to it and
computing specialists get sucked in.
Technical jargon is undeniably useful as a verbal shorthand for specialists
when talking to others in the same field, be it computing, law or financial
futures trading. Jargon has always been part of the computing industry.
After all, what did 'mainframe' mean before it became 'enterprise server'?
Computing people are comfortable using terms such as hardware, software,
megabytes, RISC and Windows in the knowledge that technical colleagues are
likely to understand exactly what they are talking about.
However, until recently, computing people worked in their ivory towers,
turning system specifications into programs which more or less did what the
business departments required. They could talk their own language to each
other as they got on with their jobs.
BUSINESS COLLABORATION
But personal computing has opened business people's eyes to the potential of
information technology (arguably an acceptable term) and brought them closer
to the specialist staff. New software products (now called tools) enable
computing people and business people to develop prototype systems together.
The new applications of information technology emerging from such
collaboration are making computing central to the business. The computing
specialists are increasingly having to cut jargon and talk the language
(business jargon?) of their end-users (do these people know, for example,
that they are end-users?).
Perhaps this welcome trend towards collaboration will work its way back from
the end-users to the computing people and from them to the marketing people
who are responsible for so much of the jargon.
Any reversal of the encroachment of jargon could be significant. Stripping
away jargon exposes just what people are trying to sell. After all, whatever
computer suppliers might say, they do not leverage open platforms: they sell
boxes of electronics.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (10): Easy access is a crucial
factor - Information Highway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new high-speed motorway in the UK, stretching from Lands End to John
O'Groats, would be almost totally unused if there were no other entry or
exit points. Likewise, the success of any information highway depends on
easy access.
The Clinton administration has grabbed headlines in the US by announcing
government initiatives to build a national Information Highway. This is
intended to connect homes and businesses across the US. Each will have a
'black-box' that will connect them via a cable to all kinds of services.
Among the first applications suggested are video telephones, interactive
shopping and on-demand entertainment services.
Telephone companies and cable TV operators see the enhancement of current
services as a growth opportunity. The main competitor for cable TV is video
rental. Rental stores are able to offer a vast array of films while a cable
operator can only broadcast one film at a time. Connected to the information
highway, a customer would be able to select a film from a large repertoire
and then receive it down the wire a few minutes later.
The technology required is impressive. Even a short movie takes a large
amount of space on disk and requires a high-speed reliable data channel for
delivery without visual glitches. Keeping a library of a few thousand films
on-line will require significant advances in computer storage technology.
Given the present rate of advance in this area, it is unlikely to be a real
problem.
Possibilities for advertisers are exciting. Adverts could be matched to the
film currently showing (such as ice picks during Basic Instinct, perhaps?).
As the highway would also be used for interactive shopping, it would be
possible to deliver an advert together with the ability to order the product
by simply pressing a 'Yes' button on the black box. Advertisements could be
aimed at a subscriber based on previous purchases and customer profiles.
However, the difficulties in accessing domestic subscribers are well known.
Mercury Communications in the UK had a fully digital telephone network long
before British Telecom, but domestic penetration has been held back by the
cost of connecting households into its network.
The only wires running into most houses carry either mains electricity or
telephones. Neither is suitable for the high-speed data flow required for
video transmission. The coax cables laid for television transmission offer
much better pathways but very few households have such a connection. New
houses in some areas of the UK (such as Milton Keynes) are built with a
cable TV connection as standard, but this is only scratching the surface of
the problem - a great number of households still lack such a connection.
To complicate matters, the way that the data will be transmitted over the
wire is itself an area of considerable debate. It is unlikely that technical
merit alone will decide which method triumphs. There are similarities with
early video recorders - VHS was the least technically advanced of the three
systems at the time (VHS, Betamax and V2000) but it succeeded because it had
the highest market penetration of software.
The largest computer network in existence - the Internet - sees the
information highway simply as a logical extension of itself. The Internet is
a collection of thousands of different systems that agree solely on a set of
protocols (called TCP/IP) for connecting to one another. It arose in the
1970s as a loose inter-connection of research and educational
establishments. It now has over two million users world-wide, with the
majority of traffic being commercial. Current growth is around 12 per cent a
month.
Governments have rarely succeeded in legislating for innovation. The much
vaunted Japanese 'Fifth Generation' project has yet to produce any real
benefits. Government sponsored bodies are simply too slow-moving to keep
pace with the demands of an emerging technology. Usually, the imposition of
a goverment body adds a layer of bureaucracy that stifles the creativity
that it set out to promote.
Whether Europe needs a single information highway seems moot as it is
unlikely to get one. Agreement between national telephone companies is
notoriously hard to achieve. In any case, the Internet already extends into
Europe and many multi-national companies have their own high-speed links
across the continent.
An information highway will only succeed if it can achieve a 'critical
mass.' The first few telephone and fax machines were relatively useless: it
was only the spread of these devices that drew everyone else into having
one. For the information highway this is more likely to come about by
meeting real needs than by political rhetoric.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (9): Benefits outweigh problems -
Home-working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Doesn't your next door neighbour go to work any more?' remarks the nanny as
she comes up the drive. 'His car always seems to be here these days, lazy
old Rod]'
The answer is - yes and no. Rod next door works as hard as ever, but
increasingly, like many a salesperson, he does so at home. He sells Rank
Xerox photocopiers to the local government and health sector.
Rank Xerox has encouraged its sales staff to go home to work, starting with
a 'hot desk' policy of shared office space, and moving towards providing
them with home-based laptop computers. Xerox was one of the pioneers of the
idea (then only for top executives), 20 years ago. Now it is one of a
throng.
Independent and government-sponsored reports suggest that home-working is
already widely adopted, with 300,000 active teleworkers in the UK alone. The
Henley Centre for forecasting predicts at least 2,500,000 by 1995. The
Department of Trade and Industry and the Rural Development Commission
believe home-working technology can revitalise rural areas.
Here in rural Buckinghamshire, we have a microcosm of the social pattern of
the 1990s. Of the dozen houses in this hamlet, (not counting the farmhouse),
half the occupants are retired, and everyone in the other six households is
employed, five people in their own businesses, only one on the farm. Apart
from one, the businesses are all 'home-based.' Occupations are mixed: two
doctors, our Xerox neighbour, myself the journalist, a gardener, a caterer
and an electrical contractor.
Of these, I am as yet the only true 'teleworker,' working largely at home,
and entirely reliant on computer technology. My computer can connect to the
Financial Times' mainframe, and my telephone - most of the time - to the
rest of the world. This is written in a 'home office,' equipped with fax,
computer, laser printer, telephone and answering machine.
The technically self-sufficient home office (I like the term 'telebode') is
not to be confused with a telecottage, which is a fully equipped communal
resource in rural areas, for the use of anyone who has an occasional need of
technical resources and support. Such enterprises also train people for
teleworking, particularly women who are then qualified to take their skills
back to the most remote areas and become teleworkers.
The arrival of ISDN telephone technology gave Scotland a head start in
teleworking. Now widely available, ISDN is likely to lead to more
exploration of remote working, using teleconferencing and video-groupware to
link teleworkers, (see D for Desktop Video).
The term 'teleworker' suggests a reliance on technology, and is used to
describe those whose work is defined by the computer. The first pioneers
were unsurprisingly, in the area of computer programming.
The DTI has set up a voluntary Special Interest Group to raise awareness of
the potential of home-working - 'our job is to raise awareness, targeting
employers,' explains David Barry, chairman of Teleworking SIG. 'The
definition extends beyond users of groupware and those on networks to
include any home worker. Broadly speaking, productivity can be higher at
home: the new telematics technology offers potential savings on the
traditional office-based work pattern.'
As part of the Computer Supported Collaborative Workshop, the committee is
drawn from industry, consultants, practitioners and researchers.
Home-working is a source of cost-cutting to employers, who can make savings
on office space, travelling expenses, secretarial and administrative
support, and even employment costs if they use freelance teleworking
contractors.
Home workers save on the hassle of travel, have more time to work, and are
demonstrated to be more productive, working more flexibly and (not in this
house) without interruption. But not everyone is suited to the life:
solitary home workers have to be self-motivated, disciplined and
independent. One report found that remote clerical work simply wasn't a
success, because people partly came to work for the company, without which
the task became unbearable tedious.
In the 1990s, the leaps made in technology, and particularly in
communications, have meant that people can bring their work home with them,
yet stay in touch with the office, as never before. Large companies such as
NatWest, Sun Alliance and Unipart are sending their sales teams home,
equipped with laptops, motivated by regular contact on the network by
electronic mail.
It is more difficult for the self-employed to establish themselves. But
equipping a home office is easier and cheaper than ever before. The price of
hardware has plummeted, it has become better packaged, (plug-and-go) and
software has become far easier to use without training.
Nevertheless, for an IT novice, getting appropriate technical support can be
a formidable struggle, and an unforeseen expense. Some products are now
specifically tailored to the home market, such as the Arpeggio PC from Sonix
Communications in Cirencester, which provides ready-made instant
communication links, and cuts out the need for a permanent leased line.
Part of Canon UK's product range is aimed specifically at home workers, such
as its printers and the BN notebook range.
Despite some obvious disadvantages of teleworking, would I go back to
working 9am to 5.30pm, commuting to London? No thanks. I don't even need a
stroll round the bluebell woods to think about it . . .

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (7): Way to lift technology
burdens - Facilities Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Information technology (IT) is meant to be a tool that enables a company to
carry out its primary mission. The difficulty is that IT often threatens to
dominate budgets. The defence of the IT professional  - that you just cannot
get by without persistent technology expenditure - annoys company
accountants. A prudent business should be able to keep every cost under
control. If vital services, from car fleets to office cleaning, can be
contracted-out to third parties, why not IT?
Facilities management (FM) is the practice of hiving off computer services
to an outside supplier while the customer gets on with his prime business.
FM appears in guises such as systems integration, outsourcing and third
party maintenance (TPM). In 1992, the worldwide market for all such services
was estimated at Dollars 46.5bn, and predicted to grow to Dollars 108bn by
1997.
Some sectors are waking up to the potential for FM in a dramatic fashion. In
the telecoms realm, the European market for outsourced networks is estimated
at Dollars 11.7bn by 1997.
Saturn Global Networks (SGN), a specialist outsourcer for corporates needing
dedicated international datacomms, has just arrived in London, offering an
FM service on the much-vaunted information super-highway. SGN takes over
responsibility for tying up the intricate nodes that translate data at the
customer's end. The material is then fit to be flashed down the line and
across the globe. Each node costs around Dollars 75,000 to install, but
SGN's customers are not primarily concerned about cost. They want someone
else to handle the bits and bytes while they concentrate on their real
business.
FM offers to solve headaches by taking over the burden of technology. A
recent Dataquest survey of 500 senior European IT executives found that
gaining expertise and knowledge was regarded as the prime benefit of FM. But
when it came to choosing an FM supplier, the ability to deliver a solution
on time was the most significant factor.
The automated teller machine (ATM) is an indispensible part of retail
banking. Yet the Co-op Bank has elected to hand over its entire ATM network
to IBM in a Pounds 13.2m five-year contract. Mick Firth, director of retail
banking services at the Co-op, says cost is not a significant factor in this
radical move. He adds: 'We reviewed our distribution strategy. We wanted
increased functions, flexibility and the ability to guarantee quality of
service to the end user.'
The Co-op decided on a massive expansion of the ATM network, from 110
machines to a potential 500.
It started out with its own ATM network, and could have pursued this
strategy on its own. Mr Firth locates the real value of FM for his bank:
'We've avoided an extra investment, and we've freed resources we can use for
managing our branches.'
There are two rules to getting FM right, he says: one is to obtain a
watertight contract stipulating the level of service. The other is to create
a firm partnership with the FM supplier. 'The whole thing has worked very
successfully,' he notes. 'The handover took place in 20 days over February
and March.'
IBM is managing the entire operation, including cash replenishment. Co-op
customers will not see teams of programmers stuffing notes into the back of
their cash dispenser. But Securicor and Security Express staff will top up
the ATMs under contract to IBM.
The FM business continues to grow. Traditionally the computer industry has
generated huge profits from manufacturing hardware. This is the
'metal-bashing' side of the business - and makers of large computers have
suffered the same fate as other smokestack industries. Profits have
plummeted as smaller, more powerful systems brought down the price of
computing. The main suppliers have fled from their dependency on hardware
and are frantically diversifying into the lucrative world of FM. Bull has
placed its FM marketing drive under the umbrella of a new company, Athesa.
Local government, with its finances under relentless scrutiny, is a key
target. With 60 dedicated staff, Athesa will arrive on the customer's
doorstep as a specialist FM house. But the parent company will supply
personnel as soon as they are needed.
Bass Taverns is spending Pounds 3.9m (Dollars 5.7m) with Unisys in a
three-year outsourcing deal. Unisys will develop the software that runs
Bass' retailing system. With 2,500 pubs to support, this operation is the
lifeblood of Bass.
Writing and maintaining a customer's software has thrown up yet another IT
acronym: Applications Management (AM). Computer services group Hoskyns
claims AM to be the next big thing. But when Hoskyns commissioned a survey
of senior IT managers last year, 35 per cent still cited cost-containment as
their prime concern. It takes more than some snappy initials to blow away
the balance sheet blues. Contracting-out to an FM supplier may not guarantee
reduced spending, but it should keep the lid on.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (8): Better ways of mapping the
data - GIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you're a woman terrified of suffering a melanoma (skin cancer), move to
Brecon in Wales, where it hardly occurs. Men in Wales, however, suffer a
high incidence of stomach tumours, and cancers associated with sexual
behaviour. A report published at the end of March, The Atlas of Cancer
Incidence in England and Wales 1968-85 has for the first time examined the
locational occurrence of cancer, and identified many different forms with
specific locations.
This use of a Geographical Information System (GIS) illustrates how the
technique of mapping data to a physical location can reveal gems of
information. Based on data gathered over 18 years, the report has mapped
occurrences of different illnesses. The information may throw light on
causes and effects, and can certainly help to plan for health resources.
GIS has proved to be one of the boom areas of computing in the last years.
Newcomers include computer software houses, hardware suppliers, and
consultancies, all muscling in with determination on a territory that used
to be the cosy domain of geographical specialists. Once limited to expensive
dedicated equipment, the GIS is beginning to appear down-market, and become
a more accessible tool in commerce. Established IT giants - Sema Group,
Logica, Unisys, Informix and Oracle among them - are showing an interest in
the potential of GIS revenues.
Report and estimates about the boom in GIS have been appearing for some
time. According to the most recent results from IT researchers Dataquest,
published in March 1994, the total GIS market worldwide rose from Dollars
587m in 1992 to Pounds 654m in 1993.
'We anticipate a compound annual growth rate of 16 per cent per annum until
1995, which makes it one of the fastest growing areas of the software
markets,' says Petra Gartzen, a senior analyst and specialist in computer
aided design and GIS for the research group Dataquest. 'New applications and
technologies are constantly coming on the market, such as improved access to
satellite communicated data and geographical positioning systems (GPS).'
Some of the main areas in GIS are obvious: utilities recording assets, local
authorities planning future schools and services, road and transport
planning, retailers targeting their markets. Locational information has
become relevant in a world of compulsory competitive tendering, where
purchasing authorities 'outsource' to 'service providers.'
The GIS market is poised for its boom partly because the hard slog of the
groundwork - literally in the following case - has neared completion. In the
UK, the Ordnance Survey has been working for two decades creating the data.
Early efforts were not flexible enough for the emerging market. But in
November 1992, at the national conference of the Association for Geographic
Information, the OS announced Land-Line, the large scale digital map data
products which are at the heart of GIS user-systems around the country. They
have also now solved 'edge matching' - a problem where the paper-based
medium had stretched or shrunk so that the digitised versions did not quite
match when meeting on borders: 230,000 maps should be available in one
seamless whole by 1995.
One thing discovered by the early users of GIS is that the problems of
mapping data by location are by no means only technical. Viewing data
'spatially' has a fundamental effect on the way that organisations work.
Although there are great savings in cost and efficiency to be gained, the
investment of time, money and energy up-front produces expectations that may
take some time to come to fruition. The exercise of re-focusing operations
through a GIS is not unlike business process re-engineering: it involves
cross-disciplinary and departmental co-operation, and has to be driven from
the top.
This culture shock might explain why the market has shaped niche
specialisations. Strategic Mapping, MapInfo, and ESRI have all established
strong positions in the low-end market. ESRI's ARC/Info GIS has nearly half
the government GIS business worldwide, 27 per cent of the transportation
market, and over 20 per cent of the utilities.
In 1992 it is attributed with 35.7 per cent of worldwide software-only
sales: Intergraph, its nearest competitor is credited with 17.2 per cent.
Smallworld, the UK specialist based in Newmarket, has carved out a niche
with utilities - electricity, gas, water and telecommunications - by
offering a specialised 'hand-holding' service that eases the process of data
conversion, customisation, and business re-engineering. Its clients include
six cable companies, and seven out of the 12 UK electricity companies, and
has recently won a contract with German Bundespost.
Automated mapping and facilities management (AMFM) is specific to the
utilities providers which use it to map and define assets overground and
underground, and even in the air, to provide information on charging and
maintenance planning.
The largest sector in terms of market potential is business marketing and
sales, according to Dataquest's Petra Gartzen - 'we've done some analysis
about the business market because the technology has become so much more
accessible with powerful PCs. A lot of the business GIS is PC-based and we
anticipate that it will grow to Dollars 174m or more by 1997 from a humble
Dollars 10m in 1990.
'The market leaders are mainly US companies, Strategic Mapping and MapInfo;
overall leaders are Intergraph and ESRI. But the low end PC-based business
is where the growth is, penetrated by companies with an existing user-base
elsewhere, such as Autodesk.'
Visual information is becoming readily available. In March, President
Clinton overruled the CIA and ruled in favour of market forces, making
visual information commercially available from US satellites.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (6): Pragmatic view prevails -
Enterprise Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mainframe is dead: long live the enterprise server.
Computer manufacturers say organisations are finding that the traditional
central mainframe does after all have a place in the new world of
client-server systems and networked personal computers.
Indeed, although client-server and PC systems initially take work from the
mainframe, they later give it back even more.
'Just 12 to 18 months ago, people talked about choosing between mainframes
and client-server,' says Mr Peter Slavid, corporate systems business manager
at computer manufacturer ICL.
'Today, there is a more pragmatic view. People see that the future for
enterprise and departmental computing lies in making the most appropriate
and efficient use of both approaches.'
Mr Slavid says client-server was initially seen as a cheaper approach but
that this is no longer the case. Several studies over the last 18 months
support this view. Separate surveys by research firms Xephon, International
Technology Group and Ideas International conclude that in systems supporting
200 users the mainframe cost per user in equipment, software and staff is
40-50 per cent less than the networked PC cost.
The Xephon research shows mainframe systems are also 25 per cent cheaper
than client-server systems based on minicomputers.
Mr Barry Graham, a consultant working on the Xephon research, says the
increasing automation of mainframe operations and the falling costs of
processing power, running at around 10 per cent a year, mean mainframes are
becoming even more attractive.
'PC networks in particular were not designed for 100 people doing
complicated things,' he says. 'As you add users, you get queues, so you put
in more powerful file servers and other processors, so the costs increase.
With mainframes the reverse happens.'
The argument here is that mainframes are designed to handle large numbers of
users running big systems with fast access to big databases, so up to a
point users can be added without increasing the costs.
Researchers also point to hidden costs and other issues related to
distributed client-server and networked PC systems. These include the time
spent by office staff on running their systems instead of doing their own
work - put at 10 per cent of their time, including training, by research
firm Gartner Group. There are issues of file back-up, security, viruses,
unauthorised use of pirated software products and other matters which a
central mainframe operation, manned by specialist staff, deals with as a
simple routine.
Once the costs and issues are appreciated, the mainframe versus
client-server debate disappears and the right combination of the two
approaches can be selected, says Peter Slavid at ICL.
First, organisations remove from the mainframe the jobs that it is not good
at, such as word processing, plus applications which are truly departmental
systems. The mainframe workload initially declines. But, as end-users get
more and more of their own systems and their networks expand, the problems
of handling large volumes of data and managing big networks arise, problems
which mainframe data centres are used to handling.
So the mainframe's workload increases again, albeit in a different
direction, especially towards managing data. It becomes the enterprise
server in the client-server set-up, running the corporate databases.
Meanwhile, there are established corporate systems which the mainframe will
continue to run, at least for the time being.
'Most businesses are highly dependent on applications which have been
carefully built over the last 10-20 years,' says Mr David Heap, a consultant
at IBM.
'These are often called legacy applications, implying that they are
inflexible, of little value and soon to be replaced. I prefer to call them
trusted applications. They may lack flexibility but they provide the basic
information used to run the business.'
The dependence on 'legacy systems' is reflected in various surveys on
mainframe use. The research group, IDC last year found that over 80 per cent
of organisations planned to continue running mainframes. Even so, half of
those said new systems would be installed primarily on other equipment,
mainly Unix machines.
IDC concluded that 'traditional mainframes are not dead but they will become
a dead end'.
However, although mainframe use is apparently not declining significantly,
the suppliers' mainframe revenues are. Peter Slavid at ICL says revenues
from mainframes are falling by 10-15 per cent a year, yet the technology
performance is increasing at about the same rate, so the amount of mainframe
power in use is staying fairly stable.
In addition, both ICL and IBM say organisations are increasingly merging
data centres, saving money by running the same amount of work on fewer
machines and with fewer staff.
'Falling revenues can mean cuts in research and development but these are
offset by other developments,' says Peter Slavid. 'Manufacturers are
increasingly using commodity components. They are moving to open systems in
their operating systems. In addition they are introducing specialist add-on
processors, for example for database management. All these developments
maintain the improvements in price performance.'
Mr Slavid takes up the point about established 'legacy' systems and
concludes where he started, with pragmatism: 'Most big critical business
systems will continue to be run on the mainframe, if only for one simple
reason: it works.'

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (5): A promising market as costs
fall - Desktop Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Desktop video is potentially bad news for airlines and for courier
companies. But, though they don't know it yet, it is good news for
executives who hate airports, and also for far-flung teleworkers.
People have heard this kind of promise from technology before and are
understandably suspicious. For most people, multimedia still belongs in a
science fiction limbo. It comes somewhere between the ubiquitous PC (itself
a safe, known quantity) and the human transporter in the television series
Star Trek which flushes people from the starship Enterprise to any handy
planet.
But this seems authentic. People really can phone up (over one of the new
ISDN lines, which can carry two bands of traffic, voice and pictures
simultaneously) and see the person to whom they are talking.
While talking, they can send pictures from videos or from text. They can
share a word-processed document that pops up on a screen-window, and work
together on it while still talking.
You, the user, can see a moving video of your colleague, displayed in a box
in the corner of the screen, and of yourself. Unless, of course, you want to
point the camera at some other subject to display it over the line. For
long-distance valuation of antiques, perhaps, or a second opinion on a
patient's medical condition?
BT has already installed 40,000 ISDN 2 channels for multimedia use in the
UK. Within a few years, the paraphernalia of desktop video - camera,
microphone, plug-in card to the PC, software, storage and backup mechanisms
 -will be cheap enough for small businesses to use, even to install at home
for fun.
Steve Cramoysen, marketing manager for Mercury Communications, believes that
the availability of ISDN will bring a flood of newcomers to join established
video-conferencing companies such as Picture-Tel V-Tel and others -
'integration of the various technologies has become as easy, cheap, and
small enough to think about packaging it as desktop video, for one-to-one
communications,' he says. 'Desktop video is about collaborative working:
it's much more useful to be able to share documents.'
NEW APPLICATIONS
Nuts Technologies in Hong Kong has a growing base of business users for its
Connect 918 full-motion colour system. They include the United Nations
organisation Unctad, a surveillance user in Israel, and a manufacturer of
highly customisable printing presses in Germany, which has until now sent
its commissioning engineers all over the world.
Eric Rixen, Nuts business development manager for Europe and the Middle
East, believes that once the video network has reached critical mass, it
will take off - 'initially it's being adopted by publishing houses because
they already have ISDN in-house for transferring large files.'
Teleconferencing Marketing Review from IFC Research of Guildford estimates
the value of the world market for Video conferencing products and services
will rise from Dollars 800m in 1992 to Dollars 7.7bn in 1997.
There are three components for multimedia applications: hardware (getting
cheaper and more standard), software and the source media itself: motion
video, stills, or whatever is being sent.
Large software companies such as Microsoft are promoting the potential of
the marketplace and moving fast to provide the delivery mechanisms for the
source media already amassing.
Database company Oracle claims it is already on the 'information highway',
promising access to database information and video on demand in the home.
Software alliances are happening: BT with Oracle and Sybase with IBM. Most
recent addition to the multimedia stampede is Reuters, with its online
business information products.
The coming together of disciplines depends on specialists in particular
areas. For example, Apple is producing software such as QuickTime, which
speeds up the rather jerky moving picture from the 12 frames per second to a
more realistic 30.
Doceo of Norcross Georgia produces a 'video benchmark' kit for comparing
software-only codec boards. Micropolis of Reading is ready for the boom with
the first high-volume disk drive to store images. Attica Cybernetics of
Oxford is producing the actual CD-ROM media for home, education, libraries
and business.
Video-conferencing companies are also re-positioning themselves. It was
events such as the Lockerbie air disaster and the Gulf War that put an edge
on video-conferencing, according to Mr Phil Simmonds, the marketing manager
of Luton-based GPT Communication Systems, a GPT/Siemens joint venture set up
in April 1991 to explore the new market.
'We're now focusing down on what we call 'the business desktop.' I, as a
user, would like to bring together fax, phone, PC, video and file transfers
on the PC, and we know that that is what users want. We expect the UK market
to have a potential of Pounds 40m . . . with some prediction of Dollars
2.4bn by 1996.'
Mr Peter Niblett, multimedia brand manager for IBM UK, has his eyes on the
home market: 'Up to now, the factors holding back multimedia have been its
very novelty - people can't imagine how it will help them - and the
availability of source material.
'We see the home market as very promising, especially given the spread of CD
ROM, sound cards, and affordable DIY image and motion video capturing and
editing.'
By 1997, the cost will have plummeted, and it might cost Pounds 50 - less
than the cost of a computer game - to look up distant relatives in
Australia.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (3): Farewell to antiquated
operations - Business process re-engineering is the restructuring of a
company and the way it operates / Business process re-engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The emphasis in business process re-engineering - or BPR for short - shifts
from traditional functions such as accounting and purchasing, working in
their own compartments, to processes, which typically cut across functions.
People from different areas communicate with each other and even work
together as teams. Layers of management usually disappear.
Indeed, BPR has cynically been defined as Big Personnel Reductions, often
Based on Professional Recommendation, a reference to the number of companies
now offering help in this area.
The impact of such change is typically reflected in greater innovation in
everything from products to the use of information technology, better
quality and service and better staff motivation.
Bending the corporate and individual mind to such an exercise is no mean
feat. And although information technology has a key role to play, it is also
part of the initial problem.
'Business process re-engineering is going off the rails, even before it is
properly understood,' says Dr Colin Coulson-Thomas, chairman of consultancy
Adaptation and leader of a new European Union project in this field.
'People are getting bogged down with incremental improvements to what is,
rather than thinking creatively about what ought to be.
'What is referred to as BPR turns out to be process improvement or
simplification and not process re-engineering.
'Such initiatives may result in worthwhile increases in performance but they
are unlikely to produce the radical transformation promised by advocates of
re-engineering.'
Mr David Harvey, a director of research firm Business Intelligence, which
has studied this topic, adds: 'Most businesses claim they are geared to
constant change. But too often the change is the wrong kind - the kind that
props up a creaking management process or functional structure and keeps it
going for a few more years, rather than replacing it with systems which are
suited to current needs. The result is management systems of growing
complexity and overhead costs.'
He adds that 'information technology has been part of the problem: as
administrative systems have grown in complexity, IT has been used to help
manage that complexity.'
Mr Colin Philips agrees and believes that the automation of existing
processes and functions, often dating back to the Industrial Revolution,
demands that companies get started as soon as possible.
Mr Philips is head of international operations at Trinzic, one of the
growing number of companies offering software products to support the
analysis and development of business processes.
The urgency is increased because as end-users' appreciation of the potential
of information technology increases, they are demanding more and more
systems which are tightly focused on their activities.
'As information technology becomes tightly integrated into the
organisation's different business units, it becomes difficult to separate
the business processes from the technology itself,' Mr Philips says. 'And as
business processes become more automated, they become embedded in the
information system. It becomes increasingly difficult to change one without
changing the other.'
The Business Intelligence study report highlights the restrictions of
traditional structures. Each department focuses on what it contributes, not
on what is needed as a whole. There is competition between functions, for
example for budgets and staff.
Employees identify with their function rather than with the company as a
whole. There are barriers to co-operation between functions and sometimes
even conflict. And a structure based on functions generates its own
bureaucracy, which is needed to co-ordinate work and the flow of documents
between the functions.
'Re-engineering challenges the underlying values and culture of a company,'
the report says.
'All the components of a company could be affected, because re-engineering
takes a holistic approach. Everything that affects outcomes - organisation,
processes, people, technologies - must be considered for change.'
Although information technology is seen as an obstacle to getting started,
it is also regarded as key to the re-engineered business. At the simplest
level, information technology enables different departments to share
information through on-line databases, breaking down barriers and jealously
guarded departmental ownership of data.
Work flow automation, typically based on systems that process images of
incoming documents such as forms and invoices, enable people to work
together more easily. So-called groupware software enables people in
different departments, perhaps even in different cities, to access,
contribute to and comment on shared documents such as specifications and
sales proposals.
Electronic data interchange, the exchange of orders, invoices and sales
forecasts between computers, is re-engineering business processes beyond the
company gates by transforming relationships with external trading partners.
Thinking about areas such as these can be a starting point for looking at
business re-engineering, but only a start. As US consultant Dr Michael
Hammer put it, when he introduced the term to management: 'Re-engineering
cannot be planned meticulously or accomplished in small and cautious steps.
It's an all-or-nothing proposition with an uncertain result.'
He added: 'Even so, most companies have no choice but to muster the courage
to do it. For many, re-engineering is the only hope for breaking away from
antiquated processes that threaten to drag them down.'

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (4): Increasing power and
functionality - Client/Server Systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It makes great sense to put power where it is most effective. This is a
fundamental organisational principle and applies as much to computer systems
as it does to anything else.
During the first 30 years in the history of information technology, however,
computer power has been centralised - concentrated on a single computer and
doled out to users via terminals. It was far too expensive to distribute
computer power.
The arrival of cheap personal computers in the early 1980s changed all that.
For the first time it became possible to distribute real power to users.
But the spread of local power to the desktop - combined with the need to
access shared resources - has made old models of IT systems obsolete and
prompted a redefinition of how truly distributed information systems can be
built.
It is not enough to distribute power to the desktop - modern IT systems must
distribute functionality, too.
Client/server systems make this possible. They bring formal design
principles to networks of computers by defining an architectural framework,
as well as standards and procedures.
The client/server approach breaks an IT system down into sets of processes
and mechanisms to allow them to communicate.
There are two distinct processes: front-end user processes (clients) and
back-end services (servers). Client processes need the power to operate a
graphical user interface and perform local data manipulation. Server
processes include shared printer servers, communications gateways and common
databases.
The client/server architecture provides the universal framework and the
mechanisms which hardware and software suppliers can use to tie their
products together.
The idea of client/server systems originated with developments in database
technology in the 1970s. It was seen that database operations fell into two
distinct operations: making requests for data and physical management.
Database software developers split their products into front-end tools for
building requests and back-end 'engines' which processed them. They
communicated using a language called Structured Query Language (SQL).
Initially, both parts of the database ran together on a single multi-tasking
computer. But as personla computers replaced terminals at the front end, the
two were distributed to PC workstations and server computers.
THE WAY FORWARD
The network that links the workstations to the servers provides an
infrastructure which can be used to distribute other processes and the
broader idea of client/server systems evolved from this. It is now widely
seen as the future of IT systems.
Market researchers agree that the growth of the market for client/server
systems will expand quickly and the move to client/server is well under way.
The Yankee Group, for example, points to a shift in computer power from
larger to smaller platforms. It estimates that PCs and PC LANs will provide
more than two-thirds of every corporation's raw computing power by 1995.
A survey of 250 of the UK's top 1,000 companies carried out by IDC for the
Rothwell Group last year showed that over 40 per cent were either moving or
planning to move to client/server systems. Over a third of these tied their
decision to wider organisational changes.
The IDC survey also gives some indication of the relative immaturity of the
client/server market. It notes that the 100 or so companies committed to
client/server computing are dealing with 54 different supplier companies.
These range from the traditional manufacturers such as IBM, DEC and Hewlett
Packard - all of which have placed increasing emphasis on client/server
systems in recent years - to software consultancy companies like Hoskyns,
EDS, and Logica.
Given client/server computing's background, it is no surprise that database
software suppliers are taking the lead in the sector. The Yankee Group
estimates that the bulk of revenues - Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.84bn)
worldwide in 1992 - from client/server products goes to database developers
like Oracle, Ingres, Informix, Sybase and Gupta Technologies.
The second category, network operating systems software (Novell, Banyan,
Microsoft), accounted for a further Dollars 1.5bn in 1992, with tools and
other categories following well behind.
Database companies are likely to continue as the technology leaders in
building the infrastructure of client/server computing. However, the key to
successful client/server applications lies with systems integrators.
They have to glue all of the technology together and turn it into a useful
application. They must build in all of the controls and security which users
have come to expect from larger systems and, in addition, keep costs down.
They must also determine how applications are split into client and server
processes. This is proving to be the most difficult aspect of client/server
systems.
Ms Christine Comaford, chief executive office of Corporate Computing, a US
consultancy specializing in client/server systems, said: 'I have seen
Dollars 30m worth of failed client/server systems and many were the result
of 'analysis-paralysis'.
'You can't apply old techniques to new technologies and this what designers
try to do,' she said.
'It depends on where they come from. If they are into graphical user
interfaces (GUIs), they cram everything in the GUI when they should take a
layered approach.'
Ms Comaford said successful client/server systems must be built on a
conceptual model which covers the GUI, the application logic, the business
rules and access to the database.
This made it possible to realise the full benefit of modern client/server
systems, to not only distribute power but also to distribute functionality
to the desktop.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (2): New ways to use spare PC
power - Agent Software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Software is set to go on the market to exploit the reservoir of untapped
energy existing in idle personal computers on desktops.
The history of the computer industry consistently proves the old maxim that
'nature abhors a vacuum.' No sooner do hardware engineers produce faster
chips and higher-capacity storage than software engineers rush in and create
new ways of using computers.
'There is an enormous amount of spare computing power out there and we are
on the verge of turning it loose with the next generation of multi-tasking
operating systems,' comments Mr David Friend, founder and chairman of Pilot
Software, a specialist in a new type of software called intelligent agents.
He adds: 'Imagine a large retailer with over 1,000 stores and maybe 30,000
different products in 800 categories. They need to collect sales data from
each store on a daily basis to get management information. They want to be
able to identify any product where sales have changed markedly,' he adds.
'They want to make sure they have hot items in stock . . . the problem is to
work out what mental rules you apply if you are an expert and define them
mathematically in a program so you can create a software agent - or agents -
to do the job. Then you can get that spare computer power working for you.'
The phenomenon of surplus computer power is, of course, relatively new.
Before the PC, computers were so expensive that all their power had to be
used to justify their cost. Mainframe systems were - and still are - used
for on-line work during the day and for batch processing at night.
With the spread of PCs, computer power has moved to the desktop and much of
it lies unused. The limitations of PCs are partly to blame. With some
exceptions, for instance background communications and printing, a PC can
only do one thing at a time.
But the move to multi-tasking operating systems such as Windows NT, OS/2 and
Unix opens the door to the latent power of the PC (see O for Operating
Systems).
Software agents can help to use this spare power productively. They are
either passive agents which monitor events and take action, or active agents
searching networks and databases for specific information.
A passive agent may monitor network traffic, measuring performance and
working to improve it.
Active agents help reduce the growing problem of information overload by
coping with the mass of information available in modern computer networks.
Typically, an active agent would use a set of rules to seek relevant
information for a project, consolidate it and present it to the user. This
type of agent fits well with developments in areas such as workgroup
computing (see W for Workgroups) and transaction management (see T for
Transaction Management).
The importance of agents as an enabling mechanism for these technologies
promises to open up a new software market. According to UK market researcher
Ovum, the worldwide market for agent software will grow from an annual value
of Dollars 37m in 1994 to Dollars 2.6bn by the year 2000.
Software builders have already started to add agents to a wide range of
applications.
One project aims to automate loan processing in an underwriting
organisation. As much as 80 per cent of the processing is carried out by
software agents, leaving the user to concentrate on exceptions and problems.
A project from Andersen Consulting, the world's biggest consulting firm,
uses agents to create a workbench which can filter newsfeeds and support
casual users in the financial services industry.
There are more ambitious plans for agents in the future. This year AT&amp;T
plans to introduce a messaging service called Personalink which uses agents
to filter messages and search for information on a network.
The agent software for Personalink was developed by General Magic, a
Californian-based software company founded by the two lead designers of the
Apple Macintosh. Telescript and Magic Cap, General Magic'stwo software
products, are at the core of the Personalink service and could become the
basis of more general standards in agent software.
Other leading players in the software agents market include IBM, Microsoft,
Hewlett Packard and Xerox.
With this level of interest and the expected market growth for agent
software, it will not be long before spare PC power begins to wane.

FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (1): The revolution is about to
begin - Although millions of people use computers, new advances in
technology mean that the real computer revolution is only now about to start
/ Comment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP MANCHESTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The infrastructure of information technology is changing. The traditional
models of computing - either terminals controlled by a central computer or
stand-alone desktop personal computers - are giving way to a single model of
distributed power.
This year's Financial Times A to Z of Computing carries the theme of this
transition - to what some call the age of the 'network as the computer.'
Powerful desktop computers based on new chips - such as the Pentium and the
PowerPC - make it possible to provide almost every user with the local power
they need.
Multi-tasking operating systems like Windows NT, Unix and OS/2 offer access
to remote, shared resources such as printers and databases. Once plugged
into the emerging 'information highways,' the desktop computer becomes a
'window' on the IT world.
The emerging new infrastructure promises to open the door to many new
applications. Intelligent agent software which can scan a network of
databases, full-motion video, which can bring TV to the desktop computer,
and neural networks which can unravel complex data input, promise to extend
the boundaries of IT.
But while the new infrastructure makes many novel applications possible, it
also creates a new set of problems. Distributing computer power is not
enough. IT must also distribute functionality. This demands different
approaches to building IT systems and the software which makes them work.
Most important of all, IT systems must be tied closely to business needs.
Computer users are no longer satisfied with expensive systems which only
bring limited benefits. They want systems that are adaptable and can cope
with changes in the way their business is organised and administered.
New techniques such as business process re-engineering and workgroup
computing are expected to make it easier to build enterprise-wide
applications and deliver genuine benefits. When combined with software
engineering tools and object-oriented design, these new analysis techniques
should make it possible to create flexible applications which can change
with the business.
But it is not only big business which will gain from the new IT
infrastructure. PC technology is increasingly finding a place in the home -
either to support 'teleworking' in a home office or as a domestic aid for
'teleshopping,' managing personal finances and entertainment. Laptop
computers plugged into the 'information highway' will extend computing to
every corner of our lives.
The move to the new infrastructure will not be without pain, of course.
Those who hold on to the past will find it increasingly difficult to find a
market for their skills. But there are some ideas from the past which will
survive and help to solve some of the technical problems created by the new
infrastructure.
The valuable lessons learned in the mainframe era - particularly those
associated with managing transaction traffic and data storage or methods for
controlling software - offer proven solutions and should not be ignored.
'After 40 years of constant change, glowing predictions and never-ending
complexity, computers are finally being used by millions of people worldwide
every day. In spite of this, the computer revolution is only now about to
begin,' says Mr David Vaskevitch, director of enterprise computing at
Microsoft, in his recently-published book Client/Server Strategies.
He is right. The computer revolution he predicts promises to be one of the
most exciting technological changes in human history.
This year's Financial Times A to Z of Computing is your guide to this
change.

FT  26 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: AB disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointment at the lack of news at Associated British Foods was said to
be behind the 15 pence fall in the shares to 583p, despite profit figures in
line with market expectations. Turnover was an unusually heavy 1.1m.
Many analysts had been hopeful that the acquisitive and cash rich company
might use yesterday's profits statement to announce another deal, following
the rumours of a bid for the cake business of Allied Lyons mooted recently
in the market. Allied Lyons shares slipped 3 to 587p.
Enterprise Oil came under moderate pressure, closing 3 off at 445p as bid
stories, and suggestions that a rights issue would be needed to fund such a
move, continued to circulate.
British Gas shares dropped 9 to 297p in unspectacular turnover of 6.1m as
the market prepared itself for the consultative paper expected from Ofgas,
the industry regulator, on competition, rate of return and the new price cap
formula on transport tariffs.
The latest improvement in crude oil prices gave the majors a strong boost.
BP touched 392p early in the session before slipping back to close a net 2
1/2 ahead at 388p on heavy turnover of 14m.
There was widespread gloom in the bank sector where dealers reported
persistent profit-taking following last week's surge of interest in the wake
of the Lloyds Bank bid for the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society.
Standard Chartered dipped 14 to 995p as the market remained unconvinced that
Lloyds would hold on to its near 5 per cent stake. Lloyds shares lost 8 to
589p on profit-taking. Abbey National, hit last week by worries that the
Lloyds move would trigger a war in the mortgage market, rallied 5 to 437p.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo suffered the biggest fall among the FT-SE 100
stocks, the shares tumbling 3.6 per cent as the market focused on weekend
press coverage of a lengthy review of the company's prospects by leading US
brokerage Salomon Brothers.
Salomon's Mr Peter Laing has argued that Glaxo will have to include Pounds
500m of provisions in its 1996 figures as a result of redundancies from the
decline of Zantac, the anti-ulcer treatment which accounts for the largest
proportion of sales. Mr Laing has also reduced his 1996 forecast excluding
provisions by Pounds 305m to Pounds 2.075bn. The shares slid 21 to 554p.
SmithKline Beecham's last annual meeting hosted by Mr Bob Bauman failed to
inspire and the shares shed 6 to 376p. However Wellcome held steady to close
only 2 weaker at 513p as analysts anticipated US approval for the company's
anti-epileptic drug Lamictal.
London International eased a further 2 to 103p ahead of an announcement that
Powerstock, an investment arm of Malaysian Genting, had increased its stake
to 4.4 per cent.
The electricity distribution companies, known in the market as 'recs',
suffered from another flurry of heavy selling by institutions and private
investors increasingly worried by the electricity industry regulator's much
tougher than expected opening stance on pricing proposals for next year.
Hints of the regulator's severe stance leaked into the market last Friday,
triggering big falls across the sector.
Among the worst casualties yesterday were the two FT-SE constituents,
Eastern, 16 off at 600p and Southern, 21 lower at 580p. Manweb lost 20 to
672p and Seeboard 17 to 308p.
In a lacklustre stores sector, Sears were strong ahead of results today. The
shares put on 3 to 131 1/2 p. Analysts have pencilled in around Pounds 127m
for this morning's full-year figures.
News and information group Reuters Holdings lifted 13 to 518p after the
company announced a 15 per cent jump in first quarter revenues.

FT  26 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Chemicals active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemical stocks outflanked the bears yesterday with the help of a
recommendation from one leading UK securities house which highlighted their
exposure to a pick-up in mainland Europe. Sentiment surrounding the sector
also benefited from a strong set of figures delivered by Du Pont of the US.
The chemicals research team from Smith New Court stood up at the morning
meeting to highlight Courtaulds - which has a 30 per cent exposure to the
continent, and Laporte and ICI - which both have a 25 per cent exposure.
Analyst Mr Philip Morrish said: 'We have been speaking to companies which
are seeing a surprisingly buoyant start to the year particularly in Germany
but also in France and Italy.'
ICI was up 11 at best before closing 3 better at 832p. The shares have risen
sharply over the past week and some dealers said that the company's first
quarter figures on Thursday could prompt a small setback as the company
tends to adopt a cautious stance when it reports. Courtaulds, which reports
in mid May, settled 2 weaker at 545p after 550p earlier and Laporte improved
7 to 797p.

FT  26 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo in the bid frame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stakebuilding/takeover speculation that has surrounded Lasmo since the
oil exploration group announced its Pounds 219m rights issue two weeks ago
erupted again yesterday with the market responding to strong rumours that a
180p a share bid will be launched this morning.
The bid rumours were accompanied by another session of heavy activity in
Lasmo ordinary shares, in the new 'nil-paid' stock and in the traded
options. The ordinaries closed 8 higher at 155p, after 158p, with turnover
reaching 18m shares, while the new nil-paids settled 8 firmer at 50p, after
54p on 7.7m traded.
Lasmo was the heaviest traded in the options market where the equivalent of
2.2m shares changed hands. The turnovers in the stock, nil-paids and options
yesterday were similar to big volumes in all three for much of last week.
Dealers said that among the favourites to launch a bid for Lasmo were
Enterprise, Elf, British Gas, PowerGen and Arco. The company's advisers
maintained, however, that there were no signs of any abnormal patterns in
trading in the shares and that the stock is purely being re-rated,
especially by US investors in the light of the recent rise in the oil price.
Crude oil prices, now around Dollars 16 a barrel, were trading below Dollars
14 a barrel as the rights terms were set.

FT  26 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a largely dull session in the futures and options market yesterday,
with thin trading and few noteworthy features, writes Christopher Price.
Dealers reported a lack of buying or selling interest almost from the start,
and the June contract on the FTSE 100 spent most of the session drifting
slowly down. In fact, June's opening trade at 3,138 turned out to be the
high of the day, after which a lack of buying enthusiasm rather than selling
pressure saw June slip back.
GDP figures in line with market expectations stemmed the drift for a short
time, but the weak gilts market continued be a negative influence and June
continued to lose ground.
A weak opening on Wall Street added to the slide and June hit 3,101 shortly
before the close, its low of the day. A slight spurt towards the finish saw
June end the session at 3,102 with volume a lowly 10,128 contracts.
However, in after hours trading, June brightened up, reflecting a turnaround
in sentiment on Wall Street, the contract ticking up to 3,109.
Lasmo topped the stock options list once more - at 2,269 contracts, with
takeover talk again said to be inspiring investors' interest. Glaxo was
second at 1,072. Total options volume was 18,414 contracts, compared with
over 29,000 on Friday.

FT  26 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index drifts down towards the
3,100 area - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market had an uncomfortable session, with the FT-SE Index
falling to within 7 points of the 3,100 area as a sell-off in German bonds
brought a reaction in British government securities. Trading volume in
equities was very low, although ready interest was shown in a handful of
speculative situations.
Shares tried to rally when Wall Street opened higher but turned back again
to close at the lowest levels of the day as the early gain on the Dow was
trimmed to 11 points at the London close. The final reading of 3,106.1
showed the FT-SE Index with a net fall of 27.6 on the day.
The market opened higher in spite of a further waning in hopes for a base
rate cut. Gains were soon reversed, however, as bond markets turned down
across Europe. The absence of any encouraging communique from the meeting at
the weekend of the G7 finance ministers left markets unsettled and UK bonds
were not helped by the announcement of 0.7 per cent growth in domestic gross
domestic product for the first quarter. There was little response, however,
to a slight widening in the UK's non-EU trade deficit in March.
Selling pressure was persistent, rather than severe. One trader commented
that 'for every decent buyer, there were a couple of sellers', and the loss
on the Footsie soon extended to 25.4 to reach 3,108.3. The downward drive
came from the stock index futures, which were, in their turn, shying away
from losses in UK bonds which ranged to around 1 1/2 points at one time.
Losses in bond markets have unsettled UK equities for the past two months.
There were signs, however, that investors, having largely abandoned hopes
for a base rate cut, were switching attention to recovery stocks. Chemical
issues, encouraged by good trading figures from Du Pont in the US, looked
for similar signs of progress in the UK sector of the industry. This month's
indications of growing UK retail sales were reflected in demand for those
leading store groups still to report on progress for the first quarter of
the year. Oil shares remained very firm behind the rally in crude oil
prices, with Lasmo attracting strong demand as bid speculation continued to
flourish.
But across the range of the market, there was no escaping the negative
influence of the bond and futures markets. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 21.9
points to 3,767.6.
Trading volume proved very slow in the first half of the session and even
the attempted rally only lifted the day's Seaq total to 522.3m shares,
compared with 816.3m on Friday, when retail business was worth a healthy
Pounds 1.67bn.
Analysts sounded disappointed that European and US bond markets were still
so nervous, and that UK equities could still be so clearly unsettled by
pressures from the fixed interest sectors.
This week brings a number of significant investment hurdles, with the US GDP
numbers for the first quarter and the German money supply data, both due at
the end of the week, capable of upsetting the investment mood.
The stock market is expected to focus this morning on the quarterly survey
of business optimism among members of the Confederation of British Industry
(CBI). A week ago, CBI members appeared less optimistic on retail sales than
was indicated by the official statistics subsequently released.

FT  26 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): DuPont leads surge in Dow
industrials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks surged yesterday afternoon as higher bond prices and strong
corporate earnings brought a wave of optimism to the equity markets, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 57.10 higher to 3,705.78, after
the NYSE's 'downtick rule', which restricts program-guided buying, was
triggered for the second time in three sessions. It was the first day since
March 29 that the bellwether blue-chip index closed above the 3,700 level.
The more broadly based Standard &amp;Poor's 500 ended 5.08 ahead at 452.71 in
moderate trading.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.66 better at
435.97, and the Nasdaq composite gained 8.24 to 730.80.
Stocks opened with moderate gains as continued stability in the bond market
was sufficient to encourage a flurry of buying as the session got under
way.(
The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes last month
had risen 5.7 per cent from the previous month. With sales declining 9.7 per
cent amid February's deep freeze, investors attributed little significance
to the data.
Later, the longer-dated Treasuries surged as bond traders began to feel more
confident that the economic growth was moderating, although there was no
fresh news to back up the conviction. Stocks caught the updraft and closed
just shy of their session highs.
The improvement came after most of the US financial markets announced that
they would close Wednesday in honour of former President Richard Nixon, who
died at the weekend. The Commerce Department said it would postpone the
release of March durable goods data in observance of the national day of
mourning.
Investors yesterday chose to accentuate the positive, responding
enthusiastically to strong first-quarter results released by several
companies whose performance is closely linked to the macro-economic cycle.
The favourable reaction contrasted with that afforded Caterpillar and
Chrysler earlier in the reporting season. Those stocks were hard hit after
the companies revealed a solid first-quarter.
Yesterday, DuPont led the Dow industrials, jumping Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars
58 1/8 . The company posted a 39 per cent surge in net income, excluding a
non-recurring gain a year ago.
The stock inspired buying in a range of cyclical stocks. International Paper
leapt Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 62 3/4 and Caterpillar advanced Dollars 3 3/4
to Dollars 111-1/8.
Goodyear, which is riding high on a strong recovery by the US car industry,
gained Dollars 1-1/8 to Dollars 40-1/8. The group said underlying net income
climbed 33 per cent in the first quarter.
In the automobile sector, Ford was Dollars 2 3/8 ahead at Dollars 57 7/8 and
General Motors added Dollars 1-5/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 as investors awaited
the companies' results, expected later this week. Chrysler was Dollars 1 1/8
higher at Dollars 49-7/8.
Boeing, another Dow component, added Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 3/4 after the
company said its 1994 results would come in at the top end of forecasts. The
share price improved in spite of a decline in first quarter net earnings.
Canada
Based on preliminary data, the TSE-300 index added 69.57 points, or 1.67 per
cent, to 4,236.73, with advances leading declines 433 to 306.
Volume of 52.446m shares was just below Friday's 52.610m shares, and trading
value increased to CDollars 675.3mfrom CDollars 609.3m.

Another increase in US short-term interest rates last Monday left a
number of domestic indices markets at, or close to their 1994 lows.
In Europe, Germany was a significant exception. Its upward career,
prompted by a Bundesbank rate cut on April 14, was interrupted; but it
resumed as the financial sector recovered from fears inspired by the
Jurgen Schneider property

FT  26 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Brazil): US provides clues for Latin
America
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo retreated from earlier highs to end at 15,516, up 1,313, or 9.25
per cent, adding to Friday's 10.6 per cent advance.
The market was boosted by a slight drop in US interest rates and by Wall
Street's performance.
Volume was thin at Crz251bn and traders said this reflected uncertainty over
the country's constitutional reforms.
In the absence of domestic news, the market looked to New York for
direction.
However, the market was also keeping an eye on Brasilia where congressmen
could vote on the Provisional Measure 457 which details the specifics of the
government's anti-inflation plan. This will pave the way for a new currency
to be introduced.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares recovered late in the day from pre-election nervousness as buyers
returned, in spite of the spate of bomb blasts which have killed at least 19
people since Sunday.
Gold price gains towards the close brought fresh interest to the market,
taking the gold index 11 higher to 1,846. The overall index finished 28
higher at 5,068 and industrials were 43 ahead at 6,031.
De Beers reversed losses to post a 75 cent gain to R108.25 and Anglos made
R1.50 to R215.50. SAB added R2 to R92, Remgro collected 25 cents to R30 and
Richemont put on R1 to R42.

FT  26 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Mexico): US provides clues for Latin
America
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican shares closed lower on reports that another businessman had been
kidnapped. The IPC index finished down 18.23 points at 2,191.08.
Earlier the market had risen to 2,289.60 after Friday's strength, buouyed by
the peso's firmness and expectations of easier short-term interest rate and
good first quarter results from Telefonos de Mexico.
Mexican stocks registered their biggest advance in more than three years
last Friday after the Banco de Mexico moved decisively to protect the peso
and quell speculation.
On Friday, the 36-share IPC closed 133.99, or 6.5 per cent higher at
2,209.31, its biggest single-day advance in percentage terms since 17
January 1991.

FT  26 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses moderately inspired by
strong US start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were only moderately inspired by a strong start on Wall Street,
writes Our Markets Staff. Milan was closed for a holiday.
FRANKFURT eased on the session and rose with the Dow in the afternoon, the
Dax index falling 11.70 to 2,202.22 and recovering to an Ibis-indicated
2,208.68.
The day was marked by disaffection with front-line cyclicals - chemicals,
although they would normally be bought at this time of the year, and
carmakers, and some engineers and steels - as analysts said that there were
some less exaggerated valuations elsewhere in the cyclical category.
Turnover dropped from DM11.6bn to DM7.7bn. BASF and Bayer led chemicals down
with session falls of DM3.80 to DM314 and DM4.10 to DM385.10; Mr Glen Liddy
of Kleinwort Benson said that German institutions, which tend to buy the
stocks for their dividends, were holding off.
In the automotive sector Continental, the tyremaker, dropped DM5.50 to
DM282.50 and Volkswagen DM17.50 to DM531 after a magazine article said that
VW might be forced to impose large-scale lay-offs next year.
Siemens, representing the quieter cyclicals, virtually held its ground at
DM734, down 80 pfg. Mr Liddy thought that its first half results were 'very
encouraging', and the shares rose after hours by DM3.50 to DM737.50.
PARIS found it impossible to sustain Friday's 2 per cent gain, and the first
day of the May trading account saw the CAC 40 index 18.88 lower at 2116.29.
Dealers said that falls in bonds left equity investors worried about high
yields at the long end of the fixed interest market.
Turnover was low at FFr2.3bn. Eurostocks offered a contrast: Eurotunnel, in
a mirror image of the market, rose 55 centimes to FFr40.75 in a technical
recovery after a sharp fall on Friday; Euro Disney, however, dropped
FFr1.70, or 5 per cent to FFr32.20 as traders created short positions to
open the new account.
ZURICH bounced back from early lows after Wall Street opened. The SMI index,
under pressure during the morning from weak bond futures, finished down 24.4
at 2,763.5 after a low of 2,738.5.
Nestle fell SFr13 to SFr1,211 in heavy trade ahead of tomorrow's annual news
conference.
Roche certificates gave up another SFr50 to SFr6,800 but Ciba registered,
trading ex-dividend, added a net SFr2 to SFr866.
Miss Janet Dyson at Hoare Govett commented that Ciba's growth in the next
three years was expected to derive principally from the industrial division
 -although restructuring should prevent a significant downturn in healthcare
and agriculture - in spite of difficult market conditions.
Banks were under pressure, with CS Holding SFr13 lower at SFr593 ahead of
Friday's annual news conference.
Ascom was steady at SFr1,300 in low volume after the troubled
telecommunications company reported a 1993 loss at the top end of
expectations, but said that it expected to break even this year and return
to profit in 1995.
STOCKHOLM was unimpressed by the supplementary budget and instead turned its
attention to corporate news and forthcoming results. The Affarsvarlden index
rose 1.5 to 1,463.4.
Mr Allen Owie at Unibank commented that budget reduction measures had fallen
far short of expectations, suggesting that the forthcoming election in
September may have constrained the government's room for manoeuvre.
Volvo B rose SKr14 to an all time high of SKr712 on news that the carmaker
had sold its 43.8 shareholding in Cardo to Incentive, which then launched a
bid for the rest of the investment company.
Incentive fell SKr3 to SFr302 amid worries that it was paying too much while
Cardo shot up SKr98 to SKr498, just under the SKr500 bid level.
Gambro B, majority owned by Cardo, rose SKr12 to SKr361, after news of the
bid.
Handelsbanken B added SKr4 to SKr113 in response to positive 3 months
earnings figures.
AMSTERDAM failed to recover from early falls, caused by a sharp drop in bond
prices, and the AEX index finished 4.15 lower at 414.96 lower in quiet
trading.
Akzo Nobel fell Fl 2.50 to Fl 220.50 ahead of first quarter results today.
MADRID, volatile this year, was consciously staid as it waited out the day
of the Banesto auction, the result of which was due after hours.
The general index rose a mere 0.03 to 318.99 in turnover of Pta21bn.
Banesto fell Pta23 to Pta755 after a broker said it was worth Pta500 a
share, and BBV and Santander, thought to be the most likely contenders, fell
Pta5 to Pta3,200 and Pta10 to Pta6,150.
WARSAW rose for the fourth consecutive session, the WIG index closing 458.6,
or 3.5 per cent higher at 13,557.6, but brokers said that there was also
increased selling, offering the prospect of strong profit-taking in the days
to come.
ISTANBUL dropped 5.5 per cent as sellers stepped in after early buying, the
composite index ending 1,022.43 down at 17,450.83, after 19,212.39 in the
first half of the session.

FT  26 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei dips ahead of
holiday as Kuala Lumpur climbs

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arbitrage selling and position adjustment by dealers ahead of the Golden
Week holidays depressed share prices, and the Nikkei index gave up 1.3 per
cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average fell 255.25 to 19,709.14 after a high of 19,921.48 and a low
of 19,628.33. A fall in the futures market prompted selling by arbitrageurs,
while foreign investors were also seen liquidating large capital stocks.
The strengthening of the yen to the Y102 level also unnerved investors. The
currency closed up Y0.72 to Y103.05 in spite of selling intervention by the
Bank of Japan. 'Many people are afraid of the yen and another cold summer
hampering the expected economic recovery,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko
Securities.
Some market participants said they would adjust positions ahead of the US
GDP figures on Thursday. 'A rise in GDP could lead to a further rise in
interest rates and a fall on the New York stock market,' said a dealer.
Volume totalled 250m shares against 307m as most investors remained on the
sidelines, and traders said that 20 per cent of the volume was linked to
technical activity.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.37 to 1,604.43, and the
Nikkei 300 fell 2.31 to 293.32. Losers outpaced winners by 702 to 310 with
171 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.36 to 1,311.11.
Financial stocks were lower on index-linked selling. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
fell Y40 to Y1,900 and Bank of Tokyo lost Y20 to Y1,570. Nomura Securities
lost Y50 to Y2,260.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the benchmark stock for investor confidence,
fell Y9,000 to Y888,000 and East Japan Railway declined Y2,000 to Y483,000.
Profit taking depressed petroleum stocks. Showa Shell Sekiyu fell Y60 to
Y1,370 and Tonen lost Y20 to Y1,540.
Speculative favourites were higher on buying by individual investors,
Sumitomo Coal Mining rising Y14 to Y965 and Ishihara Sangyo by Y9 to Y440.
Retailers were bought on hopes of a consumption-led economic recovery.
Takashimaya rose Y20 to Y1,360 and Marui gained Y40 to Y1,680.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 122.53 to 22,029.50 in volume of 16m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y120 to Y6,520 on profit-taking by
overseas investors.
Roundup
Some strong performances were seen in the Pacific Rim while other markets
were lacklustre. Australia, New Zealand and Colombo were closed for public
holidays.
KUALA LUMPUR picked up 2 per cent as investors, demonstrating increasing
confidence, bought blue-chip stocks. The composite index added 20.65 to
1,059.52.
SINGAPORE was higher, supported by institutional demand for several blue
chips, but trading volume was still light. The Straits Times Industrials
index closed 42.23 or 1.9 per cent higher at 2,307.82.
TAIWAN rose 1.4 per cent in heavy trade led by steels, papers and plastics,
but some heavy profit-taking was awaited as a prelude to any sustained
advance. The weighted index rose 81.22 to 5,918.55 in heavy turnover of
TDollars 73.22bn.
MANILA overcame a hesitant start, heartened by the strong performance of the
San Miguel and Manila Electric (Meralco) issues, and the composite index
climbed 50.24 or 1.8 per cent to 2,838.40. Volume dipped to 1.51bn shares
from Friday's 1.94bn.
San Miguel A and Meralco B shares each rose around 4 per cent to 169 pesos
and 515 pesos respectively. PLDT added 25 pesos to at 1,765 pesos.
SEOUL saw profit-taking in blue chips wipe out early gains, and the
composite index, 8 points higher at one stage, ended 0.03 lower at 892.70.
HONG KONG closed easier but a late round of bargain hunting trimmed losses
after a sluggish day's trade. The Hang Seng index lost 20.74 at 9,136.11
after a low of 9,068.26. Turnover was down to an indicated HKDollars 2.95bn
against Friday's HKDollars 5.63bn.
KARACHI was marked 1.8 per cent lower amid selling pressure from short-term
investors on settlement day. The KSE 100-share index fell 44.22 to 2,425.80.

FT  26 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar slips lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar fell back on foreign exchanges yesterday as the weekend G7
meeting failed to produce any statement supportive of the currency, writes
Philip Gawith.
The flip side of dollar weakness was D-Mark strength and the German currency
finished stronger across the board. In London the dollar closed at DM1.6794
against the D-Mark from DM1.6947 on Friday.
The D-Mark was helped by comments from a Bundesbank council member
cautioning that German interest rates might not fall as fast as some
countries wanted.
Sterling also suffered at the hands of the stronger D-Mark, closing at
DM2.5049 from DM2.517 on Friday. It was slightly firmer against the dollar,
finishing at Dollars 1.4916 from Dollars 1.4853. The sterling index closed
at 79.9, from 80.
Although Japanese officials made clear at the G7 meeting that they were
unhappy with the level of the yen, many analysts believe that the US
administration is satisfied with the current exchange rate.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said some members
of the Clinton administration appeared to believe that they had Japan on the
ropes - 'that if you squeeze them so hard they have to open their markets
finally.'
He said it was arguable that Japanese economic recovery was not possible at
the current exchange rate, while if the dollar fell below Y100, this was
'armageddon'.
There was little market response yesterday to the confirmation of Mr Tsutomu
Hata as the new prime minister. The yen finished at Y103.225 from Y103.650.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said this was because
Mr Hata's premiership was unlikely to impact on economic policy or the trade
dispute, nor resolve political uncertainty.
Mr Chertkow, however, predicted that Mr Hata would try to placate the US by
enshrining the 1994/5 budget cuts as permanent, while the Bank of Japan
would support this fiscal stimulus by cutting rates again. He added that if
the economy did not recover, Mr Hata's coalition government would be
unlikely to survive.
Mr Lyons said the yen/dollar rate might remain in the spotlight ahead of the
golden week holiday which starts on Friday in Japan, and lasts most of the
following week.
The UBS analyst said the US/Japan trade dispute 'continues to cast a pall
over the dollar generally.' Having fallen below DM1.6840 against the dollar
the US currency is next expected to test the DM1.6650 level.
A number of other factors weighed on the US currency. One, according to Mr
Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, was a delayed response to
Friday's appointment of two new Fed board members. The market believes this
will give the Fed a more doveish flavour, and hence slow the rate of
monetary tightening.
Another was the general firming of European interest rates. This is the
result of more bullish economic forecasts emerging from Germany, which has
encouraged a bearish tone in German interest rate markets.
This was evident in the futures markets, with the June euromark contract
settling three basis points lower at 94.72. The back-end contracts lost more
ground, with the December 1995 contract losing 20 basis points.
Traders stressed, however, that these movements in the longer contracts were
deceptive as most of the trade was amongst locals. Lack of liquidity also
made the contracts susceptible to manipulation. Weakness at the short end of
the yield curve is also a spillover from the longer end, where sentiment in
bund futures has soured.
The fall in euromark futures was reflected in short sterling futures. The
June contract finished six points down at 94.57. Markets are now discounting
mid-year short term interest rates  1/2 of a percentage point higher than in
January.
The longer contracts dropped further, with the December future finishing 16
basis points worse at 93.78. In the money market, the Bank of England
provided late assistance of about Pounds 225m. Earlier the Bank had provided
Pounds 727m liquidity compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 950m.
Overnight money traded in the 4 1/4 per cent-5 3/4 per cent range.
Sterling was unaffected by the GDP and trade data released. Preliminary
first quarter GDP growth was 0.7 per cent, quarter on quarter, in line with
market estimates. The non-EU trade deficit for March was Pounds 675m,
compared with February's revised Pounds 640m.
The D-Mark finished higher across the board in Europe. It closed at L957.7
against the Italian lira, from L956.7, and Pta81.52 from Pta81.37 against
the Spanish peseta.
The French franc fell below its old ERM floor again to finish at FFr3.435
from FFr3.427. Analysts said market sentiment was turning against the franc
owing to the Bank of France's tardy pace of monetary easing. The issue will
acquire fresh relevance when new unemployment figures are released on
Friday.

FT  26 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian nickel output exceeds
western estimates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's nickel production last year was much higher than previous western
estimates suggested and its consumption was much lower. This became clear
after Russia for the first time supplied government statistics on its nickel
market to the International Nickel Study Group, the Hague-based industry
organisation.
The figures revealed Russia's primary nickel production last year was
190,000 tonnes, some 22 per cent below the 1992 level but well above the
168,000 tonnes previously estimated by the study group. Nickel consumption
was 60,000 tonnes compared with the study group's estimate of 80,000 tonnes.
Russia's official nickel exports came to 110,000 tonnes, down from 133,000
tonnes in 1992. The study group pointed out, however, that these exports
excluded those of ferro-nickel or other forms of the metal, estimated to be
nearly 30,000 tonnes in 1992.
Mr Glen Wittur, secretary-general of the INSG, said that the official
Russian figures would be used by the study group from now on. However, it
was still not clear how often the statistics would be supplied.
China, a prospective study group member, reported that nickel output at its
principal facility, Jinchuan Nonferrous Metals Corporation, reached 27,300
in 1993 or 88 per cent of total Chinese production. This also suggests the
study group underestimated China's output which it previously gave as 29,500
tonnes. Jinchuan is being expanded so that China's nickel production will
rise to 50,000. China's 1993 nickel consumption was estimated to be 45,000
tonnes. Consumption is predicted to rise to 70,000 tonnes by the year 2,000.

FT  26 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Dutch
agriculture faces a Herculean task - Over-stocking farm land with animals
has created a problem of Augean proportions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Dr Ir van Dijk has three academic qualifications and three jobs.
He is professor of agricultural co-operation at Wageningen University,
director general of the Dutch National Co-operative Council and chairman of
the International Agricultural Strategy Council for the Dutch government.
But when I met him a few days ago he had his arm up the back of one of his
pedigree Texel ewes which was having difficulty lambing.
It must be said that he and his family have only a small flock at their old
farmhouse in the Dutch village of Lienden and that the sheep are kept more
for a hobby than as a business. But it was immediately clear that in spite
of the long list of letters after his name this was a practical man who
understood farming.
I visited Prof van Dijk to learn about 'Ter Zake', of which he is one of the
authors and which literally translated means 'To Work'. It is a rallying
call to Dutch farmers to get on with sorting out their problems themselves
rather than relying on the European Union or the Dutch government. It
epitomises the purpose of a 'great debate' now under way across the rural
areas of The Netherlands on future policies for farming.
For although Dutch farmers have a long-standing reputation for being among
the most innovative and efficient in Europe they are now, as Prof van Dijk
explained to me, facing declining incomes, severe environmental restrictions
and a deteriorating relationship with the Dutch public. The Great Debate, he
hopes, will identify and define these problems so that obvious solutions may
emerge and ancillary organisations and businesses can get 'to work' on
implementing them.
There can be no doubt that Dutch agriculture is in crisis. Unlike British
farmers, who have seen incomes rise during the past two years, incomes in
The Netherlands have continued their downward trend. Moreover the Dutch
experience is what the authors of the reform of the EU's common agricultural
policy intended. British farmers' good fortune is, to a large extent, the
result of the devaluation of sterling in September 1992 and the subsequent
statutory adjustments to green currencies to bring UK farm prices up, by
some 20 per cent, to their real value compared with other EU currencies.
During earlier years, in the 1970s and 1980s, Dutch farmers had overcome the
shortcomings of their small-farm structure by intensifying their management
methods, especially with livestock. Dutch traders discovered alternative
animal feed ingredients, such as manioc from Thailand, which could be
cheaply imported from third countries, by-passing EU tariff restrictions.
Dutch food processors developed markets for farm produce all over the world.
And in spite of its small land area, The Netherlands became one of the
biggest exporters of agricultural goods in the world.
But animal feed, once it has passed through the animal, turns into dung.
There are now so many animals on Dutch farms eating so much imported feed
that the business of disposing of their wastes on the limited land available
has become unbalanced. Indeed critics have suggested that some areas in the
east and south of the country are like a gigantic sewage farm.
Inevitably this has led to environmental problems. Soils have become so
overburdened with certain minerals that they have become a pollution hazard.
In spring, when animal slurry, stored all winter, is spread, or as is now
decreed, injected into the land, the smell across wide areas of the country
is unpleasant, even to a farmer's nose.
Attempts have been made to contain the problem by limiting the number of
animals kept on each farm and by government regulations on the quantity of
slurry applied to land. But the restrictions were applied after the animal
population had reached unmanageable proportions and there has so far been no
serious move to cut livestock numbers.
The Great Debate has at least resulted in this possibility being discussed -
although the current priority seems to be to find some way to feed pigs, for
instance, so that they produce lower mineral levels in their dung. The fact
that exports of intensively-produced livestock are so important to the Dutch
balance of payments is clearly significant to the debate.
It goes without saying that this intensity of livestock production has been
significant in the deterioration of Dutch farmers' public relations.
The Great Debate has been going on for several months now. Every region and
every sector of Dutch agriculture and horticulture has been involved and
some preliminary conclusions are, apparently being reached.
Quite apart from the excess of livestock it has, for instance, been admitted
that there are too many abattoirs in the country and some kind of
rationalisation seems to be on the cards. The farm supply trade, dominated
as it is by co-operatives, has recognised that it is overmanned. The three
farmers' unions representing Catholics, Protestants and Liberals have begun
to talk of forming one federation.
A recent survey has indicated a growing acceptance among Dutch farmers that
they need to farm in more environment-friendly ways. Prof van Dijk told me
of new targets to reduce farm emissions of potentially polluting chemicals,
minerals and gasses by between 70 and 80 per cent. Exactly what that means
in terms of inputs and in turn production is not yet entirely clear,
although establishing this is exercising the minds of Dutch agricultural
economists.
Some of the 100,000 farmers in The Netherlands have begun to realise that
there may not be an adequate living for more than half that number by the
end of the century.
The growing self-awareness that appears to be coming about as the Great
Debate progresses is being achieved through discussion and without
confrontation. And it is beginning to lead to pragmatic decisions by
individuals and groups.
Some are addressing problems with a view to beating them. Others are
planning to get out of business while they still have time.
All in all the debate seems to be a catalyst for change. And although the
British farming industry is nothing like as intensive and does not yet face
the same degree of crisis, I feel sure that it would benefit from a similar
self-examination.

FT  26 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures hold firm - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures held firm in thin trading yesterday
as investors looked ahead to today's meeting between the Brazilian officials
and coffee growers over the government's plan to sell official stocks.
'Until that's out of the way, no one is prepared to take a view on the
market,' one trader said.
The July position closed at Dollars 1,496 a tonne, up Dollars 23 but well
short of the recent high.
There was no reaction to news that the robusta coffee retention indicator
had passed the 70 cents-a-pound mark, allowing sales of beans stockpiled
under the producer's market support scheme.
COCOA prices lost ground in the afternoon. Early industry buying was
confined to bargain-hunting and failed to follow prices up, traders said. By
the close the July price had retreated from a high of Pounds 888 a tonne to
Pounds 874, down Pounds 6 on the day.
Base metals trading at the London Metal Exchange remained slow. COPPER ended
steadier but with the three months delivery prices below the earlier high of
Dollars 1,930 a tonne as a lack of follow-through interest and a downturn in
the New York market prompted profit-taking and speculative selling.
ALUMINIUM also slipped from earlier highs as resistance and selling emerged
towards Dollars 1,300 a tonne for three months delivery. It was last at
Dollars 1,291.50, up Dollars 4.50.

smelter sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US-owned Southern Peru Copper Corporation, producer of two-thirds of all
Peru's copper, bought the state-owned Ilo refinery at auction in Lima on
Friday.
Although five potential bidders had pre-qualified for this, the second
attempt at a sell-off, SPCC made the only offer.
The initial, February, asking price of Dollars 75m was reduced by 10 per
cent for the second auction. SPCC bid Dollars 68.9m for all Ilo's assets,
although it will hand back Dollars 5m in unwanted buildings for the state to
dispose of.
SPCC had always looked to be the natural buyers for Ilo. The refinery,
purpose-built in 1975 at a cost of Dollars 56m, produces 99.9 per cent pure
copper cathodes from SPCC-supplied blister copper under a tolling agreement.
Output last year topped 180,000 tonnes.
The new purchase will enable SPCC to integrate its smelting and refining
operations and cut costs. It will invest more than Dollars 20m in upgrading
and expansion of the refinery in the next three years. This should boost
SPCC's total output of refined copper by about 9 per cent.

FT  26 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finance mandate awarded for
Qatar Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of six international banks has been awarded the mandate to arrange
up to Dollars 680m to finance the upstream elements of Qatar's first
liquefied natural gas project.
The total cost of Qatar Gas, the first of two proposed LNG projects in the
country, will be about Dollars 4bn by the time the first shipment of LNG is
made to Chubu Electric Power company in Japan in 1997. Japanese banks and
government agencies are responsible for financing the more than Dollars 3bn
'downstream' part of the project, including the liquefaction plant and the
LNG carriers.
The total amount of limited recourse financing for the upstream section  -
which includes the offshore production platforms and pipelines to the land
facilities - will depend on the extent of export credit in equipment
contracts now being let. The upstream partners in Qatar Gas are the Qatar
General Petroleum Corporation, Total of France and Mobil Oil of the US.
The financing is expected to be in place this year. The group of banks
includes Barclays, Credit Lyonnais, Gulf International Bank and Societe
Generale. JP Morgan is advising the Qatar Gas partners and Citibank is an
adviser to QGPC.

<TEXT>
The government of the Faroe Islands has awarded a licence for seismic
surveys on the Faroese continental shelf to the American company Western
Geophysical Corporation, of Houston, Texas.
The licence marks the beginning of the Faroe Island's programme to explore
for hydrocarbons in its offshore continental shelf area.
BP has made a substantial oil discovery south-east of the Faroe Islands and
close to the dividing line between the Faroes' and the British sectors, over
which there is an unresolved dispute between the two countries.
The Faroe Islands is a self-governing province of the Kingdom of Denmark.
Economically the group is almost entirely dependent on fisheries. It is in
the throes of a serious depression caused by falling stocks and prices of
fish. Denmark has had to pump substantial sums of money into the the
islands' to prevent total economic collapse. Against this background, the
islands' government is pinning its hopes on hydrocarbons prospects.

FT  26 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Bunds fall as focus remains on economic
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German bund futures fell back over a point as the market continued to focus
on the prospect of economic growth and the likelihood of another high money
supply figure to be released this week. The market chose to ignore the
release of favourable inflation figures yesterday, maintaining a bearish
mood, and as bund prices tumbled, they dragged the other European government
bond markets down in their wake.
The German market is anxiously awaiting the release today by the leading
economic research institutes of their growth forecasts for 1994, dealer
said.
Bond analysts and dealers said that the market has chosen to focus on recent
comments by German politicians and Bundesbank officials suggesting that
economic growth may be picking up. Last week, Mr Rexrodt, the Economics
Minister, said growth could even be somewhat better than forecast.
Yesterday, Bundesbank board member Mr Edgar Meister was reported saying
there were signs of recovery in the west German economy.
Some economists at investment banks, meanwhile, have revised their growth
forecasts upwards. As a result, the bund market is nervous that the
Bundesbank could slow down or halt its already snail-pace easing in
short-term rates.
Meanwhile, the M3 money supply figures for March are due to be released this
week. After the annualised 17.5 per cent growth in February, dealers expect
the March figure still to be in double-digits and well above the
Bundesbank's 4 to 6 per cent target range.
With the economic recovery and M3 figures providing the main focus, the
release of favourable inflation figures was largely ignored by the market.
April inflation figures from North Rhine-Westphalia were better than
expected, with annual CPI growth slowing to 3.0 per cent from 3.1 per cent
in March, while the monthly increase remained unchanged at 0.2 per cent.
This follows the release on Friday of the inflation figures from the state
of Baden-Wuerttemberg where inflation was up 0.3 per cent on the month and
3.1 per cent on the year.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 94.74 and fell to 93.58 before
settling at 93.65.
The drop in bund prices depressed the other European government bond
markets, pushing French debt prices lower in the absence of significant
domestic factors.
Swedish government bonds tracked the bund market lower, but saw additional
downward pressure as a result of the disappointing 'mini-budget' announced
yesterday. One analyst pointed out that many of the measures announced in
the supplementary budget are due to be phased in over a long period of time
and could be jeopardised by the autumn general election.
In addition, the Swedish bond market has seen heavy new supply - both of
index-linked and of conventional stock - in recent days, which dealers said
had weighed down the market.
Short-dated UK gilts opened on a soggy note ahead of Wednesday's auction,
while the decline in bund prices further depressed the market, leading to a
fall of a point from the previous close.
The release of the economic growth figures was in line with expectations and
dealers said the gilt market chose to ignore the domestic economic data and
focus on the bund market's decline instead.
Britain's gross domestic product rose 0.7 per cent in the first quarter from
the fourth quarter of 1993 and was up 2.6 per cent compared with the same
period a year earlier.
The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 106.26 at the opening to a low of
105.26, settling at 106.09.
Longer-dated US Treasuries posted solid gains yesterday afternoon as traders
followed through on last week's encouraging rebound. The improvement
followed a decision by the Treasury to postpone Wednesday's supply auction
in honor of former President Richard Nixon, who died at the weekend.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/16 better
at 89. The yield eased to 7.145 per cent, 27 basis points lower than at last
Monday's close. The two-year note was off  1/16 at 99 3/16 , to yield 5.555
per cent.
Bonds generally meandered in directionless trading for most of the morning.
There was little economic news to drive the market, but a weakening trend in
US securities overseas cast a shadow.
Traders were unruffled by news of a 5.7 per cent rise in sales of existing
homes last month, after a 9.6 per cent fall in February. The recovery
offered no convincing evidence of a fresh surge in housing activity nor an
unsettling escalation of inflationary pressure.
On the contrary, the market grew bolder in the conviction that the economy
was not as strong as it had feared just a fortnight ago. Although there was
no further indication of a slowdown, the long bond climbed steadily during
the afternoon.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: EBRD funds Dollars 60m credit
facility for Czech bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has provided a
Dollars 60m seven-year revolving credit facility to the Czech Republic's
Kommercni Banka. The floating-rate funds will be used to finance Czech
exports to western and developing countries, particularly in Asia.
Terms of the agreement were not disclosed but an EBRD official said that
Kommercni Banka, which is 51 per cent state-owned, would be paying a
market-related premium over Libor, the London interbank offered rate.
The official added that the facility would give medium-sized companies in
the private sector access to long-term funds, which were in limited supply
in the domestic market.
The EBRD hopes to provide similar facilities to banks in Slovakia, Hungary,
Poland, Russia and other states in the former Soviet Union during the course
of this year.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: IFC in plan to securitise
emerging market loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector
finance arm, plans to securitise part of its emerging market loan porfolio.
'We have a scheme under design which would allow us to pool selected
corporate project loans as collateral to issue rated securities', said Mr
Richard Frank, the IFC's chief financial officer. The loans involved will be
located in Latin America and Asia.
The IFC is in discussion with credit rating agencies to agree the level of
enhancement required to support issuing high-grade securities. 'We are
looking for high-quality securities on the basis of the loan pool collateral
and supporting features,' Mr Frank said.
One difficulty is that while the corporate borrowers are investment grade,
they may be located in sub-investment grade countries, he said.
Taking existing loans off its balance sheet through securitisation will
allow the IFC to increase its loan capacity.
'There is a high level of demand for our funding, and this will allow us to
finance a larger volume of loans,' he said.
The IFC's disbursed and outstanding loan portfolio totals some Dollars 5bn,
of which 42 per cent is Latin American and 23 per cent Asian.
The initial scheme would involve about Dollars 300 to Dollars 400m in
corporate loans, but as the IFC disburses more loans it may create new pools
for securitisation, Mr Frank said.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Pibs rise sharply on C&amp;G bid
news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market in permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs) issued by UK building
societies has rallied strongly on the news that Lloyds Bank is to take over
the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society.
The largest price rise is in the C&amp;G's Pounds 100m issue of 11 3/4 per cent
Pibs, which has rallied by six points since Thursday, to 122. The yield
spread over the UK gilt due 2017 has shrunk from about 230 to 180 basis
points, as a result.
However, other Pibs issues have also rallied, though less dramatically. For
example, the spread on the Halifax Pibs has tightened by about five basis
points to 160 basis points since Thursday, and the spread on the Leeds Pibs
has narrowed sharply from 225 basis points to 210 basis points.
Dealers said the market had already been improving prior to the Lloyds
announcement, as wider spreads and higher yields had attracted fresh buying
after a sell-off at the start of the year.
Dealers say there are several reasons for the sharp rise in the C&amp;G Pibs
price. First of all, holders of the paper are rewarded in the same way as
other investing members and will therefore be entitled to receive a cash
payment of Pounds 500 and 10 per cent of the value of their holdings, up to
a maximum of Pounds 10,000. This means that investors are more likely to
keep hold of the paper, even though it is rallying strongly, creating a
shortage of paper.
Second, the status of the Pibs will rise when the takeover goes through.
Currently, Pibs, which never mature and were issued to provide capital for
building societies, are the equivalent of equity and would therefore,
theoretically, count as Tier 1 capital under bank capital rules.
However, under the terms of the Lloyds deal, the Pibs will become
subordinated debt securities and count as upper tier 2 capital.
The deals which have rallied most strongly are those issued by building
societies deemed likely to be takeover targets, or likely to convert to bank
status, bringing about a similar change in the status of their Pibs.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Bonds: Minimal issue supply in choppy
conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Choppy conditions in the underlying government bond markets kept Eurobond
issuance to a bare minimum.
'It's not a very constructive environment - investors are still very, very
cautious and although we've seen some nibbling, the markets are still
fragile,' said one syndicate manager.
The Canadian dollar sector saw the bulk of yesterday's meagre supply:
CDollars 165m of 10-year bonds for the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto
via ScotiaMcLeod, and CDollars 150m of two-year notes for Landesbank
Schleswig-Holstein via Nomura. Both deals were targetted mainly at
continental European retail investors and medium-sized institutions but
neither issue met heavy demand, traders said.
The sterling sector was abuzz with talk of imminent 10-year issues, but a
volatile gilt market kept investors and issuers firmly on the sidelines.
Eastern Electric was rumoured to be planning a Pounds 350m 10-year deal via
CS First Boston and BZW. Abbey National and Cable &amp; Wireless were also
tipped as possible issuers.
Elsewhere, there was talk that Sweden is poised to issue Y100bn of five-year
Euroyen bonds, although dealers warned there would not be enough demand for
such a large deal. Belgium was also expected to bring its widely rumoured
French franc issue, some said as early as today.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Sappi omits payout after fall in
profit

<TEXT>
Sappi, South Africa's biggest pulp and paper company, has announced a
decline in after-tax profits to R142.2m (Dollars 29.3m) in the year to
February from R360.1m. Largely as expected, the company has been forced to
pass its final dividend.
Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman, blamed the drop on a weak domestic
economy and depressed world pulp and paper prices.
Turnover increased by 19 per cent to R5.54bn from R4.67bn, due mainly to the
first inclusion of consolidated results from Hannover Papier, the German
manufacturer of coated products acquired by Sappi in 1992. But operating
income dropped to R165.5m from R443.7m a year ago.
This was partly offset by net non-trading income of R26.9m raised from the
sale of non-core assets in Germany and residential property in South Africa.
Net finance costs dropped from R65m to R45m, due to lower interest rates and
a R500m investment from the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation
which will be either repaid or re-acquired by the company at a future date.
The overall debt/equity ratio has been reduced from 0.47 to 0.41.
Mr van As said despite cost-cutting and the depreciation of the rand, which
helped boost exports from South Africa, the continued weakness in European
markets had depressed earnings. However, the new Brussels-based marketing
operation had been successful, increasing exports from the group's British
and German interests by almost 24 per cent.
The company also announced that its R1bn expansion to Saiccor, the world's
largest dissolving pulp supplier, would be commissioned on time and below
budget in 1995.
Mr van As said he was confident the situation would improve as the
international pulp market continued to recover and the domestic political
situation stabilised, helping boost local demand.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Testing time for French insurers
 -The UAP sell-off heralds a new era for the sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any day now, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, is expected
to launch the FFr25bn (Dollars 4.28bn) sale of the state's remaining stake
in Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest insurance group in
France.
The UAP privatisation, which will be followed by those of Assurances
Generales de France (AGF) and Groupe GAN, marks a watershed in the French
insurance industry's fortunes by heralding the end of the long tradition of
state ownership. It also comes at a time when Victoire, the second-biggest
private sector insurer after Axa, is up for sale thereby paving a way for a
foreign group to emerge as a force in French insurance.
However, these developments come at a difficult time when insurers are under
intense financial pressure. UAP, AGF and GAN all recently reported weak
results for 1993, due to the depressed state of the insurance market and the
losses of their banking subsidiaries. They now face the dual challenge of
stabilising their finances and adapting to the changes in the French
insurance industry.
'This is an important time for the industry,' said Mr Stephen Dias, European
insurance analyst at Goldman Sachs. 'Privatisation is a big factor. All the
state-controlled insurers will have to adopt a more business-like approach
in future. The industry was very depressed last year. It's now in an
intermediary phase and, if all goes well, profitability should return to
normal next year.'
One consolation is that there is already evidence of recovery in the French
insurance market. It reached its nadir in 1992 when the economic slowdown
triggered a decline in demand and a steep increase in claims. The insurers
were trapped in a vicious cycle of sacrificing margins to fight for market
share: not only against each other but against the specialist mutual groups
in the motor market and the banks in the life sector.
Demand is still depressed but the big groups have begun to raise premiums
and to be more rigorous about accepting new business. Mr Claude Bebear,
chairman of Axa, and Mr Jacques Friedmann, his counterpart at UAP, have both
noted an improvement in their French insurance interests.
Meanwhile, demand should improve as the economy emerges from recession. Life
insurance has particularly strong growth potential in the light of the
government's long-awaited pension reforms. The threat from the mutuals is
abating partly because they have been affected by the economic downturn.
However, the banks are becoming even more competitive in life insurance. The
insurers are responding by joining forces with the banks to tap into their
formidably efficient distribution networks. UAP will use its privatisation
to formalise old links with Banque Nationale de Paris. AGF is being courted
by two banks: Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais.
Yet the recession dealt a double blow to the insurers by burdening their
banking subsidiaries with heavy property losses. UAP, AGF and GAN were the
chief casualties. They wrote off part of these losses in last year's results
and transfered the rest to shell companies or to more robust subsidiaries.
'This isn't a final solution,' said Mr Tim Dawson, analyst at Lehman
Brothers. 'All they've done is allow themselves to write off the losses over
a longer period. But at least it alleviates the short term pressure on the
balance sheet.'
The 1993 'clean-up' is welcomed by observers such as Mr Dias of Goldman
Sachs as evidence that UAP, AGF and GAN are preparing to be 'more
business-like' after privatisation. All three groups should also have more
financial flexibility as private companies. UAP has secured the government's
agreement to stage a FFr3bn capital increase as part of its privatisation.
AGF plans to follow suit.
Ironically, the pace of acquisitions is likely to slow down in the
mid-1990s. AGF and UAP are now intent on consolidating their acquisitions as
is Axa after a difficult period with The Equitable of the US. These groups -
and GAN - are considering expansion into Asia. But the focus for French
insurers over the next few years is likely to be integration rather than
expansion.
Indeed, the flow of acquisition activity may well reverse if, as the
industry expects, Victoire is snapped up by a foreign purchaser. A number of
international insurers, including BAT of the UK and Germany's Allianz, have
looked at Victoire - so far inconclusively.
Suez, the French holding company that owns Victoire, is now considering
various offers for the business. Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, hopes to clinch
a deal next month. French insurers will then discover whether to add the
threat of foreign competition to the other changes taking place in their
traditional territory.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: New products help Kao to Y49bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kao, Japan's leading household products maker, reported increases in annual
sales and profits for the 14th consecutive year due to strong sales of new
products and a decline in material and operational costs.
Kao, one of the few Jap-anese companies bucking the current recession, saw a
9.6 per cent increase in non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to
last March to a record Y49bn (Dollars 473m), while sales rose 2.8 per cent
to Y639.5bn.
After-tax profits rose 4.4 per cent to Y24.5bn, while operating profits
increased 13.3 per cent to Y52.8bn. The company's operating profit margin
was 8.3 per cent, offsetting the deterioration in the non-operating balance.
Due to the firm rise in profits, the company will raise its dividend for the
second half by Y0.5 per share to Y5.5, or Y10.5 per share for the full year.
Sales of Kao's household product division rose 2.9 per cent to Y559.5bn,
thanks to new hair products and lipsticks, while the chemical division
posted a 1.6 per cent sales increase to Y80bn.
For the current year to next March, the company remains cautious over
prospects of a consumption-led economic recovery advocated by many private
economists. Mr Tomiaki Nagase, senior managing director, said strong sales
growth was unlikely, and forecast a 4.1 per cent rise in non-consolidated
pre-tax profits to Y51bn on a 2 per cent increase in sales to Y652bn.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Finland plans to cut state
ownership in Finnair to 50.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finland's government is to seek parliamentary approval to cut state
ownership of Finnair, the national airline, to as little as 50.1 per cent.
The move would be in line with the country's privatisation programme.
The state owns 72 per cent of Finnair, and the government says it wants to
retain a majority stake in the airline for the moment.
Approval of the scheme would enable Finnair to issue new shares to private
investors when market conditions allow.
The company made FM89.8m (Dollars 16m) profit in the six months ended
September 1993, compared with a loss of FM197m in the same period of 1992.
It has said it expects full-year losses to halve from FM415m.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: First-quarter income drops 28%
at Texaco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Texaco, the US oil group, yesterday reported a 28 per cent decline in
consolidated first-quarter net income to Dollars 202m, or 69 cents a share,
as sharply lower crude oil prices offset efficiency improvements, costs
reductions and increased oil production levels.
The group's quarterly earnings were restated to account for the sale of
Texaco Chemical to Huntsman Corporation, concluded last week.
If income from the chemical operation was included in the results, Texaco
would have earned Dollars 278m in the quarter, still slightly below last
year's profit of Dollars 281m.
Upstream exploration and production earnings were almost halved to Dollars
120m in the wake of declines in crude oil prices of more than Dollars 4 per
barrel in the US market, and more than Dollars 3 per barrel internationally.
However, upstream earnings were buoyed by an increase in natural gas prices.
Earnings from downstream manufacturing and marketing operations, which
traditionally benefit from cheaper oil, rose to Dollars 203m, up from
Dollars 171m a year earlier.
The group said margins rose in the US market, where the introduction of its
new CleanSystem gasoline product boosted domestic sales. Downstream earnings
overseas were lifted by increased sales in Latin America and higher margins
in Brazil.
Capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter rose 17 per cent to
Dollars 624m as overall spending on both upstream and downstream operations
increased, particularly on drilling on developmental gas projects in the US.
Overseas upstream expenditures fell, primarily because successful project
completions in the North Sea oilfields continue to feed through into higher
production volumes.
Although corporate overheads were lower in the quarter, higher after-tax
interest expenses pushed up corporate and non-operating expenses from
Dollars 99m to Dollars 120m.
The results had little impact on Texaco's share price, which rose Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 65 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Atlantic Richfield (Arco), the Los Angeles-based energy group, yesterday
reported a 43 per cent decline in first-quarter profits to Dollars 149m or
92 cents a share from Dollars 260m or Dollars 1.60 a year earlier.
Revenues tumbled to Dollars 3.9bn from Dollars 4.67bn.
The company blamed the sharp drop in earnings on lower crude oil prices.
Arco's downstream refining and marketing operations, however, put in a solid
performance, thanks partly to higher natural gas prices.

<TEXT>
Astra, the Swedish drugs group, has signed a long-term co-operation pact
with Mitsubishi Kasei Corp (MKC), a leading Japanese chemicals group which
is looking to strengthen its pharmaceuticals business.
The move is designed to bolster Astra's position in its key markets of
Europe, Australia and New Zealand from the turn of the century, when the
Japanese group's projects are expected to reach the clinical trial phase. It
will also enable Mitsubishi Kasei to build up its pharmaceutical businesses
outside Japan.
MKC's pharmaceutical research and development has been concentrated on the
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and central nervous system areas.
Although these are also Astra's specialities, the Swedish group stresses
there has been little overlap in research areas. It is therefore expecting
the collaboration to complement its own efforts.
Under the accord, Astra has acquired the right to develop and market
selected MKC pharmaceuticals in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, either
exclusively or jointly with the Japanese company.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Accor argues the logic of the
lower bid - Forte's higher bid for Meridien is not the whole story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the 27 years since they opened their first Novotel in Lille, Mr Gerard
Pelisson and Mr Paul Dubrule, joint chairmen of the Accor hotels-to-luncheon
vouchers group, have developed the disconcerting habit of finishing one
another's sentences.
Mr Pelisson takes the lead enthusing about the growing market for company
canteen meals in Latin America. Mr Dubrule explains why Accor agreed earlier
this year to merge its business travel interests with those of Carlson of
the US, rather than with American Express.
Both talk with equal animation, however, about why they rather than rivals
Forte of the UK should be allowed to buy the Meridien hotel chain, 57 per
cent owned by Air France.
When the Air France board meets on Thursday, financial logic dictates that
Forte should be the preferred candidate. Its offer reportedly values
Meridien at FFr1.8bn (Dollars 310m) compared to Accor's offer, thought to
value the chain at FFr1.6bn.
Mr Jean-Didier Blanchet, Meridien's chairman, has publicly backed Forte's
bid.
Air France is expected to announce a loss of FFr9bn for 1993 and is seeking
European Union approval for a French government cash injection of FFr20bn
over the next three years. Some might find it difficult to see how the
company could argue its case for more money in Brussels if it accepted the
lower Accor offer; Mr Dubrule and Mr Pelisson disagree.
They do not quite argue that they should be allowed to buy Meridien simply
because they are French. A naked appeal to French patriotism would be
difficult to sustain because all - or nearly all - the money Accor is
offering is being put up by Prince Al Waleed of Saudi Arabia.
Accor would own 51 per cent of a joint company, with the prince owning the
rest. Together, they are believed to be bidding for 40 per cent of Meridien.
Accor would inject about half of its 101 upmarket Sofitel hotels into the
joint company, along with its management skills.
Mr Dubrule and Mr Pelisson's central argument is that, although it is
offering less money, Accor could do more to ensure Air France's future than
Forte. They argue that Accor, with its hotel and business travel interests,
could provide Air France with more air travel and package bookings than
Forte.
Mr Pelisson points out that Accor's Paris offices are 200 metres away from
Air France's. He says: 'Most of their people have the same origins as ours.'
Mr Dubrule continues: 'It's easier to work with your neighbours than with
someone else. Forte's partner should be BA; our normal partner is Air
France.'
He says the European Commission should not be concerned about Air France
accepting less money. Mr Pelisson continues: 'What is most important for Air
France is that we can do much more to help it recover in the future.'
The co-chairmen have another objection to the Forte bid: it is offering too
much money. Last year, a French bank valued Meridien at only FFr1.2bn. Isn't
that something for Forte to worry about rather than Accor? Mr Pelisson says
it is something for Air France to worry about, since Meridien will require
investment of up to FFr2bn over the next five years. How would Forte pay for
that expansion?
But then how would Accor, whose net income fell to FFr615m last year from
FFr802m in 1992? Prince Al Waleed and his associates will fund the
expansion, Mr Pelisson says.
Accor itself has other expansion plans. The tie-up with Carlson will create
the world's biggest business travel company. Latin America's growing
economies present opportunities for selling business services. The group has
a 24 per cent interest in Accor Asia Pacific, a Sydney-based company which
runs Accor hotels throughout Asia. The demand for reasonably-priced hotels
in China and India will be huge.
If Accor's Meridien bid fails, the group has plenty of other interests to
pursue, the chairmen say.

The leadership of the Meridien hotel chain, 57 per cent-owned by Air France,
yesterday said they would prefer their company to be taken over by Forte of
the UK rather than by Accor of France or Kempinski of Germany.
Forte and Accor are regarded as front-runners to buy all or part of
Meridien. Kempinski is seen as an outsider.
Mr Jean-Didier Blanchet, Meridien's chairman, said the company's executives
had reviewed the three groups' business plans: 'By a vast majority they are
convinced that Forte is the best possible way to go for the future of
Meridien.'

Digital Equipment announced the resignation of one its top managers in the
wake of higher-than-expected losses for its third fiscal quarter.
Mr Edward Lucente, vice-president of worldwide sales and marketing and
general manager of Digital's systems business unit, who has been responsible
for all of Digital's marketing and sales as well as managing the company's
most important product group, had resigned 'effective immediately', the
company said.
He has been replaced by Mr Enrico Pesatori who joined Digital just 14 months
ago as general manager of the company's personal computer business.
'Enrico has created a growing and profitable force in the worldwide PC
market, making Digital an emerging market leader in this sector of our
industry,' said Mr Robert Palmer, Digital president and chief executive.
Mr Lucente is to become executive-in-residence, Graduate School of
Industrial Administration at Carnegie Mellon University, Digital said. Mr
Lucente is a lifetime trustee of the university.
Before joining Digital Mr Pesatori served for two years as president and
chief executive of Zenith Data Systems where he was credited with achieving
a turnround. Previously he spent 21 years at Olivetti.
Mr Lucente, a 30-year veteran of IBM, joined Digital in April 1993 after a
short period at Northern Telecom. He is regarded as one of the computer
industry's most experienced sales and marketing executives.
Commenting on Mr Lucente's departure, Mr Palmer said: 'Digital benefited
significantly from Ed's experience and leadership. He set high standards of
professionalism for our sales force and helped Digital move to a more
customer-focused organisation. We wish him well.'

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Kmart warns of further declines
in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Kmart, the US discount store group that has been struggling to compete with
its more successful rival Wal-Mart, yesterday warned that first-quarter
earnings would be even worse than the dismal results reported for the same
period last year.
It said lower-than-expected sales were to blame. Its specialty retailing
operations had performed strongly, it said, but not well enough to outweigh
a profits shortfall in the discount store division.
Earnings from continuing retail operations for the quarter to April 27 would
be 'well below' the 12 cents a share earned in the comparable quarter, the
company said. The latter figure has been restated to exclude the loss-making
Pace Membership Warehouse and PayLess Drug Store business, now sold.
Kmart said it expected to report improved earnings for 1994 as a whole. But
since the company plunged into net losses of Dollars 947m last year, this
failed to console the stock market, and the shares fell by Dollars 1 to
Dollars 17 by the close of trade.
Kmart, once the world's biggest retailer, has suffered five years of
stagnant earnings largely as a result of its inability to defend its market
against the rise of Wal-Mart.
One of its weaknesses has been inefficient inventory control that has
resulted in excess stocks of goods that customers do not want to buy. That
in turn has led to the need for big mark downs to dispose of the unwanted
goods.
Mr Joseph Antonioni, chairman and chief executive, said one factor
contributing to the poor sales figures had been inventory adjustments over
the past six months, including the elimination of more than 10,000
slow-selling items in the hardline and fashion merchandise categories.
Mr Antonioni said Kmart had completed a year-long assessment of
merchandising and store productivity.
'We plan to begin to implement some parts of the merchandising initiatives
in the second quarter, with significant implementation over the next year.
We anticipate that results will become evident as the year progresses and
into 1995,' Mr Antonioni said.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: DuPont jumps 39% to Dollars 642m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Shares in DuPont, the US chemicals group, jumped by Dollars 3 1/2 to close
at Dollars 58 1/8 yesterday as the company reported a 39 per cent jump in
underlying net income to Dollars 642m for the first quarter - its best
performance in any quarter since 1990.
Mr Edgar Woolard, chief executive, said the biggest factor in the profits
increase was lower costs. 'Although not yet complete, the restructuring
efforts are having a significant effect on our bottom line performance,' he
said.
However, Mr Woolard said the group was seeing increased demands in important
markets for a number of its businesses, including automotive products,
engineering polymers, nylon, Lycra spandex, and non-wovens.
'Not only is demand generally improved in the US, but market conditions are
better in Europe and Asia, where our chemicals and specialties sales are up
15 per cent and 6 per cent respectively,' Mr Woolard said
First-quarter turnover was Dollars 9.19bn, up Dollars 120m or 1 per cent
over the previous year's figure.
The net earnings of Dollars 642m, or 94 cents a share, compared with Dollars
493m, or 73 cents a share, last time. But last year's figure included a
non-recurring Dollars 32m gain from an exchange of North Sea petroleum
properties.
Petroleum segment earnings rose to Dollars 215m from Dollars 200m last time,
excluding the prior year gain.
Stronger domestic downstream performance, reflecting higher refined product
margins, helped outweigh the drop in upstream earnings resulting from a 20
per cent fall in crude oil prices.
All other segments increased earnings. Chemicals earned Dollars 83m, up from
Dollars 69m; fibres reported Dollars 144m, up from Dollars 102m; polymers
earned Dollars 147m, compared with Dollars 77m; and diversified business
made Dollars 148m, against Dollars 107m.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Boeing income hit by sales drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing weakness in the world market for new airliners resulted in a 10
per cent fall in net income to Dollars 292m from Dollars 325m for Boeing,
the US aircraft maker, in the first quarter.
Commercial jet deliveries fell to 82 from 93 last time while turnover
dropped to Dollars 6.35bn from Dollars 6.64bn. Earnings per share were down
to 86 cents from 96 cents.
Boeing warned last quarter that overcapacity in the world airline industry
would cause deliveries of its aircraft to fall to between 250 and 260 this
year from 330 last year. It said sales were expected to fall to between
Dollars 20bn and Dollars 21bn from last year's Dollars 25.4bn.
Yesterday, the company appeared to be taking a slightly more optimistic view
of the market, saying that deliveries this year were expected to be 'in the
260 range' and sales were expected to be 'in the Dollars 21bn range'.
On the other hand, Boeing added that it was expecting research and
development costs to rise this year because of systems integration and tests
on the new 777 aircraft and because of commercial development of the
extended range version of the 777, the 737-700, and the freighter version of
the 767.
The company also noted that reduced levels of new investment in facilities
and equipment meant it would be unable to capitalise as much debt interest
this year as it did last year.
Following the contract signing with Southwest Airlines for 63 of the 737-700
aircraft, Boeing said, detailed structural design work on the
next-generation 737 aircraft had begun. Sales discussion were taking place
with several domestic and foreign airlines.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Gerstner sees profits at IBM
this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines expects to be profitable this year, after
three years of heavy losses, Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive,
told shareholders yesterday at the computer company's annual meeting in
Toronto.
Unlike last year's annual meeting, when Mr Gerstner faced an audience of
angry shareholders calling for the resignation of the board of directors,
this year's shareholder gathering was a more friendly affair.
'While I'm not writing a pledge in stone, I can tell you that barring the
unforeseen, we are planning on being profitable in 1994,' he said.
'We're not in a position to blow the horn and declare victory. But I think
it's safe to say the funeral dirge is over.'
Mr Gerstner said that IBM would continue to cut costs and that the company
still planned to reduce its workforce by about 35,000 people by the end of
1995.
'I still believe . . . that's about the right number given current
assumptions about future business conditions,' he said.
Having achieved two consecutive quarters of profitability, 'cultural change
is one of my highest priorities', Mr Gerstner said. 'When it comes to a
results-oriented corporate culture, we're not there yet - by a long shot,'
he acknowledged.
'I believe (IBM) we have been the victims of 'success inertia',' he said.
'Things went so well for so long - we were so profitable, so highly regarded
 -that we stopped running hard.'
Using a sports analogy, Mr Gerstner likened IBM's situation to that of a
team that scores lots of points early in the game.
'They call it sitting on a lead . . . you start playing conservatively and
you frequently lose that lead - and the game - to fast and hungry
opponents.'
Last week, IBM's share price jumped by almost Dollars 6 to Dollars 58 3/8
when the company announced first-quarter results including an unexpected 6
per cent rise in revenues to Dollars 13.37bn and much higher than expected
profits of Dollars 392m.

<TEXT>
Apple Computer expects to improve its sagging gross profit margins in the
second half of its fiscal year, Mr Joseph Graziano, chief financial officer,
told a technology conference, AP-DJ reports from San Francisco.
The computer maker's gross profit margin stood at 24 per cent in the
just-reported second fiscal quarter, in which Apple reported an 84 per cent
drop in profits.
Mr Graziano said the company believed a three-year erosion in that
profitability measure had stabilised. 'We think we can expand from these
levels in the second half of the year,' he added. He did not quantify the
expected improvement.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Goodyear, the US tyre group, yesterday said strong US sales and operating
efficiencies had contributed to a surge in first-quarter net income.
Net income jumped 33 per cent to a record Dollars 116m, or 77 cents a share,
from Dollars 87.1m, or 60 cents, before the effect of an accounting change
in the first period of 1993.
Goodyear, which supplies more than 80 per cent of the tyres fitted on new
Chrysler cars, benefited from a powerful recovery by the US automotive
industry. Overall, revenues climbed to a high of Dollars 2.91bn, a 3.4 per
cent improvement from the year-earlier quarter.
'This outstanding performance is especially gratifying in light of economic
conditions in various regions of the world,' said Mr Stanley Gault, chairman
and chief executive.
In the US market, tyre revenues climbed 4.7 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn, while
unit sales were up 12.1 per cent.
Elsewhere, business was mostly lacklustre. International revenues edged 1.5
per cent ahead, partly because of a decline in Europe, where the
original-equipment passenger car market contracted. In Latin America, which
generated 23 per cent of Goodyear's operating profit last year, sales and
income were robust.
Strong demand in the US enabled the group to make more efficient use of its
plant capacity, lifting segment operating margins to 9.4 per cent, from 8.4
per cent a year ago. Lower interest expense was also a factor.
Separately, the company reached a tentative, three-year labour agreement
with the United Rubber Workers at the weekend, just hours after the previous
contract expired.
Neither side would disclose details of the pact, pending ratification by
union members. If approved, the URW would use the deal as a model in
negotiating contracts with other tyre groups operating in the US.
News of the agreement helped push up Goodyear's share price in early trading
on Wall Street. The stock rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 39 3/4 even though
its first-quarter results were at the low end of analysts' expectations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fall of 16 per cent in domestic sales at Siemens for the six months ended
March, was offset by strengthening foreign business, the German electrical
and electronics multinational reported yesterday.
Group net earnings were unchanged at DM879m (Dollars 514m) on turnover up 3
per cent at DM38bn, Siemens said. However, growth in sales was due to the
first-time inclusion of the US Sylvania lighting business.
Osram's turnover jumped 71 per cent to DM2.9bn. A similar rise in lighting
product orders, reflecting recovery in the north American economy and the US
automotive industry, contributed to an overall 9 per cent increase in
demand.
While the foreign order book was up 21 per cent at DM27bn after a 33 per
cent advance in the first quarter, domestic demand for the six months showed
no relative change, and was 6 per cent lower at DM17.5bn.
Incoming orders are considered an important indicator at Siemens, but the
figures are subject to sharp short-term fluctuations because of the high
capital costs of projects such as power stations.

The French government yesterday announced a price of FFr152 per share for
the public offer of the privatisation of Union des Assurances de Paris, the
country's largest insurance group.
The price represents a discount of about 7 per cent to yesterday's close of
FFr164 for UAP shares. Industry analysts said that the price was at the
lower end of expectations.
The French government also announced a group of long-term stable
shareholders which will hold a combined 11 per cent of UAP's shares.
Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the construction and communications group will
hold 2.2 per cent of UAP's shares, as will Soparinvest, part of the Albert
Frere group of Belgium and Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank.
Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group will hold 1.2
per cent of the shares, while Peugeot Citroen, the vehicle group will hold
0.8 per cent.
Meiji Mutual Life of Japan will take 1 per cent, with the balance accounted
for by Credit Local de France, the local authority lender, and the Caisse
des Depots, the state financial institution.
In addition to the core shareholders named yesterday, Banque Nationale de
Paris will hold 15 per cent of UAP's capital, reducing its stake from the
current level of 19 per cent.
Under the terms of the issue, individual investors will be able to confirm
orders for UAP shares from this morning until the evening of May 3. In the
case of excess demand for the 47.3m shares reserved for individuals, there
will be a clawback of up to 15 per cent of the 47.3m shares allotted to the
offering for institutional investors.

after buying stake

<TEXT>
Incentive, a key company in the Wallenberg family empire, yesterday launched
a bid for Cardo, a Swedish investment group, after buying a 44 per cent
stake in the company from Volvo for SKr3.7bn (Dollars 468m).
The offer, which values Cardo at SKr8.4bn, is designed to give Incentive
control of Gambro, one of the world's leading medical equipment groups.
Cardo has a 58 per cent voting stake in Gambro and 43 per cent of the
capital.
Mr Mikael Lilius, Incentive managing director, said the group wanted to
invest aggressively in medical technology.
'This is a market leader with a substantial growth potential,' he stated.
Gambro is particularly strong in the renal care field.
With an annual turnover of SKr16.7bn, Cardo is a bigger company than
Incentive which has sales of SKr12.3bn. Apart from its holding in Gambro,
the company has industrial operations spanning industrial doors, pumps, and
train brakes, and a big investment portfolio.
Mr Lilius said Incentive planned to reintroduce Cardo as a public company,
but it would also sell the company's equity portfolio. The portfolio, which
includes a 4.8 per cent voting stake in Volvo, has a value of SKr2.7bn.
Mr Lilius said Gambro fitted well with Incentive's diversified engineering
operations, which include transport, materials handling and processing. But
he said there were no plans to bid for the rest of Gambro, which last year
achieved profits of SKr976m on turnover of SKr9.05bn.
Terms of the Incentive offer are SKr500 per Cardo share and SKr325 per
warrant.
The Volvo disposal is a swift demonstration of the vehicle group's new
strategic focus on core transport operations, following last week's
announcement that it planned to shed around SKr40bn worth of non-core
assets.
Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive, said yesterday that the disposal was
'fully in line' with its new strategy. 'At the same time, I believe this is
a favourable solution for Cardo, industrially and in terms of ownership.'
It lifts Volvo's total proceeds from sales of non-core assets this year to
SKr7.1bn.

Agache and Au Bon Marche, two French companies associated with Mr Bernard
Arnault and his LVMH luxury goods group, yesterday reported healthy
increases in profits for last year.
Agache, which was Mr Arnault's original investment vehicle and is the
holding company through which he controls the network of businesses with
stakes in LVMH, last year increased net profits by 35 per cent to FFr368m
(Dollars 63.12m).
Turnover rose by 9.8 per cent to FFr27.6bn. Agache benefited in 1993 from a
FFr348m exceptional credit on its share of the proceeds of LVMH's sale of
the RoC skin care business.
Au Bon Marche, which has retail interests including the Bon Marche
department store in Paris as well as a large minority stake in LVMH, saw net
profits rise 15 per cent to FFr653m. The net dividend is going up rises to
FFr16 from FFr15.50.
The company, one of the businesses that is financing Mr Arnault's recent
efforts to unravel LVMH's cross-shareholding agreement with the Guinness
drinks group, received a FFr362m exceptional credit on the RoC sale.

capital costs of projects such as power stations.
The first-quarter surge in foreign demand, for example, was mainly
attributable to large Asian contracts. Total new orders at the important KWU
power generation division were 36 per cent ahead after six months at
DM4.9bn.
The group, which in January said it expected full-year profits to fall by 10
or 15 per cent mainly because of reduced investment earnings, is still
showing the strains of feeble investment in the German market.
Telecom sales were down from DM9.2bn to DM8.3bn. A rise in orders for
private systems offset a decline in the public sector, leaving the six-month
order total for this business unchanged at DM9.3bn.
Sales and orders at the loss-making computer business, Siemens Nixdorf
Informationssysteme, were both down around 6 per cent.
The group's payroll had increased by 6,000 to 397,000 since March 1993,
because of the consolidation of acquisitions such as Sylvania, in spite of
shedding some 8,000 jobs in the interim. The group plans to reduce numbers
employed by 15,000 this financial year.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Thomson-CSF accounts delayed

Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics subsidiary of Thomson, the
state-controlled French electronics group, is being forced to delay the
publication of its 1993 accounts as a result of the difficulties of Credit
Lyonnais, the ailing bank in which it is a minority investor.
Credit Lyonnais, which is in dire financial straits after years of
aggressive expansion, last month announced that it had made a FFr6.9bn
(Dollars 1.18bn) net loss for 1993 and disclosed details of a FFr44.9bn
emergency financial restructuring package, including a FFr4.9bn capital
increase and the transfer of FFr40bn of non-performing property loans to a
new shell company.
Mr Alain Gomez, chairman of Thomson, is understood to have taken a tough
stance in negotiations with the government over Thomson-CSF's involvement
with the rescue.
The Thomson holding company will contribute FFr1.2bn towards the capital
increase. However, Thomson-CSF has been left with a FFr1.5bn loss for 1993
due to its 21.56 per cent stake in Credit Lyonnais. It will have to
participate in providing guarantees for the new shell property company.
The value of its participation in the guarantees has been estimated at
FFr1.8bn, but has not yet been finalised. As a result, Thomson-CSF has
decided to delay publication of its 1993 results, originally due to come out
last Thursday, until it has assessed the full impact of its involvement in
the Credit Lyonnais rescue.
Thomson-CSF warned shortly after the announcement of the Credit Lyonnais
rescue plan that it would fall into the red in 1993 because of its share of
the bank's losses. The company, which made a net profits of FFr1.52bn in
1992, said its own businesses had produced 'very good' operating profits
last year.
Mr Philippe Mouthon, an analyst at Societe Generale in Paris, estimated that
Thomson-CSF would make a net loss of FFr2.2bn for 1993 and come back into
the black with net profits of FFr1.12bn this year.
Credit Lyonnais's management is pressing ahead with the implementation of
the rescue package. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, told L'Agefi, the French
financial daily, he hoped to complete the capital increase by the end of
June.

FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro rises to NKr877m in
first term

Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian energy and fertiliser group, yesterday announced
a rise in first-quarter net profit to NKr877m (Dollars 119.29m) from NKr506m
in the same period last year.
The advance was helped by a positive NKr127m net effect of accounting
changes, higher petroleum production and stronger results from the
agriculture division.
Higher prices for several of the group's main products and a stronger dollar
also contributed to the upturn.
Group operating revenue improved to NKr17.3bn from NKr16.5bn while operating
income emerged at NKr1.6bn, against NKr1.5bn. Hydro said that although
operating income showed little change, the first-quarter result was stronger
than last year's fourth quarter.
The impact of lower crude oil prices was largely offset by increased oil
production. The oil price during the quarter was Dollars 14 per barrel,
compared with Dollars 18 a year ago, while petroleum production  - of which
oil accounted for 77 per cent of total output - rose to 2.9m tonnes of oil
equivalent from 2.2m.
Hydro explained that the lower dollar oil price was also partly offset by
the higher average dollar exchange rate but the oil price stated in
Norwegian kroner for the 1994 first quarter was nevertheless 18 per cent
lower than in last year's first quarter.
The company said there was a general underlying improvement in the economies
of main markets.
For the group's individual segments, agriculture lifted first-quarter
operating income to NKr430m from NKr257m as sales rose to NKr7.6bn from
NKr7.4bn.
The oil and gas division saw operating income fall to NKr863m from NKr902m
as sales increased to NKr3.7bn from NKr3.6bn.
Petrochemicals boosted operating income to NKr133m from NKr112m as sales
rose to NKr1.2bn from NKr1.1bn.
