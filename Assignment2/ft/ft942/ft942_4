FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Permanent interest-bearing shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yields on permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) have risen since we last
published the table a month ago, writes Bethan Hutton.
Pibs are issued by building societies to raise capital. They pay a fixed
income indefinitely but are not redeemable, so investors can get back their
money only by selling them on the open market.
Rising Pibs yields are, generally, linked to the gilts market but variations
in the price differentials between different Pibs are due more to building
society factors.
The market is still reacting to the proposed take-over of the Cheltenham and
Gloucester building society by Lloyds bank. Elaine Milner, a director at
Hoare Govett, says the main impetus behind market movements recently has
been speculation over which building society could be the next target for
take-over.
But, she adds, investors' principal motivation is not the cash incentives
sometimes offered during a take-over, such as the Pounds 500 promised
initially to those at C&amp;G holding Pibs in the Lloyds take-over.
Instead, investors are prompted by the better credit ratings of Pibs issued
by larger institutions.
If a small society is taken over by a large one, it becomes more
credit-worthy and the price of its Pibs will increase. This has increased
demand for the Pibs issued by the smallest societies such as the Skipton,
Newcastle, Cheshire and Leeds Permanent.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Big day gets ever nearer - Rolling
Settlements
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is only one complete stock exchange account period left until rolling
settlement begins on July 18.
The stock exchange divides the year up into account periods, named by
letters of the alphabet. We are now in the middle of account period M, in
which the last day for dealings is July 1.
All trades conducted any time in the account period, which began on June 20,
are totalled and a single bill for the net amount is sent out. It has to be
settled on July 11.
This allows some investors (particularly, those who have dealt early in the
account) up to 15 working days to settle their accounts.
The system allowing them to settle the net amount is useful for all
investors, and especially speculators who aim to buy and sell at a profit
within the same account.
If successful, they can make money without ever having to put up a penny of
their own money.
Account periods will disappear from July 18, although investors who dealt in
the last period - account N - can still settle in the usual way on July 25.
From July 18, the settlement day will be 10 working days after dealing day -
or T+10.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Buyers take advantage - Directors'
Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever the market experiences some slow-down, directors tend to use the
opportunity to buy shares. This is proving to be the case at present. Over
the past six weeks or so, there has been a steady level of buying across all
sectors.
Computing company ACT Group announced results the day before directors
bought stock on the market. Following an additional announcement warning
that profits in the present year were going to be affected adversely by
product development costs, the price fell sharply.
At the lower share price level three directors - Roger Foster, the chairman,
Michael Hart, the managing director, and Dr Gwyn Jones, a non-executive
director, bought a total of more than 129,000 shares at prices between 130p
and 131p.
Porter Chadburn, the leisure goods distributor, also announced final results
during the week. The group recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 17.2m compared
to a loss of Pounds 3.6m for the same period last year.
Nevertheless the chairman, Patrick Barrett, remained confident about the
future and three directors, including himself, and the chief executive, Tony
Philipson, all bought stock at 32p.
Phillip Kaye is the largest single shareholder on the board of City Centre
Restaurants. Prior to this recent sale, he held more than 2 per cent of the
company. This stake has now fallen to about 1.6 per cent with the sale of 1m
shares at 82p.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Powering to profit - The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven of the 12 regional electricity companies report their results next
week, beginning with Norweb and Seeboard on Monday.
The seven will not want to increase their profits by a much larger
percentage than the 15 to 20 per cent announced already by the rest of the
pack. Doing so would attract unwelcome attention from consumers and the
regulator just ahead of the most important review of prices they are likely
to face.
Norweb is expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 175m, against
Pounds 157m, and a dividend of about 22.5p, up from 20p. Seeboard is
predicted to announce Pounds 125m (Pounds 113m) pre-tax and an 11.6p (10p)
dividend.
On Tuesday, Midlands is likely to announce about Pounds 200m pre-tax (Pounds
167m) and a 23p (20p) dividend. On Wednesday, Northern should announce about
Pounds 125m (Pounds 111m) and 24.6p (21.4p) and Eastern about Pounds 220m
(Pounds 183m) and 22p (19.2p).
On Thursday, SWEB should achieve Pounds 115m (Pounds 101m) and 23.3p (20p).
Yorkshire will bring the show to a close on Friday with about Pounds 175m
(Pounds 156m) and 23.5p (20.4p).
Airtours, the tour group, is due to report first-half results on Monday,
with pre-tax losses expected to be about Pounds 18m after a profit of Pounds
3.5m from disposal of fixed assets. This compares with Pounds 6.9m last time
before the expenses of Airtours' failed bid for its rival, Owners Abroad.
The loss will occasion no surprise; travel companies usually make first-half
losses. Nor will the size of the loss be unexpected; Airtours said this
would not exceed Pounds 18m when it launched a rights issue in April. BPB
Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard maker, has seen a sharp rise in
margins since a price war between it and two Continental companies - Lafarge
Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany - ended more than 18 months ago.
Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 100m are expected for the year to the end of
March when BPB announces its annual results on Thursday. This compares with
Pounds 57.5m the previous year, but is still well short of the peak of more
than Pounds 200m earned five years ago.
Asda, the supermarket group, reports its full-year results on Thursday and
is expected to post pre-tax profits of around Pounds 190m, little changed
from the Pounds 187.4m reported the previous year which included exceptional
credits of Pounds 65.2m.
Vendome, the Pounds 3bn luxury goods group spun off from the restructuring
of Rothmans last October, is expected on Friday to report profits of at
least Pounds 205m for the year to end-March - ahead of a pro forma Pounds
187.8m. The group, which numbers Cartier and Dunhill among its brands, will
also be reporting exceptional charges of more than Pounds 20m, mostly made
up of restructuring costs.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: An inter-galactic goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I am enjoying the World Cup. Soccer is the world's game, and will be one of
the first cultural activities mankind establishes on foreign planets once we
embark on space colonisation.
Many astronomers believe that the galaxies teem with intelligent life. Some
astronomers believe that colonisation must be well under way in many
galaxies, including our own. As stars wax and wane, people migrate towards
the galactic core, in search of fresh worlds, and discover that the galaxies
are veined by refugee and trade routes streaming inwards, towards
concentrations of civilised life.
I like that theory. I believe it to be true, which leads me to imagine that
somewhere close to the centre of our own galaxy - perhaps at this moment - a
variety of beings are competing in the Milky Way World Cup of soccer-playing
planets.
Given the distances, and the problems with travel - strikes by signallers,
the congestion at stellar intersections - I doubt whether the Milky Way
World Cup is staged at intervals shorter than 10,000 light years. But it
must be fun when it happens. Imagine the advances in tactics and the
improvements in training methods that must be displayed at this galactic
soccer festival once every 10,000 light years.
From that perspective, our own World Cup is a primitive thing indeed,
ruggedly prehistoric, played by coarse creatures barely out of the slime
stage, evolutionarily speaking, though much further up the scale of
soccer-playing life, it has to be admitted, than the creatures from
countries that failed to qualify - many of whom, unfortunately, are at a
pre-language stage and do not use utensils to cut meat.
I am lucky that I can watch the World Cup undistracted by distaff
chattering. I am watching the World Cup on the smaller of our two television
sets, in a corner of the dining room, while Miss Lee, my executive
assistant, is ensconced in the sitting room, which she chooses to call the
green room, watching Wimbledon, or films about surfies.
She watches nothing else. She is contemptuous of soccer - except, that is,
for a handful of Latin American players whose careers she monitors with
wistful devotion.
I bumped into her the other evening.
She said: 'Hello, Michael. How is Valderrama doing? Is he juicing things
up?'
I said: 'Carlos Valderrama, who plays for Colombia? What a big
girl's-blouse. All that ridiculous hair, and what does it add up to? Nothing
whatsoever. Colombia are finished. They haven't won a point. What a load of
rubbish.'
'How about Etcheverry, that nice Bolivian? I imagine he's surging.'
'I'm afraid that Etcheverry kicked a German and was shown the red card, so
it's goodnight to him.'
'Caniggia of Argentina?' Miss Lee looked distracted. 'Surely he's
prospering, thrusting into the penalty area, banging home the goals.'
'Claudio Caniggia is another girl's-blouse.'
'So tell me about yourself, Michael. How are you doing? I recall that among
a series of half-baked forecasts you made at the start of the year, you
predicted that in the final of the World Cup Norway would beat Brazil 3-1.'
'Did I?'
'It was New Year's Day. I remember sitting in the green room on New Year's
Day and perusing, for want of something better, a series of forecasts you
made for 1994, of which Norway to beat Brazil 3-1 in the final of the World
Cup was possibly the most eccentric.
'You sounded highly disturbed. You predicted, for example, that the FT-SE
100 would top-out at 3,660 before Easter and then fall like a stone in
September or October, and that the gold price would finish 1994 above
Dollars 500 an ounce.'
'And so it could, if the Chinese masses get their dander up and buy gold
heavily. They love their gold, those Chinese masses. An extra ounce per
Chinese household per calendar year would send the gold price soaring.'
'You also said that John Major would resign.'
'And so he will, Miss Lee. Just as Norway will beat Brazil in the World Cup
final. You'd like Norway. There's Sigurd Rushfeldt and Jan Aage Fjortoft and
Jahn Ivar Jakobsen . . .'
I looked up. Miss Lee had vanished. I was talking to myself. I returned to
the dining room, to my glistening screen, which brings me weird stories from
places far away.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Private View: Breakfast with a one-man welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To be invited to breakfast and discover your host making tea and toast in
his dinner jacket is mildly disconcerting, especially if he is nearly 79
years old.
Could the famously unconventional Michael Young (less well known as Lord
Young of Dartington) have just returned from an all-night, end-of-term,
party? Unfortunately, no. He was just saving time ahead of an evening
engagement at Glyndebourne opera.
But since it is nearly the end of term and since it is also the 25th
anniversary of the Open University, the creation of which Michael Young
inspired (the OU now boasts more than 200,000 students and has been copied
in 30 countries), it seemed a good time to find out what this remarkable
entrepreneur was up to.
Lord Young is too gentle for an entrepreneur, too modest for a visionary.
Listening to the thin, quiet voice it was hard to picture the social
revolutionary who, among other things, drafted the 1945 Labour Party
manifesto founding Britain's welfare state, coined the word 'meritocracy'
(to warn of its dangers) and created the Consumers' Association with its
enormously successful magazine, Which?.
He has a talent for originality rare in a conformist world. He sees what is
happening rather than what ought to be happening, describes what is lacking,
and sets about creating an organisation to supply it. It is a one-man
welfare state.
One of his latest wheezes - a prediction, really, for the next century  - is
the 'open school'. It is his solution to the problems of truancy, disruption
and academic failure and modelled on the Open University principle that
every student is a volunteer, not a conscript.
Children are growing up sooner, Lord Young observes, but the time they spend
in schools gets longer. Therefore they should, if they wish, be able to
leave at any point after primary level and do something socially useful
under supervision - including learning from home - until they are ready to
resume formal studies later in life.
Utopian, or barmy? From any other mouth such an idea would be mocked to
death. But similar schemes are emerging already.
'I suppose I am influenced by the fact that I was at a school where there
was little or no compulsion,' Lord Young explained. He was referring to
Dartington Hall School, the progressive establishment in Devon (recently
closed after a series of scandals).
'We didn't have to attend classes unless we wanted to. And one was
encouraged to learn through undertaking projects of various kinds. So when I
was 13 or so I mainly worked on a poultry farm, in the woods. I also set up
a motorcycle repair business and bought and sold motorcycles. Through the
chickens I learnt elementary book-keeping and how not to make a terrible
loss.
'I was certainly happy there. I think happiness is a good goad to learning.
It put the idea in my mind how much more swiftly people learn if they really
want to and how it can be spoilt for them if they have to. What may be awful
at 10 may be very agreeable at 13, and so on. Children don't develop at the
same rate.'
You went to some classes at Dartington I suppose?
'I went to a few, mmm. I was mainly interested in painting.' He indicated a
youthful landscape on the sitting room wall and told me he had a studio full
of pictures. 'And I was interested in philosophy. If there were any
compulsory classes they were in philosophy. Bertrand Russell's children were
there too. He was quite a frequent visitor and sometimes joined in the
classes.'
What about the learning gaps? Lord Young's example was not persuasive: he
recalled visiting Blenheim Palace as a youth with Anthony Crosland and Roy
Jenkins and marvelling at their knowledge of the painters displayed there.
Gaps or no, Michael Young was able to get a degree at the London School of
Economics while simultaneously qualifying as a barrister. Unfit for military
service because of asthma, he ran the think-tank Political and Economic
Planning during the second world war, joining Labour Party headquarters as
research director at the end.
He became disillusioned with politics and the outcome of the nationalisation
which he had himself fostered. So he turned to sociology, achieved a
doctorate, and lectured for a while at Cambridge. He calls himself a
'libertarian socialist'.
Open schools sounded fine, I said, but with the demands of today's economy
could we wait for children to feel ready to learn?
'But you can't train someone, not effectively, who doesn't want to be
trained,' he replied. 'It's not that I'm against schools, or education or
anything. I just like them to be attractive. If one was to abolish
compulsory education altogether most young children would certainly go. You
just have to see what pleasure children of three get at nursery school.
'You would have to introduce this sort of thing gradually. People would be
nervous, and rightly, about the minority of children who might escape the
system altogether. Clearly there are a lot of children for whom the standard
diet is satisfactory. They take to it beautifully. It would be awful if any
changes were to upset that.
'In essence they are volunteering. So they've got to be catered for along
with the rest. You can't just have everyone walking in the woods and coming
back with nice charcoal sketches.' He laughed.
What about 'workfare'? Lord Young's voice adopted a stentorian authority as
he pretended to address a defaulter: 'Yes. You don't look after people with
Alzheimer's disease. You haven't learned how to look after a trout fishery
in north Wales. You have refused to go to Africa to help with the irrigation
scheme in Rwanda. There's something wrong with you, John] You can't expect
us to keep you if you don't do anything at all.'
It was not only his schooling which was unconventional. Michael Young's
father was an Australian violinist who turned music critic. His Irish mother
separated from his father, after falling for a Russian Bolshevik with a
flashing smile, and lived the bohemian life: love affairs, painting,
partying and teaching at the Workers Educational Association.
I asked her son what, in founding 30 or more organisations, he had been
trying to do all these years.
'God knows. Maybe he doesn't. I've obviously tried to meet a need. I think
I've got a rather keen sense of the market - usually not a commercial market
 -or of a demand that can be met by some innovation. I've always been
motivated by opposition.'
He is also moved by what he calls 'the wonderful potential in all of us that
isn't being realised'.
'And I think there has been a sort of communitarian or collectivist theme.
I've always thought that co-operatives were, on principle, the best sort of
organisation for economic and social purposes.'
So the Consumers Association is an information co-operative whose members
act as guinea-pigs for each other's purchases. The Advisory Centre for
Education monitors schools, the College of Health medical treatment. His
University of the Third Age, set up with the social historian Peter Laslett,
has retired people teaching each other. On his 'brain trains' it is the
commuters.
He recognises, however, the failure of most workers' co-operatives. That had
been a disappointment, he said.
Are people fundamentally collaborative or selfish?
'Both. But I think what we've played up is the selfish side of it, and the
collaborative side has been played down. The way we think about society and
manage it - I think the whole thing is out of balance.'
Many people must think of doing something when their toaster doesn't work, I
said. But you go and start an organisation. What makes you different?
'What I learned from Dartington is the practical, or administrative sense. I
don't think I'm a good administrator of something which is routine but I
think I'm a good administrator of something which isn't yet born because I
have a rather good head for detail.'
And because you know how to work the system?
'I can often see where with small effort you can achieve a relatively large
result.'
He guards against failure by looking for people to find fault with his
schemes. 'The most valuable people in any new enterprise are those who think
it's no good.'
You seem to enjoy creating these bodies as much as seeing the benefits, I
said.
'Once something's going, if it is going, I'm happy to leave it.
Unfortunately I find it difficult not to keep thinking of things to be done.
They come streaming into my mind.'
His latest project is to improve the rites of death. It may have less to do
with his age than with the premature death exactly a year ago of his second
wife, Sasha Moorsom. It is obvious he misses her a great deal. 'I would have
liked to have died before her and to change places with her if one of us had
to die,' he said, almost whispering.
He spent hours in research at crematoria watching the hurried routine
enforced by the expense of the machinery. 'Binding people to the pace of the
machine can give a very inhuman result,' he said. 'It is even more terrible
than I thought.' His National Funerals College, launched this month, aims to
remedy that by putting clergy, funeral directors, counsellors and
crematorium managers together.
There is yet another project on the books, to do with the beginning of life.
But that is still a a secret.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Wrestling with a knotty problem: Dominic Lawson confesses to
an increasing affliction - clothing cowardice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week I received a visit from a man from the Iranian embassy, or rather,
as his card specified, The Islamic Republic of Iran. He was not wearing a
tie. They do not, in the Islamic Republic. I believe it is something to do
with the tie being a Christian symbol, crosses and all that, which keeps the
Iran of the ayatollahs an open-necked zone.
Open-necked is not quite accurate. The man from Tehran had his white shirt
buttoned (on a very hot day) to the top. Now, I do not want to argue that I
would have been friendlier to my visitor if he had been wearing a tie: we
opinion formers are never so superficial, even after a good lunch on a hot
day in the City. But the emissary's strict adherence to the dress code of a
regime we tend to regard as a fanatical alien theocracy was not designed to
put me at my ease.
Clearly the man could not have been a spy. But what must he have thought of
me? Here, in an office lacking air-conditioning with the windows bolted shut
against the noise of passing traffic, sat the Englishman in a suit and tie,
drinking hot tea with milk.
Which of the two men could be said to have the odder customs, at least as
far as dress is concerned? The encounter set me thinking. Why should I not
come to work in the summer dressed in the open-necked style which pleases
me, rather than some unfathomable code of etiquette.
This tie business is a particular problem. I like my existing range of
shirts, but in the past, while the sleeves have kept their length nicely,
the collars have mysteriously shrunk in the wash.
Every weekday morning there is an awesome, asphyxiating struggle to lock the
tie into place. The blood supply to the brain is impaired, and the ideas
which I woke up with, dwindle in direct proportion to the diminished supply
of oxygen.
There is no excuse for this. It is not as if there was some senior figure in
the office who could tell me that I was not properly dressed without a
jacket and tie. Nor would I have any trouble getting into restaurants. With
the exception of the Savoy Group and the Ritz, I can think of few places of
executive entertainment where the traditional dress code is rigidly
enforced. And even there the staff will gladly lend the casual diner a
temporary jacket and tie. I suppose it all boils down to that awful disease
of the middle-aged: the desire to be taken seriously.
I am frightened to be mistaken for an advertising copywriter or a member of
the bohemian intelligentsia - my office is dangerously close to The
Guardian's.
At weekends too, I am increasingly afflicted by this clothing cowardice.
When I am in Gloucestershire, solid farming country, I do not want the
passing men of the soil to realise, before I open my mouth, that I am an
interloper, a man from the 'smoke', as they call London. So I must wear a
Barbour jacket, old corduroy trousers, and uncleaned green wellingtons. I am
still, of course, betrayed by the speed with which I drive my car around
their narrow lanes, but there are sacrifices my temperament is not prepared
to make, even for social acceptability in the shires.
There are certain people, back in the City, who think they have found the
answer, who have developed an item of dress which is meant to proclaim:
'Yes, I have a good and responsible job, but I am more witty and imaginative
than the rest of you bores.'
This item is called the bow tie. But, while I have one or two friends who
perpetrate this sartorial statement, I think we can all agree that, on the
whole, bow-tie wearers are wrong 'uns: the circumstantial evidence is
compelling.
Indeed, had the man from the Iranian embassy come into my office wearing a
bow tie, I would have been even more undiplomatic over the matter of Salman
Rushdie.
You will have noticed that I have touched only on the matter of male dress
codes. And unavoidably so. While it is true that the public dress of women
in the Islamic Republic of Iran is not strong on variety, over here only a
book could scratch the surface of so deep and mysterious a social issue.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Greece mourns end of an era - The death of bouzouki
player and composer Manos Hadjidakis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a poignant scene in Jules Dassin's Never on Sunday in which Homer
Thrace, the brash American know-it-all determined to bring back the true
cultural values of ancient Greece to a country he finds riddled with happy
hookers and hard drinkers, castigates Takis, the local bouzouki player, for
being unable to read music, thus forsaking any right to be called a
musician.
The scolded Takis sulks away to lock himself in the bathroom, only to
recover his spirits when Ilya, the compassionate whore played by Melina
Mercouri, persuades him that the birds in the trees manage to be the most
beautiful of all music-makers without ever needing to consult written notes.
The scene was almost certainly based on a real-life incident during the
shooting of the film; Dassin had been assured by his wife Mercouri that the
film score's composer, Manos Hadjidakis, would produce a fitting piece of
music to accompany his sharply cynical portrayal of American cultural
imperialism.
What he had not expected was that Hadjidakis would turn up with a group of
friends with not a leaf of sheet music between them, asking them simply to
improvise round any random melody he would start picking out.
Dassin need not have worried; Hadjidakis's main theme for Never on Sunday,
sung by Mercouri, won that year's Original Song Oscar and became a massive
international hit.
The death of Hadjidakis last week, following so closely that of his great
friend and collaborator Mercouri in March, has left Greece in a state of
shock which is hard to imagine in any other European country.
These two great charismatic performers, along with Mikis Theodorakis, were
by far the most potent symbols of Greece's cultural golden era at the start
of the 1960s, when the country began to emerge from the lengthy shadow of
its Nazi occupation and civil war, and started to enjoy the fruits of cheap
air travel and hordes of sunshine-seeking northern Europeans.
The bouzouki, and the brooding, sensual rebetiko folk-song became ubiquitous
harbingers of the country's new self-confidence; previously dismissed as a
marginal, working class phenomenon, Hadjidakis and Theodorakis used their
flair for melody, and later their thirst for experimentation, to bring this
essentially eastern musical form to mass attention.
Today, serious music critics dismiss much of these composers' work as
tourist-kitsch, but that is to underestimate its role in defining a new
identity for a modern country straining to shed a frightening burden of
ancient glories.
For a brief period, before the Colonels' coup in the spring of 1967, Greece
 -modern Greece - felt it could teach the world a thing or two about living,
whether in the form of Anthony Quinn's Zorba, conducting Alan Bates in a few
weary dance-steps on the beach, or Mercouri's Ilya, devouring ouzo, sailors
and capitalism in equal measure.
Today, straining to breathe through the belching fumes of its capital city,
racked by economic uncertainty, feeling threatened by border states, Greece
has lost that momentary sense of exhilaration and has reverted to its
previous cultural inferiority complex. As long as there was Melina fighting
to her last breath for her Marbles, as long as Hadjidakis continued to hold
court in Athenian cafes, Greeks could still remember when things felt
better.
The loss of these dominant figures deals a hefty blow to a national psyche
which, forged by the Cassandras and Medeas of its cultural heritage, needs
little encouragement to look on the bleak side of life.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Sizzler in the concert hall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Driver reviews John Adams' new concerto conducted by Ken Nagano
The London Symphony Orchestra's concert under Kent Nagano at Barbican Hall
on Thursday was designed to be sizzling and balletic: Ravel's La Valse,
Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet ballet suite and the European premiere of the
Violin Concerto by the American John Adams (born 1947), a composer renowned
for heady minimalist rhythmic intensities. Nagano is a leading exponent of
Adams's work, having launched (and latterly recorded) his opera The Death of
Klinghoffer and performed many of his other pieces.
He is also a guaranteed sizzler in the concert hall. His account of Ravel's
bewitching yet brutally vivid 'choreographic poem', that strangely extrovert
threnody for the old Europe, which begins in the ballroom to end on the
battlefield, made one feel the truth of all those epithets and brought home
the sheer sonorous power of the LSO, especially in the lower and darkly
rumbling registers. No matter how dark and rumbling the sounds, they were
always precisely focussed: little curling counterpoints took on chilling
force.
Adams's concerto, written in 1993 and premiered in Minneapolis in January
(with soloist Jorja Fleezanis) is also a kind of choreographic poem, having
been jointly commissioned not only by two orchestras (Minnesota Orchestra;
LSO) but by the New York City Ballet. Adams's strict, often motoric rhythmic
manner and colourful (but often inwardly complex) imagery lend themselves
readily to dance.
His 1988 score Fearful Symmetries has been choreographed no less than six
times, most recently by Ashley Page, whose Royal Ballet version opened at
Covent Garden last week.
But it was out of the experience of opera composing, Adams writes, that the
present concerto sprang. To him it illustrates a melodic and harmonic
flexibility and a contrapuntal richness alien to the minimalist rigour of
his earlier work but called for by The Death of Klinghoffer and now the
basis of what he calls a 'post-Klinghoffer', or post-minimalist, language.
Actually, few minimalist composers besides the soporific Philip Glass have
tended to keep matters truly minimalist for long; but there is no mistaking
the opulent melodic and contrapuntal intentions of this new work, even if
the part-writing is heavily dependent on flurrying scale passages, and the
rhapsodising does not quite throw up tunes.
The orchestra used is small (double winds), but a large assortment of
percussion and a pair of synthesisers make up the odds. When the latter are
not spending time perversely imitating the harp, they contribute some novel,
ethereal effects. There are the three movements, fast-slow-fast, traditional
to a concerto: the second a gently musing and attractive Chaconne with the
curious subtitle 'Body through which the dream flows'; the third an
exceptionally lively Toccata with extra bite supplied by claves and cowbell.
The solo part, brilliantly despatched by Gidon Kremer, is full of
traditional figurations and devices. With likeable impunity and verve, Adams
has produced a virtuoso vehicle in something like the grand romantic manner.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Whaddaya know, dreams come true - To his surprise,
Martin Hoyle enjoys 'Copacabana'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They came to sneer (well, some of us) and stayed to cheer (well, most of
them). Copacabana is the musical based on the song by Barry Manilow. A
tempting precedent for lazy impresarios who can now adapt any number of
well-loved songs into plays and illuminate the West End with such titles as
Ich Grolle Nicht and Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.
Let it be said at once that those of us who, with the open-mindedness of
true criticism, approached this show with dread were pleasantly surprised.
If you associate Manilow's music with the Weltschmerz of blue-rinsed matrons
in sun-lounges, be reassured that these songs are new, fresh - though a
threatened rendering of 'I Write the Songs' drew screams of recognition from
the audience - and sometimes tuneful.
Roger Redfarn's Plymouth-originated production is cheerful, spectacular,
bouncy and shrewdly aimed at its market. Let curmudgeons complain. A show
that cribs WS Gilbert's joke about composing and decomposing has pedigree.
The framing story concerns a young song-writer, Steve (Gary Wilmot,
immensely likable), who dreams up the title song as he strums at the piano.
Dissolve into the play within a play; Steve becomes young song-writer Tony
who falls for aspirant actress from Tulsa, one Lola (Nicola Dawn). We are
transported to the interior of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, or possibly
Grand Central Station, where a dozen young hopefuls in identical Andrews
Sisters hairstyles arrive to make the big time.
This is 1947 Broadway and after auditioning for South Pacific and Brigadoon
Lola is taken on by the Copacabana nightclub. Here she attracts the
attention of villainous Rico (Ronald Reagan in a moustache, though the
programme calls him Richard Lyndon) and we are dazzled by showgirls in
glitter wearing gilded grapes, gold pineapples and what in one case look
like ungilded courgettes. 'This is the kind of glamour l used to dream
about,' breathes Lola. Me too; l would wake up screaming.
Rico says, 'Champagne should never be sipped; it should he consumed like
life itself - with great passion.' His discarded mistress Conchita, also in
glitter but no vegetables, is alarmed; she knows the signs. We then enjoy
'Bolero de Amor', one of those numbers where the girls wear fishnet
stockings on their arms and the men tear their (the girls') skirts off.
Tension mounts as Conchita (nicely played as a fading Chita Rivera type by
Anna Nicholas) tries to warn off Lola with philosophy: 'Honee, too much
dreaming can be dangerous.' Rico cruelly counters this with an Oxford
linguistic snarl of 'Conchita has been telling her putrid lies again.'
Drunk with the sophistication of it all, Lola is kidnapped to Havana
('Havana, Cuba?' she asks like another geographically disadvantaged heroine,
Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls) where Rico intends to have his way with her.
In Rico's own nightclub, the Tropicana, Conchita and Her Boys (pleated
flairs, frilly sleeves and nattily knotted boleros) sing of Havana in terms
that recall 'It's Nicer in Nice' from The Boy Friend.
The full extent of Rico's dastardly intentions towards the humiliated Lola
then becomes clear. He forces her into a dance routine where she is captured
by lithe-limbed pirates who finger her frills, rather enviously l thought.
Tony effects their escape from Rico's clutches and the company does a big
number addressed to 'Sweet Heaven' which I think reads a little too much
into the deity's interest in aberrant showgirls. Back in his apartment young
Tony/Steve wakes from his reverie, having fallen in love with his creation,
Lola. (A duet, reality and fantasy never quite meeting, provides a moment of
genuine charm.)
But lo] The girl whom we have glimpsed in the framing narrative as a nag
with a face-pack does her hair, puts on a frock and 'It's you]' he cries.
And whaddaya know, his squabbling in-laws turn out to be the comically
irascible club-owner Sam and wisecracking cigarette-girl Gladys (Jenny
Logan) of his dream. He even gets to take the girlfriend's glasses off, thus
transforming her, according to time-honoured alchemy, into a beauty.
He decides to give the title song a happy ending. The critics realise that
the evening has passed without actually hearing the number right through
and, reckoning that for once they have the breaks, steal away.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: The purest painter of them all - William Packer
admires the later work of Pierre Bonnard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLAIM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pierre Bonnard, with a handful of his more-or-less contemporaries - Matisse
and Picasso of course, Beckmann, Mondrian and one or two others  - is one of
the truly great painters of the 20th century. What makes him remarkable
within this elite is his quality as the purest painter of them all. That is
not to say that he was not an exquisite draughtsman, but even in this
respect we find him suggesting, teasing the image out of a delicate flurry
of marks, rather than fixing and delineating it in more conventional graphic
fashion.
If his drawing is so painterly, how much more so is his painting itself. For
while with Picasso and Matisse, for example, we will always find a quality
of drawing in the painting - that is to say in the linear statement of an
image which only then is painted - with Bonnard the paint on the surface is
the image, the image a confection of stroke against stroke, colour against
colour, with whatever line there is growing from this process.
The irony is that it was as a graphic artist that Bonnard first made his
reputation in his Nabis youth in the 1890s. But here again it is in the
broader disposition of pattern, tone or colour, mass against mass, flat on
the surface, that we find the distinguishing character of the work. Even in
the work of his old age, and especially in the domestic interiors and
table-top still-lifes, with their frontal, horizontal and vertical emphases,
and their exploitation of doors and windows, mirror frame and table edge, we
may discover echoes of those same youthful, sophisticated graphic tricks.
It is this work of his old age which provides the substance of the small,
beautifully judged and visually ravishing exhibition that now fills the
Hayward's upper galleries. Bonnard had been visiting and working in the
south of France since the early years of the century. In the spring of 1926,
at the age of 58, having decided at last to settle in the sun, he bought the
Villa du Bosquet at le Cannet, a small resort close to Cannes on the Cote
d'Azur. It was to be not just home and studio but the principal subject and
stimulus of his work until his death, some 21 years later.
He did not, of course, confine himself to working only from the house and
its garden, but it is the intriguing premise of this exhibition to
concentrate on what he did within that limitation. Nothing, however, is lost
of the variety or scope of his work, for here along with the paintings of
his wife, Marthe, taking yet another bath, or of the table laid for lunch,
are broadest and most distant of landscapes, looking out high over the
garden wall to the sea far below, and to the blue and purple mountains far
beyond.
And in between comes the middle view, up the steps to the terrace, down the
garden path to the garden gate and over the wall to the neighbours'
rooftops, fields and gardens. The birds feed along the path between the
shrubs and bushes: the little dog skips across the grass. Inside the house,
the tables seem to take us through the hours of the day and the seasons of
the year. We tour the house, from dining-room to bathroom, to studio, to
bedroom and back to dining-room - the house is not large. Marthe bathes
again, sits working at the table, moves across the room, gets ready to go
out. The painter looks at himself in the bedroom mirror.
The sense of place is palpable, inescapeable. We feel we know exactly where
we are, whether sitting at table, looking out of the window or through from
one room to the next, catching just a glimpse of another figure here, a
profile there, caught out of the corner of the eye. It is all done through
the paint, shimmering and glowing on the surface of the canvas. We are not
shown what is there exactly: nothing is described in simple terms, but
rather hinted at, suggested by touch and colour, stroke against stroke.
We are coaxed into a conspiracy of feeling by which we sense through our
eyes, rather than merely see, just how the sunlight hangs in the air, and
the shadows fall, and time passes, so softly. We may almost hear the bees
hum, and the clock tick. 'Brightness falls from the air; Queens have died,
young and fair . . .' Here is a great artist in his full maturity, catching
sensation even as it fades. It is magical stuff, and poignant too, as is all
great art, for it touches on our mortality. 'Dust hath closed Helen's eye .
. .'
Bonnard at le Bosquet: Hayward Gallery, South Bank Centre SE1, until August
29, then on to Newcastle; National Touring Exhibition sponsored by British
Telecom.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Dancing into difficulties - American ballet companies
are losing their way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN ACOCELLA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last December The Red Shoes, a musical comedy based on the world's most
famous ballet movie, opened and closed on Broadway. It says something about
the current state of ballet in New York that, a few months later, both of
our major ballet companies were found serving up the funeral meats cold. At
American Ballet Theatre, one of the spring season's featured offerings -
indeed, a trumpeted event, with five performances added ('by popular
demand') before it even opened - was the silly little ballet that the modern
dance choreographer Lar Lubovitch had created for that musical.
Meanwhile, the star of The Red Shoes, Margaret Illmann of the National
Ballet of Canada, apparently no sooner got back to Toronto and fed her cat
than she got a call from New York City Ballet. Not to be outdone in the Red
Shoes salvage department, NYCB invited her to dance three guest performances
during the spring season.
A glamorous past, an aimless present feeding off that past while trying to
figure out whether there is going to be any future - that, right now, is the
story of ballet in New York.
In addition to The Red Shoes, ABT dredged up Antony Tudor's 1963 Echoing of
Trumpets, a highly sensationalist anti-war ballet (Nazis, gang rape on
point) and produced James Kudelka's Cruel World (to Tchaikovsky's 'Souvenir
de Florence'), a highly sensationalist new ballet not about war but about
how many slam-bang gymnastic pas de deux  - with the woman spun, swung,
flung, caught at the last possible second - you can pack into one ballet.
Six, as I recall.
But the major event of ABT's season was a new Nutcracker, choreographed by
company director Kevin McKenzie to a libretto by playwright Wendy
Wasserstein (The Sisters Rosensweig). Like so many Nutcracker-revisers,
Wasserstein has made the ballet more rational, more up-to-date. But above
all what she has done is make it more complicated.
This ballet has things no Nutcracker has ever needed before: unicorns,
Jewish jokes, four ballerinas. Meanwhile, the things a Nutcracker does need
 -a tree that grows, a battle that starts with the battle music, a party
scene where you can tell who the mother is - it doesn't have. Nor are there
any interesting dances. The big duet for Clara and her Nutcracker is an
almost comically ungainly number. The night I was there, the excellent
dancers Ashley Tuttle and Gil Boggs looked as though they were afraid they
were going to be killed.
While ABT invested most of its resources in this big, bad production, New
York City Ballet put its eggs in twelve little baskets. In 1992, the company
staged a festival called the Diamond Project, in which various
choreographers were asked to stage new ballets on a low budget.
This year, the Diamond Project was revived - the company now says it will be
a biennial event - and, as before, a great range of choreographers were
invited, veterans and tyros, company insiders (Damian Woetzel, Miriam
Mahdaviani, Robert LaFosse, Richard Tanner, Peter Martins) and outsiders
also (Kevin O'Day, Trey McIntyre, David Allan, Ulysses Dove, Lynn
Taylor-Corbett, Anna Laerkesen, John Allyne).
Basically, they produced two kinds of ballets. One was the complication
ballet, favoured by the company insiders - a ballet in which classical steps
are cut up into a thousand details, a thousand little prettinesses, in the
hope, it seems, of distracting the audience from the question of what it all
means.
The complication ballet is descended from one aspect of George Balanchine's
work, as reinterpreted by his successor as NYCB director, Peter Martins, and
it was Martins's contribution to the Diamond Project, Mozart Piano Concerto,
that provided the purest example. In the slow movement, the principal
dancers had so many niceties to cope with - turns tilted and twisted and
embellished and reversed halfway through - that they could barely dance.
This was not a ballet; it was a teacup - Louis XV.
More popular with the audience was the genre favoured by the outsider
choreographers: the alienation ballet. This, too, I believe, is descended
from Balanchine - from his stark 'leotard' ballets - but remotely. Its true
father is William Forsythe, the American choreographer who has had such a
success in Europe. In any case, what it looks like is a Calvin Klein
advertisement. To jarring music (Bartok, electric violins) stylish-looking
young people stand around in unitards looking sexy and disaffected.
Occasionally, they dance with each other; often they dance alone, and then
get bored and walk off stage.
A few promising pieces issued from these unpromising molds - Miriam
Mahdaviani's Correlazione, Richard Tanner's Episodes &amp; Sarcasms, Kevin
O'Day's Viola Alone - but that is three out of 12, and all three needed more
work. In a ballet world nearly void of interesting new choreography, the
Diamond Project sounds like a good idea - throw everybody into the pool, see
who swims - but perhaps it isn't. With so many choreographers, each is given
too small an honour, too small a challenge, and this may have contributed to
the extreme conventionality of their works. The company would probably be
better served by operating in the usual way: commissioning two or three
works and thus placing serious bets.
Apart from its general mediocrity, what struck one about the new ballet
choreography this spring was how very difficult it was. Dancers pirouetted
with their legs crossed; they somersaulted off their partners' shoulders;
they sweated and gasped. These are not the kinds of exertions that keep
ballet companies in shape. Both ABT and NYCB are fielding some thrilling
young dancers - notably, Ethan Stiefel and Jennifer Ringer at NYCB and
Paloma Herrera and Ashley Tuttle at ABT - at the same time that general
company standards are falling.
In a recent performance of Balanchine's Mozartiana at NYCB, the four woman
corps moved as if through custard. For this situation, various reasons have
been advanced, including the death of Balanchine and other revered masters.
('All our icons in the dance have pretty much passed on,' ABT principal
Cheryl Yeager said in a recent interview with Dance Magazine. 'We don't have
to cut off our heads to be ballet dancers any more.') The decline will only
be hastened, however, if choreographers, looking for something striking to
do, create steps so difficult that they cannot shape or phrase them - in
effect, cannot dance them - but only hope to get through them somehow.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Face-lift for listed National Theatre - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke declared the National Theatre on
London's South Bank a listed building. And on Thursday Richard Eyre, the
NT's director, announced that Sir Denys Lasdun's unloved creation was to be
subject to a substantial face-lift.
Time may improve the look of the National but concrete brutalism, circa
1970, is currently out of popular favour. Richard Eyre's diplomatic
embellishments, which include closing the ugly road that circles the place
and knocking down a superfluous walkway to create a square stretching to the
river, are a small step in the right direction. Sealing and cleaning the
concrete before it starts to crumble may also soften the over-riding menace
of the fly tower.
So here is an artistic re-development to be warmly welcomed. And although it
is dangerous to distribute Lottery money before a pound has actually been
staked, the National must stand a good chance of being an early beneficiary.
For of course Richard Eyre can only afford his Pounds 7m refurbishment if he
gets Lottery aid.
He anticipates raising Pounds 3.5m from the National's friends with the rest
coming either as a millennium project or from the Arts Council's Lottery
funds. The National is enjoying an artistic flowering; it runs a tight ship
financially and never publicly asks for more subsidy; the building is more
successful inside than out and money will be spent here. This seems a
Lottery project with a favourable wind behind it.
Adding to its prospects was the news that Peter Brooke and his fellow
Millennium Medici's have decided to devote some of the Pounds 100m plus a
year they will distribute to smaller projects, as well as a dozen major
schemes. The National's Pounds 3.5m falls neatly into this category if its
alternative source, the Arts Council, should prove unexpectedly difficult.
Peter Brooke has shed some light on his thinking. The number of substantial
millennium projects has been raised from the rumoured eight to a dozen,
which should encourage the more peripheral projects like the Chester
auditorium and Albertropolis. As expected, he intends to support bursaries.
He also gave tentative backing for the idea of a major festival on the lines
of the 1851 Great Exhibition. Surely no time can be wasted if this project
is going to be a serious contender rather than a half-cocked diversion.
When Charlie Allsopp calls to order the saleroom at Christie's at 7pm on
Monday evening and takes bids on a tiny Boudin landscape, the art world will
hold its breath. This auction of post-1870 art, taken with a similar
offering at Sotheby's on Tuesday, will determine the fate of the season.
In the good old days, Pounds 50m and more might be raised from an hour's
frantic dealing at this annual summer sale. Now both auction houses will be
happy to bring in half that. The auctions are very selective, with just 50
or so lots at each. Vendors have been persuaded to accept modest reserves.
The pictures are mainly fresh on the market, with enticing historical
pedigrees. The preparations have been meticulous, for another disaster could
set back the price recovery in art for another year.
Christie's has the good later stuff, including one of the eight Atelier
pictures that Braque painted in the 1950s. It sold Atelier VIII for Pounds
4.3m in 1992, when the market was at rock bottom. The top estimate of Pounds
3.5m for Atelier V shows excessive caution.
Sotheby's has the better earlier works, including the first sketchy version
of Manet's most important composition, that bar girl at the Follies-Bergere,
a star of the Courtauld collection. The Pounds 3m estimate seems modest. The
other Sotheby's gem is one of the ten paintings of poplars Monet completed
in 1891. Here again Pounds 3m is expected. A sign of the times is the Pounds
750,000 estimate on a haunting painting by Magritte: in 1989 it sold for
over Dollars 2m.
Perhaps Sotheby's and Christie's will have calls from a mysterious telephone
bidder, like the one who transfixed Bonhams' auction of Gothic art last
Monday. The sale almost doubled its forecast at Pounds 271,000, with a bed
designed by Pugin's son Edward in 1865 making Pounds 38,500. The new owner
of the bed, and much else from the sale, is that well known Hollywood Goth,
Cher.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Arts: Why maestros don't throw wobblies - Antony Thorncroft
explains the different rules governing classical and pop recordings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We all know that pop stars spend as much time in court as in the studios and
that there are few artists who have not at some time fallen out with their
record companies over royalties and advances. But could the same thing
happen in the classical field; could Pavarotti throw a George Michael-style
wobbly and take Decca, his recording company, to court?
In general, the classical departments of the record companies are
considerably more rarified environments than their pop counterparts: there
is still an over-riding commitment to art for art's sake. Profits are
perceived as less important than the wonderful creations that they are
laying down for posterity. In practice, this has meant that the classical
departments of the large record companies are loss-making and they have been
subsidised by the more lucrative pop sections.
The rules that govern classical music recordings are, in most cases, the
complete opposite of the cut-and-thrust workings of the pop business. It is
the classical artists, especially the handful of established divas and
maestros, who have the record labels over the financial barrel. When the
maestro coughs, the record executives jump.
In pop, major stars tend to earn most of their fortunes from their records
and use live performances to promote the sales of albums whereas a
prestigious record contract is a useful promotion for the source of the real
money in classical music - the concert halls and the stages of the opera
houses. A handful of big name stars - Pavarotti, Domingo, Kiri te Kanawa,
etc - have quickly learned to exploit their commercial appeal and moved out
of the opera house clique into the entertainment media, with vast open air
concerts, emphasising the superior earning potential of the live performance
for the classical star.
In pop, talent scouts scour the country in search of new acts which they
strive to exploit quickly during the brief period of their fashionable
shelf-life. In classical music, companies like Philips have been known to
sign up young tyros and then hold them in creative suspension for years
until they feel that their musical skills have reached a sustainable pitch.
They might then nurse them, and their loss-making recordings, for many more
years until concert performances have finally delivered a revered
reputation. Classic contracts inevitably tend to be for long periods, with
the knowledge that when the breakthrough comes, sales tick over for decades.
Most of the annual revenue on the classical side comes from recordings made
long ago.
In pop, companies jealously guard their artists and are reluctant to let
them record for rivals while top conductors and classical soloists take
periodic 'holidays' to make occasional albums with competitors. Classical
companies accept the tradition of lending artists to other labels.
In pop, record companies want their artists to keep churning out repeats of
their last hits. An established classical artist, however, can virtually
perform what he or she chooses and there is a greater reluctance to force
artists into the studio to complete a contract. If the inspiration has gone,
the label accepts the loss.
Record companies have regarded their classical subsidiaries as cultural
icons ensuring prestige rather than profits, which take years to accumulate,
and much depends on the good personal relationship between artists, agents
and record company personnel. Loyalties are generally enduring: Pavarotti
has been with Decca for thirty years.
Classical albums might sell annually in their hundreds, rather than the
hundreds of thousands of a pop hit, but they keep on selling. The Pounds
500,000 recording cost of a major opera might be amortised over 20 years.
Advances are generally low - Pounds 5,000 for a newly signed artist - but
there are no deductions. A new pop act might be dazzled by a Pounds 250,000
advance but by the time the cost of studio time, promotional video, and
marketing have been deducted there is often little left.
Unlike the pop industry, the classical world is selling repertoire rather
than a name. Stars are important - on their broad backs the record labels
hope to off-load to the shops the low priced, economically produced,
recordings from eastern Europe and elsewhere, which supply music rather than
masterpieces. But the serious enthusiast of classical music buys a sound
rather than an over-hyped reputation.
There have been whispers that the gentlemanly idiosyncracies of the
classical companies are under threat and the emergence of Sony, George
Michael's label, which acquired CBS, has caused some unease. Its Japanese
management has a passion for classical music and poured millions into
building up the American record company's rather lack-lustre classical
catalogue. There was also a spell of unfamiliar 'poaching' from other labels
and advances were inflated throughout the classical world. Some of Sony's
more costly commitments sadly back fired - both Von Karajan and Horowitz,
lured from DG, died before they could record for their new masters - but the
new Sony list is impressive: Maazel, Mehta, Abbado, Muti, Barenboim and
Giulini, and the Berlin Philharmonic. The company has yet to translate its
investment into an increased share of the market.
The sudden phenomenon of the classical hit also caused ripples. The money
men at head office received a jolt when Pavarotti and the Tenors, Nigel
Kennedy, Gorecki, Tavener and, this year, Spanish monks chanting the
Gregorian ritual, suddenly started to sell in pop-like proportions. But
excited board room speculation that classical music could be the much-needed
new musical craze were soon scuppered by sales figures. Even in recent years
classical music has never managed to rise above 9 per cent of total record
sales.
Most classical artists will still be more interested in developing a
satisfyingly long creative career than cashing in their skills. The very
limitations in the size of the business inhibit financial excess. Specialist
record labels, like Conifer, which attracts artists who share its interest
in exciting interpretations of the classics, know that they cannot afford to
embark on an auction.
Agents, too, want long careers for their artists: not a pop star's brief
hour in the spotlight. Joeske Van Walsam protects his artists from signing
recording contracts because he feels they have not yet achieved the required
maturity. Pop music sold its commercial soul to the devil decades ago; in
classical music there is still some integrity. That is one advantage in
being a minority taste.

and responsibilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE PRINCIPLE OF DUTY by David Selbourne Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 15, 288
pages
A chord is immediately struck by Selbourne's claim that the contemporary
social order is corrupted by its overemphasis on rights and demands, and by
his call for a new order based on civic bonds of duty. No doubt many will
immediately see the welfare scrounger as the paradigm of what Selbourne
attacks; but his views apply equally to those whose self-enrichment is made
possible by the protection of society, but who resent contributing, whether
through taxation or otherwise, to its common good.
Selbourne's diagnosis of society's present disease is telling, and although
his prescription for its remedy is not novel, it is timely and compelling.
In an earlier work, The Spirit of The Age, he described the collapse of
society into a 'phantom order' from which meaningful social relationships
have vanished. In this new work he argues for a revitalised civic order
based on principles of duty and obligation. Both the right and the old left
in politics are roundly criticised for their role in the collapse of
society, and Selbourne offers in their place what he calls 'social-ism',
written with a hyphen to show that it is not the old socialist theory which
'reduces mankind to the level of the barrack-room', but a reawakened civil
polity which opposes the greed and self-interest of individualism, the
primary cause, in Selbourne's view, of the wreck of our civil polity.
Society, Selbourne argues, is in a state of collapse and 'disaggregation'
because it has espoused an amoral politics of 'dutiless' rights and
freedoms. Emphasis on rights without duties, demand-satisfaction and
self-realisation through unfettered freedom, has created a moral vacuum.
When the dutiless individual calculates how to act, mere self interest is
his only criterion. In such circumstances no civic order can flourish.
Selbourne's solution is to reassert an argument which both the liberal
tradition and the common law have long recognised, but has been
progressively ignored: that people have duties to themselves, their fellows
and society, which are fully the moral equivalent of their rights. This
'principle of duty' is an expression of the constraints that membership of
society places upon individuals. It identifies their obligations and ways of
ensuring that they are observed.
Our duties include, says Selbourne, pursuing a livelihood and making
ourselves informed; caring for the members of our families; respecting and
helping others; and 'bestowing pains upon the preservation of the civic
order'. There is also a duty to conserve natural resources and society's
historic patrimony, and to fulfil obligations of public duty such as
undertaking military service when necessary, sitting on juries, and
contributing to public funds by taxation. Selbourne proposes a variety of
sanctions for those who fail in these duties, based on loss of rights and
privileges in various ways including those already familiar.
Some, especially on the left in politics - Selbourne's own natural terrain -
will find some of these ideas reactionary. They have certainly been
unfashionable for long enough to make their revival a novelty. Politicians
on the right occasionally table-thump about duties and respect for society
when addressing Party Conferences on law and order issues, but never when
talking about taxation, long-term investment, or public spending on
education and health. Mrs Thatcher famously denied the very existence of
society, suggesting thereby that it is the individualism of the right which
is most dismissive and destructive of social ties.
But Selbourne is correct: only where there is a strong sense of a civic bond
between people, with all having a lively mutual sense of values, can there
be a flourishing and progressive social order. A model is provided by
memories of wartime, or at least the more nostalgic versions of its
camaraderie, its sense of community and cooperation. However dewy-eyed the
ideal might be, one cannot call it unworthy.
There are of course problems with Selbourne's picture. His views are right;
the difficulty is how to implement them. Society is so uneasily plural and
fragmented, its members so divisively sold on the supreme value of getting
and having; how can one be sanguine? Selbourne's vision is one at which a
pre-industrial city-state might aim, if its leaders and teachers were honest
and its economy such that competition among its members rarely involved
conflict and anxiety - the twin spectres of the market place, where only
some can be winners. But can vastly populous, fissiparous, strident modern
societies, brought up - at least during this last decade and a half - on a
particularly naked version of the politics of self-interest, hope to change?
Hostile critics will claim that Selbourne is being self-importantly oracular
in this book, offering it as a gospel for an anxiously waiting world. But
charges of pretension will be misplaced; he has tried to think his way not
just into the theory of a better social order, but of its practicalities.
There is much in what he says that demands and deserves very careful
thought.

THE ELECTRONIC ELEPHANT by Dan Jacobson Hamish Hamilton Pounds 17.99, 373
pages
HAPPY SAD LAND by Mark McCrum Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 16.99, 455 pages
INNOCENTS IN AFRICA by Drury Pifer Granta Books Pounds 15.99, 338 pages
Dan Jacobson has taken time off from his crafted and distinguished novels to
go home - home to Kimberley, the diamond town, and thence to travel up the
'Missionary Road', that ancient African route which slips between the
Kalahari and the Boers and finishes at the Zambesi and the Victoria Falls.
It is not one of the region's finer scenic routes, featuring as it does
countless miles of thorn, sand and scrub, so Jacobson has to explain that he
was attracted to the journey in part by its historical interest, in part by
its personal reference - 'that half-known, half-feared region which had lain
forbiddingly on the very doorstep of the Africa I had grown up in'. We are
to be taken back, then, to the scene of his early - brilliant - novels,
before he graduated to a London professorial chair and ambitious novels on
Old Testament themes. The best thing in The Electronic Elephant is his
description of the Northern Cape veld, which sends us back after all these
years to A Dance in the Sun and its images of a furious Afrikaner isolation.
The route to the north was indeed important to the 19th-century
missionaries, who were in the vanguard of colonial conquest. 'The
Livingstone Liquor Stall' in Campbell, near Griquatown, is a reminder of the
presiding genius of the tale. It is a road, argues Jacobson, littered with
the wreckage of successive ideologies: European imperialism, Boer
nationalism, Victorian racialism, apartheid, African liberation, Marxism -
and Christianity, which alone has survived, and prospered, in its peculiar
African styles. In a lovely scene in the Kuruman mission church the
secular-Jewish Jacobson and his atheist wife are the only congregation at
the Easter service: 'Making sense of my presence there was impossible;
impossible also not to feel the strangest mixture of wonder, embarrassment,
mirth, fraudulence, compassion for our hosts, even a kind of protectiveness
towards them'.
This is, as you would expect, a journey informed by the novelist's eye. He
encounters Bushman soldiers brought back for their safety from Angola by the
South African Defence Forces whose forebears had massacred them to
near-extinction (it is, as he says, 'surreal'); he meets a group of
far-Right Afrikaners who are preparing for their own ethnic, on-screen
state; he returns, always, to the history of these obscure territories; he
notes that it was platinum as well as tourism which transformed the economy
of President Mangope's Bophuthatswana; he has the expatriate white South
African's gentle scepticism of the future ('A 'non-racial' South Africa? One
might as well talk of breeding a kosher pig . . .')
When he moves out of the Republic he is less confident: he does not respond
to Botswana and is ill at ease in Zimbabwe. The single map is inadequate,
the absence of an index is regrettable, and he can't spell Mmabatho.
Mark McCrum has published the story of another journey around Southern
Africa. The scheme is simple: McCrum spent time in Botswana as a teenager in
1977 and liked it; 15 years later he went back. Cue to a pleasantly readable
account of his travels and his undramatic adventures. McCrum has a good ear
for dialogue and does not take himself too seriously. Happy Sad Land makes
an interesting, relaxed, unessential read for anyone interested in that part
of the world. He can't spell Van Zyl Slabbert.
The best of the bunch, the surprise, the curiosity from out of the blue, the
classic-in-waiting, is Drury Pifer's Innocents in Africa. Pifer is an
American, a playwright who was brought up in Southern Africa in the 1930s as
son of a mining engineer who was employed on the Rand, in Kimberley, in
South-west Africa, and then in Kimberley again.
Pifer has produced an entrancing memoir of childhood in pre-apartheid days.
This book, written with superb precision and elegance, its recall of detail
based on access to his beloved mother's letters home, is utterly fascinating
about the South Africa of those pre-war years, yet it is more than this, it
evokes and recreates the intimacy of the life of a happy family of
half-a-century ago. The fact that they were Americans gives a unique view of
the English-Afrikaner tensions of those formative years, but the deeper
subject is its poetic recapture of the experiences of childhood which most
of us never recall in more than fragments.
The Pifers went back to America at the end of the war: 'It didn't occur to
us that this journey out of Africa was the last time we would find ourselves
together and happy, day after day, perfectly matched in our non-stop prattle
and familiar love . . .' The boy never went back.
Innocents in Africa deserves a much longer review: let this be a shorthand
recommendation of a wonderful book. He can't spell Japie.

JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN: ENTREPRENEUR IN POLITICS by Peter T. Marsh Yale
University Press, 725 pages
The life of Joseph Chamberlain was so full and varied that his official
biographer, JL Garvin, needed 15 years to complete the first three volumes,
then gave up. Julian Amery picked up the baton and took another 20 years to
complete the story. Amery's work was published in 1969. There have been
other, shorter books, but the long, detached study comes only now from the
North American historian, Peter T. Marsh.
One can see the difficulties. Chamberlain conforms to no recognisable
pattern in British politics. He grew up in London, but made his name in
Birmingham. He left school at 16, but was already pretty well educated. His
father put him into business. In Birmingham he became known as the screw
king, because it was screws that his companies manufactured. He was arguably
the most successful mayor in the history of British local government. Under
his stewardship in the mid-1870s, no corner or institution in Birmingham was
left untouched by his reforms.
Then he went into national politics. For a time he flirted with Newcastle,
and had a fling at Sheffield where he failed. So he fell back on Birmingham
which provided his political base for the rest of his life.
The political society of the time did not understand such an outsider.
London's reaction to Chamberlain was distinctly snobbish. There was a
terrible row about his putting up his relatives for the Reform Club. Years
later, when he was Colonial Secretary and in the absence of the prime
minister had to entertain the Kaiser at Windsor with the Queen, a foreign
office mandarin noted: 'We can only hope that Birmingham has not given
himself away.' In short, he was thought to be unsophisticated.
His political career, though it had some peaks, was turbulent throughout.
Some of the troughs, and the reason why he did not make it to Downing
Street, were undoubtedly of his own making. Chamberlain was initially a
radical Liberal, much more so than Gladstone. But, as Marsh demonstrates, it
was more his personal rivalry with Gladstone rather than a difference of
political beliefs that led to the two men falling out. Chamberlain could
have sought a compromise on Irish policy; instead he became a Unionist,
Gladstone stuck to Home Rule and the party split. The other result was that
Gladstone stayed as leader.
Chamberlain was to change his mind again, and damage other parties, on other
subjects. He became the great imperialist and advocate of tariff reform,
having once been in favour of free trade. He may thus go down as a wrecker
rather than as a politician of achievement. Yet there is something in the
phrase that he exercised influence without much power. Most of the social
reforms of the late 19th century had something to do with him: education,
pensions, compensation for industrial accidents. He was politically astute
in realising that the Conservatives could be a reforming party because they
drew support from both ends of the social spectrum.
There were more tangible monuments. Chamberlain founded the University of
Birmingham. As Colonial Secretary he was a great promoter of tropical
medicine. He was partly responsible for the founding of the state of
Nigeria.
True, there are murkier sides. Even now it is still not clear how far he
gave implicit encouragement to the Jameson raid in South Africa; certainly
he gave a very indiscreet briefing to the African correspondent of The
Times, who had a direct line to Cecil Rhodes.
On the whole, however, Chamberlain was his own man. Winston Churchill wrote
of him in Great Contemporaries in 1937: in British affairs 'Joe was the one
who made the weather'. Marsh adds perceptively: 'But no man could change the
climate'. The rest of the country was not like Birmingham.
Chamberlain's entrepreneurial career peaked in the mid-1870s, just as the US
and Germany were beginning to overtake Britain's industrial capacity.
In politics he thought that the development of the empire could be used to
raise the standard of living of the British working class. In the most
devastating comment of all, Marsh concludes that the industrialist turned
statesman thus overlooked the technological advances being made elsewhere.
He turned his back on innovation.
The truth is that Chamberlain had the good German virtues. He admired
Bismarck for his social policies and belief in education, but became an
imperialist partly because he did not want British possessions overseas to
pass to the Germans. Chamberlain remained essentially a loner: the nicest
story about him is that musically he was so tone deaf that, even as the arch
man of empire, he could not recognise the national anthem.

THE ENGLISHMAN'S SUIT by Hardy Amies Quartet Pounds 12, 120 pages
This genteel history of the suit, modelled on the limp volumes of belles
lettres and collected aphorisms that in the 1920s littered the lavatories
and lesser bedrooms of the country house, ends on a 'Naughty-naughty,
tut-tut' note - 'it is,' avers the writer, 'rude to be ill-dressed. It is
particularly rude to dress squalidly at the opera . . .' A
three-button-coated dark suit from Marks and Spencer is strongly
recommended.
As one who weeps at almost every opera, I should look and feel twice as
foolish in a suit as I do in the crumpled sweater that engages Master Amies'
despite. A suit demands a stiff upper lip and a straight back, but Mimi
demands that I be reduced to a sobbing heap slumped in my stall, and for
that a suit is far from suitable.
The Master traces the history of coat, trousers and vest from the Versailles
of the Sun King to Savile Row; he touches it with great events and famous
men as taste swings this way and that across the Channel, with fops and
clowns and macaroni, with Brummell and the Comte d'Orsay, and with assorted
asses playing Prince of Wales. In 1934, within these pages, the history of
the suit becomes the history of Hardy Amies, and Burton, Hepworth, Tommy
Nutter and the flashy Mr Fish swim into view.
The thread breaks from time to time, giving way to disconnected jottings and
asides on class, tradition, the National Trust, Country Life, daffodils and
daisies - 'Latin should be taught intelligently and interestingly in every
school;' the high-toned English too breaks down, gentlemen become gents,
their suits gear, and we 'get back to basics' with strictures on the shirt
and tie and coy diversions into underpants.
The repeated justification for this book and the life and work of the Master
is the snobbish refrain that the suit is the dress of the gentleman - but it
is also, the doubter must observe, the dress of the politician who wishes to
be mistaken for a gentleman, too easily camouflaged by expert tailors,
manicurists and the hairdresser (Mrs Thatcher's cabinets were full of them),
and for the businessman it is a uniform.
Politics, business and the London club secure the future of the suit well
into the next millennium, prophesies the Master; as one for whom it seems
the most grotesque and impractical of garments, quite hopeless for walking
dogs, listening to opera, eating in cool comfort, driving a car, painting
pictures or enduring travel in an aeroplane, I wish that he would turn his
attention to other forms of formal dress and I commend the cassock that I
wore as altar boy, a thing of tailored dove grey silk, a thousand buttons
from throat to ankle, a touch of lawn about the neck - no puzzle-bugger
jacketed suit could ever match its easy elegance.

MOTHER'S BOYS by Margaret Forster Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 313 pages
THE BINGO PALACE by Louise Erdrich Flamingo Pounds 14.99, 274 pages
Margaret Forster's novels catalogue the anxieties of family life: conflicts
between generations, the impact of Alzheimer's disease, the rights and
wrongs of mixed-race adoption. Her new novel marks a shift in emphasis,
moving from the internal politics of individual families to the impact on
them of outside events over which they have no control.
Joe, an introverted 15-year-old living in a quiet northern town, is the
victim of a vicious and unprovoked attack by two youths. Forster holds back
the nastiest detail of the assault for around a hundred pages, placing the
reader in the same position as the confused relatives who observe Joe's
traumatised state without fully understanding it.
As Joe's parents, Harriet and Sam, struggle to help him recover, another
family in a nearby town is facing a different ordeal. Sheila is the
grandmother, in effect the mother, of one of the teenagers convicted of the
attack; she brought him up after her own daughter died. Thus Forster sets
the scene for a novel about mother love, and about the fierce protectiveness
both women feel towards the boys they have brought up - a protectiveness
which, far from helping them to understand what has happened, actually gets
in the way of it.
For the heart of this novel, unusually for Forster, is not illumination but
its opposite. It has a fly-on-the-wall quality, exposing the women's inner
lives and even bringing them together in an ineffectual attempt at mutual
understanding. Yet all Forster seems to be offering is a statement about the
limits of unconditional love. Clearly Mother's Boys does not set out to
offer resolution, or even plot development, but even as gifted a writer as
Margaret Forster is not able to overcome the longueurs inherent in a novel
whose keynote is bewilderment.
There is no lack of plot in The Bingo Palace, the fourth in Louise Erdrich'
s quartet of novels about the Chippewa Indians of North Dakota. The book is
essentially a love story in which a young drifter, Lipsha Morrissey,
competes with Lyman Lamartine, his boss and half-brother (or possibly his
half-uncle), for the love of Shawnee Ray, a gifted seamstress who is also
the mother of Lyman's illegitimate son.
The novel is set on an Indian Reservation whose inhabitants simultaneously
live in the mundane present (Lyman is the owner of the Reservation's chief
attraction, a bingo hall) and a mythic past. Erdrich has written about this
past in the earlier novels, demonstrating the way in which the Indians'
continual creation of myth - making themselves larger than life, endowing
themselves with supernatural powers - was a means of compensating for the
bitter reality of the white settlers' decimation of the tribe.
The problem with The Bingo Palace is that it displays no ironic detachment.
What seemed in the earlier books a celebration of tradition now feels like
whimsical folkiness; we are continually presented with characters who refuse
to die or who possess magical powers. Erdrich's writing strains after
effect, imposing mystical interpretations on everyday events like birth and
death: 'The red rope between the mother and her baby is the hope of our
nation. It pulls, it sings, it snags, it feeds and holds. How it holds.'
This is all the more disappointing because Erdrich is a talented writer.
Perhaps she has come up against a present which she is at a loss to
interpret, and has fallen back on a narrative style whose limitations are
now obvious. It will be interesting to see what she does now, and whether
she can escape from her self-created cul-de-sac of Reservation chic.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Property: Manchester gets a breathing space - Cadogan's
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Back to basins is a surprise theme for urban renewal in Manchester. The
basins belong to the city's many canals and were used by traders and
commodity dealers in the 19th and early 20th centuries to unload their
goods, cotton chief among them. The bales were taken to red brick warehouses
as grand as palaces.
By 1988, however, when the Central Manchester Development Corporation took
control of 470 acres, 40 per cent of the land was derelict while the canals
were in disrepair or full of contaminated waste. The population was down to
250.
Over the years, the basins had been filled in and built over. Luckily, many
of the great warehouses survived. What could be done with them to
re-energise the city's heart? The answer was to use the canals - there are
eight miles of them in the CMDC's patch - and dig out the basins as open
spaces to encourage pleasure craft while converting the warehouses to flats
and mixing in new buildings on the quaysides around the basins.
The aim was to clean up the area and provide sophisticated living in
historic surroundings in order to lure people back and let central
Manchester breathe again.
It is working. There are now about 2,000 residents and there will be 1,040
more from September when a student village opens at the old Dunlop Buildings
where Charles Macintosh invented his raincoat around 1823.
Such developers as Housing Projects, Bellway, Macbryde, the Manchester Ship
Canal Company itself, Piccadilly Village and Wimpey are thrilled at how
their schemes have sold, often right off the plan.
Macbryde is building on Slate Wharf, beside the Bridgewater Canal, and
Bellway at Woollam Place in Liverpool Road, opposite the world's first
passenger railway station. Flats in these developments start at around
Pounds 50,000.
The smartest conversion - and selling fast, although only a few days on the
market - is a warehouse beside the Rochdale Canal at 42-44 Sackville St.
The Manhattan Loft Corporation, fresh from successes in London at Summers
Street in Clerkenwell and Wardour Street in Soho, is turning a superb
building - rich in beams, cast iron and high ceilings - into 35 shell flats
which buyers will finish themselves. Prices from Pounds 54,000.
Meanwhile, if you are a developer looking for a warehouse to convert, the
CMDC (061-236 1166) will be happy to suggest some.
The May figures of the Corporate Estate Agents property index, based on data
from 4,100 offices (with about half the country's estate agency business),
show a sliding market. Agreed sales fell 3.6 per cent and completed sales
4.9 per cent compared with April - which itself was 10.4 and 11.2 per cent
down on March, the best month in a long time.
New listings, an important sign of confidence, also fell: 6.5 per cent fewer
in May than in April, which was 11.3 per cent down on March.
Despite the overall slide, London is a different story. Winkworth, with 33
offices in the capital, reports that sales agreed rose 40 per cent from
January to March, fell 21 per cent in April, and recovered 9 per cent in
May.
Noting 20 per cent price rises in central London since October 1993, 10 per
cent in Battersea, Fulham, Hammersmith and Islington, and 'significant'
increases further out, Winkworth expects prices to peak in the next month
and then perhaps to fall back slightly in the second half of the year when,
normally, fewer people try to buy.
Two modernist 1930s' houses are on the market. FRS Yorke (of Yorke Rosenberg
and Mardall, now the YRM Partnership) designed Torilla in Hatfield,
Hertfordshire, when he was 27. Listed grade II*, it needs work to restore it
as a gem of the enlightenment between the wars. Rumball Sedgwick (0727-852
384) asks around Pounds 220,000.
In St John's Wood, north London David Stokes built 5 Cochrane Street NW8 in
1937 and has been there ever since. Now, though, it is time to sell. Brian
Lack (071-586 5929) asks Pounds 495,000.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Property: It's the mixture as before - Lime was used to make
mortar 3,000 years ago. Now, it is causing a minor revolution in the
building trade / Conservation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a minor revolution going on in the building trade. At the heart of
it is a four-letter word, the roots of which go back even further than those
four-letter Anglo-Saxon words much favoured by British workmen.
The word is lime. For approaching 20 years it has been much favoured in
building conservation circles, but the problem has been one of converting
the ordinary builder back to lime, according to masonry consultant Bob
Bennett.
Bennett runs the Lime Centre, a small enterprise dedicated to training
people in the use of this most ancient of building materials.
'Man has been using lime for 3,000 years,' he says. 'Cement is a mere
passing phase. Unfortunately, since the second world war when cement became
widely known through its use in concrete defences not only builders but also
private individuals have turned to it for repairs to traditional buildings.
'Usually, this is all wrong. Almost all these buildings were built with lime
mortar, which is far less harsh than cement, more forgiving and, above all,
allows buildings to breathe.'
Lime is on the way back, though. It began in the mid-1970s with the start of
a 12-year programme of conservation on the west front of Wells Cathedral in
Somerset, and now there is a handful of experts who, like Bennett, run
regular courses on using this material. At the Lime Centre, Bennett's
fortnightly courses attract private individuals as well as builders,
architects, conservation officers and other interested professionals.
In the Chilterns, building conservator Ian Pritchett runs similar courses.
Like Bennett, he slakes lime and supplies it to specialist restorers.
'We seem to be gaining more enlightened clients on our courses all the time
 -especially surveyors - but we could still do with more builders,' he says.
Near Stroud, in Gloucestershire, Woodchester Mansion Trust is using the
unfinished Victorian mansion there as a focus for the revival of traditional
building skills. The trust runs occasional courses on the use of lime
mortars in stone buildings.
And, at Gosport in Hampshire, the English Heritage Conservation training
centre at Fort Brockworth also runs courses based on the use of lime.
The key to the 'back to lime' philosophy is the fact that old buildings
breathe. In the past, it was accepted that this happened because of the
vapour-permeable nature of lime mortar, which means that moisture absorbed
by the fabric emerged through the joints. Insert a modern pointing of
Portland cement in an old wall and damp is likely to stay in the wall, say
the proponents of lime.
'If a wall can't breathe the result is often damage to brick and stonework -
or even to the whole wall,' says Bennett. 'The answer, particularly in older
buildings, is to replace like with like - which usually means lime.
'People forget that until the coming of Portland cement in 1824 lime was in
common use in the construction of virtually all buildings.
'The ancient Egyptians used it, the Greeks appreciated its qualities and, in
this country, the Romans used it very widely, and many buildings right up
until the outbreak of war in 1939 were built with lime mortar.'
In the widespread move back to lime mortars, many builders still resist the
trend, according to architect Rodney Black of East Bergholt, Suffolk, who
has been specifying lime mortar for work on traditional buildings.
'Many builders avoid lime mortars if possible because they are slower to lay
than cement mortars,' he says.
In some parts of the country, however, their use has barely died out. In
Devon, where many of the older buildings are made of cob - a mixture of clay
and straw - large quantities of lime were always used. Builder Kevin McCabe,
of Colyton, near Honiton, is one of a handful of builders who has always
used lime on old buildings.
For several years, he has done his own slaking. 'It is a cheap, relatively
quick process and you know exactly what you are going to get,' he says. In
spite of the lime revival, however, it is still unusual nowadays for
builders to slake their own lime.
'Lime has such a good track record. It should not be taken as read that all
new building developments are necessarily better than the original,' says
McCabe.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Travel: In Megalopolis only the veneer is modern -
Cosmopolitan Buenos Aires is a city best at remembering the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I did not think I would like Buenos Aires. Everyone I met along the way told
me I would not.
'What's the point? It's a big, modern, noisy city,' said a New Yorker I
bumped into on a trail in the Andes.
'You want somewhere exotic, sensual, a city with palm trees - try Rio,'
suggested a Norwegian from his hammock in the Amazon basin.
'It is not really South America at all,' said a Parisian I met buying an
alpaca poncho in an Indian village. 'You might as well be at home.'
They were right, of course. Buenos Aires is cosmopolitan, a western-style
city with little of the allure, the climate, the strange people and odd
sights that usually attract travellers to South America. Why, indeed, go to
such a distant place only to feel so close to home?
But my fellow travellers were wrong, too. Buenos Aires' first-world
sophistication on a rough-hewn, third-world continent is remarkable in
itself, and I ended up liking the city very much.
Wild and woolly South America ends, and civilised Buenos Aires begins, at
Tigre, a small Argentine town at the confluence of the Uruguay and Parana
Rivers. North and east it is no distance by boat to Uruguay and a great
spongy river delta where channels of water twist and braid and meander off
into the distance of a vast continent.
But Tigre is also a city suburb, the last station on Buenos Aires' northern
commuter railway line. Just 30km to the south lies the heart of a great
metropolis of more than 12m people.
Something struck a chord as I sat in the Tigre train heading to Buenos
Aires' Retiro station. After weeks of Latin American exotica, the suburbs of
the city, seen through a train window, were all so familiar and banal that I
felt a sense of deja vu. I was on every commuter train I had ever taken in
every city I had ever lived.
I recognised those men in suits, briefcases in one hand, folded newspapers
in the other, standing on the platform at San Isidro station. I recognised
the dusty plasterers waiting at working-class Victoria; the rock-music
graffiti scrawled on the walls at Nunez; the Italian restaurants at
Belgrano; the neglected houses of the poor at Virreyes; the private school
children in caps and ties at Olivos; the shopping centre at Rivadavia; the
family estate car parked outside the phony Tudor half-beam house at Vincente
Lopez.
They were part of my own urban life. All big city dwellers from the west, I
knew before I arrived, would find something of themselves in Buenos Aires.
Downtown Buenos Aires roars, a commotion of people in a hurry. There is a
good dose of brash energy in the air.
The city is laid on a grid pattern of rectangular blocks. You can look for
miles down canyons of buildings. Fleets of yellow-and-black taxis cruise the
avenues, their drivers as happy to run you down as blink.
Hot-dog carts dominate busy street corners. In the chic Recoleta district,
professional dog-walkers trail behind gaggles of canines while their owners
 -thin women of impeccable taste - move between boutique, private gallery
and exclusive pastry shop.
All interesting enough, considering the continent that surrounds it. But
there are hundreds of such middle-class cities about. And, quite frankly,
there does not seem to be much left of the once-touted romance of Argentina.
It has been swallowed in the noise and traffic of a megalopolis. The days of
the gaucho are long gone, as are the huge fortunes that were made on the
pampa through wheat and cattle. The playboy Argentine millionaire with his
vast estancia and polo ponies seems to have disappeared, as have the strains
of the tango that used to float through dance-halls and the crowded quarters
of the city.
A brutal military dictatorship, a futile war with Britain and a
pre-occupation with continuing economic crisis seem to have effaced much of
the distinctive character of the city. But Buenos Aires has plenty of
character, and remains a city like no other. It is a deceptive place. It
appears, at first glance, modern, new-world, hard-edged. But that is only a
veneer. Unlike US cities, which look to the future, Buenos Aires is much
better at remembering its past.
This is essentially a southern European city, often old-fashioned and
traditional in outlook. Its inhabitants may move to northern big-city
rhythms, but like their Mediterranean forebears they are gregarious,
emotional, leisure-loving and sentimental.
Buenos Aires spends much of its time recalling its greatest days and, still
further back, its European origins. It is not difficult for the visitor,
too, to peel back the layers of the years.
PorteMos - the city's inhabitants - tell you proudly that in the early part
of this century Agentina was one of the leading economies of the world, well
ahead of such backwaters as Canada or Australia. Money was no object;
anything was possible. There is proof of this even in the commercial
downtown district, where, above modern ground-floor facades, are bizarre and
ornate follies imitative of long-gone European architectural fads.
Nor is Buenos Aires' monumental architecture any more firmly rooted in the
new world. Today the grounds around the Palacio del Congresso - Argentina's
national congress - are shabby and neglected. Years of economic decline and
vast public debt have taken their toll.
But it does not take much imagination to see it as it was - bronze and
marble statues reminiscent of Rome's, gardens as noble as those of Paris,
public architecture as imposing as Madrid's. Still in magnificent condition
today is the nine-story Teatro Colon, imported from Europe block by marble
block, tile by gilt tile, and regarded as one of the finest opera houses
anywhere.
My favourite old-world haunt, though, was the tree-lined Avenida de Mayo,
designed by Spanish architects in the 19th century. Stroll here with
elegantly-dressed crowds on a balmy January summer evening, take coffee in
Tortoni's wood-panelled and red-leather-upholstered cafe, and you could not
tell that you were not on a boulevard in some elegant southern European
city.
If PorteMos placed so much importance on things European, it is because they
never wholly cut their ties, and remained eternal immigrants on an
essentially foreign continent. Between 1860 and 1930 6m Europeans began new
lives in Argentina, many settling in Buenos Aires.
White, largely urban and imbued with middle-class values, Argentines feel
little affinity for the rest of South America, much of it poor, rural and of
mixed, mestizo blood. Nor do Bolivians, Brazilians and other South Americans
have great affection for Argentines.
For many who immigrated - half of them Italian, a third Spanish, others
German, French, Portuguese and middle-European Jews - a new life in Buenos
Aires was moulded by poverty. It was out of the alienation of displaced
working people that much of Buenos Aires culture, including the tango, grew.
I did not spend too much time after dark in La Boca, the working-class area
down by the old port where Buenos Aires life began for many of the early
Italian immigrants. The brothels have gone, knife fights in the bars are
less common, and most of the squalid tenement buildings have been pulled
down. In the day-time it is a good place to walk to get an idea of the
city's beginnings, but at night it is a little rough.
But I did spend more time in San Telmo, another working-class district close
by. It is becoming slowly gentrified, its warehouses being turned into
artists' studios, its once-crowded dwellings converted to antique shops
jammed with family treasures - clocks and porcelain, cast bronze and marble,
mirrors and wind-up gramophones - imported by later and wealthier
generations of PorteMos. But there is still a genuine neighbourhood
atmosphere that, for me, brought out the best of the great urban conclave
that is Buenos Aires.
I toured the markets with local housewives, watched old men in their
undershirts playing dominoes under the trees of the Plaza Dorrego, and
kicked a ball in the street with a young crew of future Maradonas. In Des
Nivel, a simple little restaurant with plastic table-cloths, 10-gallon wine
jugs and a vast charcoal grill, I ate thick Argentine steak, the tenderest
in the world.
Best of all, I found a small place called A Media Luz - In the Half Light.
There are not many places left these days where you can watch and listen to
tango, the sensual dance, the sad songs that for generations of immigrants
were the expression of absence and loss.
But the elderly PorteMos gathered in A Media Luz not only knew the music,
they remembered the words and sang them with tears in their eyes. For all
its modern bustle, Buenos Aires is an evocation of the past.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport: Delay the funeral, tennis is alive and well -
Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first week of Wimbledon's 108th tournament has produced so much
excitement and good tennis that rumours of the sport's imminent demise seem
decidedly premature. A heady mixture of nostalgia, emotion and raw-blooded
athletic endeavour has given us entertainment of a high order.
Rod Laver, the 53-year-old Australian who was a four-time singles champion
at Wimbledon, provided the nostalgia on the opening day.
The red-haired left-hander, looking slim and fit, received a tremendous
ovation when the Duke of Kent, president of the All England Club, presented
him with a piece of Waterford crystal to commemorate the silver jubilee of
his unique second grand slam in 1969.
Following the ceremony, it was appropriate that the world No 1, Pete
Sampras, who had idolised Laver when growing up in California, should have
opened the Centre Court programme. A convincing win against Jared Palmer,
his neighbour in Tampa, Florida, suggested that anyone with pretentions to
Sampras's title will have to produce something very special.
The emotion belonged to 37-year-old Martina Navratilova. Her arrival on the
Centre Court was greeted with rapturous enthusiasm by the assembled crowd,
who gave the nine-times champion a lengthy standing ovation that brought a
lump to the throat.
In my 48 years of visiting Wimbledon, I have never seen anything like it.
Fortunately, Martina was not too much affected by the occasion and saw off
the challenge of the British girl Claire Taylor without fuss.
The opening day had offered no clue about the drama that lay ahead. True,
Cedric Pioline, the No 13 seed from France, went out, but that was not
unexpected on grass.
Suddenly, on Tuesday, the drama began. On the Centre Court, Steffi Graf,
Germany's five-time champion, the overwhelming favourite to retain her
title, crashed out 7-5 7-6 to the 30-year-old black American, Lori McNeil.
As if in sympathy with her legion of tearful fans, the gods wept. This was
the biggest upset in the history of Wimbledon. Never before has a defending
champion lost her title in the first round.
The doom-laden skies created a Wagnerian atmosphere. McNeil played glorious
attacking tennis at the net to reveal the shortcomings in the champion's
game.
In strong, gusty wind, Graf's high ball-toss on serve was a liability. On
the still sappy grass, the sliced backhand approaches of McNeil, skidding
through fast and low towards her opponent's vulnerable backhand wing, were
superbly effective. Even Graf's forehand only worked intermittently.
It was obvious that the champion's confidence, dented by a recent loss to
Sanchez-Vicario in Hamburg when she had held match points, and another to
Mary Pierce in Paris, was still damaged.
Before they started McNeil, who had beaten Graf once before - two years ago,
in the first round of the Virginia Slims - said she fancied her chance in a
first meeting on grass. How well she took it.
McNeil is the product of John Wilkerson's public parks programme in Houston
which also discovered Lori's one-time doubles partner, Zina Garrison. By
coincidence, it was Garrison who inflicted humiliation on Graf when she beat
the German en route to the final at Wimbledon in 1990.
Graf's unexpected departure left a gaping hole in the draw. The other seeds
in the top half responded well. Conchita Martinez (3) and Argentina's fallen
angel, Gabriela Sabatini (10), started playing with renewed enthusiasm.
Sabatini did well yesterday to beat the Eastbourne winner, Meredith McGrath,
in straight sets.
Life was not so easy for McNeil. Reacting from her sensational win, she
struggled to beat Yone Kamio of Japan, but at least she survived and
yesterday she won against Kristie Boogert of Holland more impressively in
straight sets.
Meanwhile, there was turmoil among the men's seeds. In the course of five
days eight disappeared, including two former champions, Michael Stich (2)
and Stefan Edberg (3).
This year Stich lost in the first round in Australia to Malavai Washington
and in the second round in Paris to Aron Krickstein. The brittle German had
his cup of grand-slam misery filled to overflowing when he was beaten in a
delayed first-round match by Bryan Shelton, another black American. At this
rate, Stich will soon lose his No 2 ranking.
The present world No 3, Stefan Edberg, is unlikely to be the man to overtake
him. Looking vulnerable on serve from the start, the 28-year-old Swede was
beaten in five rousing sets by Kenneth Carlsen after leading by two sets to
one. It was sad that yesterday sickness forced him to retire when trailing
6-4 6-4 1-0 to Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden.
Thursday produced two magnificent encounters. In the first, the French Open
champion, Sergi Bruguera of Spain, beat Australia's big hope, Patrick
Rafter, in a five-set marathon on Court No 1.
Bruguera prefers clay courts and has not played here for three years, but he
adapted to the demands of grass with the skill of a natural competitor.
Some of his acutely-angled touch volleys were a joy and his ground strokes,
fizzing with topspin, made life at the net uncomfortable for the game
Australian. Yesterday he won again at the expence of Jean-Philippe Fleurian
of France in four sets.
How nice it was to see another Frenchman, artistic left-hander Guy Forget,
fit again after a year away following operations on a knee.
His five-set win against last year's finalist, Jim Courier, was a joyous and
skilful occasion, not least because the two combatants, old friends and
rivals, displayed a chivalry that is rare these days. Here were two men
giving everything but still able to take joy from their opponent's winners.
It left you feeling uplifted.
How stirring, too, that last year's fine performances from the British men
were repeated, this time by Jeremy Bates and Chris Wilkinson. At 31, Bates
is performing as well as ever. Perhaps the responsibilities of fatherhood
were what he needed to give him stability and maturity. Today he plays
Markus Zoecke of Germany.
Wilkinson, who reached the third round last year, was not disgraced in
losing to Wayne Ferreira at the same stage yesterday. He was relieved to be
playing at all after enduring one of those frustrating injury spells that so
often end the careers of promising athletes.
It has been a good week for Wimbledon and for tennis. Postpone the funeral.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Motoring: The car substitute with a wiggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will the new wave of multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs), such as the Peugeot 806
I wrote about last week, put a stop to the growth of on/off-road 4x4 sales?
I suspect so. But Land Rover most definitely hopes not: all its eggs are in
one massive, permanently four-wheel-driven basket. It follows that any move
in life-style aspirations away from waxed cotton jackets, green wellies,
jodhpurs and knobbly tyres would be bad news.
Ask typical urban or suburban owners why they chose this sort of vehicle
instead of a normal car and most will praise the high seating position and
interior space, even though this can be more apparent than real.
The one thing they never mention is cross-country capability - because they
have no intention of leaving the tarmac and would not know what to do if
they did. Thus, the benefits of the complicated transmission and high-slung
suspension designed for off-road work are never exploited.
A much more logical and effective form of transport would be one of the
growing band of MPVs, which combine lots of interior space with a high
driving position. But when did logic guide car purchase? So, without taking
back a word of the above, I have to say that the Jeep Grand Cherokee I drove
for a week recently was vastly enjoyable to use as a car substitute, even if
the back end sometimes wiggled like Marilyn Monroe's.
The 5.2-litre, 212 horsepower, V8-engined Grand Cherokee, with four-speed
automatic transmission and permanently engaged four-wheel drive, is as
American as mom's apple pie. Never mind the little wiggle; it is wonderfully
comfortable because it rides shock-absorbently with finger-light steering
and has enough power and traction to master any driving situation.
It will out-accelerate most executive cars and cruise as quietly as they do
at business drivers' speeds on the motorway. It corners capably, with no
more body roll than most of its kind. While a big car, it does not feel
intimidatingly bulky in narrow country lanes and is easy enough to park.
The soft but supportive seats are leather-trimmed and the interior is not in
the least American flash. With its sober colours and polished wood veneer, I
thought the Grand Cherokee as understated as a quality European car.
It is full of electronic novelties. Display panels tell the driver the day,
date, time and outside temperature, when the next service is due, and even
the direction in which they are driving. Super-efficient air-conditioning,
cruise control, anti-lock brakes and a good six-speaker stereo are part of
the package.
You cannot expect any hefty on/off-roader with an engine the size and power
of this one to be frugal with fuel but the Grand Cherokee is by no means a
heavy drinker. The transmission is so eager to get into the high top gear
that a driver content to cruise at the US legal maximum of 55 or 65mph (88
or 105kmh) should see well over 20mpg (14.1 litres per 100kms) on a journey.
An enormous spare wheel and tyre takes up about 20 per cent of the load
floor but there is still a lot of room for luggage. And roof rack
side-rails, which are built in, have instantly-adjustable crossbars for
carrying things such as windsurf boards.
At Pounds 27,995, the Grand Cherokee is about Pounds 7,000 cheaper than a
comparable Range Rover Vogue or Mitsubishi Shogun, but it would look just as
much at home at a smart country occasion. The snag is that it only comes
with left-hand steering, although there are plans to introduce right-hand
drive versions, possibly by late next year.
Unlike Land Rover, Jeep (part of the Chrysler organisation) has hedged its
bets. If the trend by then has moved away from on/off-road 4x4s, Chrysler's
Voyager MPV will be waiting in the wings, complete with right-hand steering.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport: Why small is beautiful - Olympic politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As he stood in the Sorbonne this week, paying homage to the efforts of Baron
Pierre de Coubertin in 1894 to revive the Olympic Games, Juan Antonio
Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, must have felt
a sense of irony.
When de Coubertin's invitees met 100 years ago, in the Salle Octave Greard
at the university, the young French aristocrat sought to make his tiny
committee internationally powerful. Today, Samaranch is struggling to find
ways to make his powerful group smaller.
De Coubertin would have made a superb lobbyist in any modern democracy. In
spite of a bizarre appearance - he grew a wide, feathery moustache - the
baron was worldly enough to have a hand-picked group of powerful
sympathisers who attracted public attention.
By June 1894, after 10 years of effort, de Coubertin had hustled enough
support in French public life to organise his Sorbonne Congress, at which
the rebirth of the Olympics was formally discussed. There were 2,000 guests
at the opening banquet, with athletes' representatives from 12 countries.
Throughout the Congress, de Coubertin staged fete after fete - including
night foot-races and fencing matches in a Parisian playing field lit by
1,000 torches. Trumpet fanfares, military music and fireworks rounded off
the events.
The main principles of the Olympics were approved almost without debate, de
Coubertin said. These were: four-year intervals between Games, modern
sports, no children's contests, different sites for each Olympics and a
stable IOC. It is remarkable how these principles have endured, in spite of
developments such as television and sponsorship.
Earlier this year, Samaranch wrote privately to each IOC member asking for
views on two subjects: fixed rather than lifetime membership and the
involvement of presidents of individual sports federations as temporary
members during their terms of office.
So far, 52 have replied - a little more than half. Samaranch is looking for
a reform consensus he can bring to the August Congress of the Olympic
movement - the first since Baden-Baden in 1981 - but, as one IOC insider put
it, 'asking members to support fixed terms is like getting turkeys to vote
for Christmas'.
One tactic that Samaranch and his executive board seem to be employing,
perhaps to show the IOC the dangers of atrophy, is not replacing members who
die or reach mandatory retirement age.
No new members have been elected for over two years. And the Lausanne
headquarters of the IOC has made no commitment to elections at the congress.
Countries such as the UK, Italy and the US, which have previously had two
members (as a recognition of having held the Games) now have one, simply
through non-replacement.
Possibly, Britain is in the most curious position of all. Having fought hard
in the last five years or so, in concert with other Europeans and Americans,
against the increasing Latin-American domination of the IOC voting process,
the country that gave most to de Coubertin's vision of modern athleticism is
now becoming marginalised.
Princess Anne is the sole current UK member, but her position and other
commitments make it impossible for her to become completely involved in the
Machiavellian and high-stakes world of international sports politics.
Sebastian Coe, the Olympic gold-medal runner turned Tory MP, and Craig
Reedie, chairman of the British Olympic Association, are the candidates to
fill the IOC vacancy created by the mandatory retirement of Dame Mary Glen
Haig.
Coe is much liked by Samaranch, who appointed him a member of the Athletes
Commission and - notoriously - gave him a personal invitation to compete in
Seoul after the middle-distance runner had failed to qualify for the British
team. Reedie, a former president of the Badminton federation, is
well-connected in the top echelons of sport and would quickly become a force
for common sense and less grandeur within the IOC.
Both men are the type the IOC needs to embrace if it is to renew itself for
the coming 100 years. But the 'recruitment freeze' - based around the
Samaranch passion to reform and tighten the movement - means neither will
have an opportunity to contribute.
In the US, a similar problem surrounds the vacancy created by the
resignation from the committee two years ago of the disgraced Robert
Helmick. The obvious candidate, Peter Ueberroth, maestro of the Los Angeles
Olympics, has much to contribute but seems to have little chance of joining
the IOC.
There is always friction between a host city and the Olympic committee in
the frantic couple of years before a Games. However, relations between
Atlanta and Lausanne are unusually frosty, with some senior IOC figures
beginning to wonder if it was not a terrible mistake to award the games to
that city.
Some of those difficulties - which are likely to get worse in the two years
left before the 1996 Games - might have been avoided if the Olympic
experience Ueberroth garnered in Los Angeles in 1984 were available within
the IOC.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport (World Cup '94): Colombians trip up tipster - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Betting-wise, my strategy of backing South American teams has been rocked,
but not wrecked, by Colombia's gutless performance and (almost certain)
elimination, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. They were my big winners. After
Romania beat them, I took another wrong step by betting Pounds 10 each way
on Romania at 25-1 (Pounds 10 to win at 25-1 and Pounds 10, at half-odds, to
reach the final).
My other bets - Brazil (3-1) and Argentina (9-1) - could still show a small
overall profit, which means that the time to pump up the volume is fast
approaching.
If Brazil and Argentina win their first-round groups, they will not meet
before the final (assuming they survive). But so greedy are Britain's
bookmakers that Brazil have been clipped to 7-4. If Romania are eliminated,
my combined losses on them and Colombia will total 53 per cent of my stakes
to date - a disgraceful position to be in.
For my next trick, I will probably quadruple my Pounds 20 bet on the Argies,
but not until they have played Nigeria. Coolness is required. It is what the
bookies dread.

Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigeria, who meet Argentina in Boston today following a 3-0 win in their
World Cup debut against Bulgaria, say they are not afraid of Argentina's
rehabilitated star, Diego Maradona.
'Maradona is a respected player,' said Nigeria's Dutch coach Clemens
Westerhof. 'We respect him, but we are not afraid of him.'
Both teams won their opening games and know they have relatively weak
opponents in their last games, so today's Group D match could turn into a
goal-chasing clash of two powerful forward lines.
But Maradona advised caution against Nigeria.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport (World Cup '94): Turn on, tune in, and marvel with
Motson - Britain's TV audience is being served a World Cup mixture of
thrills and banality / Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There comes a turning-point in every World Cup when events on the pitch take
on extra significance. It usually happens after the opening salvoes have
been fired. We have been introduced to the dramatis personae; we have
acclimatised to sleepless nights; and we have begun to bond with the hapless
addicts at the other end of the office who also remember that Bolivian
back-heel which led to their third corner of the match.
At this transcendent moment, people who spent the first days of the campaign
rubbishing soccer find they have run out of cliches and quips, and start to
take an interest, for even they understand that what they are watching is
powerful drama.
That moment has arrived early in this splendid tournament, with Thursday's
Italian victory over the charmless Norwegians. The combination of a rash
piece of goalkeeping and a truly courageous piece of management by Arrigo
Sacchi brought us the first unforgettable icon of USA 94: the utterly
bewildered face of Italy's Roberto Baggio as he trudged off to be
substituted by Luca Marchegiani.
You had to be there - in front of a television screen, that is - to lip-read
Baggio's distress: 'E impazzito?' ('Has he gone mad?'). Sacchi stood firm.
Off went the cherubic Baggio, up went the voice of BBC commentator John
Motson, and suddenly we knew we were in a World Cup.
These are the games, high in melodrama, low in pure footballing skill, which
make great television. For the truth is that the various pundits assembled
to provide viewers in Britain with 'expert' analysis are proving as sadly
inadequate as ever.
Reaching a new nadir of banality, John Fashanu, who plays for Wimbledon in
the English Premier league and is commentating for ITV, revealed plenty
about his conception of the game during the closing stages of Sweden vs
Cameroon. 'In the last couple of minutes', said Fash, 'we have had two
substitutions; both of them are 6ft 2in, so neither side obviously wants to
settle for a draw.'
Tell that to the 'Norwegian Everests' (La Gazzetta dello Sport). Norway are
one of the tallest sides in the competition, but have so far displayed
little desire to wander into their opponents' half.
For the most part, comments on strategy and technique have been conspicuous
by their absence from British screens. Tactics? Who needs them when you have
Ron Atkinson, manager of Aston Villa, around? Ron, never one to lose himself
in theory, has become a master of psycho-football, the game that is played
entirely in the head.
Halfway through Germany vs Spain, he could bear it no longer: 'You also  - I
don't know if it's my imagination - get the impression about that mental
thing . . .' - this in response to the hitherto impressive Spanish side
having had a quiet five minutes.
'That mental thing' is pundit-shorthand for letting us know that every side
from south of the Alps - or Texas, for that matter - contains far too many
feckless fanny merchants who would prefer to be in mid-siesta than in
midfield where they might be called on to turn over a bunch of strapping
Teutons.
On came Germany's Rudi Voeller, the 'old fox', in what was 'a psychological
substitution'. Like a work of 18th century empirical philosophy, all was in
the mind now. 'You get the impression that all the belief is with the
Germans' - a quasi-theological pearl that warned us what to expect. The
Spanish dominated the rest of the game and Germany played their poorest
football of the tournament.
The team with the most legitimate claim to experiencing unbearable mental
pressure have provided the saddest story of the week. Colombia had to pull
their mid-field player Gabriel Gomez out of their match against the US at
the last minute after he had received death threats against his family.
On the field, the Colombians looked ever more ineffectual as they ran their
pretty triangles into the thumping tackles of Alexi Lalas and Marcelo
Balboa. As they left the field at half-time, the Colombians would have seen
a scoreboard which read: 'Escobar, own goal', which probably told them more
than they needed to know about their homeland.
Lalas and Balboa (wasn't that Rocky's surname?) looked stronger and stronger
as the match went on. Lalas, variously referred to as 'the rock-and-roller',
'the gypsy' and 'Catweazle', looks one of the best defenders in the world on
current form - smart money sees him in the Premier league next season -
while Balboa came within an inch of scoring the goal of this or any World
Cup with a stupendous overhead kick.
At the other end, goalkeeper Tony Meola, who wants to be an actor, glanced
at the TV camera behind the goal and crossed himself in mock incredulity.
The Americans, having seen their basketball championship settled on
Thursday, can now turn their attention to the less serious business of
watching their soccer players knock the stuffing out of some of the world's
greatest teams.
Through a combination of Wimbledon, short-sightedness and long, bitter
memories, we were denied the opportunity of watching live what was surely
one of the biggest stories of the first World Cup week - the extraordinary
return of Argentina's Diego Armando Maradona, perhaps the only man, along
with Pele of Brazil, to have earned the right to be called a football
genius.
This mere fact was not enough to sway Britain's terrestrial TV channels,
which had already decided that an ageing, overweight cheat with a drug
problem could not possibly play a decisive role in such a wholesome sporting
event.
They should think again. Maradona's body is so battered that he is literally
frightened to shoot, in case the force required causes him serious injury.
But against Greece, he saw an opening and could not resist it. Curled into
the top corner, it was the most precisely-hit shot of the week.
Maradona's sprint to the camera and Munch-like scream into the lens let out
four years of fury and resentment. BBC link-man Bob Wilson found it
unsavoury. Maradona himself, watching a playback, thought it was 'very
beautiful'.
Surrounded by loyal lieutenants who can move the ball with bewitching speed,
and looking significantly fitter than he did in Italy four years ago,
Maradona is set to have a final fling with the talent which stubbornly
refuses to desert him. He has already won a World Cup single-handed, but
will not rest on the memory. It's that mental thing.

Advertisers in Cyprus have withdrawn TV commercials aired during World Cup

Soccer
</HEADLINE>

A summit meeting was delayed, streets virtually emptied and doctors
postponed operations yesterday as millions of South Koreans tuned in to the
country's World Cup match against Bolivia, which ended in a scoreless draw.
South Korea had not won a game in three previous trips to the World Cup
finals, and must now beat defending champions Germany to advance to the
second round.
President Kim Young-sam, an ardent soccer fan, and visiting Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai, met 20 minutes later than scheduled so that they
could watch the telecast, the presidential office said.
Kim lamented South Korea's missed opportunities in the last minutes, but
later called national team coach Kim Ho to voice encouragement. 'I want to
cheer the players for doing their best. If Spain can tie Germany, we also
can put up a good fight against Germans,' the president was quoted as
saying.
News reports said surgeons at the Korea University hospital in Seoul
rearranged their operating schedule so they could watch the match.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Sport (World Cup '94): A new generation wooed by skill -
Robbie Walther, 15, plays soccer for Dalton School in New York City. He says
that doesn't make him a wimp / Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Why do I, a good, young, upstanding American, play soccer and not American
football, basketball or baseball? The question had never crossed my mind
before it was announced that the soccer World Cup would be played on
American soil.
As soon as I heard the news I was ecstatic, but confused. How could soccer's
most prestigious tournament be played where football, baseball and
basketball reigned supreme; where soccer had not even been televised on the
four major networks; and where anyone who wants to watch a soccer game
either has to listen to a commentary on a cable station - probably in a
different language - or go and watch a college match, at times possibly the
most embarrassing athletic vision the US has to offer?
My feeling is that it was the suburbs and the immigrant communities around
the country that helped create the impression of some interest in soccer.
But one thing was certain, I thought: it was not people like me who caused
Fifa, the sport's governing body, to choose America as home for the 1994
World Cup.
I have been playing soccer since I was six years old and, since everything
back then had to revolve around me, I naturally assumed that just about
everybody played soccer. Now that I am in high school, it is pretty obvious
that I am in quite a small minority.
This must have something to do with the availability of soccer equipment in
New York City. For a pick-up game of American football in the park, all you
need is six kids, a football and something to mark the end zone. Soccer
needs a ball, at least 10 kids - and two goals.
Now, some of the suburbs and areas with heavy immigrant populations do have
pitches and goal-posts marked out, but not the New York City parks I know.
So soccer is almost destined to falter in the cities, though there are a few
of us who keep the game alive in urban areas.
In New York, the football and soccer seasons overlap, which forces choice on
anybody who wants to play both. I tried football, but once I had experienced
the joys of a sport in which it takes 30 minutes to put on pads to play for
another 30 minutes without ever actually touching the ball with hand or feet
(I was big enough to play in the line), I lost my taste for it. When I said
as much to the football coach, he reprimanded me with words that not only
told me he liked anchovy pizza but also that he thought I was a wimp. I was
nudged towards soccer.
If the football coach started me playing, I have stayed with soccer because
it is different and I love it. It does not involve my hands or brawn but it
does involve my feet and brain (speed helps, too). There is no other sport
in the world that allows the feet (and sometimes the head) to do the
scoring. So, a country where men like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Joe
Montana and Lawrence Taylor are labelled as superior athletes has yet to
produce a soccer superstar like Pele, just about the only soccer player
anybody has ever heard of.
Other kids my age have not been so lucky to have soccer's history and
traditions explained to them, and it is hard for them to learn about the
game.
Most start not by playing it but through television. And here's something
interesting: we can now see TV commercials that use soccer to sell a product
 -for example, Snickers candy, in which a man is shown juggling a soccer
ball.
The target of this commercial is children, which tells me that the
advertising people have worked out that soccer just might be bigger among
kids than they had thought. Now we have reports that an eight-team American
soccer league might be formed.
On reflection, maybe America got the World Cup not just because its
government put in the highest bid but because of people like me, who live in
big cities, as well as the suburbanites and the immigrants.
I guess Fifa saw that America could become a great soccer-playing nation,
and how much my generation needed a new pastime. Perhaps we are really on
our way.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Chile slow to get chilly: FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. This week they arrived in Chile.
Arriving in Chile, winter seemed far away. It was if Portillo, one of the
highest and most famous ski resorts in South America, was reluctant to be
stirred from hibernation.
Just 48 hours earlier we had been baking in the heat of the Mojave desert in
California - and the temperatures in the Andes would not have been out of
place in the Californian summer.
Recently, in the northern hemisphere, we have seen many ski resorts 'put to
bed' for the summer, but this is the first time we have seen one being woken
up for the winter.
In spite of being surrounded by peaks of 19,000ft and more, Portillo, close
to Argentina, was still in its summer slumber.
Lucy and I, on the other hand, although anxious to ski, were keen to hang on
to what was left of our brief summer. We were rewarded with a blue-sky day
and a powerful sun which glittered on the icy and almost bottomless waters
of the Laguna del Inca just outside our chalet.
David Purcell and his brother Henry, both originally from New York, had been
praying for a heavy snowfall so that they could open Portillo on time. And
the following day, a leaden sky might have given them cause to cheer. But
David Purcell did not like what he saw.
'High overcast,' he said. 'That's exactly what we don't want. We need either
snow or clear blue skies so it gets cold enough to make snow. When it's like
this it doesn't snow and we can't make snow either. Some resorts would open
with the snow we already have, but we'd rather wait.'
Open or not, Henry, who has been in charge at Portillo since 1968, was kind
enough to run one of the chairlifts just for Lucy and me so that we could
ski our compulsory daily run. He and his daughter Elisa even kept us
company, while his black labrador Sally romped down the slope with us.
Then the prayed-for snow started falling with a vengeance, completely
contradicting the weather forecast. Tentatively, the Purcells opened a
single Poma lift.
After stagnating with minimal skiing for 8 1/2 days, Lucy and I were even
more boisterous than Sally. We skied relentlessly through falling snow until
the lift closed.
I expected to feel dismay at being plunged back into winter again so soon,
but the familiar feeling of warm blood tingling in my veins on a cold day,
and the sharp intake of mountain air, came as a pleasantly invigorating
surprise.
Now we are looking forward to trying the rest of Portillo's lifts, including
the unique Va et Vient lifts, Rocas Jack and Condor, specially designed for
inaccessible, avalanche-prone terrain, and skiing some of Chile's steepest
slopes - with the possible exception of the Kilometro Lanzado, on which
French Olympic champion Michael Prufer skied at 135.264mph.
This is a wild, windswept place. And much as we miss the Californian summer,
we are glad to be here.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Gardening: Be wary of Blairi - give cistus a vote - Robin
Lane Fox finds that sun roses can leave their rivals in the shade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flowers are everywhere and it seems mad to waste a weekend in a town. Roses
have even been keeping pace with the news. I have no doubt about my sight of
the week: it confronted me on an old brick wall in Oxfordshire with an
allegorical message.
All over the brickwork ran the opulent flowers of the old-fashioned rose
known as Blairi Number Two. Watch out, you fellow travellers, to judge from
this rose's petals. The outer edges are a soft and appealing pink but the
centres are a deep rose red, verging on bloodstains.
Blair's Number Two is a class act as a climber, like the lesser-known Number
One. Perhaps we will see it in party buttonholes in 1997. But you might be
reassured to know that it is extremely prone to rot when looking its most
promising, and that it never performs if it is given its head. It looks best
on a scaffold of wood or bamboo.
This weekend, the elusive Blairi Number One can be seen at its best in the
great rose garden of Mottisfont Abbey in Hampshire (where I think I remember
it on the wall in the far left-hand corner as you enter the first walled
square). Number One is nothing but a pale powder-pink, and I have to say
that Number Two has eclipsed it.
Roses of this type hate my soil; they show signs of distress and quickly
lose their leaves. In order to hide them, I look to the other great shrubs
of high summer in the home counties. Three mild winters have done wonders
for them and, this weekend, the best have never looked better. On a poor
soil for roses, try sun roses instead. These are the evergreen family of
cistus which will leave Blairi Numbers One and Two looking very parochial if
you ever transplant them to gardens further south.
Cistuses conjure up two different settings which the post-war intake of
gardeners are busily uniting. With one eye, I picture them on the chalk
soils of Hampshire, spilling out of borders below the mallow-flowered
abutilons which have come safely through the recent frosts between
Winchester and Newbury. With the other, I picture them where they grow wild:
in the gardens of expatriate-built holes within reach of the Mediterranean.
If I was banished from Britain, Blair's roses would be no good at all: I
would switch over in quantity to cistuses (a plant which gardeners in
France, Spain and Italy still use unimaginatively).
Cistuses, like horses, have run through my adult life, some staying longer
than others. By now, I know which ones look best. Go for the white-flowered
forms with dark, chocolate blotches and leaves with a sticky surface and a
resinous smell. I never understand why many gardeners, especially in hot
climates, choose the pink-flowered forms instead: varieties such as Silver
Pink or Sunset are much the least interesting.
The first choice has to be Cistus cyprius, which is surprisingly hardy in
Britain and magnificent in French or Italian settings. It puts up with awful
drought and soon reaches 6-7ft, needing enough room to spread itself. But be
sure that you site it correctly because you cannot move it later. Indeed,
the one golden rule for cistus growers is never to transplant an established
bush. This spring I broke the rule, just to test it; the result is a dead C.
cyprius, just as the books promise.
If cyprius is too big for your taste, you might like to risk others that are
denied to those of us in colder gardens. In light shade, there is a
white-flowered cistus, called palinhae, which will flourish unexpectedly
under tall trees. I first saw it at Wisley and then checked its performance
with Graham Thomas, the living master of ground cover.
C. palinhae really does spread in light shade, although it will look messy
if you have the sort of trees which drip anything sticky on to the ground.
It makes low bushes (up to 2ft) and is a much older and grander alternative
to yet more hardy geraniums. Anyone with shade in a sheltered garden should
try two or three bushes and, if they survive the winter, take dozens of
cuttings next year.
Cistuses are extraordinarily easy to multiply, as you can prove for yourself
this very weekend. Now is exactly the moment to strike. Simply pull off some
of the soft shoots which are not flowering at the tips of a plant, and pot
them up in a light, sandy soil. They will be well-rooted by September so
long as you water them.
Londoners and expatriates also have the choice of two lovely forms which
lack sufficient hardiness for me. The best is lusitanicus decumbens, which
has white flowers with crimson eyes and lasts as a broad, spreading bush for
a very long season.
It ought to be exploited everywhere in its native Spain and Portugal, but
gardeners seem stuck with exotic South African daisies and foreign bedding
plants. Against a sunny wall in a warm city, it will last for many years; it
is my pick of the main family.
I would match it with a hybrid, raised in Hampshire: Halimio cistus
wintonensis which has small, grey-green leaves and cream-yellow flowers with
a chocolate zone in its prettiest named variety, Merrist Wood Cream. Be
warned, however, that it has never survived moderate frost in sheltered
corners of Oxford and is emphatically a plant for a pot or a warm garden
here or abroad.
Years of losses have taught me there are few certainties in the world of the
cistus, but that the taller and smaller-flowered white laurifolius is one of
them. It remains a backbone of summer borders and banks, even in places
where the frost is relatively sharp.
Since 1987, I have rallied to an alternative, the broader and
bigger-flowered Snow White (its elderly raiser kindly wrote to me when last
I alluded to it in the FT).
One or two branches have died back since then, but I continue to think it
the most under-rated of the hardy forms - and if you saw it right now, you
could only agree. The petals fall nightly from the passing flowers but buds
keep on opening and the entire plant now has a spread of 6ft without any
sign of distress.
Surprisingly few nurseries either list or know it. Hunt out those which the
The Plant Finder recognises and then propagate Snow White from cuttings;
they root with wonderful ease.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Outdoors: A glorious evening of sedge frenzy - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Readers with retentive memories may recall an account I gave last summer of
a week-long trip to Ireland which was attended by bad weather on an almost
biblical scale. The experience of having my campaign against salmon and
trout reduced to grim farce by flood and tempest compelled a reassessment.
Last year's weakness might have been an excess of planning. This time, I
kept my options open until word reached me that the summer salmon were
running in the Blackwater.
A glance over the bridge at Mallow gave the first hint that the tactics
might be flawed. Twelve months before, the Blackwater had been in foaming
flood. Now it was a gentle and suspiciously shrunken stream. Where, I
demanded of Frank, who guards and cherishes the fishing at Killavullen - was
the water? And the salmon?
His sorrowful face told the whole wretched story of the damnable lottery
that is salmon fishing. It was now Monday. The previous Tuesday a steady
rise in the water had brought the fish up in numbers. Frank had six one day,
seven the next. By Friday the level was dropping and the salmon had speeded
upstream. By the time we - my Irish companion, Niall, and I - arrived, the
situation was hopeless.
It was Frank's opinion, offered to the accompaniment of violent profanity,
that there was not a single salmon resident on the fishery.
We decided to hold a high-level pow-wow, concentrating on the kernel of the
problem. This, as ever, was the weather, which was glorious. The sun was
beating down, and the Blackwater seemed to be evaporating before our eyes.
Our thoughts turned from the unreliable salmon to the trout of Ireland's
finest trout river, the Suir, no more than an hour's drive away.
Next morning found us in the pleasing town of Cahir, across in County
Tipperary. We were in a little shop up the hill from the famous Norman
castle, buying flies at a furious rate from a woman called Alice Comba. She
is quite the most artistic dresser of flies I have come across in many a
year, and her premises in Old Church Street are well worth a visit, if you
have the good fortune to be in that lovely part of the world.
We knew that our best chance would be during the evening. By 8.30pm we had
feasted in a smart new restaurant in the town square, and were tackling up
beside the broad, well-loved waters at Swiss Cottage, just downstream from
Cahir. It and 15 miles of the Suir are controlled by the Cahir Anglers, a
day ticket from Miss Comba costs Pounds 8, a season's permit just Pounds 13.
I waded across the stream, went down a couple of fields, and fished up a
long, deep pool towards a weir. The air was balmy and, as the sun sank in an
amber sky, the trout began to pick at a hatch of olives. But they were as
fastidious as ever, and as I neared the top of the pool, I still had not
managed to fool one.
Then I saw a clumsy, fluttering movement at the surface, and an eager pounce
from a fish. It was a sedge, and within minutes, multitudes of these
unprepossessing insects were appearing all over the river, and the trout
were going mad.
There is nothing in trout fishing to beat the excitement of an evening sedge
hatch, and it was years since I had experienced one. Something about the
motion of the creature as it careers across the top in its efforts to gain
flight induces abandon in even the most selective fish. The rises are
slashing and savage and the river that velvet June night boiled with the
feeding frenzy.
Normally, in such circumstances, I lose my head and fall in, or lose my
flies, or break my cast. This time I remained comparatively calm, and one of
Miss Comba's sedge patterns did the rest. By the time I bumped into Niall, I
had caught seven. None was vast, but they fought like demons. He, a much
more accomplished fisher than I, had simply lost count of his battles.
On the bank, witnessing our endeavours, was a curious little Cahir man. He
rebuked me sternly after I had waded back, telling me that I could have
fallen into a hole and been swept away. A friend of his, he said, had a
narrow escape a couple of nights before.
I asked him what had happened. It seemed that this friend had borrowed the
reins off my informant's horse, saying he wanted to pull a tree out of the
water. He had tied a grappling hook to one end of the rope, and the other
end to his leg. Throwing the hook around the tree, he had attempted to walk
the tree out of the water, fallen headlong, and been 'near drownded'.
Unable to see the relevance of this incident to my own case, we bade
farewell to the little man and left the river, exhilarated. It had been a
memorable night.

a heresy for James Bond
</HEADLINE>

Not so long ago a friend confessed that he had been to Dukes Hotel in St
James's, central London, and ordered a dry martini. The barman at Dukes,
Gilberto Preti, is rumoured to make the best martinis in London, but my
friend found that he had been unable to finish the glass: it was just that
bit too strong, and just a little bit too dry.
It is that austere and uncompromising side of the martini which makes it the
greatest of cocktails. One's first martini should be a baptism of fire: a
martini is a John Wayne of a drink which separates men from boys. It is one
of the very few things I look forward to when crossing the Atlantic, for
Americans are deeply serious about martinis.
In 1977 President Jimmy Carter launched a famous attack on the
'three-martini lunch' as a symbol of the progressive decadence of the
American business world. American drinking habits are distinctly odd. They
drink three cocktails then sit down to iced water rather than wine with the
meal. It is all a bit like a general who unleashes a terrible artillery
barrage at the enemy lines at the beginning of a battle, then forgets to
send in the troops. Three pre-prandial martinis would seem to be a lethal
dose.
A great deal of mystique surrounds the creation of a martini, but the recipe
looks deceptively simple. The Savoy Cocktail Book (Constable, Pounds 6.95)
gives the following: '1/7 dry vermouth; 6/7 dry gin, stir well with ice and
serve with a squeeze of lemon rind.' Which is certainly only half the story.
In order to find out the other half, I went along to a tasting of dry
martinis at the Atlantic Bar and Grill in Piccadilly, London's latest
late-night haunt. Five top London barmen were standing with their cocktail
shakers in their hands: Dick Bradsell from the Atlantic; Salvatore Calabrese
from the Lanesborough; Peter Dorelli from the Savoy's American Bar; James
Scott from the Groucho Club in Soho; and Lado Stojanovic from Maxwells in
Covent Garden.
Judging between the five was hard work indeed. All displayed a very high
level of professionalism. Bradsell's, Calabrese's and Dorellis were quite
similar in style - all three were deeply lemony. Dorelli's was slightly
different in that it was served, minus the peel in the original Savoy
cocktail glass; justified by tradition, but ever so slightly nude.
Stojanovic's was the least dry of the five, in that it was the only one in
which one could detect the flavour of vermouth which made it half way to a
gin and French. Scott's was possibly the driest, in that not even the lemon
was able to dent the armour of the gin.
What surprised me were the choices of gin.
They were unanimous in their condemnation of Gordons and its new 37.5 per
cent bottling, but all five had selected gins at 40 per cent. Of these, two
were Beefeater, two Bombay Sapphire and one, Booths. Contrary to the
teaching of great barmen beyond these shores, who use export strength gin at
around 47 per cent, these British barmen insist that their relatively weak
martinis are the best. American customers, they maintain, are astounded by
their delicacy after the fire-water they drink at home. I have to say I was
not wholly convinced by this argument.
Of the other elements which go into a martini, four out of five favoured
Martini Extra Dry as their vermouth, while the one remaining barman used
Noilly Prat. In the main, the vermouth does not end up in the drink, being
either swirled round the glass or the shaker. Clear, fresh, quick-frozen ice
was absolutely indispensable; and it should be stirred, not shaken: shaking
bruises the gin. This little heresy was introduced by Ian Fleming of James
Bond fame.
Another heresy was the olive. Dorelli thought this went back to the film
MASH, where one of the characters is offered an olive-less martini and
exclaims: 'What no olive? You can't drink martinis without olives]' You can,
apparently. An olive will just make your cocktail oily.
I emerged from the tasting slightly light-headed and not wholly convinced
that I had really got to the bottom of the martini debate. Next stop Dukes.

<TEXT>
It is the height of the elderflower season and I am clutching a friend's
recipe for elderflower cordial, to which my family is addicted. The
commercial versions are not bad but the home-made ones are ambrosia. We have
a car bootful of elderflowers, sugar in the cupboard and all I lack is
tartaric acid or citric acid.
I start off at Waitrose, Safeway and Sainsbury and am in some despair when
all fail to yield the essential ingredient. On to Boots. 'Would cream of
tartar do?' asks the girl behind the counter. It will not. A helpful
pharmacist tells me that she can obtain some tartaric acid by Monday (it is
now Saturday and I do not fancy the elderflower heads' chances of surviving
that long).
I head up the high street stopping in every chemist along the way.
Eventually, a small pharmacist sells me citric acid and I am limp with
gratitude. He tells me that many chemists do not stock it because drug
addicts use it in conjunction with heroin. If this is true it seems rather
hard on the brewers of elderflower syrup.
As I write, the elderflowers are brewing splendidly. I am buying up all the
tartaric acid that I can and the nice pharmacist at Boots has ordered in
readiness for next year.
But why should it be so difficult to find something so innocent?
PS. The recipe - with grateful thanks to Morny Hay Davison:
Ingredients: 25 big elderflower heads; 2lbs white sugar; 80 grammes tartaric
acid or citric acid; 1 1/2 pints boiling water.
Method: Pour the boiling water over all the ingredients and stir each day
for four days. Strain through muslin and fill bottles.
Forget authentic earthenware dishes from the Auvergne, microwaves and
make-your-own pasta machines, today's hottest accessory for the serious cook
is a blow-torch.
Some weeks ago my son-in-law served a perfect creme brulee. The topping was
evenly crunchy and a heavenly shade of caramel - so unlike my own efforts
with a standard grill.
Top chef Alastair Little specifically recommends a blowtorch as a culinary
tool in his book Keep It Simple. The blowtorch can be used for crisping
potato toppings, singeing chickens, caramelising bananas, browning and
producing perfectly even brulees. It costs Pounds 10 and runs on propane
gas. The Taymar hand-held version is perfect - do not use anything more
powerful - and is available in DIY stores.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A fashionable way with fish - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sizzling roast joints of beef, lamb or pork used to be synonymous with
Sunday lunch. No longer. The word 'roast' has been hijacked.
Trendy menu-writers have discovered its power. Nothing, it seems, can start
salivation faster this summer. Pan-fried and char-grilled are passe. Roasts
are in.
The hottest menus are peppered liberally with roast and roasted foods, the
terms sometimes being applied to just about anything cooked in the oven.
Baked tomatoes have become roasted tomatoes, although the cooking method has
not changed one jot.
Aubergines, red peppers, fennel, garlic and courgettes are other likely
candidates for this treatment in fashionable restaurants, where you may be
offered roasted red pepper soup, slow roast tomatoes, and roast figs with
honey and almonds. But the choicest dish of the lot, the dish of summer
1994, must be roast fish.
Basically, roasting achieves the same searing effect on fish as grilling or
frying, but with fewer anti-social side effects. There is less danger of the
fish catching and burning as it cooks, so you do not have to watch it
closely. And most of the cooking smells are trapped within the walls of the
oven instead of the cook's clothes and hair.
Whole fish - such as sea bass, sea bream, snapper or grey mullet weighing 2
1/2 to 3 1/2 lb - are a popular choice while a middle cut of cod of around
the same weight is acceptable, too. For those who like everything to come
ready-portioned, fillets and steaks of turbot, brill, halibut and cod are
all suitable.
Whatever you choose, one crucial clue to success is using high heat. If the
temperature is low, the fish will not be sealed and seared without and
cooked juicily within, as it should be. Instead, juices will ooze out and
the fish will stew in them, quite possibly leaving the flesh dull and
tasteless. So make sure you heat the oven thoroughly in advance - the
hotter, the better.
How long will fish take to cook? Thickness is as important as weight. As a
general rule, allow 15 minutes an inch at the thickest part - but check by
testing. Cut down on to the backbone at the thickest part: the fish is ready
when the flesh has turned white right through. If the fish is ready before
you are, let it rest in the plate-warmer.
Whole fish are protected against drying out during cooking by their
mackintosh skins, and the skin can be a choice titbit if roasted crisply.
Placing the fish on a rack or a bed of vegetables raises it in the roasting
pan and allows the heat to circulate more freely - which is all the better
to crisp up the skin. A fan-assisted oven might also be of some help.
Be sure the skin is dried thoroughly after rinsing and before cooking. Then,
brush it with a thin film of oil or melted butter and sprinkle it with sea
salt and a good sanding of freshly-ground black pepper.
If, in spite of all this attention to detail, the skin does not roast as
crisply as you would wish, baste the fish again just before serving (with
butter or oil, or paint it with lemon juice or a light sugar syrup and a
splash of soy sauce) and flash it briefly under a very hot grill for a
sizzling finish.
Some cooks like to slash whole fish with two or three oblique cuts down each
side before cooking. This speeds the process but encourages some loss of
moisture, although the wounds can be staunched (partially, at least) by
stuffing them with slices of lemon or slivers of herb or spice-flavoured
butter.
On balance, however, I think it better to leave the skin unscathed and to
save such extra flavourings for stuffing into the belly or to use for
saucing when serving.
Fish fillets and steaks, lacking the all-enveloping protection of skin, need
more careful treatment. Dust them with a modicum of flour to check they are
thoroughly dry, and lay them in a shallow roasting pan or baking tin that is
robust enough not to buckle when subjected to high heat.
The tin should be brushed lightly with butter or oil and the pieces of fish
placed well apart. If jam-packed, the heat will be unable to circulate
properly and the fish risks stewing.
The simplest - and, in a way, the most sophisticated - recipes call for
topping the fish with just a dusting of flour and a drizzle of oil or melted
butter, and for turning it at half-time (but with great care, to avoid
breaking the crust). Such plainly-roasted fish steaks or fillets can be
served just as they are, pure and simple, or partnered with a splendidly
showy sauce.
More often (and this is easier to get right), the pieces of fish are cloaked
with buttery or olive oil-soaked bread crumbs flavoured with a few herbs or
spices.
By the time the fish is just cooked and still moist in the centre, the
crumbs should have dried out to an appetising golden crust. If necessary, a
quick flash under a very hot grill will ensure a crisp finish.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: New look for a high-fryer - Nicholas Lander
enjoys one of Britain's most satisfying meals / Great British Eating
</HEADLINE>

Fish and chips are not what they were. The great standby supper dish for the
British working classes is changing its profile - and so is the industry
that supplies it.
Some 10,000 fried fish shops in the UK generate annual sales of more than
Pounds 600m, frying more than 60,000 tonnes of fish and 600,000 tonnes of
potatoes. One of their leading proponents is John Barnes, ebullient chairman
of Britain's most famous chippie, the publicly-quoted Harry Ramsden's. He
visited the first Ramsden's shop at Guiseley, Yorkshire, in 1968 and liked
the product so much that he bought the company.
Barnes says: 'Our aim is to make eating fish and chips fun, using the
original Guiseley design from the 1930s as the setting for all the
restaurants.' There are now 10, including one in Hong Kong, and other
overseas outlets are to open soon in Melbourne and Singapore. Requests for
information are frequent, many from overseas; they are answered by the
company's own public relations department.
But Ramsden's is only part of the story. If you walk into any restaurant
today serving modern British food, there is bound to be a variation on fish
and chips. It has also become a fashion food, with top chefs eager to outdo
each other in their style of presentation
Indeed, cod and chips with a mint pea puree (Pounds 9.95) were on offer last
week to millionaire author Jackie Collins and politician Cecil Parkinson who
were eating (separately) at London's fashionable Le Caprice restaurant.
Fish and chips is a simple, unpretentious and relatively inexpensive dish
ideal for the 1990s. But as more chefs serve roast cod (healthier than
frying), it will inevitably make this increasingly scarce fish even more
inaccessible. Already, it is almost the same price as farmed salmon.
To find a fish and chip restaurant that bridged the gap between tradition
and modernity, I took the boat train to Harwich, Essex. There, at the the
Pier Hotel, I discovered a restaurant tinged with history, romance, and a
little sadness.
The original Pier Hotel was built in 1860 and it prospered for 90 years as
the quays bustled with ferries to and from continental Europe. Then business
fell away and the hotel was bought in 1977 by two local businessmen, Gerald
Milsom and Richard Wheeler. Milsom had an established restaurant, Le
Talbooth, at Dedham near Colchester, Essex, while Wheeler was chairman of a
Colchester wine merchant, Lay &amp; Wheeler.
On trips to Boston, in the US, they had seen the popularity of such
restaurants as Jimmy's Harbourside, where fresh fish was cooked simply and
sold cheaply and the queues never seemed to disappear. Their aim was to
offer the same at the Pier, where the sea is 50 yards from the front door.
The romance was supplied by the appointment of Chris Oakley as chef. Today,
he is in partnership there with his Swiss wife, Vreni, whom he met at Le
Talbooth. Indeed, Oakley was cooking in Davos, Switzerland, when Milsom
asked him to take over at The Pier.
Oakley is perhaps the most highly-trained fish and chip chef in the country,
having spent two years at catering college followed by another two years at
Claridge's, one of London's top hotels. He immersed himself in the job,
often visiting the famous Seashell fish restaurant at Lisson Grove, north
London, to see how it operated.
To choose the batter for his own fish, he set up a blind tasting of seven
different versions - including beer, egg, yeast, and flour and water. That
decided, he found that living near the sea was no guarantee of getting fresh
fish.
'When I arrived, I thought it would be quite easy for me to buy the fish I
wanted from the local fishermen, but it took me several years to win their
confidence,' he says. He has no regrets, though. 'In the summer months the
fish here - turbot, bass, brill, crab, lobster and Dover sole - are
wonderful, and sometimes in such abundance that I can let other chefs know
about the day's catch.'
The restaurant is on the first floor, from where you can look out over the
estuaries of the rivers Orwell and Stour to Constable country and watch the
fishing boats, yachts and ferries. My cod and chips were delicious, although
I kept an envious eye on the spanking fresh Dover sole being eaten alongside
me.
Oakley's formal background was obvious: an exciting array of four different
types of bread rolls before the meal and at the end some stunning petits
fours with the coffee.
This, however, is where the touch of sadness comes in. There is no denying
the popularity and success of The Pier, which serves 45,000 customers a year
and is one of the town's biggest employers in an area with unemployment well
above the national average. But it is too far from the real action.
The restaurant is in the centre of Harwich town, which used to be the
gateway to the quays. Now, though, most of the traffic which passes in and
out of Harwich en route to the Continent use a modern terminal at Parkeston
Quay, two miles away.
The Pier offers the great British meal of fish and chips in style. But, to
flourish for another 100 years, it needs a new location.

FT  25 JUN 94 / What would Mrs Goggins say?: Lucy Kellaway is put through
the Postman Pat test - Lunch with the FT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I am half-way through lunch with Howard Davies, director general of the
Confederation of British Industry, and we are discussing Postman Pat.
That very morning the newspapers had been full of Davies. He had been quoted
making accommodating noises about the Labour party, and had written an
article chastising Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, for
his naive views on dividends.
But now he is sitting in Andrew Edmunds, a rustic restaurant in Soho,
central London, challenging me to name six inhabitants of Greendale, a
fictional village from a children's storybook . . . 'Postman Pat, Mrs
Goggins, Ted Glen, Jess, Peter Fogg . . .' I am starting to struggle, and he
helps me out: 'Reverend . . .' he prompts. 'Timms,' I supply the correct
answer with considerable relief.
I have just failed to name the Famous Five, failed to name any Swallows or
Amazons and failed to supply the name of Jennings' best friend. Davies is
looking surprised, disapproving even.
We have reached Greendale by a circuitous route. I have told him how
thankful I am to be meeting him on my terms rather than on his. I was
referring to his famous Christmas parties to which he invites a large group
of like-minded, over-achieving fortysomethings for a highly-competitive
quiz. I had heard tales of senior Treasury officials being humiliated by
being unable to name the ERM bands.
'It's amazing what some people don't know,' he says coolly. He proceeds to
tell me about an even more hair-raising event that he is in the process of
arranging for his seven and nine-year-old sons. The children will answer
questions about children's books (doubtless doing better than I did), sing
songs in foreign languages and undergo tests of physical strength.
Howard Davies evidently excels at this sort of thing. During lunch he shows
himself to be an expert not merely on the relative pay levels of British
bosses, but on Zimbabwean wine (he is shortly off for what he calls a
'love-in' with Robert Mugabe, the country's president), on the structure of
tendons in the leg, and the latest in soccer computer games. He reveals that
he is fluent in French and Spanish, and is (or at any rate was) a first-rate
sportsman.
But that is to skip ahead. I had invited Howard Davies to lunch early this
spring. I got a prompt reply from his secretary accepting, but saying that
he did not have a free lunch slot until mid-June. Nearer the time, she
called again to name Andrew Edmunds as his chosen restaurant. It was a
predictably unpredictable choice, full of film people, with the odd
sprinkling of alternative business types.
To prove he fits the latter category Howard Davies arrives on his bicycle,
and is already installed when I arrive by taxi a minute or two late. He
orders a bottle of mineral water. 'I have two non-drinking months a year
just to prove it can be done,' he explains. 'It makes you lose weight
without having to concentrate on it.' I note that he is not exactly a fatty,
but he replies it makes him 'look better on the beach'.
He glances at the menu, and makes a healthy choice. 'I'll have the salmon
sashimi and then the crab cakes, for a change,' he says. A change from what?
I wonder.
Was he really busy every day since I invited him? He describes the endless
succession of people who invite him to lunch to lobby him about this or that
and his efforts to avoid a time-wasting meal. In addition there is the
endless round of associations and federations, each with their annual lunch
or dinner.
'The difficult thing is to think of something new to say.'
I ask whether he really needs to say something interesting every time,
surely no one would notice if he coasted occasionally? He disagrees: 'You'd
quite quickly acquire a reputation of being boring.'
I get the impression that in Davies's book, boring is a serious allegation.
Everything about him declares that he will not be considered that.
Unsuccessful might rank nearly as low.
'I tend to do single-mindedly what I am doing at the time,' he says as we
start to discuss his career. 'At Oxford I did Oxford. I did a certain amount
of work, I acted in OUDS, edited a newspaper and played games.' He recalls
how he applied to the BBC after Oxford, but was turned down without even an
interview - it seems to rankle even now. His friend Peter Stothard, now
editor of The Times, made the grade, but Davies points out that he did
better still by landing a job in the Foreign Office. 'I did what grammar
school boys did and asked what is the most difficult thing to do? At that
time the foreign office was.'
In any case he reflects that journalism is a young person's profession. At
just 43, surely he still counts as young? 'No, not since I did the Gazza
injury to my knee last year. Gazza was a fit young boy of 24 and he's come
back. But the surgeon said to me: we don't think it's worth repairing these
if you are over 40.' Then follows the description of tendons and cartilage
in the knee, which I only half understand.
Yet Davies does not think of himself as old either, and says that will not
happen until Mick Jagger stops singing, and there is no longer talk of the
next Rolling Stones tour. Here he has hit on our first shared interest. We
discuss great Stones' concerts, and I boast that I last saw them in Cologne
in 1990. He replies that he saw them in an even more unlikely place in
Paris.
Whatever age Howard Davies considers himself, he certainly looks older than
his years. I ask - as politely as it is possible to ask such a question -
whether he thinks his senior appearance has helped give him, especially
earlier on, extra gravitas.
He looks neither surprised nor offended. He replies that both he and John
Birt, director-general of the BBC (another chum), may have been helped by
going grey or bald early. However, he insists that he does not look 'older
in a total way. It's only hair in my case. I'm relatively fit for someone of
my age'.
The conversation is getting sticky, and the waitress rescues the situation
by asking if we would like a pudding. I order a tiramisu, and he an equally
wicked hot almond cake covered in cream. I declare the meal so far to have
been 'absolutely delicious'. He agrees that it has been 'quite good'.
Does he care about food, I ask. He turns out to be a keen cook, and says he
is much better than his wife (Pru Keely, producer of the BBC programme
Question Time) at preparing an impromptu meal for guests. Apparently he can
knock up a nice Italian pasta or risotto, a stir fry or something Indian in
just 20 minutes using whatever is in the fridge. His wife is a better bet
for guests who have been invited long in advance. 'She follows recipes that
say: 'Take a lobster, boil with four onions, discard lobster, reduce to one
teaspoon, pour over a scallop, discard scallop'.'
Apropos of nothing in particular, he then starts telling me about a computer
football game that his children have. I have already said that a) I have no
interest in football, and b) I do not know anything about computers.
Nevertheless, he gives a 10-minute soliloquy on the workings of this game,
the noises it makes when the ball hits the goal post, the information it
conveys about players of European teams, and much else besides.
I suggest that it is not only his sons who are wild about this game. He half
laughs, but certainly does not admit to having wasted hours bent over the
screen himself.
I ask for the bill, which turns out to be less than Pounds 40 including
service. I pay, and walk him to his bike. 'That was too cheap for the
Financial Times,' he says. 'Perhaps we should have lunch all over again.'

FT  25 JUN 94 / Celebrating rites of passage: Americans know how to
negotiate life's stepping stones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My daughter, Caroline, graduated from Harvard recently and there was much
celebration - deservedly for her; more selfishly for the parent freed of
forking out Pounds 25,000-plus a year.
The warm glow of the three happy days of rejoicing at 'the other Cambridge'
still lingers, but with it a serious thought: that whatever else they may do
right or wrong, Americans understand the importance of commemorating rites
of passage - and there are few more serious than obtaining a university
degree. More than that, marking the occasion properly is a long-term
investment in the future, for university and graduate alike.
Dim 30-year old recollections of Oxford are of a quick shuffle in a cap and
gown, rented by the hour, along with a handful of others who bothered to
pick up their degrees in person, the odd bottle of fizz huddled under an
umbrella, and back to the grindstone. Younger friends report it has not
changed much since.
Harvard, America's oldest university, has been doing it properly for 343
years and so, for not as long, have most other groves of US academe, where
to graduate from college (and high school and kindergarten and typing
school, come to that) is regarded as worthy of proper commemoration not only
by those receiving degrees but all who have helped them - parents, friends,
lovers, teachers, even bank managers.
Cynics say America overdoes this sort of thing, giving awards and
recognitions to those who do not really deserve them. Even now a controversy
rages in higher education over whether what is known as 'grade inflation'
make degrees themselves worth the paper they are written on.
But, as US vice-president Al Gore kept repeating (in a different context) on
Harvard's glorious Commencement Day: 'The cynics are wrong.' There ought to
be nothing cynical, as the university's bachelor's degree citation puts it,
about 'passing into the company of educated people', nor about the sense of
occasion and its own history that Harvard puts on display every year.
My daughter's graduation was no exception. Of course, it helped that the
weather was magical but local lore has it that it never rains on Harvard's
graduation and, if it does, it is only scotch mist, which no one notices.
Certainly a crowd that must have numbered 25,000, only about a third of them
getting first and higher degrees, could scarce forbear to cheer at every
opportunity (with the business school graduates cheerfully and greedily
waving dollar bills).
The featured guest speakers were Al Gore (class of '69) and recipient of an
honorary degree this year, and Lani Guinier. In truth, the vice-president
was not at his best in a speech that wandered more than a little from its
central text - that cynicism is the enemy of democracy.
But his now well-rehearsed line in self-deprecation ('I'm a living example
to the millions of Americans suffering from Dutch elm disease') got
appreciative laughs.
But Guinier was nothing if not challenging. She is the black law professor
nominated last year to run the justice department's civil rights division
but ditched by President Clinton after she had come under fire from the far
right for allegedly advocating weighted voting according to race.
Her message - that the problem of violence in inner cities is but a mirror
image of the fault lines in established society - got a few of the parents
grumbling, but was delivered with a force and a logic designed to dispel
complacency in the younger generation present.
Best of all were the student speakers, chosen by the faculty and then given
additional training by a drama coach. One gave the traditional Latin
oration, replete with references to the Simpsons and Whitewater. Another
wondered if the manic pursuit of goals left room for a real life. A third
urged the law school graduates to take up cases pro bono (for free). A few
were sentimental, but not weepy, and all were as pleased as punch to have a
role in the ritual.
Nine honorary degrees were awarded, the selection again showing the
catholicism that Harvard prizes but which British universities, too often
consumed with petty politics and ideology, sometimes fail to match - as
witnessed yet again by the carping surrounding Clinton's doctorate of laws
from Oxford.
As well as Gore, they included Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for
Refugees; Benny Carter, the black jazz musician; an ancient Harvard classics
professor; and even the president of Yale, grinning as the mention of his
university was greeted with universal hisses.
Commencement Day is also a great occasion for alumni, marching around
Harvard Yard according to their year, the very oldest in wheelchairs, their
fund-raising activities for the university recorded publicly.
And we are talking serious money: in less than a month since its launch, the
new Harvard campaign to raise Dollars 2bn had generated over Dollars 670m,
more than 1 1/2 times as much as the Pounds 268m Oxford has raised over five
years.
The discrepancy can be put down to differences in state support, national
wealth and attitudes towards philanthropy, as well as a testament to the
career successes of old Harvard men and women. But another element must
surely come into play - the great sense of obligation that Harvard graduates
feel towards the university.
The relationship is not a one-way street. An Ivy League degree looks good on
any resume, as does one from Oxbridge, although it is less of a guarantee of
instant success and riches in today's tough employment market than it was in
palmier economic times. But the Harvard network of important connections is
not left to chance. Harvard clubs flourish all over the world, bringing
people together often for more than a drink.
Rarely does a week go by without my wife, Kathleen (class of '72), receiving
Harvard mail - and not all of it, by a long chalk, asks for money.
Oxbridge is much less good at preserving this sense of mutual assistance.
This was a message I tried to convey in a modest speech last autumn to an
Oxford dinner and it seemed to have been well-received (even by John Patten,
the education secretary). But there has been no communication from the
college since, and my inclination to contribute to the Oxford fund has not
grown more keen.
Harvard, on the other hand, does even the little things well in sending its
products on their way. Within two hours of getting her degree from the
Master of Leverett House, Caroline had it framed: a quick service for just
27 bucks by the Harvard Co-op, ready to be hung forever on a wall. I am not
sure in what dark closet my rumpled piece of paper can be found.

WOODEN FURNITURE
Simple but finely-made oak garden furniture is offered by Gaze Burvill, a
small company. Every piece is designed to be in tune with the more muted,
subtle approach that seems to suit the English garden.
Only English oak, one of Britian's most durable woods, is used, with the
timber coming from carefully managed estates. Though some tools and
machinery are, of course, used (in particular for steam-bending the wood
which gives the comfortable, curving corners) each piece is essentially made
and finished by hand.
Photographed above is the Court Seat - elegant, under-stated and durable -
with comfortable curves, angles and wide seat slats. It comes in two, three
or four-seat versions and price ranges from Pounds 885 to Pounds 1,075.
Gaze Burvill will be showing its products at the Hampton Court Palace Garden
exhibition, which runs from July 6-10. The workshop at Plain Farm Old Dairy,
East Tisted, Hampshire, GU34 3RT, can also be visited by appointment (tel:
0420-587467) and a selection of colour photographs and a price list for all
pieces is available from the address above.
OLD ACCESSORIESus, when he disposed of a lifetime's collectables, that it
was quite amazing what people would pay for a couple of battered flower-pots
or some rusty spades if you could call them 'old' or 'antique'. And in some
cases, the epithets can actually stand for better quality as well.
Take spades. Those who know about such things tell me confidently that
good-quality Victorian or Edwardian spades are far sturdier and more
handsome than any of their modern equivalents.
The Chelsea Gardener of 125 Sydney Street, London SW3 has given over a
corner of the building to Marmaduke, a concession which supplies a
constantly changing selection of old implements.
Handsome, sturdy spades and hoes range between Pounds 34.95 and Pounds 50,
trowels start at Pounds 11.95, watering-cans at Pounds 34.95, a reel and
line for marking out straight lines when planting seeds is Pounds 34.95. The
best brand-names to look out for, the ones with the longest tradition, are -
Brades, Skelton, Griffin Brand, Spear and Jackson 'Neverbend', and Elwell.
A few old garden accessories, such as wheelbarrows, have been purloined by
the interior decorating and design set and their prices have risen
accordingly. At Marmaduke it is hard to find one at much less than Pounds
300.
METAL FURNITUREFor those who like to leave their garden furniture outside
all year round, Boundary Metal makes the furniture that meets the brief. It
is rustproof and heavy enough to be difficult to steal (a very important
point this: in our part of London there seem to be gangs of thieves who
specialise in garden accoutrements).
In the standard range there are several benches, chairs (such as the one
photographed here, Pounds 171) and tables, but the company is small and
friendly enough to enjoy handling special orders. Recently they have created
a series of pagodas (such as the one photographed here - prices start at
Pounds 700), as well as decorative structures encircling trees.
All the furniture is sold from its Newbury offices (Boundary Metal, Boundary
Road, Newbury, Berkshire RG14 5RT) and there is a small to selection to view
there. Otherwise there is a leaflet available (tel: 0635-42255) and
furniture will be dispatched by carrier.
RATTAN FURNITUREStrictly speaking, Rattan is not the ideal material for
garden furniture as it is neither weatherproof nor easy to move around. But
it looks more romantic and is more comfortable (when propped with cushions)
than metal or wood. The Pier has one of the biggest selections around.
Alison Richards, The Pier's founder and managing director, believes that the
market for rattan is expanding, with many people using it not just for the
conservatory but for country cottage living rooms, bedrooms and dining
rooms.
For the eco-conscious it is worth knowing that rattan is, (so The Pier's
excellent information sheet on rattan tells me) a renewable plant which can
be collected and used without destroying either the vine or the trees
themselves. Most rattan furniture comes from the areas where it grows most
freely - Southern China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and The Philippines.
Photographed here are a sofa (Pounds 149), chair (Pounds 75) and coffee
table (Pounds 65). For those who prefer their rattan to look rather more
decorative there is the curvier (and more expensive) Raffles Collection and
the yet more decorative Savannah.
The Pier has 10 shops around the UK but none further north than Birmingham,
so it offers delivery by post. (Tel: 0235-821088 for details and brochure.)
Global Village sells a particularly refined and decorative collection of
rattan, much of it with an antiqued finish. In particular there is a
wonderful colonial high-back chair which two years ago it was selling at
Pounds 250 a time and today it is offering at Pounds 195 (either in forest
green or biscuity antiqued finish). Global Village has six shops in all.
Tel: 0935-823390 for details and brochure.
PEBBLESIf you have more a pocket handkerchief than an estate, design matters
more than ever - and in particular, the relationship between paving stones
and grass and plants. Blot Kerr-Wilson has started applying her decorative
skills to gardens. In collaboration with an artist, Tim Coppard, she uses
small pebbles to create patterned surfaces on the ground.
Each job is different and is done to commission, so prices vary enormously.
In addition, materials used can vary from the white marble and beach pebbles
used in this commission (pictured), to glass, stone, brick, slate or other
materials.
Contact Blot Kerr-Wilson, 49 Northfield House, Peckham Park Road, London
SE15 6TL. Tel: 071-639 2277.

Fashions in furnishing the garden are fortunately not subject to quite the
same hectic time-scales as fashions in frocks. This is not to say that the
horticultural set does not have its serious snobbisms or that the likelihood
of committing some hideous faux-pas is not just as great but at least the
trends have a long enough cycle for everyone to have a chance of catching up
with them.
For some time, tastes in garden furniture have tended towards the simple,
the muted, the sturdy, the indubitably English. Bright continental parasols,
plastic - shaped to look like wrought-iron - and florally decorated
swing-seats can still be tracked down (if you must) but are deeply out of
favour.
Classic designs on the lines of Lutyens are the chief inspirational sources
for garden furniture designers today and one can see why - in the muted grey
of a typical English summer day they fulfil the practical function, add an
air of calm tranquillity to the scene and never, ever jar.
When it comes to the conservatory, then a touch of Eastern rattan could fit
the bill - decorative enough to conjure up visions of Raffles and tropical
verdancy and sturdy enough to serve the practical purpose.
For those with gardens or patios still in need of a little furnishing here
are a few designs currently on offer.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Fashion: To hell with dressing your age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do you not find propriety awfully middle-aged? How often do you hear the
'woman of a certain age' asking: 'Is this all right. I don't look like
mutton dressed as lamb, do I?'
Indisputably, there is a middle period in one's life when to look too trendy
or too drop-dead sexy invites derision - the singer Cher immediately comes
to mind.
But there is an absolutely certain age, by which I mean 70-plus, when a
woman can wear any for-the-hell-of-it garments she likes and get away with
it. It is the privilege of age, like being able to say exactly what you
think or be a 'character' and, as long as she carries it off with conviction
and aplomb, we all applaud madly.
I was reminded of this liberation a few months ago when I attended a party
thrown by publisher Naim Attallah to celebrate the publication of Pamela
Cooper's autobiography A Cloud of Forgetting. Pamela Cooper is 83 and as
sassy and irreverent as you will find.
Like Miriam Rothschild's mad head scarves, Diana Cooper's whoopsy-droopsy
garden hats, or Violet Bonham-Carter's Fortuny Delphos dresses, her personal
style has nothing to do with conformity.
On this occasion, most of us standing in the drawing-room of her son, Lord
Gowrie, were decorously upholstered in velvet, as stiffly posed as if still
wearing coat hangers.
Pamela Cooper was dressed in a pomegranate-coloured, viscose-knit tunic top
and bell-bottom trousers, bought, her grandchild explained to me, that
morning from a hip teenage chainstore for 'really nothing]'
It looked madly nouveau-Biba, teamed with Jesus sandals and a modernistic
1960s necklace which looked like a fitting from Star Trek's Starship
Enterprise.
This octogenarian was by far the most flamboyant figure in the room.
Even her demeanour spoke of the Roaring Twenties or Swinging London, for she
adopted that inimitable 'backbones are out' pose.
In her hey-day, in the 1920s, world weariness was madly fashionable and
wonderful for shocking dowagers.
These days Pamela Cooper has moved on. While the pose and the attire may
speak of ennui, the mind is as keen and amused as any girl recently up in
town from the shires. She is lapping up the world.
There is nothing weary about her approach to life. And that is why, wearing
that gear, behaving in that manner, she makes those of us in between long to
be either 20 or 70.
It is the middle ground, in Major's middle England, populated with the
endlessly middle-aged, in middle class propriety that makes me feel
dispirited.
Show me a trucker or a toff in wildly unsuitable clothing and I will show
you a good party.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Fashion: Why baggy shorts are down and out - John Morgan
urges Englishmen to use more imagination when packing their holiday clothes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is always easy to spot the Englishman on holiday. He is the burnt one,
whose clothes - an untantalising mixture of sagging swimwear and ill-chosen
separates - set him apart so dismally from most other nationalities.
Many men who dress appropriately for the office and attractively at
weekends, often abandon any vestige of sartorial savoir faire at passport
control. This is an unnecessary shame: a holiday wardrobe, like any other,
requires only a little imaginative application and a modicum of
self-knowledge.
The first rule of holiday dressing (assuming a reasonably sophisticated
destination that offers the usual mix of beach life, sight-seeing and night
life) is to remember that the same body you live with throughout the year
comes on holiday too and, thus, clothes that do not suit your shape at home
will look even worse abroad.
This may seem obvious, but I am constantly amazed by how many Englishmen
dress like clowns when on holiday. The right clothes make economic as well
as practical sense, as they will integrate happily into your general summer
wardrobe when you return home.
The second principle is to go easy on colour. The English complexion may
look peerless when celebrated by Lely or Gainsborough, but does not stand up
well to the harsh glare of the southern sun.
Unclothed, I, like many of my compatriots, bear a striking, and seriously
unappetising, resemblance to saumon en croute before it goes in the oven.
Leave bright colours to others and, instead, look at soft cream, stone, ecru
and white, with a few earth tones - such as terracotta and indigo for the
more adventurous.
A restricted colour palette will also help with the third prerequisite of
the holiday wardrobe - interchangeability. So will sticking to clothes in
plain rather than patterned fabrics. No one wants to travel with masses of
luggage, yet most people pack far more than they need. Everything described
here is designed to work together in different combinations, depending on
weather conditions and dress codes.
So we come to the components. The first necessity is a good lightweight
jacket. It is both practical and versatile and its pockets mean you need not
wear a money belt which, although undeniably useful, is grisly to look at.
The jacket should be made of linen, which is the coolest and most breathable
of cloths. Man-made fibres, no matter how advanced, should be left at home.
Some of the nicest jackets comes from Dries van Noten at Joseph. Made from
white linen, they are unstructured and cut fashionably long.
Alternatively, plump for a more robust white cotton drill blazer bristling
with antique brass buttons from Voyage, an excellent shop in London's Fulham
Road selling clothes ideal for travelling.
You also need to pack a couple of pairs of trousers. These could be the
lightweight linens, matching the Dries van Noten jacket, a pair of more
substantial cotton chinos from The Gap, in khaki, stone and salt, or, more
fashionably, a pair of draw string, pyjama-style pants from Voyage. These
would look much more up-to-the-minute than jeans and are also more
comfortable in hot climates.
When it comes to the vexed question of shorts, length is crucial. Too long
and you will look like a superannuated boy scout; too short and you appear
undressed. Opt for a beautifully-cut, mid-length pair in stone-coloured
linen by Margaret Howell. They are flattering and versatile. Passable
cheaper versions can be found at Thomas Burberry, Marks and Spencer and The
Gap.
Margaret Howell also scores well with her understated, relaxed shirts in
cotton or linen. These are cut generously, are cool to wear and can be
teamed with trousers, shorts and worn as a cover-up on the beach. Also
include a selection of classic polo shirts in Sea Island cotton from John
Smedley and plenty of white cotton T-shirts by the American manufacturer,
Hanes. Should you need clothing for a black tie occasion, an
exquisitely-made, knife-pleated evening shirt from Budd, in the coolest
cotton voile, is the most elegant thing you can wear.
A summer suit is also recommended. Ivory linen is always the most glamorous
choice. It can be worn on any occasion when you have to dress up a little
and its components can be worn separately with other items in your holiday
wardrobe. Also, with the addition of the Budd evening shirt, a corded silk
black bow tie and a pair of patent pumps, it will convert into an acceptable
tropical dinner jacket.
Designer Paul Smith has a three-button, single-breasted version that
manages, in true Smith fashion, to look both classic and contemporary. More
conventional tastes could invest in his khaki cotton version or an even more
traditional model in olive, buff or navy from Hackett, although neither of
these could be transformed into black tie.
When it comes to beachwear, I am rather tired of seeing Englishmen lolloping
about in baggy shorts. I feel that surfing jams look best on those for whom
they were originally intended. Opt instead for a pair of well-designed
classic swimming trunks.
Speedo have good styles including a model made in a special sleek
lightweight fabric developed for professional swimmers. Look out, too, for
designs by the Los Angeles Sporting Club at branches of Sports Locker. Black
or darkest navy blue, remain the smartest colour choice. Remember, white is
for exhibitionists only as it becomes transparent when wet.
The beach look is completed with a cotton singlet available in a selection
of muted hues from Voyage. This year's most trendy holiday garment is a
Kikoi from Kenya, which works as a wrap, towel, mat and, for some men,
tropical night wear.
When choosing footwear, espadrilles are de rigueur. Both Ralph Lauren and
Dries van Noten have attractive designer versions, but you are probably best
buying them on location.
You should also include a couple of pairs of Superga Originali plimsolls, in
navy, white or ecru, a washable deck shoe by Dexter, a pair of the lightest
canvas desert boots from Fratelli Rossetti and a pair of formal light-brown
lace-up shoes. I am particularly impressed with John Lobb Oxfords at Kurt
Geiger, which are elegant and light. If you want to wear sandals, Paul Smith
has a handsome classic design in brown or black leather.
A cotton sweater is a must for cool evenings - and there is little to beat
Marion Foale's classic, understated and beautifully-made knitwear. The look
would be completed by a fold-up, wide-brimmed, panama from Herbert Johnson,
a couple of silk ties from Turnbull &amp; Asser and sunglasses from the Paul
Smith range. With these purchases you will have a holiday wardrobe that,
although classic in inspiration, will be modern, practical and stylish. Bon
voyage.

FT  25 JUN 94 / As They Say in Europe: Passion that eludes the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last weekend La Gazzetta Sportiva said: 'E non si puo neppure imprecare alla
sfortuna' (one cannot even blame misfortune). This observation on the defeat
at the hands, or feet, of Ireland in the World Cup, could have been taken
from a barely-known opera by Puccini which I have unearthed - Il Fanciullo
del Ouest (The Boy of the Golden West).
The hero, Chicherino, sings this sad aria, E non si puo, having been forced
to emigrate and take up American football after scoring a last-minute own
goal in a European cup match against Lammermoor United. He was also rejected
by his beloved Calcia. She sings L'Italia sprofonda nel grigiore (Italy
plunged in gloom - quoted on page 3 of Sportiva) when he scores an historic
touchdown in the Superbowl a year later.
But not all Italy was plunged in gloom at the defeat. For the opponents of
Silvio Berlusconi, the country's new leader, there was covert rejoicing.
Berlusconi owns AC Milan and their players constitute the largest element in
the Italian team. La Repubblica headlined the surprise defeat: 'Italy, in
the shape of Milan, beaten.'
So, Ireland, in the shape of England, won; nine of the team were born in
places such as Ealing, a London suburb.
There was one other country which enjoyed a startling victory last weekend -
Romania. That again was an odd case of foreigners, at least a sort of
foreigner, playing a crucial role. In the match against Colombia, which
brought tears of admiration, there was a wondrous goal by Gheorghe Hagi. The
commentators spent much of the rest of the game arguing as to whether he
could have meant it. (He did because he had done it before.)
Hagi turns out to be an Aromanian, a small group from Macedonia which speaks
an odd form of Romanian. He is a man of few words in that language, just
saying: 'Keep your fingers crossed,' to the mass circulation Evenimentul
Zilei in its attempt to extract an interview.
Romania's other goals were scored by Florin Raducioiu, who was positively
prolix by comparison, observing that the 3-1 victory was compensation for
having kept his compatriots up all night. The Bucharest fiesta began at
around four in the morning local time, the first occasion for national
rejoicing since Mr and Mrs Ceausescu were shot on Christmas Day, 1989.
Evenimentul carried an even more unusual World Cup story. In the middle of
the small knot of Romanian supporters at the Pasadena Rose Bowl was an
emotional Dutch woman waving their national flag. Asked what she was doing
there, she replied: 'I am Astrid, wife of Raducioiu,' which sounds
suspiciously like something stolen from a Dutch-Romanian phrase book. The
star striker had, it emerged, secretly married her three days before.
There has been Europe-wide speculation as to whether the host nation will
become interested in what the rest of the world calls football. The
consensus is that it will not - and that is no bad thing.
No one liked the opening ceremony. La Stampa was the most favourable, saying
it was 'simple, fast and cheap'. Another Italian paper, Tuttosport, said the
only good thing was that it was short, while Sport in Spain said the contest
opened with a 'grey, grim and short celebration'.
A French paper, La Nouvelle Republique du Centre-Ouest, pondered how a
country that had exported its culture to the rest of the world, and was
largely made up of European immigrants, had remained closed to football.
'America loves violent sports and high scores. It hates drawn games. It
prefers by far the organised progression towards the opposing goal to a
subtle combination made up of fantasy and improvisation . . . Perhaps
passions are not as universal as one would like to think.'
Soccer could become a mass sport in the US if the game abandoned the offside
rule, doubled the size of the goal, stopped every five minutes for bogus
reasons and employed teams made up of genetic curiosities. It would not be
soccer but it would appeal to TV networks and advertisers. For they will
never accept the game of football as it is known to the rest of the world.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Scrapyard with a taste for chips
 -Clive Fewins visits a recycling business with a difference in Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are alarms on all the doors and windows of Bob Howes' 40ft high
warehouse in the Aston district of Birmingham. But that did not stop thieves
from breaking in through the roof of the 8,500 sq ft building and stealing
Pounds 20,000 of precious metals.
'As the metals were uninsured and most had come from scrap printed-circuit
boards I suppose you could say the chips are down,' said Howes, whose
'computer graveyard' is one of the biggest recycling operations of its kind
in the UK.
At any time there are up to 150 scrap minisystems and small mainframe
computers, plus a handful of personal computers, awaiting the attention of
Howes and his three staff. Howes buys the scrapped computers and recycles
the precious metals they contain, as well as some of the re-usable parts.
'You could call it a low-tech business. We simply use reversible drills,
chisels and the good old hammer,' said Howes, 47.
The company, Elkarbor, may be low-tech but it is a high-volume operation,
with a turnover of Pounds 300,000. Last year, Howes and his wife, Pauline,
who is co-director, turned in a profit of just under Pounds 40,000 - one of
the better years for a business that can fluctuate wildly.
'Because it is a rather up-and-down business run on tight margins the bad
patches, when they come, can be very bad,' Howes said. 'A big robbery was
the last thing we wanted at a time like this. The last six months have been
particularly poor. After the robbery in May I shall be surprised if we make
a profit at all this year.'
He felt that, in a recession, it was his experience that scrap metal
companies were often among the last to be hit. 'When companies are closing
down all around you there is money to be made by going round metal
auctions,' he said. 'But now there are not so many companies around - and
those that are still in existence are carrying less stock and making sure
they have less surplus to get rid of.
'Early on in the present recession, when I realised that the flow of
precious metal scrap was diminishing, I started going to auctions to buy in
more common metals for recycling. This helped cushion the immediate effects
of the recession.' 'But,' he adds, 'now there are fewer auctions.'
Howes' warehouse rings with the sound of a minicomputer cabinet being
knocked away from its contents. While the cabinet is treated as normal scrap
the electronic components are removed carefully. Items such as drives and
transformers are put aside for the specialist disposal merchants who visit
to view and buy. Computer backplates, with their gold-plated areas, and
chips, often coated in precious metals, are kept separately.
'This bit is what I call the recovery service,' said Howes. 'Some of these
materials are worth Pounds 70-Pounds 90 a kilo. It takes a lot of experience
to estimate the gold content of scrap, but we usually have a good idea.
'Quite often we have an assay done on a sample of the material so the person
we are buying from knows the precise value of the gold in the scrap
computer. In this business you soon learn that all that glisters is not
gold.
'In most mini-systems and mainframe machines there is also usually silver,
paladium, and trace metals such as nickel, lead, tin, and copper from the
solder. They are all worth recycling. Tantalum can also be found in the
capacitors.
'Generally we process surface-plated gold, and the rest of the material is
sent off-site to be granulated.' This means it is chopped into small pieces
and heated to form a low- grade bullion bar. This might then be reprocessed,
or the gold removed and refined.
As well as recycling computers Elkarbor dismantles telephone exchanges,
usually for companies updating equipment.
Elkarbor is often contacted by a local broker or scrap metal merchant -
unless it hears about a job over the grapevine, 'which frequently happens',
says Howes.
'Precious metal recycling is a complicated field, in which you need a lot of
experience and a good knowledge of the trade. I often feel I am not really
geared to this business as I started life doing something else - as a
metallurgist working in steel rollmaking factories here and in Sheffield.
'Sometimes I feel I am too honest and not suited to it simply because I am
happy just making a living, and not going all-out for a big profit.'
Howes described some of the problems he encountered in 1986: 'I was four
years into the business, having started up from home in 1982. In some
instances I was putting up to Pounds 10,000 up front, only to find the
material I bought-in was worth less than I had anticipated. In three
instances the job was recovering copper and other precious metals from
cable. As the value of the metals was lower than had been indicated we
rolled the jobs over, in effect granting credit to three companies to the
value of Pounds 7,000 to Pounds 10,000 each. All three companies went bump
within a few months of each other.'
Howes survived. And he learned a few lessons. Nowadays he puts up only 70
per cent of what customers expect.
Howes says: 'However careful you are this is a business that survives on
trust. Customers trust me to take away their materials and weigh them
honestly when it comes to calculating the value of the metals to be
recovered. I respect this.'
To ensure that the new trading year is better than the current one, Howes
has two schemes in mind. The first is putting far greater emphasis on chip
recovery and the second is expanding into Europe.
'We can now separate chips by their number, their manufacturer and their
speed, and we can do this fast enough to make it profitable,' says Howes.
'We have built up a small network of customers who will ring us up for
anything from 50 to several thousand of a particular kind of chip. We charge
anything from 20p upwards for a chip and the more we can segregate and
identify particular makes and types of chip the better price we can get for
them. This is a growth area at present, so we might expand this process
ourselves, or we might merge with people I know in the trade. It depends.'
Howes has already organised brokers to bring scrap machines to him from all
over the UK and Elkarbor has carried out three successful jobs in Europe.
'We have made money out of these jobs and everybody seems happy,' he said.

My shares are held by nominees (Barclayshare) and, in view of the recent
reinstatement of indexation on capital losses, I wish to achieve some major
bed and breakfast deals. This can be done at a lower cost through one of the
brokers listed in a recent (March 12) Weekend FT article.
Is this permissible and valid (share certificates are not required) or must
I use the more expensive nominee brokers?
As it is not necessary to present the share certificates on bed and
breakfast deals, in our opinion you can use any broker you wish. (Answer by

To reduce the plethora of paperwork created by privatisation, I wish to
rationalise my family's portfolios.
Specifically, I wish to arrange a variety of transfers to consolidate
holdings within my family.
Where do I find information regarding any implications for income and, more
specifically, capital gains tax? Inland Revenue literature seems
unforthcoming.
The Revenue does produce a booklet concerning lifetime gifts which deals
with the inheritance tax implication of such transfers, and it also produces
a booklet (CGT 14) which touches on CGT matters arising from gifts.
The latest edition of the Allied Dunbar Tax Guide contains several
references to the income and CGT implications of gifting, particularly to
children.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax officer's misconduct
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The combined total of my retirement and occupational pensions are below the
amount necessary to absorb my personal allowance. I am, therefore, entitled
to a refund of tax on my investment income.
Due to an admitted oversight in the local tax office, I did not receive a
refund for 1992/93 until January this year. In the Revenue's letter of
apology, it was written: 'I have arranged for a tax return to be issued to
you shortly after Easter this year.
'When completed, you should forward your dividend vouchers with the return
so that any refund due to you for the current year can be settled quickly
and avoid the problems that have arisen to date.'
My return was duly received just after Easter and submitted - together with
a claim for repayment of tax, my dividend counterfoils and March pay slip -
on April 11.
But I was advised by the county council, my previous employer, that it would
not be issuing P60 forms until mid-May, although I am not aware of any
information on the P60 which was not on the March pay slip.
I am now told by the Revenue that it is their practice to accept form P60
and that no repayment of tax can be made to me until the form is received.
Is there any statutory authority by which the Revenue is entitled to
withhold repayment of tax, or is it simply an arbitrary decision?
No, the tax officer who refused to process your claim in April acted
unlawfully and will doubtless be severely reprimanded by the district
inspector.
Write a formal letter of complaint to the district inspector (whose name
should be printed on the letterhead of the tax office), marking both your
letter and the envelope 'For the attention of the district inspector.'
As you have been the victim of maladministration for two consecutive years,
the inspector undoubtedly will add at least Pounds 100 to your delayed
1993-94 refund by way of token compensation for the persistent misconduct of
his staff.
At the same time, you could ask the inspector for a copy of the free leaflet
IR 120 (You and the Inland Revenue), and also ask him to arrange for you to
receive refunds by instalments during 1994-95 and future years so that you
do not have to wait until after the end of each tax year before you get any
money back.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Tough line on Tessas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BAYLISS,  Moneyfacts
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) were launched in January
1991, they were intended to be straightforward accounts which could be
transferred from one building society or bank to another.
Tessas are now in their fourth year and the situation is changing. While
rates generally have fallen in line with base rates, those of the societies
have held up better than banks. Rates from many banks are now down to
between 4 and 5 per cent while those offered by societies are between 6 and
7 per cent.
Maturity bonuses, which were introduced to encourage investors to stay with
the same institution, have not been repeated in subsequent Tessa issues. And
many of the top-paying accounts will not accept transfers of Tessas due to
administration costs and a desire to keep the Tessas for their full
five-year term.
Higher-paying Tessas also tend to require larger opening balances. They
demand the maximum permitted investment each year and, sometimes, a feeder
account.
Under this system, the investor must not only deposit an initial Pounds
3,000 into the Tessa in the first year but must also put a further sum into
the feeder account, from which transfers are made into the Tessa each year.
This is fine as long as the feeder account pays good rates to compensate for
the loss of access to funds.
Confederation Bank's Tessa, which is fixed at 8 per cent for the term, also
pays 8 per cent fixed on the feeder account. But the Market Harborough
society requires Pounds 9,000 to be deposited up front; and while it pays a
variable rate of 7.6 per cent on its Tessa, it offers only 6.25 per cent
(variable) on its feeder. Even this is tiered, and drops to only 1.5 per
cent when the balance fall below Pounds 2,400.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Your CGT allowances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold in
May. Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for the month in
which you bought it.
Subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale; the balance will be your
taxable gain or loss.
Suppose you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold them
in May 1994 for Pounds 14,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
September 1985 figure of 1.516 gives a total of Pounds 9,096. Subtracting
that from Pounds 14,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 4,904, which is
within the CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800.
If selling shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982
figure. The RPI in May was 144.7.
The Budget decision that indexation cannot be used to create or increase
losses for shares sold after November 29 1993 has been modified for Pounds
10,000 of transitional relief.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Where discipline rules and mavericks
are out - Schroders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seeing how other people manage money helps you to manage your own better.
That is the theory behind our new series by Joanna Slaughter on private
client investment managers.
To get the most from the series, you should note carefully what the managers
do and what they avoid. As professionals, most of them invest according to a
definite system. They will, for instance, have a method for deciding on
overall asset allocation - which countries and which types of shares. And
they will have another for picking individual shares. They do not rely on
hunches or insider information.
Over the next few weeks, we will be talking to a selection of firms in the
City of London.
This week: Schroders.
There are no maverick managers at Schroders, according to John Henderson. He
is managing director of Schroder Personal Investment Management (SPIM), the
private client arm of the merchant banking and investment management group.
'This is a very disciplined and conservative house,' adds Henderson, who
describes its style as 'research-driven, low turnover, international.' He
adds: 'All the investment managers follow the Schroder house view. They have
the opportunity to feed in their thoughts as to the relative attractions of
a sector but, once the committees have decided the direction Schroders
should go, everyone follows.'
Take last year, when Schroders decided to reduce its Pacific rim investments
and increase its exposure in Japan. The shift in asset allocation was
reflected in every Schroder portfolio; only the percentage weightings varied
to reflect a client's particular requirements.
Schroders has 383 managers and analysts world-wide, and 1,000 investment
staff. 'With 35 offices in 27 countries, l would suggest that we are the
most international of the merchant banks,' says Henderson. This
international dimension no doubt owes something to the philosophy of the
company's founder, John Henry Schroder, who moved to London from Hamburg in
1804.
The bank made its first investment in Japan in 1870 and established a New
York presence in 1923. Today, more than half Schroders' 3,900 staff, and 50
per cent of its operating capital, are employed in offices overseas. SPIM
manages portfolios in 10 currencies, tracking many different benchmarks, and
Henderson describes the growth in overseas clients as 'spectacular'.
The team approach is central to the company's management of private client
money. Each client is looked after by three managers - an investment
director, an investment manager and an administrator - who decide overall
investment strategy and diversification. Long-term strategy is determined by
the senior directors, advised by the Schroder economists and the heads of
regional equity and fixed interest teams, while tactical asset allocation is
the preserve of a specialist team.
Present portfolio weightings are gilts, bonds, and cash (14 per cent); UK
equities (55 per cent); North America (4 per cent); Japan (10 per cent);
other Far East markets (5.5 per cent); continental Europe (7.5 per cent) and
emerging markets (4 per cent).
Stock selection is delegated to other specialists and there is a selected
equity list of 186 shares. Any stock not on this list is on trial. Henderson
says: 'Investment managers know that if they want to invest in something
that is not on the SEL, their necks are on the block.'
Certainly, managers who do not provide performance for private clients
appear to have no hiding place. The three executive directors of SPIM review
individual portfolio diversifications at least each quarter and monitor the
comparative performances.
Schroders has been managing private client money since the turn of the
century and it still looks after the descendants of its first customers.
Henderson describes the company as 'a family bank' where 'people stay and
clients form a relationship with an investment management team that can last
for generations'.
Solicitors and accountants are the source of 80 per cent of all new clients,
and Henderson is used to fighting the firm's corner in fiercely-contested
beauty parades. Last year, Schroders won 106 new private clients and lost
one - a Swiss, who was unhappy with the house emphasis on equities.
Henderson says: 'If we do a good job for the client of a solicitor, he will
put us in the beauty parade when another client comes along. We are never
handed anything on a plate. It is a jungle out there.'
Even the Schroder name does not necessarily open doors. 'Most people think
we are a German kitchen manufacturer,' Henderson notes.
Clients' annual fees are based on the size of their portfolios and the
complexity of their demands. Henderson points out: 'We have the best
incentive to make the portfolio perform well, and to minimise risk. We have
no conflict of interest.'
Although Schroders has a large derivatives team, it uses only currency
hedges for private clients. Henderson says: 'We very rarely hedge out of the
base currency of the portfolio, and we have no currency hedges outstanding
at the moment for our sterling clients. We want to stick to what we have a
record of doing well, which is fundamental investment management and
fundamental sector research.'
An initial Pounds 100,000 is needed to become a Schroder private client, and
individual client money ranges from this minimum figure to Pounds 100m. It
is something of a surprise, therefore, to learn that nearly all clients
invest to some extent in Schroders' own products.
'We have portfolios of Pounds 20m invested entirely in our unit trusts,'
says Henderson.' There is often a misconception among the public that unit
trusts are only for the smaller investor - and, of course, a unit trust does
not have the same excitement at the golf club as a portfolio of shares. Yet,
the bigger the client, the bigger the tax and administrative benefits of a
unit trust.'
The core unit trust for private clients is the Pounds 60m Schroder World
fund, which is open also to any non-client with Pounds 1,000 to invest. The
fund, which has 280 stocks in its portfolio and is used for all private
clients with less than Pounds 500,000, produced a return of more than 30 per
cent last year, and its geographical diversification makes it a shop window
for the firm's investment skills.
A 'cocktail' of Schroder unit trusts is constructed for those with assets of
more than Pounds 500,000. Direct equity investment usually is confined to
clients with more than Pounds 2m.
The Schroder view is that portfolios should include at least 25 stocks in
each market sector, and Henderson argues that the risk of a direct equity
investment is too high for any investor with less than Pounds 2m. 'It
doesn't give any scope to trim the holding and it restricts the flexibility
of the manager, so clients do not get the added value that Schroders should
be able to bring.'
Liquidity in clients' portfolios is low but managed actively. Henderson
explains: 'Because we are long-term, cautious and conservative investors, if
a client needs funds in the next two years, we will raise the money today
and hold it in low coupon, short-dated gilts.
'We will always have at least 10 per cent of the portfolio at 24 hours'
notice. Nothing is locked in for longer than one month unless the client has
sanctioned us to invest in venture capital.'
Prospective private clients certainly need to be convinced of the Schroder
investment pedigree because they may be asked to liquidate their existing
portfolios so the firm's investment managers can start with a clean sheet,
especially if the unit trust route is to be followed.
Henderson concedes that this is a tough requirement. 'Liquidation
crystallises capital gains for taxpayers, and there is no way round that.
But we would urge clients to do it, for it will enable us to hold the things
in the portfolio that we like. The client has to decide whether it is worth
taking the initial hit for the benefits that Schroders can bring.'

FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: The acceptable face of insurance -
Anthony Bailey finds that an industry hit by bad publicity has its good
points, too
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a danger that bad publicity surrounding the life insurance industry
will deter consumers from buying much-needed products. The most basic of
these is life insurance, although it goes under less obvious names such as
'term' and 'protection-only' insurance.
The problem is that life insurance has strayed far from its roots. Much of
the premium income earned by life companies does not pay for insurance but,
instead, is invested to produce a return. Yet, policies which avoid any link
with investment can be basic tools of financial planning. 'The most obvious
area for life insurance is to provide protection. We give the cheapest and
best organised term insurance in the world,' says Peter Smith, of financial
adviser Hill Martin.
Term or protection-only cover is essential for anyone whose death would
leave dependents worse off. That usually means the main earner, but it can
be worth buying cover for a non-working spouse as well if his or her death
would mean extra expenses for such things as child care.
There is a range of policies on the market which pay out lump sums or fixed
incomes or can be used for increasing incomes. A competent adviser should be
able to suggest the most suitable. Short-term policies can be used in
conjunction with inheritance tax planning.
Mortgage protection policies are a variation on the lump sum theme. Designed
to settle an outstanding repayment mortgage, the level of cover decreases as
the outstanding capital diminishes. This can make them especially good
value.
Critical illness cover is a relatively recent development which might appeal
even to those without dependents. It works in much the same way as term
insurance - with the crucial difference that it will pay out before you die
if you get a specified serious illness.
Permanent health insurance also pays out while you are alive. The payment
comes as income and is not restricted to serious illnesses. It is a form of
sick pay, and should be considered by the self-employed and those who work
for an employer with a niggardly sick pay scheme.
Getting advice on the best policy, however, is more important than with some
other life products. You have to make sure you get a policy which starts
paying out when you will need the money as there are different deferment
times - the first period of an illness when nothing is paid. You also need
to watch out for exclusions.
Private medical insurance is another area where life companies have become
more active in recent years. Bupa (the British United Provident Association)
is generally synonymous with this type of insurance and remains the market
leader. These days, though, there is a wide choice of policy and premium,
from budget cover (to beat National Health Service waiting lists) to
Rolls-Royce cover (which pays for most things, including stays in exclusive
private hospitals).
What about those policies which provide investment? The illogical
combination of investment with insurance has evolved for two reasons:
Tax relief on premiums, coupled with taxation of a life fund's investment
returns (especially in qualifying policies) did provide a degree of tax
efficiency - although mostly for higher-rate taxpayers. But premium tax
relief was abolished 10 years ago. Meanwhile, Peps and Tessas now give
better ways of sheltering returns from tax.
Life companies believe that policies which pay out only on death are hard to
sell. Investment-linked insurance promises a return even if people survive.
But life company claims that they ensure people get life cover by selling
them investment plans are, largely, specious.
Even where there is significant life cover, as with endowments linked to
mortgages, many people surrender policies early. And many policies have
minimal life cover, providing instead long-term, inflexible and
tax-inefficient savings schemes.
Unfortunately, there are no serious plans to decouple insurance and
investment. So, life company promises to clean up their act and ensure sales
staff are better trained in future look hollow. They will still sell
products unsuitable for most people.
Are there ever good reasons to link investment with insurance? Smith is hard
put to find them. He suggests that, in some cases, it can be used in
inheritance tax planning, while the smoothing effect of with-profits
policies might appeal to investors who, otherwise, would not be able to
sleep at night.
'Favourable tax treatment within the fund may make single premium bonds
tax-efficient for those who pay higher-rate tax and capital gains,' Smith
adds. 'But such people usually have substantial assets, are more likely to
want a conventional portfolio, and can make use of other tax shelters.'
Two products are highlighted as possible buys by James Higgins, of adviser
Chamberlain de Broe. 'A few companies offer insurance bond shells into which
investors can put their own portfolio of investments,' he says. 'The
internal taxation of the bonds can be favourable, but the charges levied by
the companies make them suitable only for people with very substantial
portfolios.'
For the same reason, Higgins says there could be a case for substantial
investors to pay into a regular-premium maximum investment plan,
particularly as a precaution against future increases in personal taxation.
'But, for most people - including most higher-rate taxpayers  - insurance
bonds are a bad idea. They should look at Peps, unit trusts, investment
trusts and National Savings instead,' Higgins adds.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: The right to be informed - Diary of
a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Share dealing in the UK is under close scrutiny. In February, the Securities
and Investments Board (SIB), the industry's watchdog, issued a discussion
paper on 'Regulation of the United Kingdom Equities Market'. The deadline
for submissions has just ended.
The paper noted: 'There is analysis which suggests that retail dealing costs
are high when compared with institutional dealing costs and are also high
when compared with retail dealing costs in other European equity markets.'
Early this month, it was announced that the Office of Fair Trading had begun
an investigation into market-making in shares on the London Stock Exchange.
It remains to be seen if either inquiry benefits private investors. But one
section of the SIB paper dealt with 'well informed markets' and commented:
'Market regulation should aim to enable market participants and users to be
well informed for the purposes of making their trading conditions.'
As private investors pay more than institutional investors to deal in
shares, surely they should be treated better when it comes to getting
information from companies. At present, institutions are allowed swifter
access to information (and given more of it) than private investors.
There is, for instance, the matter of annual general meetings. Far too many
start at highly inconvenient times - such as 9.30am in London or 10.30am in
Glasgow. This means that many private investors cannot attend unless they
are willing to spend money on setting off the previous day from their
distant homes and staying overnight.
Unless there are good reasons for holding early-morning AGMs (and I cannot
think of any), they should start no earlier than 11am.
The timing of certain comments and announcements also leaves much to be
desired. If, for instance, a company's directors wish to discuss their
results with analysts on the day of an AGM, this should not happen before
the meeting and/or the release to teletext services of the chairman's AGM
statement.
For that matter, many companies do not make enough use of teletext on BBC 2
and Channel 4. Any major announcement by a company to the stock exchange
should go to teletext simultaneously.
I would also like very much to see a ban on companies making non-urgent
announcements to the stock exchange at times - such as Friday afternoons
before bank holidays - when press coverage of them is likely to be limited.
The same goes for companies which announce poor results. These should have
the widest possible publicity. So, why are companies allowed to publish them
on a Friday afternoon or (worse still) on Christmas or new year's eve?
Institutional investors get the facts almost immediately via their trading
screens. But the poor private investor could well have to wait several days
before a press report appears.
Indeed, companies should be forced to send all shareholders (by first class
post) full details of any 'bad news' results at the same time they are
delivered to the stock exchange.
Then there is Crest, the proposed new share settlement system, and the moves
to rolling settlement within a strictly limited time. These will force many
more private investors to use nominee services.
As a result, company reports and circulars will go straight to the nominee
rather than private investors. Anyone using such a service should have the
right to demand that listed companies send such reports and documents direct
to investors - and at no extra cost.
SIB's discussion paper said: 'To a greater extent than in the case of any
other national securities exchange, trading on the London Stock Exchange is
dominated by institutional, large size dealing . . .' Perhaps if some (or
all) of the above suggestions were implemented, the situation might improve
for private investors.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: 3i floats as others founder - John
Gapper analyses the prospects of a venture that is looking to the long term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like a large ocean liner sailing calmly onwards while smaller vessels
founder in increasingly choppy seas, 3i announced the terms of its
long-promised flotation this week. Despite heavy falls in the London market,
the bank-owned venture capital company refused to be diverted.
Retail investors are to be offered up to Pounds 178m of equity from its
Pounds 711m flotation at 272p a share. The company and its advisers are not
too worried about whether they take it up, since the institutional funds
which are buying the other Pounds 533m are prepared to soak up any excess.
It was difficult to find too many sceptics about the value of the 3i offer
this week. The company, which is the largest European investor in unquoted
companies, has attracted a lot of interest from professional investors.
The shares were priced at a 13.5 per cent discount to net assets. This is a
little more expensive than other quoted investment trusts, the sector it is
joining for tax reasons, but advisers say its portfolio is worth more than
others because of its bias towards smaller, unlisted UK companies.
Since institutional funds bid for Pounds 1.2bn at the offer price after
being canvassed on a range of prices, 3i's advisers are confident of a good
'after-market' in the shares. In other words, they are expecting at least an
initial rise above the offer price when dealing starts on Monday July 18.
The institutional funds have been attracted by several aspects of 3i:
Because it is so large, with a market capitalisation of Pounds 1.58bn at the
offer price, it is likely to enter the FTSE 100 (Footsie) index later this
year. This gives it an automatic appeal, because most funds need to have 3i
shares to give them a weighted holding of the index.
3i's range of investments in 3,500 small and medium-sized unquoted companies
gives investors a rare chance to make an indirect investment in the sector,
which tends to outperform the overall growth rate as the economy recovers.
The company appears to be managed effectively and, unlike the seven high
street banks which have owned it until now, has not made any significant
lending blunders.
These factors have helped to attract significant interest among the more
affluent individual investors (whom 3i's advisers have dubbed 'Jeremies' in
contrast to the more down-market Sid who was targeted for the British Gas
privatisation). Some 385,000 individuals pre-registered for details of the
offer.
Unlike BG and other utility privatisations, though, 3i does not offer the
same possibilities for making a quick profit. 'This is not a stagging
issue,' says one analyst.
Ewen Macpherson, 3i's chief executive, adds: 'We are looking for investors
who know what they are doing and are buying for the long term.'
In its Pounds 2m marketing push, 3i targeted people who would hold shares as
part of a portfolio. The 'Jeremies' it seeks will have to spend at least
Pounds 1,020 on a 3i stake - the value of the 375 shares which have been set
as the minimum investment - but the company has estimated there are 1m such
investors.
Arguing that an investor in the UK small company sector is taking no risk
might seem odd, given the wave of small company failures early in the 1990s.
Yet, 3i's risk is less than might appear, given the spread of its
investments across regions and industrial sectors.
Academic studies have found that 3i's portfolio is less volatile than any
individual industrial sector or quoted company. Nonetheless, the gearing
effect - under which small companies perform better than the average in
recoveries and worse in recessions - should be taken into account.
One analyst argues that there are two possible approaches to 3i for an
individual investor. One is to treat the shares as a long-term investment
through rough and smooth. A more adventurous one is to buy in recovery and
try to sell at the point when an economic downturn is about to strike.
The implication of either approach is that 3i is floating at a good time for
investors. The biggest gains from economic recovery are past - but 3i points
out, in its note on prospects, that the health of its British portfolio 'has
stead-ily improved in the past year', a trend which is continuing.
Share applications are available from Lloyds Bank, the registrar, and must
be submitted by July 6. The allocations of shares will be announced on July
8, and share certificates will be sent on July 15.
This week's other new issue, Eurodollar, is examined in UK Company News.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family (Pensions): Better - but not ideal /
A look at this week's White Paper on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most consumers, the government's package is a good deal. From April
1997, when the laws come into effect, company pensions will be more secure
and personal pensions will be more attractive. But the regulatory regime is
not as rigorous as the system proposed by the Goode report.
Here, we look at what the government has in mind.
COMPANY SCHEMES Is my pension more secure?
Yes. A series of checks and balances will ensure that employers, trustees
and the professionals involved in the scheme do their legally defined job.
Will the law be enforced properly?
Not necessarily. Goode's proposals for a pro-active, independent
super-regulator have been weakened seriously. Instead, the regulator will be
a last resort. Moreover, instead of receiving independent funding from the
government, he will be funded by the very schemes he is supposed to police.
Will the value of my pension change?
Yes. The good news is that pensions must increase each year in line with
inflation (capped at 5 per cent). But this will apply only to benefits built
up from the date the law comes into effect.
The deferred pensions of early leavers - ie, the benefits left behind when
an employee changes jobs - will be reduced in some cases because the new law
will sever the link between occupational schemes and the state
earnings-related pension scheme (Serps).
Most company schemes that link pensions to salaries contract the entire
scheme membership out of Serps and pay reduced National Insurance
contributions. To qualify for this, they must provide a replacement pension
at least as good as Serps.
This 'guaranteed minimum pension' (GMP) normally must increase in line with
earnings inflation or 7 per cent a year for early leavers who have deferred
pensions.
After April 1997, schemes contracted out of Serps will no longer have to
provide that guarantee. Instead, they must increase all of the deferred
pension by price inflation capped at 5 per cent. Where the GMP is a
significant proportion of total pension, this will reduce the overall level
of inflation proofing.
How are transfer values affected?
The law will allow schemes to calculate transfer values for younger members
on a less favourable basis, so they could get less than at present.
Will I get my pension if my employer goes bust?
Yes, but it could be reduced. The government has adopted most of Goode's
proposals for a minimum solvency standard to ensure that, if the scheme
terminates, there will be sufficient assets to pay members a transfer value
and to secure payment of existing pensions. Bear in mind, however, that the
calculation of transfer values for younger members will result in lower
payouts.
Will I receive full compensation in the event of fraud or theft?
Not necessarily. The compensation fund will bring the fund up to 90 per cent
of the solvency level, but this may not equate to 90 per cent of your full
benefits.
Will I have a greater say in running my scheme?
Yes, but not as much as Goode recommended. Members of all types of scheme
will be able to elect at least one-third of the trustees. Goode wanted
two-thirds for schemes where the investment risk falls on the individual.
Will I get better information?
Yes but it is up to you to complain if you do not understand.
Will there be better ways to resolve disputes?
Yes. You should take the initiative and complain to the regulator if your
company's disputes system is ineffective.
Caveat emptor: Alan Pickering, a consultant with actuary Watsons, says the
regulatory regime will not be as rigorous as that proposed by Goode. 'Scheme
members must take more trouble with their pension arrangements than they do
now,' he stresses. 'A lot is at stake. It is in members' interests to
understand their benefits and to watch out for any warning signs.'
PERSONAL PENSIONS
There are two major changes here: age-related rebates and flexibility on the
timing of the annuity purchase.
Who will benefit from age-related rebates?
At the moment, the rebate of NI contributions for employees who opt out of
Serps is a flat rate, apart from a small bonus for employees age-30 and
over.
The value of the Serps benefits increases with age, so at present, the
rebate is good value for younger employees. For older employees, Serps is
better.
Age-related rebates will certainly improve the terms for older employees but
may reduce the terms for younger employees.
Why do we need flexibility in the timing of the annuity purchase?
At present, you must buy your annuity immediately on retirement. Annuity
rates, based on gilt yields, fluctuate dramatically. If you buy at the wrong
time, your income could be reduced by as much as 30 per cent.
After April 1997, you will be able to delay the purchase until up to age-75
and, in the meantime, draw down an appropriate annual income from your
pension fund. The remainder of the fund will continue to benefit from
investment returns.
William Burrows, director of Annuity Direct, says: 'These proposals overcome
the main disadvantage of the present rules which force people to buy
annuities when they retire, even though annuity rates may be very low.
'Until 1997, there are existing opportunities for those who want to defer
the annuity purchase, but you should seek expert advice.'

FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family (Pensions): What's Goode for you . .
. - Last October, a committee set up by the government produced a report
containing 218 recommendations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Maxwell's raids on his group's pension funds forced the government to
review the law intensively to find how to improve protection for scheme
members. In October 1993, professor Roy Goode, chairman of the
government-appointed review committee, produced a 1,000-page Pension Law
Reform Report containing 218 recommendations.
The White Paper published this week set out which of the proposals the
government would adopt in full, which it would water down, and those it
would ditch.
For most scheme members, though, there is one issue on which Goode's
recommendations and the White Paper measures will be judged: namely, to what
extent has the security of pensions been improved?
How do the government's plans accord with the report?
GOODE'S PROPOSALS IN BRIEF . . . A pensions act to enshrine in law the
employer's 'pension promise' and to protect members' benefits earned
already. Adopted.
A pensions regulator to have supreme authority over company pensions with
power to intervene and impose sanctions. Watered down.
A compensation fund to pay out in the case of fraud, theft and
misappropriation of pension fund assets. Adopted.
A minimum solvency standard to ensure that, if the company fails, the fund
has enough assets to meet its liabilities. Adopted.
A system to check that employers have paid their contributions. Adopted.
Greater power for the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS) and the
pensions ombudsman, plus a requirement for employers to set up internal
machinery to deal with disputes over pensions. Adopted.
More power for trustees, who would also be liable to criminal proceedings if
they fail to protect members' rights. Adopted.
A statutory requirement for members to be represented on trustee boards  -
up to one-third for final salary schemes and two-thirds for money purchase
schemes. Watered down.
Greater access by members to information, which should be explained in plain
English. Adopted.
. . . AND IN DETAIL Pensions act and regulator. Goode recommended that trust
law, which separates the pension fund legally from the company's assets,
should continue but should be strengthened by a pensions act administered by
a regulator.
Since trust law is complex and ill-defined, the act would enforce the
'pension promise' - that is, members' basic rights to a pension based on
past service and contributions paid. Employers would be required to make
clear their pension obligations in the contract of employment.
The act would make clear the trustees' primary duties to members and their
families. To enforce it, Goode wanted a regulator with absolute authority
over occupational schemes and power to intervene and impose sanctions on
wrongdoers.
Compensation scheme. Goode recommended that this should cover all
occupational pension schemes with an identifiable fund, including schemes
run by insurance companies. The scheme would not offer protection on an
all-risk basis, though.
Instead, it would pay out in the case of proven fraud, theft and other
misappropriation. Other events, such as bad investment decisions leading to
insolvency, would not trigger compensation.
The compensation itself would take the form of a loan repayable from any
pension fund money recovered, and would be funded by a compulsory post-event
levy on all schemes.
Solvency. Goode said that the level of funding backing the pension promise
was crucial and recommended a minimum solvency standard to secure the
pension rights of members.
The solvency level would be monitored regularly by the trustees and scheme
actuaries. If a fund fell below the minimum, there would have to be an
immediate injection of cash, failing which the trustees would have to
recover the funds from the employer.
Actuaries get very excited about the solvency issue. For scheme members,
however, there is only one point to consider.
Since the compensation scheme would not cover all risks, the fund should -
in the event of an employer going bust - have enough cash to provide
adequate transfer values for present and deferred members, and to buy
annuities to replace the pensions already in payment.
(Deferred members are former employees who have left their pension benefits
behind on changing jobs. Annuities are sold by life offices which, in return
for a lump sum investment, guarantee an agreed income for life).
Member trustees. These are the legal owners of the pension fund and have a
duty to pay the promised benefits to members and their families. Goode
called for more representation for members on trustee boards, except for
very small schemes.
At present, an estimated one-third of schemes appoint trustees solely from
the company's management - a system that can lead to abuse.
Goode recommended that where the investment risk fell on the employer - as
is the case with schemes that link the value of the pension to employees'
final salary - the balance of power should be retained by the employer,
which should have a two-thirds majority on the trustee board.
Where the investment risk fell on the individual - as is the case with money
purchase schemes that offer pensions based purely on investment returns -
the balance of power should be held by scheme members, who would form a
two-thirds majority.
Goode also wanted trustees to have more power over the professionals they
appointed to run the fund. In turn, the latter would have a legal duty to
report any 'serious or persistent irregularities'.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Powerful men with money to burn - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One - often futile - way to prop up flagging paper assets is to allow
powerful men with money to burn to intervene in the marketplace.
Central bankers tried it with the dollar yesterday with limited success.
Earlier in the week, Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch tried it with their
flagship newspapers, slashing cover prices of the Daily Telegraph and The
Times to stimulate circulation.
The likely outcome will be the same in both cases: much money will be spent
but for negligible net gain. Some currencies and newspapers will rise,
others will fall while the men who tried to move the markets will be a lot
poorer.
The currency effect on global markets was dramatic from the opening of
trading on Monday. The dollar weakened rapidly particularly against the yen
and D-Mark. Factors cited ranged from worries about rising US inflation,
worsening US-Japanese trade relations and accelerating growth in Germany.
Bonds in the US and Europe took fright, dragging down equities with them.
The FT-SE 100 index shed a net 146.3 points to end the week at 2,876.6, its
lowest mark since July 26. But few people resorted to ditching their shares.
This was supposed to be the year of the strong dollar, thanks to rising US
interest rates, falling German rates and other favourable economic
conditions. Instead, it has weakened against some currencies as investors
have become nervous about inflation and politics. It is important to bear in
mind, however, that the dollar is now stronger than two years ago on the
more realistic basis of its trade-weighted average.
More turmoil is ahead, though, argue those analysts who see exchange rates
as a key influence of capital markets. SG Warburg's economists believe the
dollar will be driven lower by four factors: the US trade deficit is
deteriorating; US inflation will run ahead of Germany's; the US Federal
Reserve, driven by domestic economic considerations, will not raise interest
rates enough to help the dollar; and doubts are growing about the Clinton
Administration's competence in handling geo-political problems.
Yet not everybody is glued to the currency screens. 'The weakness of the
dollar is a distraction. You shouldn't take any notice of exchange rates,'
says Peter Lyon, global strategist at Smith New Court. They might tell you
something about relative inflation rates but it is much more important to
focus on interest rates.
Policy makers have made some big economic mistakes concentrating on
currencies rather than interest rates, not the least of which for the UK was
its experience in the ERM.
Lyon took comfort this week from the failure of US bond prices to
comprehensively breach the lows they reached a month ago. 'There may be some
sort of light at the end of this tunnel.'
Moreover, sentiment is changing in the UK equity market. He notes that at
the beginning of the year, high optimism was signalled by an historically
high ratio of calls to puts in the derivatives markets.
Now the ratio is historically low, signalling high negativity. Such
sentiment is typical of a selling climax at the bottom of the market. Thus
it also tends to be a good indication of the moment to resume buying.
When will consumers of goods and services start buying more is a question
many companies in the news this week have been asking themselves. Even with
only moderate demand, British Steel was able to report pre-tax profits for
the year to April of Pounds 80m against year-earlier losses of Pounds 149m
after restructuring costs. But to try to bring more rational behaviour to
the marketplace, it is going to take the EU to court over its steel
subsidies.
First Leisure reported disappointing interim pre-tax profits of Pounds
14.1m, up 16 per cent. It is still finding consumers cautious about spending
their income on recreation. Perhaps the public - like Eurotunnel investors
who left one-third of the UK rights issue with underwriters - just want to
spectate rather than participate. Guinness, for example, has reported brisk
stout sales during the World Cup. During the Ireland-Italy game, one pub
pulled five times the number of pints it would in a normal evening.
The corporate calamity of the week was Hazlewood Foods. Its shares fell
sharply after it announced lower profits, production problems at four new
plants and consequently the resignation of the head of its UK operations.
Silentnight's shares fell after it said people were buying fewer beds.
But if the public is not eating and sleeping the way it was, can it be
persuaded to read more newspapers? Rupert Murdoch is convinced it can. Or at
least that he can snatch readers. Since he cut the cover price of The Times
10 months ago, its circulation has risen from 370,000 to 515,000.
Some of those readers have converted from the Daily Telegraph which had
tried to remain aloof. But with the Daily Telegraph's circulation recently
falling below 1m a day for the first time in more than 40 years, Conrad
Black could hold out no longer. He retaliated with his own price cuts.
A few other things were slashed in the process, including The Telegraph's
share price, along with that of United Newspapers, the Daily Mail Trust and
other publishers.
It was the most dramatic moment in The Telegraph's history since Lord
Camrose halved the price to  1/2 p in 1930, an event some Telegraph readers
would still remember.
Murdoch counter-punched by cutting The Times' cover price to 20p. At that
price he needs to sell some 300,000 more a day to break even. It might be
cheaper for him to buy all the extra copies himself. Such market
intervention would cost him personally about Pounds 18.7m a year.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Can watchdog stop another Maxwell? - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two cheers and one hiss for the pensions White Paper. Overall, it is a lot
tougher than expected. Company pensions will be more secure and personal
pensions will be more flexible. So, most people should be able to make
sensible provision for their retirement.
The worry is that the new watchdog might not be tough enough to stop another
Maxwell. (Analysis: page III).
The pension proposals underline, yet again, the conflict between having
total security and getting the best investment returns. Understandably,
given their genesis in the Maxwell pension raids, these proposals give
security top billing. The new solvency rules are calculated on the
assumption that the scheme might be closed tomorrow.
Fair enough. But the cost of this security blanket is that some funds may
produce a lower level of return than they could have done without the new
restrictions.
Those with a high proportion of older members will need to hold a
correspondingly high proportion of gilt-edged stocks, rather than equities.
But, if historic patterns hold true, equities are likely to do much better
than gilts over the long term.
Initial calculations suggest that if pension funds kept their present asset
mix (80 per cent equities/20 per cent bonds), they would provide an annual
return of 17 per cent over 20 years. If they move to a 50/50 split, the
return would drop below 16 per cent.
This calculation is as relevant to your own investments as it is to pension
funds. As a very rough rule of thumb, an individual investing on a
reasonably long-term basis should benefit from investing the majority of his
money in equities. In a real sense, they are the safer choice - if 'safe' is
re-defined as 'likely to produce better returns'.
This counter-intuitive logic can be applied also to overseas investment.
Many people instinctively regard investing in foreign stock markets as
riskier than confining themselves to the UK. But Britain is a mature economy
with only a few growth businesses. The emerging markets story has been
horribly over-hyped.
Yet, the basic argument for an international investment portfolio with at
least some money in emerging markets remains valid. Sticking to the UK is
the global equivalent of keeping your life's savings in a box under the bed.
Will Jeremy have the last laugh? Jeremy is the name given by venture capital
group 3i (see page V) to the private investors who buy its shares. Sid, you
will remember, was the plebian purchaser of British Gas shares.
Jeremy has a better education and more money. And, so far, 385,000 Jeremies
have registered to receive prospectuses for the 3i offer, which closes on
July 6.
This week, some critics argued that Jeremy had more money than sense. What
was he doing buying a new issue when the equity market was collapsing and
lesser issues were being pulled in all directions?
Was he really prepared to buy on a 13 1/2 per cent discount to net assets
when seemingly comparable trusts were trading on more?
Well, perhaps. But there is another way of looking at it. At last, private
investors are learning to look for value, invest for the long term, and buy
near the bottom rather than the top of the market.
Now for something altogether more practical: the BP dividend. Shareholders
are this year being given a novel choice. Do they want to take their
dividend in cash - or would they prefer extra BP shares worth 25 per cent
more than the cash dividend?*
The novelty lies not in the choice, as such, but the fact that shareholders
are being offered the equivalent of the gross (rather than the net)
dividend. BP's 460,000 private shareholders should certainly consider taking
the shares. But there are several caveats.
First, if your shares are held in a personal equity plan, there is no
significant advantage in opting for the share alternative. You need also to
be careful if you are thinking of selling the extra shares - as many
income-orientated investors may.
Conventional stockbrokers have minimum charges ranging from Pounds 9 to as
high as Pounds 40. So, BP shareholders with relatively small holdings will
find that the extra value of the share alternative could be swallowed up by
the costs of realising it.
The way round this is to use Hoare Govett's cheap dealing service, which has
a basic commission of 1 per cent with no minimum. But the hassle factor
means it is probably not worth considering unless you expect to use it more
than once.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Steel's surge makes City beam - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sign over the door of the Plaisterers Hall in the City of London, where
British Steel announces its results twice a year, reads: 'Let brotherly love
prevail.' 'Abandon hope all ye who enter here' might have been more
appropriate until recently.
Not on Monday, though. After cumulative pre-tax losses of Pounds 204m in the
previous two years, the company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 80m for
the year ended April 2.
That in itself was no surprise, falling more or less in the middle of the
Pounds 60m to Pounds 95m range expected by the City. But the company caught
analysts on the hop by raising its final dividend from 1p a share to 1.5p,
making a total payout for the year of 2p, compared with 1p for 1992/93.
It was just what the City needed on a day when words like 'meltdown' or even
that hardy perennial, 'billions wiped off shares', were in the air.
A 5 3/4 p rise in British Steel's shares to 139p was one of the few bright
spots among the predominantly red numbers on the dealing screens.
The shares have since slipped to close at 131p yesterday in a falling
market. Even so, they have recovered healthily from the depths of autumn
1992 when a price of 46.5p made dismal reading for investors who had paid
125p in the 1988 privatisation.
The recovery began when investors realised that the shares represented good
value at that price compared with other steel companies, and also as an
industrial recovery stock. US investors saw a discount in the share price to
the book value, and bought heavily.
In spite of the enthusiastic reception for the latest results, though, it is
hard to make a case for the shares to go much higher - even though some were
recommending them as a 'buy' at 150p. The 1994 peak is 156 1/2 p.
Admittedly, pre-tax profits are likely to be much higher this year. Edward
Hadas, analyst at Swiss Bank Corporation, has raised his forecast from
Pounds 265m to Pounds 290m and says British Steel could make Pounds 430m in
fiscal 1996.
The dividend for the present year could be 3p a share or even 4p, and 5.5p
for the following year.
Achieving that big rise in profits will be down mostly to getting better
prices rather than increasing volumes. Hadas believes British Steel's
average prices could rise by 5 per cent this year. With an improved sales
mix, that would be enough to achieve the predicted rise.
He points out that, in the second half of fiscal 1994, the company's
operating profits were already running at two-thirds of the required rate,
excluding the Pounds 24m provision for the fine imposed by the European
Commission for the company's part in an alleged steel beams cartel.
For its part, British Steel says it has a reasonably good order book and
demand in the UK is rising steadily, although the construction market is
lagging behind the automotive sector.
Importantly, the downturn in the continental European market appears to have
halted.
But all these developments seem to be reflected already in the share price
and Hadas says that, on a prospective price/earnings ratio of about 8 for
fiscal 1996, the present price is 'pretty fair'.
Most analysts now view British Steel as a 'hold' and there are few 'buy'
recommendations. Perhaps the time to do that has passed long since.
Looking beyond the immediate outlook in the steel market, there are both
good and bad signs for investors. On the debit side, it is probably wise not
to expect much from the European Union's heavily-criticised rescue plan for
the steel industry.
Capacity cuts will not in themselves bring financial salvation to the
industry and pledges, in any case, have yet to be implemented.
More positively, the possibility of a Dollars 150m investment in a steel
plate mini-mill in the US will be an important step for British Steel and
show that it is ready and able to look beyond Europe to exploit
opportunities elsewhere.
It remains, too, Europe's low-cost producer par excellence.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Rap for building societies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies were told this week to improve their practices in
relation to mortgage protection policies and to make clearer their written
explanations of the terms for fixed-rate mortgages.
The annual report of the building societies ombudsman scheme described some
documentation relating to fixed rate mortgages as 'sloppy'. On mortgage
protection, it urged societies at least to comply with the code of practice
issued by the Association of British Insurers.
Overall, however, Edell said that the number of complaints the scheme dealt
with fell by just over one-third last year to 901, reflecting a trend of
more grievances being settled by agreement.
He added also that although the number of complaints about mortgages was
rising, there had been a sharp drop in complaints about investments, as
societies had improved their practices in telling customers about the
interest rates in obsolete accounts or in simply moving them out of obsolete
accounts altogether.
From 1 July, the ombudsman will have greater powers, as his remit will
extend to complaints about a society's conduct before a mortgage or
investment is completed, if the transaction then goes through.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: The Telegraph's sharp decline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Telegraph shareholders have seen the value of their holdings decline by
almost half from their peak last month, as the newspaper this week entered a
price war with The Times, cutting its daily cover price to 30p. The Times
responded with a cut to 20p.
Other newspaper groups' shares also suffered. The Stock Exchange has
launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Telegraph's
price cut.
Hollinger, the Canadian publishing company controlled by Telegraph
proprietor Conrad Black sold Pounds 73m-worth of shares a month ago, when
the share price was 587p. Hollinger now owns 57 per cent of The Telegraph,
down from 66 per cent.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Investor Confidence index slips again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pearl Investor Confidence index fell by two points during June,
reversing the trend set by a steep rise in May. The index has now fallen
during five of the six months in 1994 so far.
The index measures how many people think the stock market is likely or very
likely to rise in the next six months to one year.
The index was set at 100 in March 1991, and has now fallen to 88.3.
The highest point since it started was reached at the time of the general
election in 1992. When the June figures are broken down into political
affiliations, they show that confidence fell among all groups except Labour
voters, whose confidence grew by 4 per cent.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Dollar dashes hopes of crisis-free summer - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar returned to plague the stock market again this week, less than
two months after Wall Street traders thought they had put the US currency's
troubles behind them.
It was in early May that the dollar last took centre stage, when its sharp
decline spurred central bank intervention to halt the slide. At the time,
the stock and bond markets both took big hits. Investors sold securities
amid fears that the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates to
protect the dollar. When the Fed did that, and the dollar stabilised, Wall
Street looked forward to a summer free of crises.
Those hopes were dashed this week when another big drop in the US currency's
value - on Tuesday the dollar fell to a post-second world war low against
the yen of less then Y100 - sent stock prices plummeting. Apart from a brief
midweek respite, the Dow Jones industrial average spent the week on the
retreat.
By 10am yesterday, the Dow had fallen 120 points, or 3 per cent, in slightly
more than four days' trading. Although bond prices fared a bit better over
the period - the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond edged slightly higher
from 7.4 per cent at the start of the week to 7.5 per cent early yesterday -
the mood remained nervous, even with encouraging news on inflation.
The reasons for the stock market's decline were relatively straightforward.
While a weaker dollar pushes up import prices, investors were not so much
worried about imported inflation as they were about the possibility that the
Fed would have to raise interest rates again to stop the currency from
falling further.
Although yesterday's intervention by central banks enabled the dollar to
bounce off its overnight lows against the yen and the D-mark, investors
clearly believed the odds on another interest rate increase have rapidly
shortened, judging by their frantic selling of stocks and bonds on Friday
morning.
By 11.30am yesterday, the Dow had fallen more than 50 points, and the
benchmark 30-year bond had dropped one and a quarter points, pushing the
yield above 7.5 per cent.
The fact that stock and bond prices continued to fall while the dollar was
staging a modest recovery suggested that there was something more to the
markets' decline than just currency and interest rate concerns. That
something more was almost certainly earnings; investors have been unnerved
by recent profits warnings from US companies, and with interest rates
apparently heading even higher, the outlook for corporate earnings is
suddenly darkening.
The massacre of technology stocks this week was a good example of how fears
of weakening earnings are undermining confidence in stocks. The rout started
on Tuesday when Lotus Development announced that its second quarter profits
would come in well below analysts' expectations. The news wiped 28 per cent
off the value of Lotus' shares in a single day, and sparked heavy selling
throughout a technology sector already weakened by estimates of slowing
computer orders and sluggish consumer demand.
After a brief recovery on Wednesday, technology stocks fell further as fresh
bad news about a single company (a broker's downgrade of Cisco Systems) sent
shock waves throughout the sector. The declines were most pronounced among
Nasdaq market stocks, and by Thursday's close the Nasdaq composite index had
dropped to its lowest level since last July.
The dollar's fall, the prospect of higher interest rates, the possibility of
a slowdown in earnings growth, and more sudden and sharp sell-offs in the
stock market have all made for a dispiriting start to the summer. As Thomas
Gallagher, managing director of capital commitment at brokerage firm
Oppenheimer, said yesterday: 'People are starting to lose some meaningful
money in stocks and they are getting nervous.'
There are pockets of sunshine amid the gloom, however, most notably in those
sectors where takeover activity is still buoyant. Cable television stocks
remain flavour of the month, thanks to the string of recent deals involving
telecommunications and cable TV companies, and the financials sector has
also been lively.
Holders of Chicago-based financial services group Kemper were particularly
happy this week when, out of the blue, a counter offer to GE Capital's
near-Dollars 3bn takeover bid emerged from Conseco, a little-known insurance
holding company from Indiana. Kemper shares jumped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars
62- 5/8 after Conseco offered Dollars 3.25bn cash and equity for the
company. Although Conseco said its offer would only stand until tomorrow, it
was enough to scare off GE Capital, which quickly withdrew its bid.

FT  25 JUN 94 / The Long View: Look who's talking . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again the international financial markets are being infuriatingly
obtuse, or so it appears to the politicians. As another minor dollar crisis
erupted on the foreign exchanges this week, the chairman of the US Federal
Reserve, Alan Greenspan, chose to boast (in the dangerous style of Britain's
former chancellor, Nigel Lawson) that the economic outlook for the US was
'as bright as it has been for decades'.
US treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen insisted the economy was fundamentally
strong and, by implication, the dollar should be, too. President Bill
Clinton also joined in this round of jaw-boning which was, apparently,
intended to soften up the markets for the next round of intervention. 'In
the end, the markets will have to respond to the economic realities,' he
said. Well, yes . . . but have they not already been doing so?
Which has the stronger economy: the US, with 3 1/2 per cent growth in GNP,
unemployment falling, and corporate profits and investment rising rapidly;
or Japan, where total output is barely growing and industrial production is
down, year-on-year? But let us look at that again. Japan has a huge surplus
of exports over imports and is likely to run a balance of payments surplus
of Dollars 125bn this year. It has a negligible budget deficit and boasts
the lowest inflation and interest rates of any major country.
The US, in contrast, has been running up deficits for many years: it is
unwilling to tax its citizens enough to pay the government's bills and the
nation is eager to consume more imports than it is willing or able to
finance through export deliveries.
Currency strength or weakness in the long run tends to reflect ingrained
national characteristics. When the politicians of a country such as the US
become annoyed by the tendency of their currency to sink, they tend to hit
out either at the alleged irrationality of the markets or at the supposed
irresponsibility and cussedness of overseas governments - in this case, at
the failure of the Japanese government to expand domestic credit fast
enough.
In fact, the Americans should look at their own characteristics. They save
comparatively little and are high consumers. As a result, investment and
growth will be comparatively low and the currency will be weak in the long
run, with a tendency towards high inflation. If the Americans want to live
like this, it is their privilege to do so - but they should understand the
consequences. If they really want to stabilise the dollar, they must take
steps to raise domestic savings and stop blaming everybody else.
Substantial countries rarely change their economic spots. A notable
exception has been France, once firmly in the high inflation camp but more
recently transferred to the German economic zone, to the incomprehension of
Anglo-American critics. The UK, of course, continues on its secular decline,
with record levels of consumption and a rate of aggregate national savings
at the bottom of the international league table. The exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 was rationalised widely as a
triumph; sterling's trade-weighted index drifted below 80 this week, the
lowest for more than a year.
These long-term trends in currencies have become evident since the ending in
the 1930s and 1940s of the links with gold, and especially since the
introduction of the floating rate system early in the 1970s. Meanwhile,
price movements have become upward-only - not always rapid, but without the
interludes of offsetting sharp price falls which meant, in previous
centuries, that there was no long-run trend in prices.
An over-spending country with a weak currency has to attract the savers of
other countries by offering them a higher rate of return. The greater the
reluctance of savers in a hard currency country to venture overseas, the
greater the premium will have to be.
Japanese investors have been hit savagely by currency losses in the past and
are proving very reluctant to expose themselves to the very real risk of
more of the same. The yen would have appreciated further if the Japanese
authorities had not been heavy buyers of US treasury bills and other
short-term dollar assets.
Now that last year's temporary optimism over the dollar has evaporated,
dollar interest rates look anomalously low. Short-term rates have, for a
long time, been below those in Germany; now, 10-year bond yields are, too.
In part, this might reflect the problems of Germany itself which, because of
the persistent consequences of re-unification, is in danger of slipping off
its pedestal: state borrowing is very high and the Bundesbank has lost
control of the money supply. But dollar rates are, nevertheless, too low and
the Americans will have to stop chattering and keep on ratcheting.
As the accumulation of debt proceeds, more marginal savings have to be
attracted and the real cost of borrowing is likely to rise. Foreign
investors have to be compensated for the risk of currency depreciation,
domestic ones for the risk of inflation in the long run. There is no point
in finance ministers protesting that the present rate of inflation is low.
It is less than four years since UK inflation was over 10 per cent, a time
period which is just the fleeting interval between one football World Cup
and the next.
Perhaps the borrowers should focus on the possibility that they could bring
down their costs by offering a firmer promise of repayment, backed by links
to an inflation or currency index - or even to bullion (as the French once
did in their post-war dilettante period) thus, in effect, reinstating the
gold standard for long-term government debt.
For the time being, though, we shall continue to be witnesses to the
frustrating spectacle of perverse financial markets refusing to accept the
self-evident truths uttered by the politicians.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Union Jacques that Eurosceptics fear: As Europe's leaders
meet in Corfu this weekend, Charles Grant assesses Delors' impact on western
Europe and how his contribution has defined the debate on its future for
decades to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES GRANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This weekend on the island of Corfu, Europe's leaders hope to name the man
who will implement - or abandon - the vision of Jacques Delors for a grand
political union on the eastern side of the Atlantic.
After 10 years as President of the European Commission, Delors has come to
symbolise the ideals of a generation of European federalists - and
everything that Eurosceptics dislike and fear.
After the great battle in Rome in October 1990, between Margaret Thatcher
and Delors about his plan for a single European currency, Britain's The Sun
newspaper filled its front page with the three words: 'Up yours Delors'. If
this expressed only the inchoate fears of little Englanders, there has since
emerged a widespread anxiety in many European countries about Delors' vision
of a federal future.
Yet no politician since the second world war has made a greater impact on
western Europe. General De Gaulle and Margaret Thatcher made profound
changes in their own countries, it is true. But Delors leaves an indelible
mark on half a continent.
He transformed the feeble and ineffective bureaucracy of the European
Commission, and the European Union it serves, into influential and intrusive
organisations. It is precisely because of this that they have attracted a
wave of popular hostility.
How did this workaholic, with the fiery temper and a strong sense of Roman
Catholic morality, achieve such a position? And why is it that he is one of
the most popular politicians in France, where he is likely to be the Left's
candidate for the presidency in May?
Delors' absence from the fray of party and factional struggle - as a deus ex
machina in Brussels - has given him the image of someone who is above
politics. He has nurtured this myth, often claiming that he is too naive,
too lacking in self confidence and too unambitious to succeed in politics.
And indeed he has never been at ease in any political party. In the 1950s
and 1960s he worked with a series of left-wing Roman Catholic clubs rather
than the socialist party. He has never been elected to an assembly, with the
exception of the European Parliament in 1979.
However, the story of Delors' European presidency reveals him to be a master
of tactical skill, strategic sense and political cunning.
When he became president of the European Economic Community (which later
became the European Community, or EC, and later still the European Union, or
EU) use of the national veto had ensured that the commission's draft laws
seldom passed the Council of Ministers.
From his first month in office, Delors began to transform the Community. He
had huge influence on: the programme to create a single market by the end of
1992; the Single European Act; the budgetary packages of 1988 and 1992; the
European Economic Area; the Social Charter and the Social Chapter; the
Delors Report on Economic and Monetary Union (Emu); and the subsequent moves
to 'political union'.
The EU became such a success during the Delors years that nine countries
applied to join.
These were remarkable achievements, for it is much more difficult for a
politician to make a mark on European institutions than on his own
government. The constitutions of nation-states are hierarchical, and allow a
prime minister or president with a parliamentary majority huge scope for
making changes.
The EU, however, is a complex network of supra-national bodies (the
commission, European Parliament and Court of Justice), inter-governmental
bodies (the Council of Ministers) and national governments, which all
contribute to the legislative and executive processes.
The EU's constitution allows no role for a leader with a strong executive
authority. Ultimately, the Council of Ministers takes the most important
decisions, but only after officials from the commission, the Council of
Ministers' secretariat, the European Parliament and national ministries have
been consulted.
Euro-MPs, commissioners, junior ministers, national ambassadors and hundreds
of lobbyists all have a say. Committees, working groups and all-night
meetings - rather than powerful individuals - are the cogs which drive this
machinery forward. Decision-making is so slow and consensual that decisive
leadership from the centre is almost impossible, as Delors' predecessors
discovered.
How, then, did Delors set about the task? Luck played its part. The
Community began to regain momentum just before his arrival. The
Fontainebleau summit, which appointed him in 1984, settled five years of
arguments over Britain's budget contribution. In an increasingly liberal
climate, most governments thought the best treatment for Eurosclerosis would
be deregulation.
Delors exploited these opportunities with great tactical skill. When he
chose to relaunch Europe around the theme of the single market, he
understood - better than many British politicians - that there would be
political consequences.
The commission's white paper of 300 barrier-busting proposals put pressure
on governments to provide the means for implementing them.
The result was the Single European Act, which ended the national veto on
single market laws. Delors' next key initiative, in 1988, was to push the EC
towards European monetary union.
He knew that would provoke a debate on the reform of the EC's institutions -
which became known as political union. Delors always had a clear idea of
where he wanted Europe to go, which gave him an advantage over political
opponents who lacked his long-term vision.
A commission president has few formal means of influencing European
politics, other than the right of proposal. Much of Delors' clout has
depended on the friendships he cultivated with EC prime ministers and
foreign ministers. Helmut Kohl has proved by far the most useful of these
allies.
The pair enjoy each other's company, sharing a strong Roman Catholic faith
and an earthy sense of humour. In 1988 Delors persuaded Kohl to back Emu,
and the chancellor made his friend chairman of what became the Delors
Committee.
In 1989 Delors' warm support for German unity - when Thatcher and Mitterrand
had doubts - turned friendship into blutsbruderschaft. During the talks on
the Treaty of Maastricht, Delors relied on Kohl to keep the other
governments in step with his timetable for Emu.
Many of Delors' personal qualities proved well-suited to his job. The
president has a chance to set the EU's agenda, so is likely to be more
effective if, as in Delors' case, he - there has yet to be a she - is a
prodigious generator of ideas. Throughout his career, in articles, speeches
and books, Delors has spurted out proposals on industrial relations, labour
markets, monetary economics and Europe's constitution.
Delors' staff joke that the role of Pascal Lamy, his chef de cabinet until
last month, was to tell the president which were the 19 of his 20 ideas that
would not work.
Delors combines a fertile imagination with a pragmatic bent that makes him a
keen compromiser. He spends evenings and weekends reading and annotating
documents. At meetings of the Council of Ministers and at summits he is
usually better prepared than anyone else.
His forte at such occasions is to craft compromises which others fail to
find because they lack his knowledge of the detail. Thus at the Edinburgh
summit of December 1992, Delors found the formula which settled the EU's
budgetary plans to 1999.
Delors believes he has a duty to serve God by improving the lot of mankind.
That sense of mission justifies, in Delors' own mind, his ambition. 'What
drives me is the worry - a sort of panic - that I might not do useful
things,' he says. 'I am never satisfied. Evidently, those who are will be
happier.'
He is uninterested in money and, in spite of a Pounds 140,000 a year salary
(after tax), leads a frugal life. He avoids diplomatic soirees and seldom
ventures out in the evening - unless one of his favourite jazz musicians,
such as Sonny Rollins, happens to be performing.
He descended into one of his blackest-ever moods in February 1988, just
before a Brussels summit that was supposed to approve his budgetary package.
Delors told a meeting of commissioners that if, as he feared, the summit did
not pass his package, he would resign and they should too.
When none of them offered to do so he accused the commissioners of cowardice
and disloyalty. If there was a shipwreck, he said, they were all in it and
he would denounce any survivors. He accused Grigoris Varfis, the Greek
commissioner, of incompetence and treachery, and said that he and his
department were une honte (shameful) and une scandale.
Delors four times told his colleagues that they should be ready to resign
with him. After two hours of this haranging he stormed out. In the event the
summit passed the package and Delors never had to test his colleagues'
loyalty.
Surprisingly, those who experience Delors' ire are usually ready to forgive
him, for they respect his integrity and his ideals. 'Delors' weaknesses,
such as his self-questioning, make you want to protect him,' says Max
Kohnstamm, formerly chief aide to Jean Monnet (one of the Community's
founding fathers), and a friend of Delors. 'If he kicks someone, you don't
ask if he's plotting against them, because you know he's doing it for
Europe.'
He inherited a horizontal power structure in which the president was primus
inter pares among the other commissioners.
With the aid of Lamy and the other members of his cabinet - who were
brilliant, dedicated and capable of ruthlessness - Delors created a
pyramidal structure, with himself at the summit. Many of the other
commissioners were sidelined, while Delors installed loyal friends - members
of the 'Delors network' - in key posts.
To win arguments against commissioners such as Sir Leon Brittan, Delors'
staff sometimes used dubious methods, such as editing or even rewriting the
minutes of commission meetings.
In October 1987 Delors told the European Parliament that America would let
the dollar fall to DM1.60. The dollar dipped two pfennigs and several
finance ministers rebuked Delors for speaking out of turn.
Lamy told journalists that the president had been misquoted and sent a
member of the cabinet to the parliament's office. The envoy found the
official who was editing the report of that day's proceedings and bullied
him into deleting the offending words. The report had been printed when Lord
Plumb, the parliament's president, discovered the ruse. He had the report
pulped and then reprinted with Delors' true words.
By the end of Delors' reign, his authoritarian management style had created
as many problems as it had solved. His network's huge influence undermined
the commission's traditional chains of command, and especially the role of
the directors-general, the top tier of officials. The regime's excesses
harmed the morale of many officials.
Delors and Lamy justified their strong-arm tactics with the argument that,
in such a creaking and ramshackle bureaucracy, there was no other way to get
things done. However they never attempted a fundamental reform of that
bureaucracy's failings.
Delors has always found ideas and policy more interesting than
administration. His departure at the end of this year, and the inevitable
withering of his network, will deprive the commission of its spine - and
leave management problems for his successor.
Delors' tactical skill began to desert him in the 1990s. He became
over-confident and appeared too ambitious on behalf of the commission. By
1991, the year of the inter-governmental conferences, the commission's
growing power - and the perception that Delors wanted even more for it - had
irked several governments.
Delors' draft treaty for political union proved too federalist, particularly
in the large role it proposed for the commission in foreign policy, to have
any impact other than to annoy governments. Delors had become too wrapped in
the logic of the EC's institutional mechanisms.
In common with many national politicians, Delors had failed to see that a
large part of public opinion understood neither the Community nor what he
was trying to achieve. Hence his surprise when, after Denmark's Nej to
Maastricht in June 1992, popular sentiment in Britain, France and Germany
turned against the EC, the commission and himself.
In the coming decades, the debate about the future of Europe will be defined
by the opposing ideas of Delors and Thatcher. Her side wants only a
confederation of free-trading nation states. Delorists will argue that
European countries have enough in common in their history, culture and
values to make it worth pooling their economic, diplomatic and military
resources into a union that can hold its own with the superpowers.
Delors has turned the Community into a powerful entity which threatens
national officials, parliamentarians and ministers. It also frightens many
citizens. Thanks to Delors, public opinion has become, for the first time, a
crucial factor in the shaping of the future of the union - and a brake on
his own federalist designs.

FT  25 JUN 94 / PosTel draws line on contracts: Group will vote at AGMs
against directors' three-year deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PosTel, the Pounds 20bn investment management group, is to vote at company
annual meetings against the re-election of directors who have rolling
employment contracts longer than two years.
The decision comes after concern was expressed over large payouts to
directors when they are forced to resign. Directors with three-year rolling
contracts can receive up to three times their basic salary if they are
forced out.
Implementation of the policy will begin 'with the AGM proxies we start
filling in on Monday', Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of PosTel,
said yesterday. Among directors likely to be immediately affected are those
of several privatised electricity and water companies which are still to
hold their AGMs.
It is also likely to lead PosTel, which handles investment for the Post
Office and BT pension funds, into conflict with the directors of rival fund
management organisations. For example Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of
Prudential Corporation, has a three-year service contract against which
PosTel will vote.
Mr Ross Goobey said yesterday he hoped other institutional shareholders
would back his campaign. However, Mr Michael Sandland, chief investment
manager of Norwich Union, said: 'We have not been supporters of contracts
which are three-year rolling contracts but we have no current plans to
follow Postel.'
The action was also heavily criticised by those directors who are likely to
be targeted. Mr Peter Hunt, chairman of Land Securities, defended three-year
rolling contracts.
They are 'normal and best current practice', he said. 'You have to have
three-year contracts to attract and retain top people, otherwise you would
have to pay higher salaries. Three years' notice works both ways.'
PosTel's move follows last May's letter from Mr Ross Goobey to the chairmen
of FT-SE 100 companies in which he said: 'PosTel will vote against the
re-appointment of any director who is on a rolling contract of more than 12
months.'
Mr Ross Goobey said yesterday a number of companies had recently reduced
their contracts to two years. One-year contracts remained his preference but
'to vote against two-year contracts would send inappropriate signals to
those boards of directors who have shortened contracts from three years'.
PosTel stressed that only in 'exceptional circumstances' would it not vote
against an offending director's re-appointment. It said it would normally
vote against the re-appointment of any director with more than a two-year
rolling period of notice.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Eurofighter faces delay in delivery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Deliveries of the European fighter aircraft to all four nations in the
project will be delayed by up to a year unless Germany's politicians and
industrialists can resolve a dispute about development costs by next Friday.
The German defence ministry said the two sides were far apart and there was
no prospect of the government agreeing to demands by Deutsche Aerospace
(Dasa), the German industrial partner, that an extra DM1.2bn (Pounds 480m)
be found from public funds for the project.
The dispute must be resolved before the German legislature goes into recess
on Friday, or it will remain outstanding until the end of the year or early
1995, when a new government sets out its defence priorities.
The Social Democratic opposition in Germany doubts the need for the
Eurofighter after the end of the cold war. Supporters say it will meet
western Europe's air defence needs until well into the next century.
The project is already running more than two years late, in part because of
political controversy in Germany.
The four governments involved, whose development and initial production run
are expected to cost Pounds 30bn, had hoped to sign a memorandum of
understanding to complete development work this summer. That will not be
possible unless there is a breakthrough in Germany.
By current plans, Britain and Italy expect to start taking delivery of the
Eurofighter in 2000, Spain in 2001, and the German air force in 2002.
However, defence industry officials said this timetable would not be
feasible unless the German row was resolved in the next few days.
A spokesman for British Aerospace Defence, the UK's industrial partner in
the project, said of the German dispute: 'We have made a commitment to the
customer governments and we would not wish to see that change. We should
remember that the longer the project takes, the higher the expenses will
be.'
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, refused to pass Dasa's request
for extra funding on to the German parliament until the government was
satisfied the sum requested was reasonable. Dasa wants the defence ministry
to supply about DM1.2bn - including costs carried over from 1992 - to
guarantee the project's future. The defence ministry has said it cannot
guarantee to put up more than DM520m. It may find an extra DM170m, but only
if Dasa can provide accounts to back its argument that more public money is
needed, a ministry spokesman said.
The ministry has said it will meet costs arising from the government's 1992
decision to extend the production period. However, it was not prepared to
pay for delays for which, in its view, Dasa was responsible.
'The question will be largely decided by how much industry is prepared to
budge,' a ministry spokesman said. 'We're staying put.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deep-seated rivalry between the Netherlands and Belgium will surface today
in two highly-contested matches played between determined teams in
far-flung, sunny settings.
On the Greek island of Corfu, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister,
will seek to prevent victory by his Belgian counterpart, Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene, in a closed-door contest to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president
of the European Commission.
Meanwhile, the US will host Dutch-Belgian competition of a more open kind at
the football World Cup. In the midday heat of Orlando, Florida, Belgium's
'Red Devils' squad will be meeting the 'Orangemen' - the national side of
the Netherlands.
Fixtures involving the two countries are always favourites with the fans,
but this match has taken on added significance because of the unusually
hard-fought battle between Mr Lubbers and Mr Dehaene for the right to assume
the mantle of 'Mr Europe'. Diplomatic relations between the Dutch and the
Belgians are usually correct but the two countries have a complicated
love-hate relationship springing from a shared history.
The Belgians may have seceded from the United Netherlands in 1830, but the
language, literature and culture of the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium and
'big brother' Holland to the north are inextricably intertwined.
This link has brought irritations and jealousy, and Belgian jokes in the
Netherlands are as rife as Dutch jokes in Flanders.
The Dutch like to see the Belgians as drink-loving layabouts mired in
political squabbles.
To the Belgians, the stereotypical Dutchman is stingy with money, lacking in
culture and devoid of gastronomic finesse. Above all, he is loud and
overbearing, especially when visiting Belgium. In fact, Belgian resentment
is similar to the aversion of the Dutch to crowds of German tourists in
their own country.
Indeed, Dutch passion about the succession to Mr Delors is not directed so
much at Belgium, a fellow small country in the European Union, as it is at
Germany, Mr Dehaene's main supporter.
This attitude was neatly captured by a political cartoon in the Amsterdam
daily Het Parool showing German chancellor Helmut Kohl with a tiny Mr
Dehaene in his shirt pocket.
The caption read: 'The right man in the right spot', underscoring Dutch
perception of Mr Dehaene as a potential puppet for German interests.
It is therefore just as well the Germans and the Dutch - whose sporting
encounters have tended to rekindle unresolved anger dating from the second
world war - have yet to meet on one of the football fields of the US while
the question of Mr Delors' succession remains unresolved.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even if some investment managers dislike the high profile stance on
executive pay adopted by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey of PosTel, few would
disagree that he has a point about long term rolling contracts. Since they
make it expensive to fire top managers, they have been one of the main
instruments by which failure was rewarded during the recession. Happily
there has been a tendency for the duration of such contracts to shorten.
Before the Cadbury Report, five years was common; afterwards a three-year
rolling contract became the norm. Since PosTel's original intervention the
period has tended to shrink further.
Some might argue that the media-friendly Mr Ross Goobey is claiming credit
for latching on to a trend that was already there. But they would be wrong
to assume that discreet pressure from institutions is enough to root out
abuse. A public stand, even if it seems inflexible, can help shift behaviour
standards. And all Mr Ross Goobey is saying is that he will use his vote to
back up his views. That is what shareholder democracy is about.
Since rolling contracts were once a necessary part of any package required
to attract top quality recruits, one fear is that other incentives, possibly
more costly to shareholders, would be needed to replace them. Significantly,
though, PosTel claims amendment of existing contracts has not usually
involved compensation. In that case, there is every reason to press for the
duration of such contracts to be reduced further.

FT  25 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Elf Aquitaine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Elf's warning that half-year group operating profits will fall 20 per cent
highlights how tough it is for corporate France to claw its way out of
recession. Continuing weak demand in France and Germany, combined with the
depressed crude oil price in recent times, is hampering Elf's
self-improvement plans. Elf's heavy exposure to upstream activities
increases its vulnerability.
Such slow progress may disappoint those investors who bought into Elf at the
time of its much-hyped privatisation in February. Elf was then sold to the
market as a BP-style recovery stock. US investors, in particular, were
attracted to its vast asset base, cash flow profile and yield. Elf is still
pursuing the right course in cutting costs, preserving cash and aiming to
realise FFr5bn from asset sales. Yet the weakness of the oil price and
strict French employment laws mean it will take longer to realise the
benefits than most had previously assumed.
Elf's warning also strikes an ominous note for the rest of the French
bourse, which has already fared worse than most other European markets this
year. Corporate and consumer confidence remains fragile as the all-important
10-year OAT bond yield has jumped by 2 percentage points this year. High
bond yields may deter investment and forestall the fall in the savings
ratio. The French government will find it hard to press ahead with further
privatisations against such a background. At least it has already got a good
slug of stock away this year.

Until Wednesday, the stock market viewed newspaper publishing companies as
attractive investments. Such businesses were considered highly cash
generative with predictable income streams and a geared exposure to the
advertising cycle. Yet price wars have turned such thinking upside down with
more than Pounds 1bn being wiped off the value of newspaper shares. That may
smack of hysteria. But if middle-market news-papers are sucked into the
price-cutting vortex, then it may yet be seen as a fair reflection of the
industry's prospects.
Unless that price cutting expands total newspaper sales - which is doubtful
 -the industry's profitability will be savaged. Total profits could perhaps
fall by 30 per cent over the next few years. Rising paper prices already
threaten to squeeze margins. By emphasising their cheapness, newspapers may
also lay themselves open to VAT. Newspaper shares will need a higher risk
premium since they appear so vulnerable to the antics of Mr Rupert Murdoch.
It is not only the daily national newspapers that will suffer. Competition
may escalate further on Sundays. Big regional newspapers, too, may fear they
will lose sales unless they respond. Price wars in any industry tend to
reflect surplus capacity. Mr Murdoch may simply believe this is true of
newspapers too. By dragging down the margin structure he perhaps hopes to
hasten consolidation. Only then will the industry return to healthier
economics.

The central banks seem simply to have stored up more trouble for themselves
with yesterday's foreign exchange market intervention. The dollar recovered
against the yen for a while, but the D-Mark was quickly stronger than
before. The central banks were clearly wrong if they thought they could
catch dealers on the hop in quiet pre-weekend markets.
In fact, it seems they were simply giving speculators a chance to unload
long dollar positions which should have been unwound long ago. Nor can
intervention without supporting action on interest rates do the trick.
Having shown their hand, the central banks cannot easily stop here. There
may be no pressing domestic need for higher US rates, while the onset of
recovery and excessive money supply growth hardly call for a cut in Germany.
But the authorities are damned both ways. Unless they can stabilise the
dollar, the US bond market, from which other markets around the world take
their lead, looks vulnerable. If US interest rates are raised, though, there
is a risk of yet more turbulence in the markets.
The only consolation is that bonds and equities seem already to be
discounting higher US rates. When the move finally comes, the markets could
calm down. Yet, to support the dollar, any US rate rise would need to be
large enough to make a significant dent in the recovery.
Unsurprisingly, the equity market has now taken fright on both sides of the
Atlantic. In watching Wall Street, London dealers must be wondering whether
a similar fate will befall the UK sooner or later as its own economic
recovery matures.

FT  25 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue-chip stocks close
sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks plummeted yesterday as a concerted effort by the world's central
banks to lift the slumping dollar proved ineffective, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 62.15 at 3,636.94, as the
blue-chip stocks were swamped by waves of computer-guided selling. The NYSE
imposed its 'uptick' restrictions on program trading at 11am, after the
Dow's decline crossed the 50-point threshold for the first time.
But the losses were not confined to the blue chips, as in other recent
sessions. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 6.83 lower at
442.80.
Declining issues on the NYSE outnumbered advances, 1,879 to 379 in moderate
volume of 261m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 4.95 at 426.30,
and the Nasdaq composite shed 7.06 to 693.79.
Before the opening, investors were braced for a rocky session. Overnight the
dollar had dropped a full yen against the Japanese currency after two days
of relative stability. News of the intervention, led by the Federal Reserve
and the Bundesbank, reached the market just as trading began. The reaction
was decidedly negative, as the rescue mission appeared to underscore the US
currency's vulnerability and raised doubts about the sustainability of the
support effort.
The sell-off in stocks gathered pace as the morning progressed and it became
apparent that the intervention was having a marginal effect. Bonds breached
a key support level, and share prices went into a free-fall which was
finally broken when the program-trading 'collar' was put in place. Towards
the close, the Dow lurched downward for a second time, to close near its
session low.
The morning's events suggested the Fed may have no choice but to lift
interest rates again. As a result, the share prices of companies which would
suffer the most from an economic slowdown were hit hard yesterday. Alcoa
dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 72 1/8 , DuPont lost Dollars 1 1/4 to
Dollars 58 1/2 and International Paper shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 67 5/8
.
Transport issues flagged, with the Dow Jones Transportation Index showing a
35-point decline, or 2.19 per cent, to 1,589.94. Among the airlines, UAL,
parent of United, fell Dollars 5 to Dollars 120 and AMR, parent of American,
dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 57. Roadway, a trucking company, was down
Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 66.
Surprisingly, technology issues held up fairly well, thanks in part to
bargain-hunting on the heels of yesterday's rout. At least two investment
houses upgraded their ratings on Oracle Systems, which develops database
management software. The stock jumped Dollars 2 to Dollars 36 5/8 .
Among other widely held Nasdaq issues, Lotus Development improved Dollars
1/2 to Dollars 34 1/4 , Wellfleet added Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 22 and Atmel
climbed Dollars 1 9/16 to Dollars 24 1/32 .
On the negative side, Gateway 2000, which sells personal computers through
the post, was marked down Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 10 5/8 , or 15 per cent,
on a profits warning.
Canada
Toronto stocks fell sharply in relatively light trading. The 300 composite
index plunged 74.68 points, or 1.85 per cent, to 3,959.85 in volume of
48.8m.
The composite index last closed below the 4,000-point level in October 1993.
All 14 stock groups ended lower, with pipelines and financial services
recording the largest declines of 2.94 per cent and 2.68 per cent
respectively. Consumer products fell 2.45 per cent, industrial products lost
1.82 per cent and mining fell 1.70 per cent. Gold and energy stocks were
each down over 1 per cent on index.
Mexico
Mexican shares continued to fall sharply, losing over 50 points following
the resignation of Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo. The IPC index of 37
leading shares was off 56.52 points, a fall of 2.52 per cent, at 2,186.41.
The highly respected Carpizo was due to oversee the August presidential
elections and to ensure that they were clean.

FT  25 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei down 1.3 per cent
on fears over yen
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Further worries over the yen kept most investors absent and the Nikkei index
lost ground on technical selling amid low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
Arbitrage selling depressed the 225-issue by 273.46 points, or 1.3 per cent
to 20,766.75, off 3.4 per cent on the week. Volume thinned to 350m shares
against 389m.
The index opened at the day's high of 20,998.30, but soon declined on
arbitrage selling and index-linked trading which overwhelmed buying of blue
chips by investment trusts and public funds. The index hit a low of
20,755.45 in the afternoon.
The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 8.17 to 1,673.07 and the
Nikkei 300 closed down 2.08 at 303.99. Declines led advances by 677 to 364,
with 154 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.67 to
1,362.66.
A no confidence vote by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party against the
minority government also unnerved investors.
Banks were lower on arbitrage selling. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30 to
Y3,240 and Mitsubishi Bank declined Y20 to Y2,660.
Daiei, which attracted buying on Thursday following reports that it would
start a joint retailing venture in China, lost Y60 to Y1,670 on
profit-taking.
Large capital steels also declined on profit-taking. Nippon Steel fell Y5 to
Y357. But Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y3 to Y795 on investment trust
support.
The yen's late rise eroded earlier gains posted by high-technology stocks,
which were supported by investment trust led buying. Hitachi closed
unchanged at Y1,040, but Fujitsu lost Y10 to Y1,110.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 79.19 to 23,242.38 in volume of 28.8m shares.
Roundup
A weak US dollar and uncertainties over interest rates continued to
preoccupy the region.
HONG KONG ended lower on the US dollar although local bargain-hunting was
encouraged by optimism on the new airport. The Hang Seng index closed down
85.75 at 8,881.00, 2.6 per cent lower on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR recovered with the return of foreign buying. The benchmark KLSE
Composite index closed up 11.53 at 1,015.03, still 2.2 per cent down on the
week. Volume was thin, reflecting investors' caution over the market's
direction after falls on Wall Street overnight.
TAIPEI moved higher on buying in the paper and plastics sectors, although
brokers said that the upsurge might not last long with investors short of
confidence. The weighted index closed 68.48 higher at 5,939.62, 3.6 per cent
lower on the week. Turnover fell to TDollars 47.36bn from Thursday's
TDollars 52.64bn.
SYDNEY's trading was inflated by the expiry of options, the All Ordinaries
index closing 34.2 lower at 2,017.9, down 1.6 per cent on the week as
turnover soared from ADollars 579m to ADollars 1.46bn.
SEOUL ended lower on a strike by railway workers, although some blue chips
staged a rebound from earlier declines as the composite index fell 6.12 to
929.45, up 1.2 per cent on the week.
Kepco gained Won200 to Won26,200 and Korea Mobile Telecom advanced Won900 to
Won313,900. Volume was 47m shares against 62.3m on Thursday.
WELLINGTON lost more ground in the international investment gloom, the
NZSE-40 index ending 21.24 lower at 2,038.77, down 2.9 per cent over the
week. Telecom was hit again by arguments for investment in fixed interest
securities, as local and world interest rates continue to rise, as well as
by selling on Wall Street.
MANILA fell through the the 2,800 support level, sparking fears of a
downward spiral if no positive factors emerged. The composite index closed
33.01 lower at 2,789.14, down 3.2 per cent on the week as most blue chips
fell on profit-taking. Turnover more than doubled to 1.34bn pesos, compared
with the previous 654.28m.
JAKARTA closed lower in sluggish trade, with overseas investors sidelined
mainly on concerns over US interest rates. The official index ended 2.09
lower at 468.87, 1.6 per cent down on the week.

Central bank intervention in support of the dollar was unable to rescue
bourses yesterday afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT wrote an unsettled and gloomy end to the official week, down 2.2
per cent and closing with the Dax index 16.79 lower at 2,005.31.
There was a brief recovery later, but the Ibis-indicated Dax subsided again
to close at 2,005.07. 'Currency intervention never lasts,' said a broker.
'It's an emergency signal, a bit of a panic measure, and it shows that
something is radically wrong.'
Turnover fell from DM9.2bn to DM7bn. Activity was dominated by another sharp
fall in Deutsche Bank, which ended DM18.20 lower at DM669.80, after DM663,
down 8.5 per cent on the week.
The stock's outlook has been clouded by investor worries about the bank's
exposure to volatile debt markets and recent property scandals.
PARIS fell away sharply in line with the trend among the late closing
markets with the CAC-40 index finishing just above the 1,900 support level
at 1,907.02, a decline of 32.00 for the session and 1.4 per cent for the
week. Turnover on the first day of the new account was estimated at some
FFr3.4bn.
In spite of the overall gloomy mood some bright spots could be found among
equities. Sanofi improved FFr38 to FFr853 in reaction to Thursday's news
that it was buying Sterling Winthrop's prescription drug business, while
some of the companies which have been forecasting better earnings prospects
also turned positive, St Gobain up FFr2 at FFr648 and Michelin adding
FFr6.70 at FFr221.50.
There was more bad news for Euro Disney, suspended limit down at one stage
before closing down FFr3.10 or 19 per cent at FFr12.90. There has been
considerable technical trading in the shares as doubts have grown about the
aftermath of the ongoing FFr6bn rights issue.
Elf Aquitaine slipped FFr14 to FFr390 as the group issued a profits warning.
ZURICH ended under renewed pressure. The SMI index fell through support at
the 2,580 level, losing 49.5 to 2,577.2, for a 1.9 per cent drop on the
week.
Cyclicals remained vulnerable, said Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Bank Sal
Oppenheim, to the threat of earnings revisions on the back of the weak
dollar. Sulzer lost SFr18 to SFr912 while Holderbank was SFr17 down at
SFr900.
Banks, which had earlier in the week halted their long slide, turned lower
again, losing an average of 1 per cent, although CS Holding fell SFr17 or
3.1 per cent to SFr535.
MILAN overcame early weakness as local investors covered positions ahead of
the weekend although the Comit index failed to register the late
improvement, losing 8.52 at 698.92, unchanged on the week.
Olivetti, however, was a bright spot, rising L45 to L2,455 following its
link with Hughes Network System to provide digital satellite communications
across Europe. CIR, the holding company, climbed L65 to L2,525.
Montedison gained another L22 or 1.5 per cent to L1,490 as investors
concentrated on its turnround potential.
MADRID reacted badly to the failure of dollar intervention, banks
particularly weak as the general index dropped 5.88, or 1.9 per cent to
299.14, 2.8 per cent lower on the week.
The exception in the banking sector, once again, was Bankinter, where
600,000 shares were put through the market, Bankinter itself buying from
Santander at Pta11,500 a share. The shares closed unchanged at Pta11,000.
Elsewhere, the decline took in construction, utilities and US favourites
like Repsol, down Pta125 at Pta3,870, but Telefonica showed relative
strength, easing just Pta15 to Pta1,760.
Brokers said that there was strong buying on the run-up to the placing of
Telefonica International.
AMSTERDAM was unsettled by the currencies turbulence with many of its
multinationals dependent on dollar earnings. The AEX index finished at the
session low of 381.43, down 5.95 on the day and 2.8 per cent on the week.

FT  25 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Little to cheer about as Irish track
bonds - The 1994 decline in Dublin equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If fund managers have experienced difficulty in tracking down their usual
equity or bond dealer in Dublin in the past week or so, the reason is
straightforward.
Dozens of dealers from the city's four main broking houses have packed their
sunglasses, sports shirts and sunblocks, and headed for the United States.
Along with tens of thousands of other Irish football supporters, they have
been yelling 'Ole Ole Ole' from the terraces of US sports stadiums, urging
on Ireland's team in the World Cup, rather than Irish stocks from their
trading desks.
They can hardly be blamed, as there has been little to cheer about in the
Irish stock market so far this year.
Last year's sustained rally, which saw the ISEQ overall index rise 54 per
cent to 1,889, peaked in January at 2,082; it is now 9.4 per cent down on
the year to date, and 17.8 per cent down from its peak. The index fell
another 26.44 to 1,711.99 last night.
The cause of this, the slump in bond prices, has been shared with other
European markets but the bear market has been particularly hard on Irish
gilts, not least because of the widespread perception that the Central Bank
is now preferentially tracking sterling rather than the D-Mark in managing
the exchange rate.
According to Mr Dan McLaughlin, the chief economist at Riada stockbrokers,
Irish gilts are now trading at 150 basis points over German bunds, compared
to 40 basis points just six months ago. 'There has been a fundamental shift
in the Irish market . . . dealing rooms in Dublin are watching the UK now
rather than the German market.' The focus on sterling and the slide in the
UK equity market has in turn driven the fall in the Irish equity market.
Financial and food stocks have suffered the hardest knocks in the Irish
league table. The main financials, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life,
whose combined market capitalisation comprises 30 per cent of the Dublin
market total, have fared worse than average, being more sensitive to the
performance of gilts. AIB is almost 20 per cent down from its 1993 high,
while Bank of Ireland and Irish Life are down some 12-15 per cent.
In foods, which comprise 15 per cent of the market's capitalisation,
Avonmore, Waterford Foods and Golden Vale are the companies most exposed to
current uncertainties in the dairy industry, further exacerbated by Golden
Vale's recent profits warning. Their share prices stand from 20 to 40 per
cent lower than their 1993 peaks.
Significant exceptions which have bucked the downward trend are Kerry Group,
IAWS and Greencore in the food sector, ICG the shipping group, and Waterford
Wedgwood. Smurfit is also showing signs of recovery as the market has begun
to take a more favourable view of the paper and packaging industry
generally. All have made gains on their 1993 highs.
But, being June, it is just half-time, and Dublin brokers who have stayed at
home are confident that ground lost in the first half will be made up in the
second. Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy stockbrokers, says: 'It
doesn't require a huge rally in bonds, just stabilisation, to get the equity
market rallying.'
Mr Brendan Lynch, senior economist at BCP brokers, agrees. 'The European
bond markets are ready for a turn. They have reached an oversold position. A
steadying of the bond market will set the base for the equity market to gain
on economic performance and improved earnings.'
Encouraging economic forecasts from a range of analysts give cause for
optimism for corporate earnings this year.
One of the latest, published by Goodbody stockbrokers this week, points to
strong export growth and a recovery in domestic demand which will raise real
GDP by close to 5 per cent in 1994. 'This year is likely to see the
beginning of a boom period of balanced and sustained growth which is set to
last for at least five years,' Goodbodys predicts. Inflation is not expected
to rise significantly, adding to the good news for the equity market.
On similar calculations, Mr Kelleher believes the ISEQ index should advance
by some 15 per cent to around 2,100 by the year-end. He says that the market
is currently trading on 11 times 1994 earnings, and 'less than 10' on
prospective earnings for 1995. 'In relative terms, the Irish market still
looks cheap,' he says.
While the remainder of 1994 and 1995 may herald a renewed rally, the months
ahead will also bring a number of changes in the way the market operates.
The separation of the Dublin and London stock exchanges, originally planned
for 1993, is now anticipated for the end of 1994. Legislation necessary to
bring this into effect is to be presented in the Dail this autumn.
Second, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) hopes to have a
market-making system for gilts in place by next year, for the first time
since the market was established 200 years ago. The aim is to achieve
greater liquidity in Irish gilts, and thereby reduce government borrowing
costs and yield differentials relative to other European gilts. Insofar as
equity prices are currently being driven by gilt prices, smaller gilt price
differentials should also mean smaller p/e differentials with other European
equity markets.

Johannesburg underwent a sharp correction, taking its lead from weaker world
markets and the easier bullion price. The overall index was 96 lower at
5,592, industrials lost 109 to 6,477 and golds fell 40 to 4,733. Remgro lost
R2 to R26 and SAB fell R3 to R88.

<TEXT>
Continued weakness of the US dollar together with fears on inflation in both
the UK and US sent stock index futures plunging, writes Joel Kibazo.
By the close, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was at 2,864, down 71
on its previous finish and at a 26 point discount to its fair value premium.
The session was particularly volatile and September, having opened at 2,908,
reached a high of 2,915 after lunch before falling to the day's low of 2,860
towards the close. In traded options, total volume was 37,152 lots with
21,454, done in the FT-SE 100 option.

FT  25 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil switch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil saw its share price fall below 400p as one securities house
advised shareholders to switch their holdings into Lasmo ahead of the
deadline for the former's hostile takeover bid.
Enterprise shares were also unsettled by reports that the company might try
to buy 10 per cent of Lasmo in the market next week if it feels it will be
unable to acquire the necessary 50 per cent through straight acceptances.
The company was fighting a strong rearguard action as its US roadshow wound
down yesterday. A company spokesman said: 'We had quite a good reception
from the US institutions and we go into the final week confident that we
will win.'
Hoare Govett said the bid had 'no real industrial or financial synergy' but
recommended buying Lasmo because 'on a medium-term view Lasmo should
outperform Enterprise if the bid fails'. Enterprise fell 14 to 399p while
Lasmo was steady at 148p.
Chemicals group Hickson International fell 13 to 160p on exceptionally heavy
turnover of 2m shares in the wake of a swingeing forecast downgrade by Hoare
Govett.
The securities house cut its current year forecast by 20 per cent to Pounds
19m. The new figure is well below the previous range of analysts' forecasts
of Pounds 24m to Pounds 29m. The change is believed to reflect concerns
among institutional fund managers over the current trading outlook within
the company.
Chemicals group BOC was one of the few Footsie companies to remain in
positive territory during the day as traders stressed the company's
defensive qualities. However, the share price could not resist the final
onslaught on the market and saw its gain of 3 trimmed back to close
unchanged at 700p.
Broker downgrades hit Cadbury Schweppes as analysts reacted to a cautious
meeting with the drink and confectionery group's joint venture business with
Coca-Cola. Cola wars with own-label goods topped the agenda and analysts
reckoned on a hit to profits of up to Pounds 30m in the current year. Lehman
Brothers lopped Pounds 15m from its current year forecast, down to Pounds
455m, while for 1995 its estimate was cut from Pounds 525m to Pounds 495m.
NatWest Securities and Cazenove were also said to have reduced their
forecasts. The shares slid 11 to 412 1/2 p.
After weak sessions following Tuesday's profits warning, Hazlewood Foods
rallied 4 to 129p on speculation of a bid from Unigate. The dairy company is
said to be considering selling its stake in Dutch group Nutricia, which
could net Unigate around Pounds 250m. The shares were steady at 366p.
A Pounds 36.5m property deal provided some support for Ladbroke before the
shares trailed off 3 to 156p. There was brief activity in Savoy with
speculation over a new chairman. The shares jumped before falling to end the
day steady at 965p. Thorn retreated 29 to 1014p on dollar worries. Euro
Disney, the French theme park operator, lost 18 to 135p on concerns over the
outcome of its recent rights issue. Airtours gained a penny ahead of results
next week.
Property agency Chesterton, which came to the market at 100p on Thursday,
slipped a penny to 99p.
The poor market trend curtailed an early advance in British Aerospace which
followed reports that British Airways was to buy Airbus jets. The shares
closed 10 lower at 445p. BAe builds the wings of the Airbus aircraft and is
a 20 per cent stake holder in the Airbus consortium.
The press report that BA plans to replace its entire fleet of short-haul
Boeing 737 with Airbus jets, left shares in the UK carrier trailing 13 to
374p.
The weak dollar exacted a toll on engineering group Siebe which derives a
large part of its earnings from the US. The shares fell 18 to 516p.
Rolls-Royce gave up 7 to 174p, in trade of 4.9m with Strauss Turnbull said
to have urged investors to 'sell' the stock.
Eurotunnel firmed 2 to 280p, with dealers encouraged by news that most of
the outstanding stock from the company's Pounds 858m rights issue had been
successfully placed.

FT  25 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Newspapers hit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The shock decision by Mr Rupert Murdoch's The Times newspaper late on
Thursday to cut its cover price to 20p hit an intensely nervous publishing
sector and saw hard pressed shares tumble further.
The Times' move made a mockery of Thursday's Daily Telegraph price cut and
prompted some analysts to talk of a domino effect in the middle market area
held by the Daily Express and Daily Mail which could end up at the door of
the Daily Mirror.
Telegraph shares were also weighed down by questions hanging over the recent
12.5m stake by Hollinger, the Canadian publishing group controlled by Mr
Conrad Black, the Telegraph owner. However, after the market closed the
Stock Exchange cleared the newspaper. The shares fell 17 to 332p.
United Newspapers, whose Daily Express now costs 60 per cent more than The
Times, fell 25 to 485p, while Daily Mail Trust 'A' shares shed 33 to 870p.
There was concern that if those papers were forced to reduce their price the
end victim could be the Mirror, already squeezed by a cut-price Sun. Mirror
Group shares fell 4 to 130p, close to the flotation price three years ago.

FT  25 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome bucks the market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was the only company within the FT-SE 100
Index to remain in positive territory yesterday as the market took on board
research suggesting that it could be a takeover target. The shares were up
16 at best and ended the day 12 higher at 598p with 3.1m shares traded.
A note by US investment house Wertheim Schroder's arguing that Wellcome
Trust, which owns 40 per cent of Wellcome, would be happy to see moves from
a rival company ensured that few dealers were prepared to sell the stock.
When New York opened, US buying pushed the stock higher. However, Wellcome
claimed last night that there had been 'no significant change' in the US
holding over the past month. UBS yesterday said that it considered Wellcome
a buy on fundamental grounds regardless of takeover activity.

FT  25 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie at new 1994 low on dollar's
problems - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market plunged through its low point for the year yesterday,
closing at its lowest level since July 1993, as fears grew that the apparent
failure of central bank intervention to protect the dollar may force the US
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
Although equity trading was not heavy, share prices collapsed as the dollar
continued to fall. The FT-SE 100 Index declined nearly 66 points to close at
the day's low after one of the largest daily setbacks of the year. The final
reading showed the FT-SE Index down 65.8 at 2,876.6.
Interest rate fears were fuelled from the US market, where the Dow
Industrial Average was down 40 points when London closed. Almost the whole
of the Footsie 100 list was savaged, with the UK interest-related shares
vying with dollar stocks in the setback. The market closed without a glimmer
of recovery, with traders convinced that unless action was taken over the
weekend, the dollar and the securities markets would face a further pounding
next week.
British government bonds had a turbulent session. After falling at first as
the dollar weakened, gilt-edged securities quickly rallied and briefly moved
into positive territory when it was confirmed that the central banks had
taken action in the currency markets.
But the bond market turned down again sharply as selling of the dollar was
renewed. By the close of trading, short-dated gilts, the most closely linked
to UK base rates, were  3/8 down. The longs, continuing to express fears of
inflation ahead, shed . Index-linked gilts, the market's inflation hedge,
slipped  17/32 .
In the equity market, losses across the broad range of equities were
reflected in a fall of 62.7 to 3,374.2 on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which
covers an extended list of blue-chip and second-line stocks.
However, equity volume, as measured by the Seaq electronic network, recorded
a total of only 450.2m shares, a relatively low figure and nearly 17 per
cent down on Friday; non-Footsie shares made up about 56 per cent of
yesterday's total. The poor volume figure bore out comments from several
leading securities houses that the current weakness of UK equities has been
caused by unwillingness of the institutions to buy shares rather than by
heavy selling pressure.
Several leading securities firms again drew attention to valuations of
equities against bonds, suggesting that these implied that UK shares were
not overvalued at current levels. Traders said that there was 'some selling'
at the opening when international clients reacted to the fall in the US
dollar in New York and Tokyo. 'But after that it was too late to sell,' said
one dealer.
The Footsie managed to regain the 2,900 mark briefly when bonds turned
higher as the central banks intervened to support the US currency. This was
also seen by some optimists as an indication of underlying support for
equities.
But the finally convincing loss of the Footsie 2,900 level was an alarming
development for the equity chartists who now fear that the market could be
vulnerable down to the 2,800 mark - unless more determined action is taken
to settle the US currency.
Some comfort was also taken from the rapid, albeit temporary, recovery in
the bond market at mid-session. Volatility in this market has been a prime
factor in unsettling equities.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Support fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Central banks launched large scale co-ordinated intervention to support the
dollar but the US currency was unable to sustain brief gains, writes Motoko
Rich.
Taking their lead from the US Federal Reserve, a legion of central banks
repeatedly purchased the dollar in a move the markets had been anticipating
all week.
The dollar at first rallied after the intervention began in the European
afternoon, gaining more than a yen and about a pfennig and a half. But
although the Fed was still seen purchasing the US currency after 3:00 pm
GMT, the dollar lost most of its ground by the close of London trading.
The dollar ended in London at DM1.5972, down from DM1.6035. Against the yen,
it closed at Y100.900, down from Y101.150.
Analysts said the intervention had reinforced market cynicism about central
bank action. 'The intervention has been a miserable failure,' said Mr Tony
Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN/AMRO bank. 'They have not scared off
any speculative trading.'
Although later denied, reported comments from Bank of Japan governor Yasushi
Mieno about the inability of intervention to 'dictate currency levels' kept
the markets bearish.
The dollar was lolling below Y100.50 and DM1.5950 when the Fed began the
concerted intervention around 1330 GMT by buying dollars for Y100.95. It
then followed about ten minutes later by buying the US currency for
DM1.6070/80. In the meantime, other central banks had also started to buy
the dollar.
As many as 17 central banks bought dollars in an effort similar to the group
action taken on May 4. The extent of the intervention was understood to be
between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn, primarily from the Fed.
The central banks briefly turned sentiment towards the dollar, which rose to
a high of around DM1.61 and Y101.90. But the action failed to push the
dollar above key technical levels which analysts placed at DM1.6250 and
Y102.50.
'We have to see the intervention pushing the dollar to these key levels,'
said Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS. 'Without
that we would expect the technical aspects of trading to remain bearish.'
Mr Chertkow said the central bank move came too late. 'If it had occured
last week when the pressure first began, then maybe it would have turned the
market,' he said.
Sterling had a banner day against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5422 from
Dollars 1.5386, and rising above the Dollars 1.55 level in after-hours
trading. Against the D-Mark, it closed in London at DM2.463, from DM2.4671.
A significant drop in the UK current account deficit for the first quarter
gave the pound a boost, while the ailing dollar gave sterling further
support.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided liquidity of Pounds
159m after forecasting a revised shortage of Pounds 650m. The bank provided
late assistance of Pounds 390m.
In Europe, the D-Mark remained strong against the crosses. Against the
French franc, it closed in London at FFr3.425 from FFr3.422 and against the
lira, it closed at L984.6 from L982.6. Against the strong Swiss franc,
however, the D-Mark closed at SFr0.838, down from SFr0.842.

In general the pepper markets were rather slow this week in the absence of
fresh buying of forward positions. The price of white pepper declined
marginally to about USDollars 2,775-2,800 a tonne, cif, for August/December
shipment from origin. Spot white pepper commanded apremium of some USDollars
150 a tonne, which was regularly paid for smaller lots. Black pepper prices
were under little pressure from rpoducer offerings and remained fully
steady. Here too smaller lots were traded on the spot market at about
USDollars 1,700 a tonne, mainly for the fair average quality grades.

FT  25 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Bulls back off at metal exchange -
Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's commodity markets appeared to be heading for an up-beat end to the
week yesterday morning with aluminium, coffee and cocoa prices registering
significant gains. But the mood changed after lunch as the bulls went into
retreat.
Aluminium's rise, which took the three months delivery position at the
London Metal Exchange to a 39-month high of Dollars 1,505 a tonne, was
encouraged by news of a big fall in exchange warehouse stocks - the third in
a row - which traders saw as confirmation that the voluntary output
reductions announced following the greement reached by leading producing
countries in January were beginning to bite.
As the metal topped the Dollars 1,500 mark, however, concerns were raised
about the possibility that more remunerative prices might encourage
companies to reverse some of the cuts.
'An awful lot of producers who have cut back must now be wondering if they
should think about re-starting some of those pot-lines,' Mr Anthony Bird, of
industry specialists Anthony Bird and Associates, told the Reuters news
agency.
That helped to undermine sentiment and by the close the three months price
was back to Dollars 1,490.50 a tonne, up just Dollars 3 on the day and
Dollars 20 on the week.
The copper market had already begun drawing in its horns after its spike on
Thursday to a fresh 21-month high of Dollars 2,507 a tonne for three months
delivery.
Renewed profit-taking trimmed more off the gains after an early rally
yesterday and the three months price closed at Dollars 2,467.50 a tonne,
down Dollars 16 on the day but still Dollars 20 up on balance. The selling
was influenced by a smaller than expected LME stocks fall, traders said, and
by improved availability of metal for immediate delivery.
'Copper will get back above Dollars 2,500 and aluminium above Dollars 1,500,
once the reactions are out of the way,' one trader told Reuters, however.
'When that happens we will see the others being bought also.'
The London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee ended a see-sawing week near
its lows after a strong early rise yesterday was surrendered during the
afternoon.
The rally, which lifted the September futures price by Dollars 85 to Dollars
2,325 a tonne, had been prompted by a warning of a possible frost in
Brazilian growing areas at the weekend. But traders quickly came to the
conclusion that the rise had been overdone, if not unjustified, and the
price subsided to end at Dollars 2,255 a tonne, up Dollars 15 on the day but
Dollars 79 down on the week.
'It's been a tale of rumour and counter-rumour today,' a dealer told
Reuters. 'There was a period of shortcovering earlier, then when the
forecasts were seen as not so bad there was light general selling.'
'It seems it's going to be cold (in Brazil) and there's a possibility of
frost,' said another, 'but it could be a case of buy the rumour, sell the
confirmation.'
Cocoa futures followed a similar pattern, and for the similar reasons. the
September LCE price bounced to Pounds 991 a tonne before closing Pounds 11
down at Pounds 965. That took the fall on the week to Pounds 71.
At London's International Petroleum Exchange Brent blend crude oil futures
traded uncertainly in its new, higher range, ending the week a few cents
lower. But traders remained optimistic that fundamentals remained positive
and that the upward trend was intact.

FT  25 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kodak hires Sculley as part-time
adviser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple Computer, has been
hired as a part-time marketing adviser by Eastman Kodak, the photographic
products group in the throes of a shake-up.
Mr Sculley, who resigned as chief executive of Apple in June last year,
built the computer company into a leading global brand.
He helped do the same for PepsiCo, the soft-drink manufacturer, where he was
a senior executive before joining Apple in 1983.
Mr Sculley, who runs his own consulting firm in New York, will spend about
25 per cent of his time on Kodak business, building its digital imaging and
brand marketing strategies.
Mr George Fisher, the former chief executive of Motorola, the electronics
group, who took over as Kodak chairman late last year, said he had worked
closely with Mr Sculley for the past 10 years.
'I am confident John can help Kodak develop a more aggressive marketing
approach,' he said.
Yesterday's appointment is good news for Mr Sculley, who suffered
embarrassing publicity earlier this year when he resigned from Spectrum
Information Technologies, a wireless communications group, after less than
four months as chairman, alleging that he had been deceived about accounting
problems.
Mr Fisher is making sweeping changes at Kodak, which has suffered for years
from lacklustre financial results. He is keen to push the company
aggressively into digital electronic imaging, which in the past has been
overshadowed by the group's traditional silver halide photographic
technology.
Kodak is still looking for a new senior executive to lead its digital
operations and is said to have been holding talks with Mr Don Strickland,
Apple's vice-president of imaging and a former Kodak employee.

FT  25 JUN 94 / International Company News: Repsol's promising new chapter -
Enagas acquisition will lift Spanish energy group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Oscar Fanjul, the publicity-shy economist who is chairman of Repsol,
Spain's partly-privatised energy and chemicals group, can afford a bit of
chutzpah at the corporation's annual meeting in Madrid today.
A week ago Mr Fanjul clinched an important deal, opening a promising chapter
in Repsol's history.
Gas Natural, which is 45 per cent owned by Repsol, bought Enagas, the
state-owned importer of natural gas and supplier to leading industries, to
become the virtual monopoly importer and supplier of gas in the fast-growing
domestic market.
Repsol, whose shares are traded in London, New York, Tokyo and Madrid,
becomes a hybrid among energy corporations through the addition of a greatly
increased gas business to its profitable oil exploration, production,
refining and marketing activities.
'Repsol is now quite unlike all the other energy groups,' says Mr Luis
Prota, an analyst at Madrid securities house AB Asesores. 'No other oil
company has this sort of big gas business, intergrating supply and sales.'
The Pta51.2bn (Dollars 379m) acquisition of 91 per cent of Enagas lifts Gas
Natural's quota of the domestic gas market from 41 per cent to just over 90
per cent.
Gas Natural has become the third-biggest gas company in Europe in terms of
market capitalisation and the fourth in terms of clients.
Gas Natural bought Enagas well below the Pta80bn-Pta120bn price range
suggested when the takeover negotiations began nine months ago.
This pleased the markets, as did the terms of the deal. Repsol, together
with La Caixa, the large Catalan savings bank that has a 25 per cent stake
in Gas Natural, avoided the investment burden of a gas pipeline being built
by Enagas to link Spain to Algeria's gas fields via Morocco.
The pipeline, due to be operational by the end of 1996, will now be built by
a separate company, called Sagane, that will remain in public ownership.
Gas Natural has an option, but not an obligation as was originally intended,
to buy Sagane from the government in 2000 for Pta50bn, a price that
represents a fraction of the cost of the state's investment in building the
fixed gas link.
The pipeline investment, and the original purchase figures, had prompted
market fears that an Enagas takeover would drag down Gas Natural's
profitability as well as Repsol's. But the energy corporation struck what Mr
Juan Carlos Calvo of Madrid brokers FG called 'a very positive deal for
itself'.
Repsol officials say the takeover has given the energy corporation a new
lease of life at a time when the domestic oil market, 60 per cent controlled
by Repsol, has become increasingly mature.
Mr Fanjul made the gas business a priority for the corporation in 1985,
shortly after he became chairman, and he now calls the strategy 'one of
those correct decisions of which we should feel proud'.
Repsol has spent nearly 10 years working towards the Enagas acquisition. In
the late 1980s it bought into regional gas distributors to build up Gas
Madrid which it owned outright. In 1991 it merged Gas Madrid with the
Barcelona-based Catalana de Gas, in which it had a 15 per cent stake, to
create the nationwide Gas Natural company.
The acquisitions had full government support because there was concern that
the fractured domestic gas market would fall prey to foreign companies. Gas
Madrid's merger with Catalana de Gas, for example, pre-empted a bid for the
Barcelona company by British Gas.
Over the past five years Repsol's gas business has raised its contribution
to group operating income to 25 per cent from 9 per cent. The weighting of
gas within Repsol will increase because of the Enagas acquisition, but it
was set to rise even without the takeover because of the new momentum the
Spanish government has given to natural gas.
Under the national energy plan, which gave the go-ahead for the Algerian
pipeline to lift domestic gas supply, natural gas will have doubled its
contribution to national energy consumption from the current 6 per cent to
at least 12 per cent by 2000.
Repsol could not have timed the expansion of its gas business better: the
turnover of Gas Natural-Enagas is likely to be Pta250bn this year and is
forecast to be more than Pta600bn by 2004.
Analysts believe Repsol's after-tax profit could increase annually by as
much as 15 per cent over the next three years.
This is the sort of message Mr Fanjul will give to shareholders today, and
the timing is favourable. Repsol is expected to make a Pta200bn-Pta300bn
global share offer later this year that will reduce the government's stake
in the energy group to about 20 per cent from 41 per cent.

FT  25 JUN 94 / International Company News: Statoil refinery scheme hit by
delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The construction of a condensate facility to expand the Kalundborg refinery
in Denmark is expected to exceed budget by at least DKr1bn (Dollars 156m)
and be delayed by at least one year, Statoil, the Norwegian state oil
company and owner of the refinery, said yesterday.
The facility is intended to expand annual production capacity by 1.5m tonnes
to 4.8m tonnes and allow output of light oil products to meet stricter
environmental standards. It is expected to come on stream in the fourth
quarter of 1995. The budget for the project was DKr2.2bn but this was
adjusted to DKr2.6bn last January.
'The increases reflect delays and deficiencies in the engineering work that
have had a knock-on effect in the construction phase and have created
substantial extra work,' Statoil said.
The disclosure comes six years after a NKr6.4bn (Dollars 905m) cost over-run
on Statoil's Mongstad refinery expansion project in Norway.
This exceeded Statoil's equity capital at the time by 27 per cent.
That budget overshoot forced the resignation of Mr Arve Johnsen, president
and chief executive - replaced by Mr Harald Norvik, Statoil's current
president - and a far-reaching reorganisation of the company. The group had
to seek a capital injection.
The main contractor is US-based Ralph M. Parsons, while Exxon is the
technical adviser to the project.
'These cost overruns undermine the profitability of the project compared
with original plans. However, the project has come so far that there is no
question of halting it. To ensure an acceptable completion of the project,
we have made substantial organisation changes,' said Mr Norvik.
Statoil estimates the net rate of return on the project at 6 per cent, or 10
per cent before tax.
In September, the board is to be presented with findings of an internal
audit of the project which is under way. A government inquiry into the
affair may be called for.

FT  25 JUN 94 / International Company News: France may sell CNP stake in
September
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government could sell off part of CNP Assurances, the country's
biggest life insurance company, as early as September.
Mr Patrice Ract Madoux, finance and international director, said continued
weakness in the French equity markets might make the part-privatisation of
CNP more feasible than that of Assurances Generales de France, the large
composite insurance company which is also scheduled to be sold.
The government sold off Union des Assurances de Paris, its biggest insurer,
earlier this year.
Mr Ract Madoux is expecting the government to sell a stake of between 30 per
cent and 35 per cent of CNP, raising between FFr5bn and FFr6bn (Dollars
899m-Dollars 1.1bn).
The group hopes to attract an overseas investor and has been targeting
potential parties in North America and Europe.
The state would retain a 40.5 per cent interest, with the savings banks
owning about 10 per cent and the post office about 17.5 per cent.
'If the market is soft we may be a test for government. We are planning to
be ready by early September,' said Mr Ract Madoux.
'Given the state of the market it may be easier to sell a medium-sized
company. It would be more digestible.'
CNP has grown rapidly in recent years, increasing its sales by 50 per cent
in 1993 alone.
Mr Ract Madoux said the group's sales through 17,000 post offices, 6,000
savings bank branches and 4,000 tax offices had all increased, partly
because of the effectiveness of training programmes.
CNP, which specialises in a relatively simple life insurance savings
product, has a market share of about 17 per cent.
The commission payments it makes to intermediaries are much smaller than
those paid by France's composite companies.

<TEXT>
Sherritt, the Canadian metals group, is to form a joint venture with Cuba's
Compania General de Niquel to mine, process and market nickel and cobalt.
The partnership is the latest move by Canadian mining and energy companies
to expand their presence in Cuba in the face of US economic sanctions.
Several European and Mexican industrial companies have gained a foothold in
Cuba as the climate towards foreign investors improves.
The joint venture will include a mine and ore-processing facilities at Moa
Bay in Cuba, as well Sherritt's refinery at Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.
Sherritt buys a large portion of Moa Bay's output as feedstock for the
refinery.
The two companies said they planned to expand and modernise the Moa Bay
facilities, and would set up a joint marketing company.

FT  25 JUN 94 / International Company News: Low crude prices bring profits
warning from Elf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group privatised earlier this year, yesterday
warned that first-half recurring operating profits would fall by about 20
per cent, compared with the same period in 1993, and that net profits would
fall by a greater proportion.
In the first half of 1993, Elf achieved recurring operating profits of
FFr5.6bn (Dollars 1bn) and recurring net profits of FFr2.1bn. Yesterday, Elf
shares fell by FFr14 to FFr390, compared with a price of FFr385 at which
they were offered to the public in February.
Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman, said the group's exploration and production
activities had been hit by low crude oil prices during the first few months
of the year. Although the price of Brent crude has recovered to more than
Dollars 17 a barrel, the average price for the year to date of just under
Dollars 15 a barrel compares with an average of Dollars 18.30 for the first
half of last year.
Mr Jaffre said the impact of this factor had been lessened by reductions in
exploration expenditures and through cost-cutting measures. However,
industry analysts added that Elf was particularly sensitive to oil price
movements.
'Elf is a much bigger producer than most other European oil groups, such as
Total,' said Mr Mark Flannery, oil and gas analyst at BZW. He said the rise
in the oil price over the past few months should prompt a strong recovery in
profits in Elf's exploration and production businesses.
First-half profits at Elf have been affected by weak demand in the refining
and marketing sector in France and other principal European markets. In
addition, operating income in this sector was reduced by the costs of
restructuring the company's Minol service station network in eastern
Germany.
The decline in profits will be amplified at the net level because of an
increase in financial charges, according to Mr Jaffre.
The Elf chairman said measures were being implemented to reduce the group's
debts, which amounted to FFr52.5bn at the end of last year. He said he hoped
to realise about FFr5bn from the sale of assets this year as part of his
strategy of reducing borrowings at the group.
Elf sounded a positive note with respect to its chemicals operations.
According to the company, restructuring measures had reduced production
costs while economic recovery in Europe had led to improved sales volumes.
As a consequence, Elf said there had been a 'noticeable recovery of
results', in the first half of the year.

Pounds 53m valuation

<TEXT>
JBA International is coming to the market by way of a placing which values
the Birmingham-based computer software house at Pounds 52.8m.
Some 11.9m ordinary shares are being placed at 160p, or 36.5 per cent of the
enlarged share capital. The rest of the stock is held by the management and
institutions, although International Business Machines has retained its
holding of just over 5 per cent.
About Pounds 12.4m is being raised. After expenses and redemption of
preference shares, some Pounds 9.6m will be available to the company to help
fund its expansion in mainland Europe. The placing is sponsored by Kleinwort
Benson which is also underwriting the offer.
At the placing price, the p/e based on last year's earnings is 16.3,
slightly lower than the sector average.
Mr Alan Vickery, chairman, said the offer price was lower than he had
anticipated two months ago, but indicated the state of the market place
where stocks had not only to reflect quality but also keen pricing.
JBA specialises in writing software for IBM's AS/400 midrange computer
family; it claims to be the US computer manufacturer's largest business
associate in Europe.
Pre-tax profits last year were Pounds 4.7m when about one third of its
Pounds 74.5m turnover came from the US.
Mr Vickery said there had been some interest in the placing from US
investors.

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Kewill Pounds 4m in the black and resumes
dividend payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kewill Systems, the USM-quoted computer software and systems group, is
paying dividends again, the trauma of struggles with Weigang, its
ill-starred former subsidiary, behind it.
For the year to March 31 it is proposing a final of 5p, the first for two
years, from earnings per share of 23p, against losses of 50.99p.
The payment is a reflection of a capital reconstruction and a much improved
performance. The shares rose 9p to 284p.
Profits before tax reached a record Pounds 4.04m, compared with a loss of
Pounds 5.19m restated for FRS 3 and struck after a loss of Pounds 5.63m on
the sale of Weigang, a German software house.
Turnover fell 4.7 per cent to Pounds 31.8m, against Pounds 33.3m, which
included Pounds 2.34m from Weigang. The decline also reflected the fall in
hardware values affecting the computer industry.
Borrowings were reduced from Pounds 3.96m to Pounds 77,000 during the year
and have since been reduced further. The interest charge fell from a net
Pounds 809,000 to Pounds 305,000.
Kewill specialises in soft-ware for manufacturing and accountancy and has a
new and fast growing interest in electronic document interchange.
Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman, said there were few signs of new investment
yet among companies in the UK and Europe but trading in the US was much
improved with profits up to Pounds 1.21m, compared with Pounds 280,000.
'New products, improving economic conditions and further reductions in
operating costs all point to continued profitable growth over the coming
year' he said.
COMMENT
The saga of Kewill and Weigang, purchased for a song in 1991, should serve
as a cautionary tale of overseas expansion for small companies. The
acquisition went wrong and Kewill's management found itself out of its depth
in a foreign country and a foreign language. An investment of Pounds 500,000
turned, in two years, into a goodwill write-off of Pounds 5.6m by the time
the company was disposed of to its management. During this sorry episode,
however, Kewill's basic business remained sound and profitable despite the
recession. Its software is generally well regarded and it is looking to
acquire compatible companies - in the UK, this time. With Weigang a lesson
learned, the shares, on a historic p/e of 12, are cheap.

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Strong second half helps MMI recover to
Pounds 1.21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MMI, which through a series of acquisitions has transformed itself from a
sponsorship and financial marketing company into a business communications
group, consolidated its recovery at the interim stage with a strong second
half, reporting a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.21m for the year to
end-February.
The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 473,000 last time and was
achieved after redundancy and other one-off costs of Pounds 128,000.
Turnover rose from Pounds 733,000 to Pounds 14.7m.
Earnings per share emerged at 2.05p (2.87p losses).
In July last year the company acquired Pelham Communications and its
subsidiary, Park Avenue Productions, along with Mediamix, a corporate
publishing company.
The directors said that Park Avenue had had an excellent year, and made the
main contribution to the profit performance.
These purchases are to be enhanced by the proposed acquisition of WMGO
Group, in connection with which a placing and open offer involving the issue
of 25.2m new ordinary 1p shares is being made.
Some 11.9m shares have been conditionally placed with institutional
investors at 27 1/2 p apiece, subject to an open offer to existing
shareholders.
On completion of the acquisition it is intended to change the company's name
to WMGO Group.
Having gained the necessary approvals to reduce its share premium account by
the amount of the deficit on the profit and loss account, MMI is able to pay
dividends out of profits. Accordingly, directors have declared a special
interim of 0.5p for the current year.

Mr Algy Cluff, chairman of Cluff Resources, the UK-based gold mining company
operating in Zimbabwe and Ghana, said at the annual meeting that he expected
next month to sign an agreement with the Tanzanian government for Cluff to
explore an area of 190 sq km on the shores of Lake Victoria.
He said the area contained the Geita mine, once East Africa's biggest gold
producer but which closed in 1966.
Development of the Freda underground gold mine in Zimbabwe was on schedule
and on budget, said Mr Cluff. Recent drilling and exploration work made him
confident that 'the Freda mine will be producing gold well into the next
century'.

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Stoddard Sekers advances to Pounds 2.1m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite a dull trading environment, Stoddard Sekers International, the
carpets and furnishing fabrics maker, lifted pre-tax profits by 42 per cent
from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 2.14m in the year ended March 31.
Turnover rose 8 per cent to Pounds 59.7m (Pounds 55.4m) as a result of a
full contribution from BMK (10 months in 1992-93) and the introduction of
fabric supply to the automotive industry.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 820,000 (Pounds 920,000) and net earnings
per share were 1p higher at 2.6p. The recommended final dividend of 0.85p
makes a total of 1.6p (1.5p).
Mr Ralph Ellis, chief executive, said the group was well structured to
achieve acceptable performance at the current level of activity and 'we
remain confident that we will be able to sustain steady positive growth'.

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tepnel shares fall on higher losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Tepnel Diagnostics, the biotechnology company, fell 28p to 121p
yesterday following the announcement of increased pre-tax losses for the six
months to March 31.
The shares have fallen from a high of 185p this year and are close to the
price of 120p at which they were floated on the USM in September 1992, but
below the 175p at which the company raised Pounds 2m in a placing in April
this year.
Pre-tax losses increased from Pounds 483,000 to Pounds 1.01m as a result of
increased spending on research and development. Losses per share were more
than doubled at 4.4p (2.1p).
Since the period end, the company has launched one of its core products,
Faras or food antibiotic residue analysis system.
The company is intending to change its name to Tepnel Life Sciences 'to
reflect the scope and potential of the company'.

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Bullers anticipates return to the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullers, the giftware and decorative products group which earlier this year
expanded into media services, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds
1.23m for the six months to December 31.
The deficit, which included losses of Pounds 284,000 from discontinued
operations, compared with losses of Pounds 1.42m for the year ended June 30
1993 and was struck on turnover of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 2.43m).
Mr David Cunningham, chairman, stressed that the 'poor' outcome preceded the
acquisition of Clashfleet for a maximum Pounds 2.8m, funded by a placing and
open offer, and a substantial capital reorganisation and debt conversion.
He anticipated that 'all the group's subsidiaries will be firmly into
profit' in the second half of the current year with 'significant profits'
for 1995.
Losses per share emerged at 0.93p (1.22p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a patchy first half, Vistec Group, the USM-quoted computer systems and
software concern, made some headway to end the year to April 30 with pre-tax
profits ahead by 4 per cent to Pounds 3.41m, compared with Pounds 3.28m
adjusted for FRS 3.
Turnover rose 16 per cent to Pounds 45m while earnings per share under FRS 3
came through at 2.06p (1.88p). An increased final dividend of 0.275p is
recommended for a total of 0.4p (0.375p).
Vistec said second half growth was accelerated by the acquisition of ISO
Communications last November and Data Logic Communication Services in
February 1994. These purchases had broadened the group's range of network
service products and expanded its client base.

Profits before tax at Syltone advanced 18 per cent during the 12 months to
March 31, underlining the encouraging stance adopted at the halfway stage by
Mr Tony Clegg, chairman of the Bradford-based transport engineering group.
On turnover ahead to Pounds 39.9m (Pounds 36.7m) - some 60 per cent of the
group's sales go to export markets - the pre-tax line rose from Pounds 2.13m
to Pounds 2.52m. Although still short of the Pounds 2.87m reported for
1991-92, Mr Clegg said: 'We are heading in the right direction and are not
short of ideas for expansion.'
The core business, Drum, which is the UK market leader in truck discharge
equipment, reported strengthened order books and higher profits, although
activities in continental Europe lagged growth elsewhere. The group has
severed its link with Alfons Haar, its distributor in Germany.
Fully diluted earnings per share emerged at 8.83p (7.35p). The final
dividend is 3.31p, making a total of 4.935p (4.725p adjusted for scrip
issue).

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Prudential pays Pounds 73.5m for Welsh
shopping centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prudential has bought the Cwmbran shopping centre, the largest centre in
Wales, for Pounds 73.5m from Ladbroke Group and a trust belonging to Mr Leo
Noe, chairman of Bourne End, the property company.
The property comprises 170 shops occupying 750,000 sq ft. Tenants include
Marks and Spencer, J Sainsbury, Asda and Boots.
Ladbroke's sale of its 50 per cent stake for Pounds 36.8m represents a small
surplus over book value at the end of 1993. The initial yield on the deal
was about 6.5 per cent.
The deal brings the total sales of commercial property by Ladbroke this year
to about Pounds 140m. Mr Peter George, group chief executive, said that
negotiations were continuing in respect of other properties and further
disposals were anticipated during the remainder of the year.
The deal is the sixth property acquisition exchanged or completed by the
Prudential this week. It has spent Pounds 400m on buying a Wolverhampton
shopping centre, a parcel of properties from Burton Property Trust and a 50
per cent share of Wimpey's Little Britain office scheme in the City of
London.
Mr Chris Taylor, property investment director of the Prudential, said that
the insurer was continuing to look for potential acquisitions. 'Now the
investment market has gone off the boil, it is easier to find value.'
Eskmuir Properties, the property investment company owned by the Laing
family, has bought Pounds 24m of investment property, to take its portfolio
to a total value of about Pounds 170m.
Eskmuir said it 'had taken advantage of the recent softening of the market'.
The average yield was more than 8 per cent.
It has bought its own building in London's West End, as well as an office
building in Watford, Hertfordshire, three Leeds office buildings, and four
warehouse properties.

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: EuroDollar priced at 220p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in EuroDollar, the UK's second largest car hire group which is coming
to market via a placing and public offer, were priced yesterday at 220p,
valuing the group at Pounds 107.9m.
EuroDollar, the subject of a management buy-out from TSB last year, had
originally planned to issue its prospectus and pricing details on Wednesday.
However, the group postponed the flotation in the wake of turbulent market
conditions earlier in the week in order to continue book-building.
The group, which has a UK fleet of about 12,000 vehicles and operates from
107 branches across the country, claimed a 10 per cent share of the
fragmented Pounds 583m domestic car hire market last year.
EuroDollar has specialised in the business rental market and 77 per cent of
its UK rental income comes from corporate customers. In the year to March
31, the group reported pre-tax profits from continuing operations of Pounds
12.6m on turnover of Pounds 72.8m.
The issue, which is sponsored and fully underwritten by Schroders, comprises
22.7m shares of which 18.3m are being issued by the company with the
remainder sold by existing shareholders.
The offer will raise about Pounds 37.7m net of expenses, which will be used
to fund the redemption of the outstanding preference share capital, held by
the institutional investors who participated in the buy-out.
Of the total, some 17m shares have been placed with institutional and other
investors and the remaining 5.68m are being offered for sale to the public.
Following the flotation, institutional shareholders will hold about 14.9m
shares (30.5 per cent) and the group's directors will hold 6.98m shares,
representing a 14.2 per cent stake.
Yesterday Mr Ian Mosley, chief executive, said he was pleased with the price
which was broadly in line with expectations. He said the issue had received
good support from 'in excess of 50 institutions'.
SG Warburg Securities is broker to the offer and share dealings are due to
begin on July 8.

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Float values UCM at Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The weak stock market has not stopped Universal Ceramic Materials' flotation
plans as the manufacturer of refractory and heating element products
yesterday announced it had placed 6.97m shares at 86p, giving it a value of
Pounds 19m.
UCM has had to compromise, however, on the amount of new cash it can raise.
Against hopes of between Pounds 8m and Pounds 10m, it will raise just Pounds
6m. After redemption of preference shares and expenses it will receive some
Pounds 2m.
Mr Bob Hughes, chief executive, said that though the climate had been
difficult, he was delighted with the outcome of the placing.
Sponsors Beeson Gregory had managed to get the placing away with a price
comparable to expectations just a day later than planned, after discussions
with Scottish institutions earlier in the week.
Delaying the flotation any longer would have hindered plans to expand
alumina capacity, to prepare for the withdrawal from the continental
European market of two large competitors, he said.
UCM reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 683,000 to Pounds 1.7m for 1993
on sales 12 per cent higher at Pounds 26.7m. Mr Hughes said sales in the
current year were ahead of 1993.
After flotation, the company expects to be less than 20 per cent geared.
The board, which is selling 872,094 shares, is expected to hold 15 per cent
of UCM. A consortium of venture capitalists will hold 40 per cent.

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Azlan shares fall 10% on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Azlan Group, a distributor of advanced computer networking
products, fell 10 per cent yesterday following a warning that profits in the
first half of the current year would not match those of last year.
The shares were marked down from 280p to 252p despite results for the year
to March 31 which saw sales rise 49 per cent, from Pounds 41.2m to Pounds
61.5m, and pre-tax profits grow from Pounds 2.95m to Pounds 3.87m.
Earnings per share came to 12.4p (8.4p).
The group, which came to the main market last November at 230p, plans to pay
a final dividend of 2p - as indicated at the time of the flotation.
Mr David Randall, managing director, said the results were achieved by
continued growth in the UK and improved performances in Germany and Denmark.
He said profitability in the first half of the current year would be reduced
because of a change in buying patterns among customers.
They were moving from repair and maintenance of existing equipment to the
purchase of new systems. This required a longer buying cycle. Orders and
prospective orders were at an all-time high, Mr Randall stated.
Azlan had, furthermore, decided to introduce new and more complex products
and phase out older technologies: 'This strategy, while limiting UK sales
growth in the short term, is enabling us to maintain product gross margin
percentages while phasing in a series of new products', he said.
Mr Randall added that the majority of the year's profits would be made in
the second half.

FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: When price cuts prove price sensitive - The
reaction of the Stock Exchange to recent Telegraph share sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The speed with which the Stock Exchange moved to investigate recent trading
in The Telegraph shares may reflect the determination of Mr Michael
Lawrence, the new chief executive, to give more focus to its regulatory
role. But its equally swift clearing of last month's Hollinger share sale
came as little surprise to City lawyers.
An insider dealing specialist from a leading City firm said: 'When a sale of
that size is proposed there would be such close scrutiny to ensure there was
no unpublished price-sensitive information involved that I find it
inconceivable that there would be any evidence connecting the sale with the
Telegraph price cut.'
The freedom of directors of listed companies to deal in their shares is
restricted by the listing rules of the Stock Exchange. These include a model
code which forms the minimum rules a company must adopt to cover directors'
dealings.
It requires directors to receive clearance from the chairman or other
designated director for any dealings in the company's shares. Such clearance
must not be given for deals during 'close' periods ahead of announcement of
financial figures.
For a company that reports quarterly, like The Telegraph, the close period
covers the month immediately preceding the announcement of figures. So
Hollinger, which is controlled by Mr Conrad Black, The Telegraph's chairman,
would have been barred from selling shares in the month up to May 13 when
The Telegraph announced strong first quarter figures. The sale was made six
days later.
Dealings are also prohibited in 'any period when there exists any matter
which constitutes unpublished price sensitive information in relation to the
company's securities (whether or not the director has knowledge of such
matter) and the proposed dealing would take place after the time when it has
become reasonably probable that an announcement will be required in relation
to that matter'.
The Stock Exchange investigation has found no evidence that a cut in The
Daily Telegraph's cover price - which has proved highly sensitive for The
Telegraph share price - was contemplated at the time of the Hollinger stake
sale.
There have been very few successful insider dealing prosecutions against
directors, largely because of the requirement for trades to be cleared by
other board members. The biggest to date was the conviction in 1991 of Mr
Ivor Goodman, former chairman of Unigroup, the Leeds-based timber and
clothing company. He received an 18-month prison sentence after pleading
guilty to selling Pounds 1.2m of shares in the company just before it
announced worse-than-expected figures.
The Stock Exchange is thought to be pursuing investigations into sales of
Telegraph shares by employees ahead of the price cut announcement. But
insider dealing experts believe it is very unlikely that prosecutions will
result.
The new insider dealing rules which came into force in March prohibit
someone from dealing in securities when in possession of information
relating to the securities, which is 'specific or precise' and which if made
public would have a significant effect on the securities' price.
Given the number of Telegraph employees who own shares in the company, there
is always a steady flow of share trades. So it is likely that some employees
sold shares in the run up to the price cut when there was increasing
internal speculation about such a move.
A leading lawyer said that in these circumstances it would be easy to mount
a legal defence even if such sales had been prompted by the speculation.
'The prosecution would have to show that the information was 'specific and
precise' and that the defendant knew it came from an inside source, and was
not just a rumour.'

<TEXT>
Sir, Re Observer's story, 'Checking out' (June 22), there cannot be many
visitors to Moscow over the past few years who regret the (temporary?)
closure of the Rossiya Hotel. This building was constructed, I believe, for
the Olympic Games which were not in fact held in Moscow as planned. However,
local folklore opined that the cockroaches were brought in by foreign
athletes taking part in the substitute Goodwill Games.
As conference organisers it has been our lot to be accommodated at the
Rossiya from time to time and delegates, speakers and staff have all
suffered the indignities of these light-sensitive creatures. Our prize for
fortitude however goes to Mrs Barbara Mills who spoke at our event,
Europe-USSR law and co-operation, in 1991 when director of the Serious Fraud
Office. At a farewell dinner during which discussion turned to 'roaches she
admitted that, as she had not had a single light bulb in her room for two
days, she was unaware of the problem.

Sir, Those who think reserving 10 per cent of the shares in a privatised
Post Office ('PO staff may get free shares in sell-off', June 20) is a waste
of scarce equity might examine the evidence in the US. Employees own an
average 12 per cent equity in more than a quarter of the Fortune 500
industrials. This is not altruism. An index of 265 public companies where
employees own at least 10 per cent of the equity, compiled by a team at
Rutgers University, outperformed the Standard and Poors 500 Index by 26 per
cent over 11 quarters to September 1993. Nigel Mason,

FT  25 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Part-time workers need to avoid
benefits trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ASHBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It Is encouraging to learn that the UK chancellor is investigating
ideas for 'improving the workings of the labour market in a humane way'
(Economic Viewpoint, June 23). May one therefore ask that he address head-on
the fact that registered unemployed people are, in effect, excluded by the
benefit system from the main growth sector in the economy: part-time
working.
Nowadays, many unemployed people say that they probably have a better chance
of finding two part-time jobs, which together would offer an adequate
overall income, than one full-time job. The problem is, however, that under
the current rules they need to find both part-time jobs simultaneously if
they are to be able to leave the register without falling straight into the
'benefit trap'.
The best way of helping them avoid this would be to offer to pay the
long-term unemployed a 'portfolio worker's allowance' for, say, a period of
six months, once they have accepted one part-time job. This would give them
a proper breathing space to find a second source of part-time income that
fits comfortably alongside the first - or, maybe, persuade their employer to
convert the part-time job into a full-time one.
The idea is being piloted by Training and Enterprise Councils in
Lincolnshire and south London, and the results are encouraging. To make a
significant impact, however, there would need to be a national initiative,
with national marketing to the unemployed.
The idea of a portfolio worker's allowance is probably the best, and
simplest, idea that has been developed for some years to help the long-term
unemployed. It would also be cost-effective for the Treasury. If the
chancellor adopted this idea, many thousands of unemployed adults could use
it to gain access to real jobs.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Japanese warm to vin ordinaire: Cheap French wine is one
pleasant consequence of the strong yen, but there is also pain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the world's leading central banks agonise over the yen's historic leap
through Y100 to the dollar this week, ordinary Japanese people are having a
ball.
A Japanese consumer might celebrate by treating himself to a prime US steak
for lunch, washed down with a bottle of French wine or Belgian beer. He
could then step into his new Cherokee jeep for a drive to the local travel
agent, where he might book a beach holiday in Hawaii, likely to cost less
than a golfing trip to Hokkaido.
These are examples of the formerly expensive foreign treats being snapped up
by consumers, enriched by a currency that has risen 35 per cent, in trade
weighted terms, since the start of last year.
Imports of beef, mostly US and Australian, rose by a third in the year to
March; beer imports multiplied fivefold in the first four months of this
year, and wine imports doubled. Car imports rose by nearly half last month,
the seventh monthly rise running, to gain a record 8.6 per cent market
share, led by US cars with a 60.6 per cent volume rise. Meanwhile, a record
5.2m Japanese travelled abroad in the first five months of this year, nearly
16 per cent more than the same period of 1993.
Their appetites sharpened by more than three years of economic decline,
Japanese people have acquired a taste for a bargain.
Some - but by no means all - the consequences of the yen's strength have
been good for the economy. A discount shopping spree, for example, was
thought to be a factor in a jump in private consumption, by an annualised
5.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year.
This spree helped import volumes grow by 16.1 per cent in the year to last
month, the main cause of a sharp 15.9 per cent drop in the trade surplus
over the same period. It was the first clear sign that the politically
troublesome current account gap - a factor in the yen's rise - is starting
to shrink.
'The boon to consumers will go much further this time than in the previous
round of yen appreciation, because people have become genuinely more value
oriented,' says Mr Dick Beason, senior economist at James Capel Pacific.
Evidence that Japan's new taste for French wine and US cars could have some
way to run is that foreign goods still only represent just over 14 per cent
of domestic demand - well below the OECD average of 24 per cent. So Japan's
consumers can be expected to reach for their corkscrews and propose a toast
if the yen should rise again.
There is, of course, a painful side to the yen's fluctuations. Nowhere is
the anguish worse than in the boardrooms of Japan's manufacturing companies.
They have seen the yen value of overseas earnings squeezed since the 1985
Plaza accord to restrain the dollar's value started the yen's rising trend.
Another turn of the screw is unwelcome, when Japan is in the fragile early
stage of a recovery from its longest economic downturn in postwar years - 37
months according to the government's Economic Planning Agency.
It is even less welcome when the
minority coalition government is facing a no-confidence motion, paralysing
attempts to resolve the dispute with the US over barriers to imports, and
casting doubt on the substance of the package of deregulation and tax
reforms, due to be published on Tuesday.
'The yen's extraordinary sharp appreciation could not only nip the recovery
in business conditions in the bud, but also destroy the country's
manufacturing industry,' warns Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren
employers' federation.
Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Keidanren employers' federation,
estimates that, if the yen sticks around Y100 to the dollar for the next
year, gross domestic product will shrink 0.8 per cent over the same period.
That compares with the government's target of GDP growth of 2.4 per cent
this year.
A similar, but stronger jump in the Japanese currency this time last year
killed signs of a recovery then. The yen rose by 17 per cent from January
1993 to last year's high of nearly Y100 in August, receding to Y110 by the
end of the year. By yesterday it was at Y101.1, 12 per cent above its 1994
opening rate.
Each Y1 fall against the dollar over a year slices 3.4 percentage points
from manufacturing industry's taxable profits, according to Nikko
Securities. The Economic Planning Agency reckons that only one in 200 of
Japan's exporters can break even at Y100 to the dollar.
Yet foreign economists - and some Japanese companies - believe that Mr
Toyoda and Mr Nagano are exaggerating slightly. For one thing, they do not
believe the yen will stay at this height, because the current account
surplus appears to have turned the corner.
This year's signs of a general economic recovery are also stronger and more
widespread than last year's. Gross domestic product rose by an annual 3.9
per cent in the first quarter of this year, by comparison with the 1 per
cent rise in the same period of 1993.
This might explain why the stock market does not believe that the strong yen
is as as bad for corporate Japan as managers sometimes claim. Mr Robert
Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia, the securities company,
points out that share prices have risen in each of the seven years since
1970 in which the yen has appreciated by more than 10 per cent: 'It suggests
that the yen's strength is linked to the strength of the economy.'
Japanese industry has, moreover, had nearly a decade since the Plaza accord
in which to sharpen its competitiveness in response to the rising yen, by
trimming costs and shifting capacity abroad. Clearly, the yen's strength
reduces such companies' foreign costs as well as foreign revenues.
Today, 7 per cent of Japan's industrial production is overseas, according to
the Tokyo office of Morgan Stanley, the investment firm. The move caused the
loss of 70,000 Japanese manufacturing jobs at the latest count in 1991. But
that is tiny in relation to the 62.5m workforce, so unemployment remains far
lower than in Japan's leading competitors, at 2.8 per cent.
This indicates that industry can continue the shift abroad without breaking
its taboo against making redundancies - the constraint on foreign investment
most commonly cited by managers in Tokyo.
Another high-yen survival technique has been to contain the rise in export
prices by sacrificing profit margins and keeping a lid on labour costs. They
have been helped by the fact that Japan's working hours and total wages are
more flexible than international competitors'.
But Japanese companies have been unable to squeeze labour costs
indefinitely. These have been allowed to rise since the turn of the decade
above those in the US and Germany. As a result of Japanese companies'
decreasing ability to pass on the costs of the high yen to their workforces,
the country's loss of export market share 'could begin to be severe', warns
the latest OECD report on Japan.
The lesson, as if Japanese companies did not already know this by heart, is
that wild currency fluctuations are a long-term fact of business in Japan.
Consumers can, at least for the time being, continue to drink cheap French
wine, reasonably secure in the knowledge that their hard-pressed employers
will not throw them out of a job - yet.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Scientists strong on religion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DENIS ALEXANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor John Postgate ('Religion: are we better off without it?' June
18/19) is mistaken in thinking that 'few scientists' are to be found holding
'religious beliefs'. Christians in Science is only one of a number of
international organisations representing many thousands of Christians
engaged in scientific research, a good number of them holding chairs of
science in British universities. Considering the powerful impetus that the
Christian world-view provided to the emergence of modern science in 17th
century Europe, this substantial Christian presence within the scientific
community is not surprising, since the two-way traffic of ideas between
science and faith has continued unabated ever since.
Prof Postgate's suggestion that 'scientists who are religious' have to
'close down' their critical faculty for religious work, is embarrassing in
its inaccuracy. A steady stream of recent books by various scientists has
illustrated the way in which research work has frequently pushed agnostics
and atheists down the pathway to theism precisely because they have used
their critical faculties.
Science &amp; Christian Belief aims to explore the relationship between science
and faith at an academic level. As editor I read all manuscripts submitted
to this journal. At the same time, I referee a large number of articles
submitted to scientific journals. I can find no basis for Prof Postgate's
claim that different standards of critical academic assessment apply in
these two spheres of science and religion.
Prof Postgate's comments about religion and war reiterate tired arguments
that miss important points. In light of the fact that more than 40 per cent
of the scientific research and development budgets of most western nations
are committed to developing ways of killing other people, his claim that the
scientific community is living on some 'moral high ground' is surprising.
Scientists have been notorious for contributing their skills to military
enterprises, so the idea that the scientific community as a whole is 'above'
such blood-thirsty activities is ridiculous. Yet scientists do not give up
science because it is widely misused any more than people give up sex
because of the existence of rape. Similarly, the appropriate response to
misuse of religious belief is not to confront religion per se, but to oppose
its misuse.

<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Gourlay's article, 'Quality under fire' (June 21), on the
attack against BS5750 makes excellent points. In particular, the fact that
organisations not accredited by the National Accreditation Council for
Certification Bodies are allowed to issue certificates to companies saying
they have BS5750, introduces wide variations in standards, and brings the
whole system into disrepute.
The Department of Trade and Industry should act to stop this outrage and
give publicity to the role of the NACCB. Only when this happens will buyers
know for certain about the suppliers they deal with.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Party loses its footing: The fluctuating fortunes of
Germany's SPD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Rudolf Scharping chose a cavernous indoor ice-rink on the outskirts
of Halle, in eastern Germany, as the venue to launch his campaign last
Wednesday for the German chancellery, he was taking a calculated risk.
Not only was this monument to east Germany's former obsession with sports,
with its banks of orange plastic seats screwed to concrete benches, a
terrible place for a big set-piece speech, even to the party faithful. It
was more than that.
Halle, once capital of a sprawling chemical industry, now ravaged by
unemployment, is in the throes of an election campaign for a new parliament
and government in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The voters go to the polls
tomorrow. So Mr Scharping, the neatly bearded, 46-year-old leader of
Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), was putting his
election-winning reputation on the line.
Four months ago, he looked a good bet. Mr Scharping and the SPD were riding
high, Chancellor Helmut Kohl was trailing in opinion polls, the economy was
still in the doldrums, and the conservative-liberal coalition government in
Saxony-Anhalt was in disarray after the resignation of its premier and three
ministers in a scandal over inflated salaries.
The Halle party conference to endorse Mr Scharping as the candidate for
chancellor was just what was needed, the party strategists declared. It
would secure a resounding win in the state election, and set Mr Scharping on
his way for the chancellor's office come the general election in October.
This week, it all looked like a very risky gamble. It is Mr Scharping and
the SPD who are now falling behind, after a damaging defeat in the June 12
European election. Local elections on the same day in Saxony-Anhalt saw Mr
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) still in front of the SPD, in spite
of the salary scandals, although only by a narrow 1.5 percentage point
margin (by 31.2 per cent to 29.7).
Yesterday's national Politbarometer opinion poll, broadcast by ZDF
television, put the CDU on 40 per cent nationally, to just 36 for the SPD.
As for Mr Scharping, he is trailing Mr Kohl in the race to be the next
chancellor by 48 per cent to 41 - a reversal of their fortunes at the turn
of the year.
On Wednesday, the mood on the ice-rink was grim. Yet everyone knew they had
to put on a good show. Mr Scharping rose to the challenge. He delivered a
storming speech, in complete contrast to his normal wooden, preachifying
style. He mocked the 'fat man' in the chancellor's office, denounced the
inequities of west German materialism and east German joblessness, and told
his detractors in the party to 'put up, or shut up'.
The question is whether his newfound fury has not come too late. For the
tide seems to be running against the SPD, in both east and west. The party
has been unable to make a clear political breakthrough, in spite of still
rising unemployment and last year's sharp recession, and even against a
chancellor like Mr Kohl, who has never been genuinely popular. Many question
whether the SPD's malaise is not more fundamental than a question of
policies, or of personalities.
'This is a very difficult time for social democracy,' says Mr Jurgen
Burckhardt, director of the Friedrich Ebert foundation, the SPD think tank.
'It is very difficult to formulate policy under our changed circumstances,
because you can only tell people unpleasant things.'
In areas such as the extension of social benefits, or the protection of
lower income groups - classic social democratic themes - the SPD now admits
that public funds are not adequate to the task.
Yet in seeking to be realistic and blunt about the financial possibilities,
it is alienating both its traditional voters and new, more prosperous
groups. 'The main themes for which social democracy always stood, and their
main voters, are no longer recognisable,' says Mr Karl-Rudolf Korte, head of
the Germany political science research group at the University of Mainz. 'If
everything comes together in a great middle-of-the-road coalition, where
will be the specific themes for the SPD?'
Ever since he was elected leader just one year ago, Mr Scharping has sought
to move his party towards the middle ground, to present it as a safe and
stable alternative government, and one which might be more competent
economically.
Yet it is precisely on the question of 'economic competence' that the voters
appear to have lost faith with the SPD. In January, a majority rated the
opposition above the ruling coalition on that question. But as signs of
economic recovery have started to multiply, they have changed their minds.
'The election strategy of the SPD has failed,' says Mr Hans-Joachim Veen,
director of research at the CDU's Konrad Adenauer foundation. 'It was a
defensive strategy which was wrong from the start, saying: 'We are like the
CDU, but rather better.' That meant they were bound to the CDU. They did not
control the themes. They had no profile of their own. And the moment the
economy started to improve, the CDU could only gain.'
The danger for the Social Democrats is that they are looking ever more like
an acceptable party for provincial politics - governing at the state or
local government level - but not for the national capital. All their main
leaders are state politicians.
Mr Scharping's safe, dull and provincial image has only compounded the
impression. 'He presents himself as a younger Mr Kohl,' says Dr Korte.
The irony is that the two may yet be condemned to govern together. For even
if Mr Kohl emerges victorious, as the latest polls suggest, the electoral
mathematics suggests he will not command a majority with his current
coalition. The Free Democratic party, Mr Kohl's current partner, is weak,
and may barely scrape back into the Bundestag.
As far as the social democrats are concerned, their strategists seem already
to be prepared to contemplate a setback in October.
'I am convinced Scharping has a chance in the medium term, even if he does
not make it this autumn,' says Mr Burckhardt. 'Halle convinced me. He has
got what it takes. This man is 46. And look how long it took Willy Brandt.'
Mr Brandt became chancellor at 55.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Hunt for a smoking gun: The political battle against US
tobacco groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Thomas Sandefur, chairman of cigarette manufacturer Brown and Williamson,
was the very picture of the tobacco executive at bay this week. Several
times his lawyer advised him not to answer as he defended his company before
a hostile congressional committee against charges that it manipulated the
levels of nicotine in its cigarettes to keep smokers addicted.
Repeatedly in recent weeks the chairman and chief executives of leading US
cigarette manufacturers have been hauled before a panel of disbelieving
members of congress, chaired by Congressman Henry Waxman, to repeat that
they do not believe nicotine to be addictive, and do not believe their
cigarettes cause lung cancer.
The congressional hounds drew closer to their quarry this week when Dr David
Kessler, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, an agency of
the health department, denounced Brown and Williamson for developing a
strain of tobacco plant with twice the normal levels of nicotine.
'These findings lay to rest any notion that there is no manipulation and
control of nicotine (in the manufacture of cigarettes)', Dr Kessler said.
Mr Sandefur was the immediate target in a quest - he calls it a 'crusade' -
by the FDA for evidence that might justify it defining nicotine as a drug,
allowing it to assert its regulatory authority.
Brown and Williamson, owned by the UK conglomerate BAT industries, has faced
particularly close scrutiny because a cache of internal documents about its
research and marketing operations, which the company alleges were stolen by
a disgruntled employee, has made its way into the hands of Mr Waxman.
But research papers and internal memoranda from other companies are also
turning up which have added piece by piece to the picture of an industry
that has not just ignored, but actually concealed, the evidence about the
addictive and carcinogenic properties of its products.
Amid all these disclosures, Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, this week
announced that the justice department was examining an array of allegations
against the tobacco industry that could lead to criminal, civil and
antitrust investigations.
Dr Kessler's strategy for taking on the tobacco industry is unclear. The
bearded and bespectacled paediatrician came late to the anti-smoking
crusade, which he declined to pursue during his first two years as
commissioner.
In the past, the FDA limited itself to regulating nicotine in chewing gum or
patches to help people stop smoking, and to preventing cigarette makers
advertising their products' benefits, such as weight loss. Dr Kessler now
speaks with all the fervour of the convert. The logic of his quest, if he
finds more compelling evidence than the FDA yet possesses that nicotine is
addictive, would lead him to a complete ban on nicotine-bearing cigarettes,
or at least to strict limits on nicotine content.
But Dr Kessler has warned of the dangers of prohibition. 'One must consider
the possible effects of the loss of this source of nicotine on the health of
some people who are addicted. It is also important to consider the potential
for a black market in nicotine-containing cigarettes,' he told Mr Waxman's
committee.
Congressional opponents of smoking also shy away from talk of prohibition.
Legislation being considered in Congress to give the FDA explicit power to
regulate tobacco (currently defined as neither a food or a drug), sponsored
by Congressmen Richard Durbin of Illinois and Mike Synar of Oklahoma, would
specifically bar the agency from banning cigarettes.
Mr Synar acknowledges that his bill would not pass if it included the threat
of prohibition. But the tactics he has adopted highlights how hard it will
be to win approval for even the less draconian proposals he is making: he
has tried to attach the measure to the agriculture spending bill, which many
legislators from tobacco growing states will in the end feel compelled to
vote for, rather than presenting it on its own. 'If the bill could stand on
its own they wouldn't resort to this backdoor tactic,' said Mr Tom Lauria, a
spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, the industry lobbying group.
Mr Lauria's confidence reflects the realities of congressional politics:
despite the bashing the tobacco industry has received over the past year,
its political muscle is still considerable. Political action committees run
by the Tobacco Institute and individual manufacturers gave more than Dollars
1m to federal candidates last year.
In addition, the industry is developing a grassroots lobbying strength. The
National Smokers Alliance, run by Burson Marsteller, a public relations firm
with close ties to cigarette manufacturers, now boasts hundreds of thousands
of members and was active, along with cigarette maker Philip Morris, in
collecting signatures to place a pro-smoking measure on the November ballot
in California.
If approved, the measure would overturn hundreds of local anti-smoking
ordinances and replace them with a less stringent state law.
Congress, however, may turn out to be something of a sideshow in a much
broader onslaught on the tobacco industry. Anti-smoking campaigners are
pressing the attack with new vigour on two other fronts.
First, they are calling for more companies and employers to ban smoking in
public places. A 1993 study by the Environmental Protection Agency
classifying secondhand smoke as carcinogenic has led to companies such as
McDonalds and employers such as the Pentagon to ban smoking on their
premises.
Second, legal action is being taken to force the tobacco industry to pay for
the health costs of its products. Instead of lawsuits brought by individual
smokers or their bereaved relatives against the company to whose products
they attribute their lung cancer - a type of case the cigarette makers have
almost always won - a new wave of claims is being filed by state governments
against the tobacco industry in general.
For tobacco executives such as Mr Sandefur, however, the immediate problem
is the prospect of FDA regulation of nicotine. Congressman Ron Wyden of
Oregon, another foe of smokers, urged Mr Sandefur to work with Congress to
develop regulations his industry could accept, or risk becoming an 'outcast'
in the debate over smoking policy.
'Congressman, it's hard for me to envision becoming more of an outcast than
I am,' Mr Sandefur replied.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Man in the News: New battleplan for Waterloo - Conrad Black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been an incredible week for Ms Barbara Amiel, the right-wing Sunday
Times columnist. Her views, usually described as trenchant, have recently
encompassed the need for a firm stand against both North Korea and beggars.
On Tuesday she held what has been described as the 'high society party of
the summer' at the Ritz hotel in London, bringing together 150 people,
including Princess Diana, to celebrate businessman Sir James Goldsmith's
election as a Euro MP and his wife's 60th birthday.
Ms Amiel's husband, Conrad Black, chairman of the Telegraph group, had quite
a week, too. Before heading for the Ritz, Black had been putting the
finishing touches to the decision to cut the price of the Daily Telegraph
from 48p to 30p.
The decision led to a sharp fall in the Telegraph share price, which exposed
Black to something approaching hatred in the City of London because he sold
Pounds 73m-worth of Telegraph shares last month at what now looks like a
fancy price. It also provoked a counter-attack from Rupert Murdoch, who cut
the price of The Times to 20p.
But Black is a tough general. 'This is not a problem, I have been in tighter
corners than this,' he said on Thursday night, after hearing of the latest
Murdoch manoeuvre and before going off to dinner with Barbara, his second
wife who, he says, has made him happier than he has ever been.
By any standards, however, he is fighting a tight corner. And Black
acknowledges that Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, which owns five
national newspapers including the cut-price Sun and the cut-price Times -
both selling at 20p - is 'playing hardball'.
The owner of the Telegraph group said he believed that 'he (Mr Murdoch)
wants to put the weaker companies to the wall. I am a capitalist and a
Darwinian and I don't raise moral objection to that, although we're a
live-and-let-live company'.
The Canadian newspaper proprietor, with more than a passing interest in
military history and the achievements of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, laces
his conversation with talk of war in the wake of Murdoch's fierce
retaliation.
'You can't make war and peace at the same time, you can't suck and blow at
the same time. If you're going to regret an escalation of hostilities by an
adversary who has already declared war on you, you might as well have flown
up the white flag in the first place.'
He is similarly defiant about City innuendo that, when his main company,
Hollinger, sold 12.5m Telegraph shares on May 19 at 587p, he had thoughts of
cutting the price of the paper.
Black said he returned from New York last week to find a recommendation
'from all my management' that the paper should cut its cover price. May's
circulation figures, out earlier this month, showed The Times had increased
its sales by 35,000 compared with April, to a new record of 515,000. The
choice, as they saw it, was between acting now and watching their
circulation drift slowly down.
'Was I seriously supposed to say: 'Sorry, fellows, we can't do it because it
will give me a public relations problem.' That is no way to run a company.
You do what you have to do when you have to do it,' said Black.
He added that he had recently discovered a new profit centre - suing people
for defamation - and promised to sue anyone who cast direct aspersions on
the share sale.
The hard attitude financial community have taken towards Black and the
Telegraph, however unjustified, may make it difficult for the organisation
to raise money in the City of London for some time.
But was the Telegraph price cut, which will cost Pounds 40m gross in a full
year, wise? Has not Black merely caused pandemonium in the newspaper market,
damaged the profitability of his paper and devalued the 77m Telegraph shares
Hollinger continues to own - and possibly undermined the future of The
Independent - all for a toe-to-toe slugging match with Mr Murdoch?
'I am not one of those who desires to see a smaller number of newspapers
published. We are not trying to run anyone out of business. We are just not
interested in being bowled out by Murdoch,' said Black, who believes the
effect of the price cut on the Telegraph's profits will be relatively
marginal.
'If it shakes out the way we think, I think we will have the pleasure of
having stopped the inexorable rise of The Times, shored up our own position
and taken only a marginal hit to profit,' he said.
Nevertheless, the price war could turn out to be the newspaper equivalent of
a winter campaign in Russia for Black, who bought effective control of the
Daily Telegraph at a cost of about Pounds 20m in 1986.
Price cuts are not the only topic exercising his staff this week. Max
Hastings, Telegraph editor-in-chief, appointed Simon Heffer, a journalist
known for right-wing views, as deputy editor, amid reports that Hastings was
a candidate for being 'kicked upstairs'.
Black conceded: 'I became impatient not with the ideological tenor of the
paper but with the lack of sharpness. It just wasn't robust and vigorous
enough and needed to be a little bit more of a thunderer (the old nickname
for The Times).'
On top of this week's turmoil, the Telegraph, a quintessentially
Conservative newspaper (though it does criticise individual Conservative
governments), could be heading for a period of opposition. If Labour wins
the next election, then Black and Ms Amiel will be invited to few powerful
political parties, even though Black regards Tony Blair, the favourite for
the Labour leadership as 'a perfectly nice man'.
As usual, Black takes the historic view. The Daily Telegraph, he explained,
had been founded in 1855 essentially to oppose the then prime minister Lord
Aberdeen, and the Duke of Cambridge as commander of the British army. 'You
can't always have your own people in power. If we found ourself as a highly
oppositionalist paper, that is frequently a very enjoyable position for a
newspaper to be in,' said the man who is today many millions of pounds
poorer than he was at the Ritz on Tuesday evening.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Leading Article: What haunts the markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Polonius advised his son, brother of Hamlet's Ophelia, to be neither a
lender nor a borrower. If people had taken this sage counsel, there would
not be much of a capital market, nor indeed much capitalism. But what has
happened to global markets this year reinforces the sense behind his advice.
It is not so much that one should be neither a borrower nor a lender. It is
more that only one of those roles is worth playing at any moment. It has
been a mistake to be a long-term lender in 1994. Now it will prove costly to
be a long-term borrower.
In the 1970s, long-term lending to such previously sound borrowers as the US
and UK governments proved financially suicidal. Fears of a repeat haunt
markets. During periods of declining inflation investors forget their fears,
like hungry mice braving a sleeping cat. But as soon as inflation stabilises
and prospects for short-term gains on long-term loans vanish, they remember
once again. So far, 1994 has been a year for remembering.
Naturally, policymakers condemn such fears as irrational. In response to the
decline of the dollar to below Y100, President Bill Clinton said only this
week that 'this is the first time in 30 years that we have had growth in the
economy, with no inflation, led by investment that will create jobs'. Thank
you, Mr Greenspan, he might have added, but did not. He has, instead,
appointed two people to the board of the Federal Reserve, Alan Blinder and
Janet Yellen, who are thought to be soft on inflation.
Why did he do that, wonder those spooked markets? He is hardly likely to
admit that he hopes to manage a default on Reagan-era federal debt, via a
bout of good old-fashioned inflation. He had to say what he did, argue the
doubters, whether he is sincere on inflation or not.
Inflation fears
The return of fears about inflation is one reason for the linked phenomena
of declining bond markets and a falling US dollar, another being the
strength of the US recovery. Investors no longer wished to buy US financial
assets. Once that mood took hold, the size of the US current account deficit
made a weakening of the currency likely.
If this is so obvious in retrospect, why was it not in advance? The general
assumption at the beginning of the year was that the dollar would strengthen
with US economic recovery, as short-term interest rates rose in the US and
continued to fall elsewhere, particularly in Europe. The relative short-term
interest rate part of this story has worked out more or less as expected,
but it has not had the expected effect on the dollar.
The main reason is that people did not foresee what would happen to
long-term rates. What has since been called the world's biggest ever margin
call, following the Federal Reserve's minuscule monetary tightening last
February, led to larger bond market declines than expected. These increases
in long-term interest rates reflect partly the reversal of earlier
speculation, partly a return of fears about inflation, but also higher real
rates of interest.
Higher rates
The fact of higher real interest rates is demonstrated by the one more or
less incontrovertible piece of evidence, the rise in the real yield on
index-linked sterling gilts from 2.9 to 4 per cent since January. This
increase explains almost half the rise in the yield on conventional
long-term gilts in this period, the rest being presumably due to
deteriorating inflationary expectations.
Why should higher real rates hurt the dollar? One reason is that investment
opportunities elsewhere are better, partly because recovery in continental
Europe and Japan is becoming evident. Investors will wish to invest in other
markets, something that is hurtful to a country such as the US which is
dependent for exchange rate stability on a continuing inflow of foreign
capital.
Also important in a more inflationary environment is past history. It is not
an accident that Japan and Germany, both of which have relatively good
historical records on inflation and historically strong external positions,
have suffered the smallest declines in their bond markets among leading
industrial countries. Meanwhile, Canada, Italy and the UK have suffered
most. Japan and Germany also tend to have the strongest currencies, Japan
most of all, given its still huge current account surplus.
Three conclusions emerge. The first is that with real interest rates back to
4 per cent, being a borrower is a risky business, even for governments. This
has to be true when real interest rates exceed the prospective real rate of
growth of an economy.
The second is that more governments should borrow on inflation-indexed
terms. Not only would this help analysts understand bond markets better, it
would also protect markets from the fear of inflation. Finally, the spooked
markets of today are the price of deceit years ago. The only possible
response is to go on trying every day to earn their trust.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Break with Thatcherite past: Moves towards statutory
regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The creation of a statutory regulatory system for the pensions industry,
promised in Thursday's white paper, marks a turning point after more than a
decade in which laissez-faire principles guided government relations with
the City.
It is ironic that the job of announcing this departure from orthodoxy fell
to Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. He is seen by the Tory
right as one of the few standard-bearers of the Thatcherite inheritance left
in the cabinet.
Yet Mr Lilley had little choice in the aftermath of the Maxwell scandal but
to seek a comprehensive and statutory framework. The disappearance of Pounds
450m of pension funds from Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire - and the
plight of the thousands of pensioners left high and dry - required a
convincing policy response. Tory backbenchers, no less than the opposition,
were unlikely to accept remedies that relied on a further dose of
self-regulation.
'I don't think there would be any support for the view that no action is
needed in the pensions industry,' says Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman
of the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee.
As for the pensions industry, a statutory framework complete with regulator
was seen as the quid pro quo for a compensation fund financed by a levy. A
strong regulator is seen by the industry as essential to minimise the calls
likely to be made on the fund.
The move to statutory regulation of the pensions industry is likely to
rekindle demands for a similar approach to financial services regulation as
a whole. Influential bankers and insurance executives have become
increasingly concerned about the self-regulatory edifice that has been
constructed on the back of the 1986 Financial Services Act (FSA).
Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, the UK's largest life
insurer, has led calls for a shift towards a simpler statutory system. 'Such
is the wholly unsatisfactory state of retail financial services regulation
that the experiment of self-regulation within a statutory framework must be
seen as a failure,' he says.
Other top City figures are reluctant to express such views in public. But
there is widespread support for the view that change is needed, says Mr
Andrew Hilton, director of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation,
a City think-tank.
Last May, the centre published a paper arguing for far-reaching changes that
drew heavily on the thinking of Sir Brian Pearse, then chief executive of
Midland Bank. There has been 'an astonishingly positive response', says Mr
Hilton, to the proposals.
Despite differences over what should replace self-regulation, there is a
growing view in the City that statutory regulation would be better than the
framework created by the FSA, according to Mr Graham Mather, the
newly-elected MEP who is president of the European Policy Forum.
'People say that we have ended up with the worst of both worlds,' he says.
'The FSA is supposed to be self-regulatory, but it is heavily overlaid by
statutory requirements. The attraction of a statutory system is that it
would get rid of the present mess.'
Such advocates of change are unlikely to have their wish fulfilled, however,
says Mr John Maples, a former Treasury minister who is now chairman of
Saatchi Government Communications, a lobbyist.
'I cannot believe there is any stomach for amending the FSA this century,'
he says. 'The faults are not big enough for the government to go through the
grief that would be involved.' Mr Mather agrees. 'There is still time to
sort out the FSA,' he says.
Those hoping that the pensions white paper opens a new door for similar
moves for financial services regulation as a whole are likely to be
disappointed, therefore. It will take a scandal of the magnitude of the
Maxwell case before the politicians see any need to extend statutory
regulation to the financial services industry as a whole.

FT  25 JUN 94 / You win some, you lose some: UK pension scheme members have
gained security, but may have lost some rewards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the former directors of Belling, the UK cooker manufacturer, were
trying to salvage their ailing company in 1991, they turned to the pension
scheme. The directors, who were also pension scheme trustees, bought a
Belling subsidiary for the scheme with Pounds 5.5m of pension assets, and
borrowed Pounds 2.1m from the fund.
Belling went into liquidation the following year and the liquidators valued
the subsidiary at Pounds 2.5m. Scheme members turned to the courts to recoup
their money. So far, they have recovered little.
This is one of the most serious cases to rock the pensions industry, which
has not yet regained public confidence after the disappearance of more than
Pounds 440m from pension funds controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.
Last week, the government acted to fill some of the most gaping holes in the
regulatory net which permitted Maxwell's deception to take place. In
addition to giving an oversight of pension schemes, the proposed legislation
would alter some aspects of state benefits which may, in some cases, reduce
the benefits paid to pensioners.
The overriding question for pensioners and scheme members is whether they
will be better off when the proposals become law. The white paper tries to
balance improved safety for members against the interests of employers who
do not want to bear higher costs. The main points are:
Creation of a pensions regulator to be funded by a levy on the pensions
industry estimated at Pounds 10m a year. The regulator would have the power
to discipline and set fines for schemes which break the rules.
There is widespread agreement that the regulator is central to improving the
safety of schemes. Regulation would be funded by the pensions industry
through a board selected from the industry. It would rely on
'whistle-blowing' by professional advisers to scheme - actuaries,
accountants and solicitors - to alert it to wrongdoing.
'Professional people are naturally reluctant to be whistle-blowers for
people who are their clients and their source of income,' said Mr Stewart
James, chairman of the Association of Pensions Lawyers and partner at
solicitors Rowe and Maw, and also a member of the Goode Committee, whose
proposals the white paper reflects. He thinks the idea of the regulator is
not as effective, therefore, as it could be. Minimum solvency standards aim
to ensure that schemes have enough assets to meet their pensions
obligations. These begin to take effect in April 1997 and schemes would have
five years to meet them fully. If they meet at least 90 per cent of the
standard, they may take another three years to bring them up to 100 per
cent.
But there is a cost to members of this added security. This is because the
method used to calculate the value of assets - which adds up the cash
equivalent needed to buy an annuity that would provide the member with the
promised benefits at retirement - means that those who leave schemes early
will have lower transfer values.
The accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand estimates that the new calculations
of cash equivalents would mean that a 30-year-old leaving a scheme would
have a 25 per cent lower transfer value once the new rules take effect.
A compensation scheme for fraud or misappropriation would be financed by
employers and cover up to 90 per cent of any missing assets.
Scheme members would have the right to appoint at least one-third of a board
of trustees, with small schemes guaranteed at least one member trustee.
This proposal should improve the confidence of the average pension scheme
member. First, members would be able to appoint trustees who cannot be
removed by the employer. They should be in a position to spot inappropriate
activity early. Mr Nigel Preston, partner in the pensions practice at
consulting actuaries R. Watson, said: 'I've seen schemes with member
trustees, and they do improve the quality of administration. They certainly
limit the ability of the bad guys to put their hands in the till.'
In addition, the presence of member trustees forces the employer to think
twice about securing the use of a scheme surplus entirely for his own
benefit, Mr Preston says. Thus, not only may members feel safer after the
new legislation, they may also find they are better off.
Abolition of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension from April 1997, which
guarantees that at least a portion of each deferred pension rises in value
in line with salary increases, until it is ready to be drawn. Instead,
employers would have to increase pensions in payment by 5 per cent or the
retail price index, whichever is lower.
The GMP is currently intended to ensure that occupational schemes provide at
least a portion of deferred benefits, which rise each year in line with
earnings, and which are equal in value to those provided by the State
Earnings Related Scheme. Schemes which are 'contracted out' of Serps are
allowed to receive rebates of National Insurance Contributions along with
their members.
According to data from the National Association of Pension Funds, some 41
per cent of employers are voluntarily increasing pensions in payment each
year by the amount required under the new law. A further 20 per cent are
increasing pensions by an even more generous level. Indeed, only 2 per cent
of all schemes have increases of less than 3 per cent each year.
Ms Penny Webster, partner at Bacon and Woodrow, the consulting actuaries,
said the abolition of GMP could cause significant reductions in the pensions
received by many people. In particular, those who change jobs frequently
would be hard hit. That is because, although a 'frozen' pension is only
required to be uprated by 5 per cent each year, the GMP portion of that
pension must be increased by 7 per cent or by the level of earnings
inflation, which is typically 1 1/2 to 2 per cent above retail price
inflation.
'Let's say a 35-year-old man leaves a scheme with 30 years to go until
retirement,' Ms Webster says. 'Considering that GMP can be 40 per cent of
his total pension, that man's final pension will be reduced by 15 per cent.'
Those who stand to benefit are those whose employers provide little or no
inflation-proofing for pensions, and who have worked most of their lives for
a single employer - a minority of the UK 10m scheme members.
The response to the white paper has been mixed. The NAPF has broadly
endorsed it, saying it strikes a balance between improving security for
scheme members and limiting costs to employers. But trade unions have said
it does not go nearly far enough in protecting scheme members.
The answer to the question of whether the average scheme member is better
off is: maybe. For while there is a greater certainty that promised benefits
will be delivered, they may prove in the end to be less generous than at
present. It will be up to scheme members to decide whether they think the
trade-off is worth it.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CORFU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish prime ministers last night reported solid progress
towards an agreement next month on the framework for a new political
settlement in Northern Ireland.
After talks at the European Union summit in Corfu Mr John Major and Mr
Albert Reynolds offered an upbeat assessment that the outline accord would
be agreed at a summit pencilled in for around July 20.
The two prime ministers were joined at their meetings by high-ranking
officials from the Northern Ireland Office and the Irish Foreign Affairs
Ministry. Both men rejected any suggestion that Sinn Fein could secure a
place at the negotiating table by announcing a temporary ceasefire. Mr
Reynolds said: 'I want a permanent cessation of violence from both
(republican and loyalist) sides. That is what the people want and that is
what the governments want.'
Officials said the leaders had still to resolve differences over the
language in the statement on the proposed amendment of Dublin's
constitutional claim to Northern Ireland and on the establishment of new
institutions to enhance north-south co-operation.
But Mr Reynolds appeared to back away from comments earlier this week that
he was insisting that the new cross-border institutions should have
'executive powers'.
He left open the possibility that the precise powers of new all-Ireland
boards to co-ordinate policy in transport, energy, tourism and
communications could be defined in talks between Ulster's constitutional
parties.
As British and Irish officials continued drafting work on the framework
document last night Mr Major appeared to accept that the Irish government
could not scrap entirely articles two and three of its constitution.
Instead, Dublin would offer to amend the articles embodying its claim to the
North if the constitutional parties in the province reached an overall
settlement.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Court backs investors: Higher payouts demanded for
debt-ridden victims of poor advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elderly victims of poor financial advice which saddled them with enormous
debts are entitled to more compensation, the Court of Appeal ruled
yesterday.
The court ruled that the Investors Compensation Scheme was wrong in using
its discretion to limit compensation to investors in home income plans. It
may have to pay an extra Pounds 20m in addition to the Pounds 22.5m
compensation it has already paid to more than 1,800 investors.
The ICS is expected to appeal to the House of Lords. It said yesterday the
ruling would force it to change from a low-cost, fast, informal compensation
scheme to a lengthy and highly legalistic one, where legal precedents would
have to be set for each new type of case and claimants might need legal
representation.
'While today's group of investors will benefit, we think ultimately
investors will suffer,' said Mr David Cresswell of the ICS.
Those affected by the appeal ruling are unlikely to receive additional
compensation until all legal channels have been exhausted.
Home income plans were widely sold during the housing boom of the late
1980s. They enabled householders, often elderly, to mortgage their homes and
invest the proceeds in income bonds, which were supposed to pay the interest
on the mortgage and provide an additional income. Some plans used roll-up
mortgages, which added the interest to the total debt.
A combination of falling house prices, rising interest rates and declining
investment returns left many investors, who had not been warned of the
risks, with huge debts and no means to pay the interest. Some have lost
their homes.
Many of the financial advisers who sold the plans are no longer in business,
so investors turned to the ICS for compensation.
Yesterday's ruling was on an appeal brought by lawyers Barnett Sampson, on
behalf of two representative investors. It covered three main points:
Whether the ICS had discretion to reduce compensation to what it considered
fair.
Whether the ICS could deduct from the compensation any money received from
the plan and spent by the plaintiffs.
Whether the ICS could lawfully limit compensation for solicitors' and
accountants' fees to Pounds 500.
The Court of Appeal ruled against the ICS on all three points.
The judgment's wider implications are that it requires the ICS to take all
relevant factors into account for each case, in the same way that a court
would. The ICS would no longer have discretion to set a formula for
compensation, or set limits other than its standard overall limit of Pounds
48,000.
The ICS is funded by a levy on the insurance and financial services
industry. Extra payouts on home income plans would probably come from an
insurance policy covering 1991-92, when most of the firms selling home
income plans collapsed. Since 1992, the ICS has not been able to obtain
insurance.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Unofficial mail dispute spreads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Postal services may be disrupted in many areas today after an unofficial
strike by postal workers which escalated from a local dispute over staffing.
Mount Pleasant, the biggest sorting office in London, was affected by the
walkout, as were offices in Romford, Dagenham and Ilford, in Essex,
Dunstable and Bedford - and Milton Keynes, where the dispute started earlier
this week.
The Royal Mail said yesterday that it might take legal action against the
UCW communications union following an injunction against it requiring it not
to take industrial action.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Heseltine ready for postal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has resolved his
differences with the prime minister over the drafting of the green paper on
the future of the Post Office, now expected to be published next week,
Roland Rudd writes.
Mr John Major rejected the first draft, believing Mr Heseltine had not given
sufficient weight to the option of leaving the Post Office completely in the
public domain.
The Department of Trade and Industry believes its preferred option of
selling 51 per cent of the shares in Royal Mail and Parcelforce is still
given prominence over the other two options.
These are to make the Post Office more commercialised in the public sector
or to sell 49 per cent of the shares in Royal Mail and Parcelforce.
Mr Heseltine wants 10 per cent of the shares reserved for the workforce, the
maximum number allowed under Stock Exchange rules. He proposes a regulatory
structure aimed at strengthening rural services and uniform letter delivery.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Sinn Fein supporters warm to ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, says that almost 40 per cent of
submissions made to its Peace Commission - which held five public hearings
between January and March this year - believed that it should encourage the
IRA to call a unilateral ceasefire.
Publishing a report on the commission's findings in Dublin yesterday, Mr Pat
Doherty, Sinn Fein vice-president, said: 'We will have to take on board the
views of people who spoke to us. It has certainly informed our attitude, and
we would not have involved ourselves in dialogue with so many people if we
were to ignore it. It would have an influence on our thinking . . . as to
how we should proceed in the weeks and months ahead.'
He said Sinn Fein would make a detailed response to the Downing Street
declaration before the end of next month, probably before the proposed
Anglo-Irish summit - pencilled in for the latter part of the month. A
document had already been drafted by the party's national executive, he
said, which must be discussed with party members first. 'But this will not
unduly delay our response,' he said.
The report published yesterday is a summary of the 280 submissions made to
the commission from across Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic during
the five hearings.
It does not make any specific recommendations, but it does highlight two
points which are likely to be central to Sinn Fein's response to the Downing
Street declaration, namely the so-called 'unionist veto' and the issue of
demilitarisation.
The report notes: 'A huge range of submissions felt . . . that the
declaration had fudged the issue of self-determination' and says that 'the
need to remove the veto' should be subject to 'further debate and
discussion'.
Mr Doherty insisted that majority consent in Northern Ireland to
constitutional change, as embodied in the Downing Street declaration, was
distinct from the unionist veto. He added: 'The Irish nation is bigger than
the unionist population . . . consent means (unionist) involvement and maybe
even more than that, but there cannot be a veto.' He said Sinn Fein was also
looking for a means to achieve 'a total demilitarisation of the conflict'
rather than focusing on just one aspect of it, namely the IRA.
Sinn Fein thus appears to be moving towards proposing an extended IRA
ceasefire, as opposed to the total cessation of violence as demanded by the
two governments. This would be in the hope firstly of shifting the political
pressure on to the loyalist paramilitaries.

FT  25 JUN 94 / 'Pretty' Blair is rapped by left
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour faces an inevitable split if Mr Tony Blair, the party's leading
moderniser, wins the leadership election, leftwing MPs warned yesterday.
Most leftwingers privately accept that Mr Blair, the shadow home secretary,
will win the election, in spite of deep misgivings about his modernising
approach.
They said Mr Blair was unlikely to face problems from the left in the
short-term because of the overwhelming support emerging for him on the
centre and right of the party.
But influential members of the hard-left Campaign group said his 'social
democratic agenda' would lead to a 'huge internal conflict' with the left
and the unions in the first year of a Labour government.
'He will win because people will agree that he is the prettiest of the pack
and that he can get Labour into Downing Street,' one leading Campaign group
member said.
'But once he is in office the people in the press who have created him will
not be seen within a million miles of him, and he will be in really deep
trouble.
'After a year of Labour government the public will be demanding something
different, and they will measure the success of the government in terms of
jobs and growth.
'If Mr Blair is still talking about community values and saying that we
cannot have full employment because of Gatt or the European Union, people
will turn on him and blow him apart.'
More moderate leftwing members of the Tribune group said they were worried
by the 'fuzzy' personal manifesto for the leadership published by Mr Blair
on Thursday.
They voiced concerns about his failure to set out a clear economic
programme, his lack of support for public sector unions, and his statement
that the market economy was 'in the public interest'.
Mr Peter Hain, MP for Neath, said there was 'a very big question mark over
our ability to win while appearing to be all things to all people'.
'I don't think you build the sort of committed constituency Labour needs to
win an election when you don't stand for anything firm. There is a kind of
trust gap,' he said. Tribune, the leftwing newspaper, said Mr Blair's
modernising policies appeared designed to 'tinker at the sidelines' of the
economy. It called for 'bold' policies to transform Britain.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Fund manager fined Pounds 10,000 by Imro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey Unit Trust Managers, the unit trust fund management arm of Abbey Life,
improperly allowed its fund managers to travel to the US and Far East on
trips paid for by commissions generated in trades with stockbrokers,
regulators said yesterday.
Imro, the self-regulating body for the fund management industry, has fined
AUTM Pounds 10,000 and ordered it to pay Pounds 8,000 in costs after an
investigation into its 'soft commission' arrangements.
Mr Paul Leband, director of AUTM and a director of Abbey's fund management
company, said that seven fund managers had accepted Pounds 50,000 of free
travel and accommodation to the US and the Far East between November 1991
and October 1993.
The travel was paid for by two stockbroking firms, one American and one Far
Eastern, through which the fund managers regularly placed
commission-generating trades. Mr Leband said that AUTM had 'misunderstood'
Imro rules relating to soft commissions.
Soft commissions are services which stockbrokers provide to fund managers at
no cost. In exchange the fund managers promise to place an agreed volume of
trades through the stockbrokers, generating commission for them. US
regulators have almost banned the practice because the commissions are paid
out of investors' capital, but UK regulators allow such arrangements within
certain limits.
Imro rules allow the fund managers to accept services which aid them
directly in their research activities, provided the stockbroker with whom
the agreement is struck arranges to buy or sell the stock at the best
available price.
Typically 'softed' services are stockbroker research or computer software
services such as those provided by Datastream, Reuters and others.
Mr Leband said AUTM had mistakenly believed that travel for research
purposes was also a suitable expense for softing purposes.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Judge's ruling reopens dam row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading UK pressure group yesterday won the first round in a legal battle
to halt Britain's funding of Malaysia's Pergau dam project.
The World Development Movement, a pressure group on Third World issues, was
granted its application for a judicial review of the decision by Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, to fund the project.
The group is calling for the review on the grounds that the offer of Pounds
234m for the dam broke British law, which states that aid money can only be
spent on beneficial economic projects.
Lawyers for the group are also pressing the High Court to block the Pounds
200m that is yet to be paid to the Malaysian government under the agreement
signed by Mr Hurd.
Mr Ben Jackson, the campaign co-ordinator, said the decision by Mr Justice
Auld to grant the application was 'a major victory' for his movement.
Mr Hurd's lawyers did not oppose the granting of leave for the application.
But his counsel, Mr Stephen Richards, said the full hearing later this year
would be contested 'with vigour'.
The High Court decision re-opens the row over the funding of the Pergau dam
at a time when the UK is anxious to restore trade relations with Malaysia.
Much of the controversy over the project earlier this year was focused on
whether the government had broken its own guidelines in 1988 by linking the
offer of aid to a defence deal worth about Pounds 1bn. Mr Hurd has admitted
there was a 'temporary entanglement' between the two deals but that they
were both pursued separately later.
The World Development Movement is challenging Mr Hurd on the broader point
that his decision in 1991 to fund the project broke the Overseas Development
and Co-operation Act.
Mr Nigel Pleming QC, for the group, said that, under the act, aid could be
given only 'for the purpose of promoting the development or maintaining the
economy of a country or the welfare of its people'.
Mr Hurd had been informed by his officials that the project was uneconomic.
Sir Timothy Lankester, the former permanent secretary at the Overseas
Development Administration, told the foreign secretary that the dam was an
'abuse of the aid programme', but was overruled by Mr Hurd on the basis of
'wider considerations'.
The group acknowledged that because it is not a charity, it would need
substantial donations from the public to proceed with the case.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Tension foreseen on Dublin link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, will today
underline his party's opposition to joint authority between London and
Dublin over Northern Ireland's affairs.
He will use a speech in Larne to say joint authority would be 'a recipe for
increased instability and tension' and that the UUP is 'not prepared to
tolerate the establishment of the structures for the severance of the union
which joint authority would impose'.
In negotiations with Dublin, Britain is understood to have rejected any
suggestion that new north/south institutions could imply joint authority
over the province. It is prepared, however, to sanction cross-border
executive boards to oversee a common approach in some areas.
Whitehall officials are optimistic that the UUP will not reject such boards
out of hand. Their powers would be decided in consultation with the
constitutional parties.
Mr Molyneaux will say that his party wants the articles in the Irish
constitution enshrining Dublin's territorial claim over Ulster to be removed
 -'but not if it means selling the horse to buy a saddle'.
He will praise Mr Major as 'a prime minister who, more than any other since
the late 1960s, is prepared to listen to the parties and to act on their
advice.'

FT  25 JUN 94 / Legal aid payout enrages Lords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government may change the legal aid rules following the revelation that
a wealthy businessman has received more than Pounds 4m in legal aid to fight
an embezzlement action brought by his former employers, the Arab Monetary
Fund.
Dr Jawd Hashim, 55, a former president of Middle East-based AMF, is being
sued for Pounds 33m he allegedly siphoned off from the fund into private
Swiss bank accounts.
The disclosure in the Lords on Thursday by Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, the
Lord Advocate, that Dr Hashim's long-running legal battles with the AMF had
so far cost the British taxpayer Pounds 4.01m in legal aid, caused outrage
among peers.
They demanded to know how someone who owns six luxury homes around the world
and who reputedly employs servants can be eligible for public funding to
fight a civil court action.
The Legal Aid Board, which administers legal aid for the government, said
yesterday it could not talk about the specifics of Dr Hashim's case, but
that it might recover some or all of the money if Dr Hashim won the action.
In general, anyone is entitled to legal aid regardless of nationality if
they are a party to proceedings in a British court, it said.
To get legal aid, however, an applicant must be financially eligible and
must satisfy the board that he or she has a reasonable legal case.
Financial eligibility is determined by a branch of the Benefits Agency,
based in Preston, Lancashire. The agency will investigate an applicant's
means.
Normally someone with Dr Hashim's assets would not qualify for aid. But the
agency must disregard assets if they are being claimed by the other party in
the proceedings.
As the AMF is claiming Pounds 33m from Dr Hashim, the agency could disregard
assets up to that amount in assessing his means.
Also, if a person's assets have been frozen by a court the agency cannot
take them into account. An injunction freezing the assets of Dr Hashim and
his wife was granted to the AMF at the beginning of the case.
The Lord Chancellor's Department said yesterday that the issue of whether
people in Dr Hashim's position should be eligible for civil legal aid was
already under review.
A similar review following the legal aid granted to Mr Ernest Saunders for
his defence in the 1989 Guinness trial led to a change in the rules for
assessing an applicant's assets in criminal cases.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Hollick urges new media watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Hollick, managing dir-ector of MAI, the broadcasting and financial
services group, yesterday called for the creation of a new watchdog to be
responsible for ITV, the BBC and other broadcasters.
The Labour peer whose company controls ITV companies Meridian Broadcasting
and Anglia Television told a London conference yesterday that governments
could and should regulate the market in which the media will develop. He
said a broadcasting watchdog should be responsible for standards, complaints
and finances. He said at a conference organised by The Voice of the Listener
and Viewer, the pressure group, that the idea of a media monopoly had to be
redefined to cover all forms of media and called for a more effective and
coherent government policy.
He argued that an element of public service obligation should apply to all
terrestrial, satellite and cable broadcasters 'to promote both programme
diversity and domestic production'.
He said he wanted to 'maintain ITV's public service obligations, the
positive programme requirements in the Broadcasting Act and the capacity to
meet them'.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Ministers demand early reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister faces growing pressure from senior ministers to bring his
planned cabinet reshuffle forward to next week.
Mr Major is believed to favour postponing the reshuffle until mid-July to
minimise the scope for Commons statements by dismissed ministers before the
House rises for the summer recess.
However, ministers say that departmental decision-making has been virtually
paralysed by uncertainty about the scope and extent of the reshuffle since
Mr Major disclosed his intentions at a Downing Street press conference two
weeks ago. As reshuffle fever spread at Westminster, MPs pointed to the
careful wording of Mr Major's comments - which explicitly ruled out only the
following two weeks - as evidence of an impending announcement.
Downing Street officials added to the growing expectations by refusing to
rule out a reshuffle next week. However, a senior official was careful to
keep open the option of a later date.
There was renewed speculation that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, will replace Sir Norman Fowler as Conservative party
chairman. Mr Heseltine has made clear that he wants to remain at the trade
and industry department, which he believes has suffered from too many
changes of senior ministers.
However, he attended a secret meeting of the rightwing No Turning Back group
on Thursday at which he is believed to have been pressed to accept the
chairmanship in the party interest.
Such an appointment would be popular with rank-and-file MPs, who believe
that Mr Heseltine is one of the few cabinet ministers with the political
skills to dent the image of Mr Tony Blair, the likely winner of Labour's
leadership election.
The government's fear of Mr Blair was underlined by a concerted attack on
the shadow home secretary by a raft of cabinet ministers including Mr David
Hunt, employment secretary, and Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary.
Mr Redwood, in an acidic statement distributed at Westminster, said Mr Blair
was a 'snappy dresser' whose personal manifesto issued on Thursday mixed
'the bland and the obvious with the ambiguous'.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Site sale clinches Pounds 500m shopping complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bluewater Park, a 1.625m sq ft shopping and leisure development at Dartford
in Kent, is set to proceed as a result of the sale of the development site
to Lend Lease, an Australian property company.
The scheme, which is expected to carry a value of Pounds 500m-Pounds 600m on
completion, is likely to be the last of the giant regional shopping schemes
to be built following the government's crackdown on planning permission for
out-of-town developments. The conditional sale of the site by Blue Circle
Industries to Lend Lease ends years of speculation about the project's
viability. Work is expected to begin later this year or early in 1995.
Lend Lease, which operates 30 shopping centres in the US and Australia and
has Pounds 6bn of funds under management, is confident it can put together a
consortium of investors to fund the scheme's Pounds 300m construction costs.
The Prudential, the life assurer, said yesterday that it was 'seriously
considering' investing about Pounds 100m in the scheme.
Bluewater Park will be in head-on competition with one of the UK's largest
existing shopping centres at Thurrock, Lakeside, just 10 miles away, which
is owned by Capital Shopping Centres. The scheme's promoters say that the
river Thames, which runs between the two, will act as a natural divide.
Moreover, they believe that demand, thought to embrace 6.5m people within 45
minutes drive time, is enough for both centres.
The government's decision to restrict out-of-town developments in order to
protect town centres has made it easier for the Bluewater scheme to attract
investors because the policy is likely to add value to schemes that have
already won planning permission.
The decision by Blue Circle to sell its 230-acre site for Pounds 50m marks a
decision that property is not part of its core business. The company, which
has 20,000 acres of land surplus to its needs, will make a pre-tax profit of
somewhere between Pounds 24m and Pounds 89m from the development over
several years.

Councils in England received 123,000 applications for planning permission
and other related consents in the first quarter of this year, 5 per cent
more than for the corresponding period in 1993. It is the third successive
quarterly increase in planning applications, government figures show.
There were small quarter-on-quarter increases in applications in all regions
except the north-west, where there was a 5 per cent fall. The largest
increase - 10 per cent - was in Greater London.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Opera house sounds note of change: A number of building
developments are about to boost Edinburgh's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the curtain rises this afternoon on a gala performance of Tristan und
Isolde at the new Festival Theatre in Edinburgh, the event will have more
than theatrical significance.
Nearly half a century after people first began to campaign for it, Edinburgh
has finally created an opera house. But its opening is only the most
spectacular of a number of developments which will strengthen the city's
economy and demonstrate that it has finally shaken off the complacency and
self-deprecation that previously obstructed progress.
'There's been a huge change of mood,' says Mr David Nicolson, president of
the city's chamber of commerce and local managing partner of KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accountants. 'I've lived here all my life, and what's happening
is dramatic.'
As well as the new theatre, Edinburgh will next year finish a long-postponed
project to build a Pounds 30m conference centre that will seat 1,200 people.
This summer a Pounds 37m scheme to rebuild and expand Murrayfield rugby
stadium will be concluded, largely financed by debentures sold to rugby
supporters.
Much of the financial community has moved or is moving into larger new
office buildings, filling long-standing gap sites near the city centre - but
unfortunately leaving the Georgian Charlotte Square half empty. Some are
moving from the centre to the city's western fringe, and much of the
Scottish Office is moving to former dock land in Leith.
The change in attitude began cautiously in the mid-1980s, with a crucial
role being played by Edinburgh District Council, which came under the
control of a group of Labour party pragmatists.
It reversed past opposition to fostering the financial sector, Edinburgh's
biggest employer, began issuing planning consents more freely and organised
schemes to develop its own considerable land holdings in the city.
Mr Nicolson believes a pivotal role in speeding the city's development has
been played by Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise (LEEL), the local enterprise
company formed in 1991 after the break-up of the Scottish Development
Agency.
LEEL marshalled the energies of Edinburgh district and Lothian regional
councils and applied funds from its substantial budget to push through the
difficult projects. 'The most important thing was that LEEL decided that the
Festival Theatre and the conference centre were going to happen,' says Mr
Nicolson. 'For years people had always found reasons for not doing them.'
LEEL has led the Festival Theatre project, encouraging the district council
to purchase the defunct Empire Theatre. This has been converted, at a cost
of Pounds 22m, into a modern opera house that would have cost Pounds 50m to
build from scratch and has a stage bigger than Covent Garden's in London.
Other money came from LEEL, public-sector bodies including Lothian region
and the Scottish Tourist Board, while the private sector has raised Pounds
4m.
Will the theatre succeed, and has Edinburgh really changed? Lord Younger,
former defence secretary and chairman of the Festival Theatre Trust, betrays
a slight anxiety when he says: 'I'll be fully convinced only when I see
Edinburgh people turning out for a performance on a cold mid-week February
night.'
Another Pounds 2m is needed from private-sector businesses and individual
donors - the latter have already contributed more than Pounds 700,000. 'The
list of donors is impressive,' says Mr Nicolson, 'but if you examine it
closely you will see gaps.'
While leading Edinburgh businesses such as Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of
Scotland and United Distillers are large contributors, only three of the
five Edinburgh-based life assurance companies feature in the list. 'I can't
understand why some companies are not more supportive when they see the
benefits these projects are bringing the city,' says Mr Nicolson.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Deficit on the current account drops to Pounds 667m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's current account deficit in the first quarter of this year was just
Pounds 667m - its best performance for seven years, the Central Statistical
Office said.
The main reason for the improvement was that the invisibles surplus rose
sharply to Pounds 2.4bn, its highest level since the first quarter of 1986.
However, part of the improvement was due to a rise in net investment income,
a statistic which is particularly volatile. The CSO said that net investment
income in the first quarter amounted to Pounds 2.01bn, the highest-ever
figure, compared with Pounds 1.13bn in the previous three months.
In particular, the financial sector increased its overseas earnings while
the UK earnings of foreign banks fell sharply.
There were also improvements in the other trade components. The deficit on
visible trade fell slightly to Pounds 3.07bn, from Pounds 3.58bn in the
fourth quarter of last year. The value of exports was 2.5 per cent higher
than in the previous quarter, while imports rose by just 1 per cent.
The surplus on services increased to Pounds 1.63bn, from Pounds 1.47bn in
the fourth quarter of last year. However, the UK continued to have a deficit
on travel, which amounted to Pounds 853m in the first quarter.
Analysts welcomed the current account figures, which were much better than
expected, but expressed caution about the quality of the data. 'The
likelihood must be that future revisions will be adverse,' said Mr Ian
Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets.
According to the CSO, the UK's balance sheet improved substantially over the
quarter. Net external assets were Pounds 42.1bn at the end of March,
compared with Pounds 22.7bn at the end of December 1993.
The figures also show that UK banks and financial institutions made
substantial disposals of overseas securities in the first quarter.
Banks, having bought Pounds 12.7bn of overseas securities in the fourth
quarter of last year, sold Pounds 2.7bn in this year's first quarter. Other
financial institutions sold Pounds 29.36bn of overseas securities in the
first quarter, compared with net purchases of Pounds 25.06bn in the last
three months of 1993.
Meanwhile, overseas residents continued to buy gilts and UK shares, to the
tune of Pounds 13.36bn in the first quarter, compared with Pounds 11.23bn in
the final three months of 1993.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Rising incomes bolster savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyant personal incomes allowed consumers to continue spending in the first
quarter of this year without reducing their savings, the Central Statistical
Office said yesterday.
At the start of the year many economists thought that because of tax rises
the recovery would only be sustained if consumers cut their savings in order
to finance spending.
However, the savings ratio - savings as a proportion of total personal
disposable income - rose slightly to 10.4 per cent in the first quarter,
from a revised 10.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year.
Income from employment rose by 2.1 per cent over the quarter, helped by
bonuses and overtime payments which have been visible in the average
earnings figures. After deducting taxes, the result was that total personal
disposable income was 1.5 per cent higher than in the previous quarter. That
allowed consumer expenditure to rise 1.4 per cent over the quarter.
Overall, gross domestic product rose by 0.7 per cent over the quarter (or
0.6 per cent if oil and gas are excluded), confirming earlier estimates.
However, first-quarter GDP is now estimated to be 2.9 per cent higher than
in the first three months of last year, compared with the 2.6 per cent
published.
The change is due to revisions in the 1993 data, which show that growth was
slightly faster in the second half of the year than was previously thought.
Corporate finances were healthy over the quarter. The financial surplus of
industrial and commercial companies, at Pounds 4.29bn, was the highest ever
recorded. Gross trading profits, before deducting stock appreciation, were
2.6 per cent higher over the quarter and 15.4 per cent higher than in the
same period of 1993.
Fixed investment rose by 2.1 per cent over the quarter and was 3.2 per cent
higher than in the first quarter of last year. However, this investment was
concentrated in the sector of industry consisting largely of government
bodies and banks. Investment fell in manufacturing, mining and quarrying and
in the electricity, gas and water industries.
The value of stocks and work in progress fell by Pounds 449m in the first
quarter, having risen by Pounds 157m in the fourth quarter of last year.
Stocks rose in the manufacturing and wholesale sectors but fell in other
areas, such as retailing.
The implied GDP deflator, a measure of inflation compiled by averaging the
prices of the goods and services which make up GDP, rose 0.8 per cent in the
first quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of 0.6 per cent. The
deflator was 3.3 per cent higher than in the first three months of 1993.
The improvement in the trade balance added about 0.4 per cent to first
quarter GDP, although this was offset by the effect of destocking.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Businesses urged to help finance new royal yacht: Car parks
tycoon seeks 'pound for pound' funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS, JIMMY BURNS and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Donald Gosling, joint chairman of National Car Parks, yesterday called
on the government and industrialists to join him in building a vessel to
replace the royal yacht Britannia by the year 2000.
The Ministry of Defence, which announced this week that Britannia would be
decommissioned in 1997, said Sir Donald's proposal was likely to be the
first of many.
Sir Donald said he hoped the government would match the private sector
'pound for pound' in building a showpiece vessel for about Pounds 60m.
He said that in addition to transporting the royal family and promoting
British trade - Britannia's current roles - the ship could be used for
adventure training for young people.
The ship could be leased to the Royal Navy, which would make it available
both to the royal family and the companies which helped to fund it, he said.
'Industries and individuals could take debentures on the ship. The ship is
not intended to make a profit, although it might pay some interest to
debenture holders.'
Sir Donald said he was approached about the idea of building a new royal
yacht by a parliamentary maritime group, and he understood it was in touch
with other industrialists as well.
A defence ministry official said millions of pounds worth of export
business, including weapons sales, had been sealed with the help of
Britannia. He said: 'The moment people step on board, they can't help being
impressed by the high standards of naval engineering.'
A glance at the list of organisers of recent events on board Britannia
suggests that the yacht has attracted the 'great and the good' of business
rather than medium-size and small companies.
This week's conference in Helsinki was chaired by Sir Michael Palliser,
vice-chairman of Samuel Montagu and former head of the diplomatic ser-vice.
In Bombay last November British Invisibles hosted a seminar with opening
remarks by Sir Nicholas Fenn, the British high commissioner, and
contributions by Sir Hugh Bidwell, former lord mayor of London, and Mr
Andrew Buxton, chairman of Barclays Bank.
In New York Mr Tony Tucker, director of public affairs for the Scottish
Whisky Association, helped organise a reception for 120 congressmen,
journalists and other US glitterati. He said: 'Undoubtedly the opportunity
to use Britannia was most welcome. It added that extra dimension of royal
lustre which would just not have been available in a hotel. The Americans
were intrigued and very interested so they came along.'
In cost terms, Mr Tucker described Britannia as a 'very good deal' - neither
'wildly expensive nor cheap' but worth it as a promotional tool. There was
no 'room hire' charge and no mark-up on food and wine as is customary in
hotels.

The government yesterday told local authorities it would not set up a
compensation scheme for former council employees who lost their jobs under
contracting out.
The European Court of Justice ruled this month that these redundancies may
have violated European Commission directives.
Councils fear a compensation bill of as much as Pounds 400m, with
potentially high legal costs. They were outraged by the government decision.
The European Court said British employers had a statutory duty to consult
employees when transferring them from one business to another - under 1975
and 1977 directives which had not been incorporated into British law.
It confirmed the right of former local authority employees who had been made
redundant to sue for compensation, as the UK had not extended the Transfer
of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations - known as Tupe - to
the public sector. Tupe dictates that existing workforces must be
transferred on existing pay and conditions when a business is taken over.
Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, said in a letter to Sir Jeremy
Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan
Authorities: 'There is no question of the government setting up a
compensation scheme.'
He said the only practical implication of the court's judgment related to
the 'narrow point' on staff consultation. He added: 'It is, of course, open
to anyone who believes that they have a case for compensation to pursue this
through the legal processes, and indeed a number of writs have been served
against the government.'
Sir Jeremy, who had demanded that the government set up a compensation fund,
said: 'The government has consistently tried to undermine the impact of
European legislation and is now trying to avoid its responsibility to the
workers who have lost out.'

FT  25 JUN 94 / Hanson writes to Major on dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Hanson, chairman of the Anglo-US conglomerate Hanson, has urged the
prime minister in a letter to keep a firm hand on the Treasury's review of
dividend taxation. Hanson donated Pounds 100,000 to the Conservative party
in its last financial year, which ended in September 1993.
He expresses relief in the letter that Mr John Major appears to be taking
charge of the study into savings and investment. Lord Hanson recently
accused Mr Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, in a letter of
'sounding like a socialist' in questioning the wisdom of high dividends. He
insisted that the issue of dividends was one for shareholders and their
companies alone, and not the government.
Lord Hanson's latest letter has irritated some ministers who support the
Treasury's review of savings. 'In urging the prime minister, as First Lord
of the Treasury, to take charge of the review, Lord Hanson is interfering in
government policy,' a minister said. 'The Treasury has a good point over
dividends and the prime minister will not be put off by Lord Hanson.'
Lord Hanson has been encouraged by Mr Major's recent interview in The Daily
Telegraph in which he said there was no question of dividend control from a
Conservative government. 'Dividend control is socialism,' the prime minister
said. 'I'm a Tory; dividend control is a non-starter.'
Mr Major appeared to restrict the Treasury's room for manoeuvre by
dismissing the argument that high dividends prevent capital investment.
Hanson, which is one of the Conservative party's biggest company
contributors and has donated more than Pounds 800,000 since the Tories came
to power in 1979, said it was only being supportive of the prime minister.
Mr Christopher Collins, a director of Hanson, said: 'Having seen the prime
minister's interview, Lord Hanson wrote a private and friendly letter to say
how pleased he was with the line he took in the dividend issue.'
The Treasury angered Lord Hanson by suggesting that UK dividend pay-outs,
which have risen significantly during the past decade, may have become too
high and inflexible.
Mr Dorrell said the Treasury decided to review savings and investment to see
whether the rise in dividends had come about because of the tax structure
set by the government. 'After 15 years of deregulation, there's no question
of us regulating dividends,' Mr Dorrell said.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Fiji to review constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fiji is to set up a joint select committee to help review the country's
racially-biased constitution, writes Nikki Tait.
The constitution, introduced in 1990 after two military coups by Mr Sitiveni
Rabuka, now Fiji's prime minister, ensures that indigenous Fijians have a
majority in parliament at the expense of the large Indian population.
The government has promised to set up a commission to review the
constitution by 1997. However, Mr Rabuka's commitment to the process has
come into question recently, after the prime minister warned that another
coup could take place if Fijians continued to feel disadvantaged. His
remarks prompted Indian political leaders to boycott parliament for several
days.
The move on a joint select committee, announced yesterday, appears to be an
effort to allay these fears. One of its tasks will be to advise Fiji's
cabinet on the size and membership of the constitutional commission itself.

International donors yesterday pledged Dollars 31.4m (Pounds 20.6m) to study
ways to stop the Aral Sea in central Asia drying up. It used to be the
world's largest fresh water lake before shrinking over the past 30 years to
half its original size of 690,000 sq km, David Buchan reports from Paris.
The money is to fund feasibility studies for a larger Dollars 220m
investment programme, designed to try to restore the flow of river water
into the lake and to counter environmental damage by stemming the blowing of
toxic salts from the exposed seabed on to surrounding towns and cropland.
The cash pledges were made at a meeting in Paris yesterday, chaired by the
World Bank, of various governments and international organisations.

Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt Australian businessman, has lost his application

ill-health. The case concerns four art fraud charges relating to the
multi-million dollar acquisition and sale of La Promenade, a French
Impressionist painting, while Mr Bond was a director of Bond Corporation in
the 1980s, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Mr Bond's lawyers, who had asked for a six-month adjournment, claimed that
Mr Bond was suffering from depression and brain damage following open-heart
surgery, and was not well enough to instruct solicitors. But Mr Ivan Brown,
a Perth-based magistrate, said yesterday that Mr Bond had chosen to spend
his time conducting business transactions, and ruled that the case should
proceed as planned on July 18.

FT  25 JUN 94 / California to vote on illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Illegal immigrants in California will be denied public education, healthcare
and other social programmes if the state passes an initiative which won
enough signatures this week to be placed on the ballot in November.
The vote could serve as a bellwether in other states, such as Florida and
New York, which also have a large number of illegal aliens.
California state officials confirmed that backers of the proposal - dubbed
the 'Save Our State' initiative - collected the more than 600,000 signatures
necessary to put the issue to a state-wide vote this autumn.
The vote is shaping up to be a divisive political issue. Mr Pete Wilson,
California's incumbent Republican governor, running for re-election but
behind in the polls, endorsed the initiative last week.
Mr Wilson's Democrat opponent, Ms Kathleen Brown, opposes the proposal, as
do a number of prominent civil rights and Latino groups.
These critics have labelled the initiative discriminatory and racist as it
primarily targets Hispanic and Asian minorities. They have promised to
challenge the proposal on constitutional grounds if it passes.
Backers count among their ranks several current and former immigration
officials, including Mr Alan Nelson, who ran the US Immigration and
Naturalisation Service under the Reagan administration.
Proponents say California's public education, housing, health and social
programmes are already stretched as illegal aliens are entering the state at
a rate of 2,000 a week. The initiative would ease pressure on California's
budget.
It would also require police, teachers and healthcare workers to report
suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities.

A young boy salutes as he stands beside a UN soldier overseeing the
unloading of food aid in the Rwandan capital Kigali, which rebels yesterday
attacked, Reuter reports from Kigali. Their mortars hit the Red Cross
hospital and public market, causing dozens of casualties.
Meanwhile, in government-held western Rwanda, French troops on a
peacekeeping mission reached the north-western town of Gisenyi after several
reconnaissance missions around the town of Cyangugu in the south-west.
A first unit, entering from Bukavu in eastern Zaire, spent the night outside
the refugee camp of Nyarushishi near Cyangugu, checking conditions of the
estimated 8,000 Tutsi refugees sheltering in fear of massacre at the hands
of Hutu militiamen.
The first mission to an area where Tutsi refugees are in a majority was
apparently intended to show that France's Operation Turquoise would be
impartial despite past support for the Hutu government.
The commander of the operation, Brigadier Jean-Claude Lafourcade, told
reporters as he left Paris for Zaire he was determined to use force if
necessary to protect refugees from massacres which have claimed half a
million victims since April. 'My mandate allows me to use force to protect
civilians and I shall use it,' he said.
He expected his opponents to be disorganised gangs hunting refugees and not
the Tutsi-led Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF). The rebels have threatened to
oppose the controversial United Nations-backed operation, fearing that
France would use it to back the Hutu-led
government.
Paris, which launched the operation single-handedly because of lukewarm
international backing, has been at pains to make clear it will not take

In Geneva, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees backed the

FT  25 JUN 94 / Japanese trade surplus 'key to currency flux'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Economic fundamentals are the most important factor for exchange rate levels
and will have to be addressed if the rise in the yen is to be halted, Mr
Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday.
Market intervention alone could not guide exchange rates to desired levels,
he added.
At a speech at the National Press Club, Mr Mieno said Japan's huge trade
surplus often surfaced as a key factor behind the yen's rise and measures to
correct it were 'the most important' in dealing with currency problems.
Confusion over his remarks sent the dollar tumbling towards the Y100 level
early yesterday in Tokyo before European and US markets opened. The
governor's remarks were interpreted by currency traders as casting doubt on
the effectiveness of central bank intervention to halt the yen's rise, and
an admission that the bank's action to support the dollar had failed.
Later, however, a Bank of Japan official said the markets had misinterpreted
the governor's remarks. Mr Mieno had said intervention was effective in
stemming the dollar's fall but it could not guide currencies to precise
levels.
In his speech, the governor said there were some benefits from the rising
yen - it would help promote industrial restructuring as companies were
confronted by the need to become more internationally competitive.
He again expressed optimism about prospects for economic recovery, citing
recent sharp increases in exports and personal spending. But he warned that
corporate investment would remain sluggish as companies continued to adjust
to over-accumulation of capital in the late 1980s.

The lawyer of Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, the kidnapped Mexican financier, said on
television that his ransom would be paid, paving the way for the release of
one of the country's wealthiest men, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
Mr Harp, the joint head of Banamex-Accival, the country's largest bank, was
seized in March. His kidnapping has been given enormous publicity, with his
abductors sending the press a series of emotional letters from the financier
to his family and partners in which he pleaded for his life. The lawyer made
the statement on Mexico's main television news programme, accompanied by Mr
Harp's son, and a representative of the Catholic church, as demanded by the
kidnappers.
The kidnappers said in their latest communique that the ransom demand had
been dropped to less than Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.7m). Mr Harp's lawyer
agreed to pay an unspecified amount, and not to involve the police.
The kidnappers have promised to release Mr Harp three days after receiving
the ransom.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An extraordinary week of Sino-British negotiations over Hong Kong's future
was capped yesterday when leaders of the British and Chinese teams
instructed subordinates to prepare a draft agreement on the financing of the
colony's multi-billion dollar airport.
The UK and China have been arguing about how to finance the HKDollars 158bn
(Pounds 13.3bn) project for the past two years. Yesterday's comments
amounted to the most positive sign to date that an agreement is in the
offing.
The intensive negotiations come ahead of the Hong Kong's Legislative
Council's vote next Wednesday on Governor Chris Patten's democracy
legislation.
Mr Hugh Davies, Britain's senior representative to the Joint Liaison Group
(JLG), which oversees the transfer of sovereignty, said he hoped an
agreement could be reached by Thursday or earlier. On Friday the Hong Kong
government plans to ask the Legislative Council (LegCo) for HKDollars 15bn
to start work on construction of the airport terminal and runway.
Mr Guo Fengmin, his Chinese counterpart, said the two had decided to entrust
to experts the writing of 'a draft agreement of the important points for
representatives of the two sides to sign, making an agreement between the
two sides.'
There was optimism in the UK camp that the two would reach an agreement. 'I
think we will get there in the end,' an official said, 'but we have gone
into drafting and this takes time.' The UK wants as detailed a statement as
possible, while China prefers to keep it general, and officials concede that
that provides plenty of room for cavilling. In particular, the UK wants a
deal which bankers will lend against and this will require 'clear evidence
of China's support' for the project.
The airport and its connecting railway will cost about HKDollars 83bn,
HKDollars 23bn of which has to be borrowed in international markets.
To satisfy China's concerns the agreement is also likely to contain a
limitation on the aggregate borrowings of the corporations building the
airport and its railway as well as enhanced oversight of the project's cost
effectiveness.
No one is sure how long the drafting of the agreement will take although
some officials suggested it could take longer than usual.
Drafting of the airport agreement is proceeding in parallel with attempts to
bridge the gap dividing the UK and China on the issue of military land in
Hong Kong. In a surprise move on Thursday the JLG was suspended to allow
experts to thrash out details of an agreement.
The UK has already conceded that the People's Liberation Army will be
stationed in Hong Kong's business district and has agreed to build the
Chinese navy a new port on Stonecutters Island in Victoria harbour.
The Hong Kong government will pay for work - estimated at HKDollars 3.5bn -
done on these facilities before 1997. But because the UK is unable to
guarantee that LegCo will approve this sum China has asked London to
indemnify the work.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government is likely to cut back its ambitious nuclear fuel
programme following an advisory panel's call yesterday for a delay in
projects involving plutonium.
Their report, which is a basis for the government's long-term nuclear energy
policy, follows growing domestic and international concern over Japan's
surplus of plutonium, a highly toxic fuel that can be used for nuclear
weapons.
Japan's nuclear recycling programme was adopted in the 1950s when plutonium
was regarded as a 'dream fuel'.
The country's first prototype fast-breeder, named Monju and based on the
west coast, began a self-sustaining reaction last month, using plutonium
produced at processing plants in Britain and France. Japan's first
reprocessing plant, in northern Japan, is due to start operating at the end
of the decade.
Until recently Japan has resisted calls from domestic and international
environmental groups for curbs on its programme. However, mounting
accusations that Japan intended to build nuclear weapons increased
government anxiety.
While the report calls only for a delay in various projects linked to
plutonium use, and not cancellation, it is a severe blow to the country's
nuclear lobby.
The report proposes: Postponement of the decision to build a second nuclear
fuel reprocessing plant until the year 2010, instead of launching the plant
that year;
Moving back the target date for when plutonium fast breeders will be put to
commercial use by 10 years to 2030;
Postponement of construction of the first demonstration fast breeder reactor
to early next century;
Delay to plans to construct more than 20 light-water reactors by 2010 by
about 20 years.

policymaker in the administration of President Rafael Caldera, did not
specify what these measures would be but he indicated the administration
could declare a 'state of economic emergency'. This would give the executive
branch the power to dictate extraordinary economic and financial measures to
confront an economic crisis.
Many Venezuelans, alarmed by a deteriorating economy, expect the government

FT  25 JUN 94 / Go-ahead likely for European atom-smasher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe is on the brink of building the world's most powerful atom-smasher.
The council of Cern, the European particle physics laboratory near Geneva,
yesterday voiced strong support for going ahead with the Large Hadron
Collider, which will hurl atomic nuclei together at close to the speed of
light. The LHC will recreate the conditions existing a millionth of a
millionth of a second after the Big Bang that created our universe.
Two of the 19 Cern members, the UK and Germany, blocked the final go-ahead
as they were not satisfied with the financial arrangements for the SFr2.6bn
(Pounds 1.2bn) project. They want France and Switzerland - the countries
that would derive most economic benefit from Cern, as host states - to
provide extra funds.
But council delegates expressed confidence that the budgetary issues could
be settled quickly and the LHC finally approved later this summer.
Mr Hubert Curien, Cern's chairman, said the French and Swiss governments had
given 'very encouraging' signs that they would increase their support.
Cern members also expect non-European countries - notably the US, Japan,
Russia, Canada and India - to make substantial contributions, in return for
their scientists working on LHC experiments.
After the cancellation last October of the planned Dollars 11bn (Pounds
7.2bn) US Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) in Texas, Cern has emerged as
the undisputed global centre for high-energy physics.
Ms Hazel O'Leary, US energy secretary, is expected to propose measures to
Congress early next month for mitigating the effects of the SSC cancellation
on US physicists, through increased international collaboration.
Cern officials believe that the US could contribute several hundred million
dollars to the LHC.
There are two reasons why the LHC would be much cheaper than the SSC. First,
it will be squeezed into an existing tunnel - a ring 27km in diameter
beneath the Jura foothills - that was built in the 1980s for Cern's current
accelerator, LEP. A new 87km tunnel was being dug for the SSC.
Second, the LHC will be less powerful than the SSC would have been.
However, it will pack several times more energy into its collisions than LEP
or the atom-smashers currently operating in the US - enough, scientists say,
to discover several fundamental facts about the forces and particles that
determine the nature of the universe.
The LHC's most important single job will be to provide evidence to clear up
the mystery of mass - what gives fundamental particles their mass and why
some weigh so much more than others.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Kohl surges ahead of SPD standard bearer

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) has moved four
points clear of its election rival, Mr Rudolf Scharping's Social Democratic
party (SPD), in the latest German opinion poll, for the first time in three
years.
The two percentage point gain for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the
Christian Social Union (CSU), comes just four months before the general
election in October, and confirms the trend in the recent European
elections.
At the same time, two polls showed a growing lead for Mr Kohl in the
personal popularity stakes, reversing the consistent trend of recent months.
However, the latest forecasts do not show any clear majority for either a
left-wing or right-wing coalition in the general election, due on October
16, leaving the final outcome still very much in doubt.
The results of the Politbarometer poll, published last night by ZDF
television, give Mr Kohl's CDU/CSU 40 per cent support if there were
national elections tomorrow, compared with 36 per cent - down three points -
for the SPD.
The very sharp reversal undoubtedly reflects voters' perceptions after the
European poll on June 12, but does not include any response to this week's
SPD party conference, which could see some recovery in the party's fortunes.
However, it augurs badly for the SPD's hopes of winning the most seats in
tomorrow's election in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the party
hopes to win power from the CDU.
As far as personal popularity is concerned, both Politbarometer, and a
separate poll by the Forsa institute in the weekly newspaper, Die Woche, put
Mr Kohl well in front of Mr Scharping. The former gives the chancellor 48
per cent support, compared to 41 per cent for his challenger, reversing the
40:51 per cent position in May.
Die Woche's poll gives Mr Kohl 42 per cent and Mr Scharping only 26 per
cent, in response to the question: 'Whom would you elect directly as
chancellor?'

<TEXT>
The new Italian government yesterday set unions a deadline to agree on
labour market reforms which would make it easier to hire and fire people,
Reuter reports from Rome.
Mr Pietro Larizza, head of the UIL, one of the country's three national
union confederations said Mr Clemente Mastella, labour minister, told them
that the government would put legislation to parliament by the end of next
month, with or without their consent.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, who promised on taking office last
month to create 1m jobs in the next two years, wants to make it easier for
employers to take on temporary and part-time workers. Companies would also
be able to offer rates of pay below union minimums to young employees and
the long-term unemployed.
However, unions fear that the new rules could let unscrupulous companies
replace existing workers with lower-paid labour.
Unemployment is running at about 11.5 per cent of Italy's 22m workforce, and
union power has been diminished since the 1980s.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany yesterday joined forces with the UK to press the case for
deregulation and flexible labour markets in the European Union.
The UK-German alliance at the Corfu summit received measured suport from Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister.
Mr Berlusconi called for less law-making from Brussels, though he told Mr
John Major, Britain's prime minister, at a breakfast meeting, that he did
not support Britain's opt-out of the social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty.
EU leaders - joined by their finance ministers - discussed the European
economy in their afternoon session against the background of an incipient
recovery but no sign of a halt to the rise in unemployment.
Top items were the European Commission's White Paper on employment, growth
and competitiveness, including progress on starting major infrastructure
projects known trans-European networks, as well as a report on the 'new
information society' in Europe.
Leaders also discussed the Commission's recommendations on macro-economic
guidelines, the framework for the 12 members of the Union to move toward a
single European currency, to be joined by Austria, Finland, Sweden, and
Norway if they enter the Union as planned next year.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, praised the
macro-economic guidelines, which call for wage restraint, budgetary
discipline, and structural reforms of the labour markets to create new jobs
and lift burdens on small business.
Mr Clarke supported Germany's request for the establishment of an
independent group of businessmen and civil servants to examine whether EU
and national legislation is imposing unnecessary red tape on companies.
Separately, the UK Chancellor made a pitch for faster liberalisation of the
European telecommunications industry.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission, avoided a re-run of last
December's clash with finance ministers over funding of the trans-European
networks.
He failed then in his bid to win support for greater European Commission
borrowing to fund the multi-billion rail and road projects.
However, Mr Delors called for a 'firm commitment' to start work on 19
'priority' infrastructure projects.
These include 11 transport projects such the Channel tunnel link in the UK;
a high-speed rail and road link through the Brenner pass linking Italy,
Austria and Germany; and an eastern EU high-speed train between Paris and
Strasbourg, plus a link joining Munich, Leipzig and Berlin.
In addition, there are eight multi-billion Ecus energy projects including an
underwater cable link between eastern and western Denmark; an underwater
electricity cable between Italy and Greece; and a natural gas line between
Spain and Portugal, with energy supplied from Algeria.
Aides to Mr Delors said the Commission president was most anxious to start
work on the trans-European networks. If the so-called 'financing gap'
materialised, then the Commission would be in a strong position to lobby for
extra borrowing powers.
British officials called for an in-depth analysis of the 19 projects.
There was no obvious shortage of capital for the networks, given the lead
role of the European Investment Bank, private capital and the newly
established European Investment Fund.
'If there are obstacles, they are of an administrative, legislative or
planning nature,' said one UK official.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Power and coal sales postponed

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday postponed completing one of its
most ambitious sales of eastern Germany's electricity network and of the
last of the large brown coal, or lignite, fields.
Following a Treuhand board meeting, the agency said the planned sale of
Veag, east Germany's electricity network, and Laubag, the giant lignite
fields, might be completed 'next week.'
The Treuhand did not explain the delay.
Veag is to be sold to a west German utility consortium led by RWE Energie.
Laubag, which will supply Veag with its brown coal, will be acquired by a
consortium led by Rheinbraun, the 100 per cent brown coal subsidiary of RWE.
The delay in completing the deal, despite pressure from Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, is thought to arise from the buyers' anxiety about prospects for
energy consumption in eastern Germany.
The two consortiums are increasingly concerned about a shift by east German
domestic and industrial customers to gas, and about the pressure on
electricity to compete with gas prices. For the moment, gas prices are
significantly lower than electricity prices.
These factors have repeatedly affected the complex privatisation
negotiations for Veag and Laubag because their sales are tied to a
comprehensive investment programme of DM41bn (Pounds 16.6bn) over 10 years.
But any return on those investments depends on a stable customer base.
Part of the investment timetable entails the construction of two 800MW power
stations at Lippendorf in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt.
Energy analysts yesterday suggested, however, that part of the investment
programme might be cancelled, which would reduce brown coal sales to Veag
and thus affect the sale price of Veag.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West German inflation is continuing its slow decline as industrial output
and exports pick up speed, according to official figures published
yesterday.
Consumer prices in the most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, rose at
an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the month to mid-June, compared with 2.9
per cent in May. The month-on-month rate of 0.2 per cent has been unchanged
since June.
Similar trends were also reported in Baden-Wurttemberg and Hesse, with
year-on-year increases of 3.1 per cent and with monthly rises of 0.3 per
cent and 0.2 per cent respectively.
The sluggish trend is widely expected to remain broadly unchanged until
September or October, when the annual inflation rate is expected to dip
towards 2.5 per cent.
Economists said yesterday's preliminary figures supported their forecast of
an overall annual rate for June of 2.9 per cent, compared with 3 per cent in
May.
Meanwhile, the automotive and steel industries reported rising output and
federal statistics office figures showed visible exports continuing to rise
strongly.
The VDA vehicle makers' group said May passenger car production was 15 per
cent higher than a year earlier and exports were up 13 per cent. Adjusted
for the extra working day this year, the increases were 9 per cent and 7 per
cent.
New car orders in May were also higher than in 1993, while demand for
commercial vehicles was starting to recover, the VDA said. Production of
trucks up to six tonnes during the month was 9 per cent higher than a year
earlier, although output for the first five months was still down 1 per
cent.
The improvements were reflected in an 18 per cent increase in rolled steel
production during the month.
Although pan-German total visible exports and imports fell 9.4 per cent and
10.5 per cent respectively during April, the statistics office noted there
were four fewer working days than in March.
On an annual comparison, exports rose 8.6 per cent and imports were 1.2 per
cent lower.
The trade balance surplus of DM6bn (Pounds 2.43bn), unchanged on the month,
was well up on the DM1.2bn recorded in April, 1993.
Imports are expected to remain weak as domestic demand remains constrained
by lower disposable incomes but foreign orders for German goods are still
increasing sharply.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Russian budget given go-ahead

The Russian budget for 1994 passed both houses of parliament yesterday -
with leading members of parliament openly derisive of its feasibility and
government officials admitting revenue was dropping and would drop further.
Deputies in both houses appear to have agreed to pass the budget to give the
government a legislative base for spending - and to avoid being bogged down
in exhaustive debates on the 500 amendments proposed. Mr Nikolai Gonchar,
chairman of the budget committee in the upper house, said the budget's
targets could not be met but some budget was better than none.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the main liberal party, Russia's Choice, told the
Interfax news agency that the spending and revenue estimates were 'totally
unrealistic' - though his faction voted it through.
Mr Sergei Aleksashenko, deputy finance minister, said tax revenue was more
than Rbs8,000bn (Pounds 2.8bn) down in the first part of the year and would
drop further in the second - though other estimates put the shortfall much
higher.
Military expenditure, the focus of the biggest struggle for increases, has
been set at Rbs40,000bn - up by Rbs2,500bn from the original figure but well
below the Rbs55,000bn the military say is essential to maintain basic
effectiveness.
Figures produced by the government show that the Rbs40,000bn would include
Rbs22,100bn for basic military financing, Rbs8,500bn for arms purchases,
Rbs4,800bn for capital construction, Rbs2,500bn for scientific research and
testing, and Rbs1,900bn for pensions.
Anti-corruption crusader Alexander Lukashenko scored an upset victory over
the prime minister in the first round of presidential elections in Belarus,
sending shock waves through the former Soviet republic, Reuter reports from
Minsk.
Unofficial returns gave 45.1 per cent of Thursday's vote to Mr Lukashenko,
who drew big crowds with speeches pledging to drive bribe-takers from
office. Fifty per cent was needed for first-round victory.
Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, who focused his campaign on a monetary
union with Russia, was in second place with 17.4 per cent. The two leaders
face a run-off poll in two weeks.

Portugal's junior minister for employment and training, Mr Antonio Pinto
Cardoso, has resigned after the attorney-general's office began an
investigation into allegations of his involvement in the suspected misuse of
European Social Fund money.
The minister's resignation is an embarrasment for the centre-right
government of Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, which prides itself on a reasonably
honest record in using EU funds. It will also fuel controversy over alleged
corruption in the use of social fund money.
Mr Pinto Cardoso said in a statement that he had not been accused of any
wrong-doing but was resigning to protect the good name of the government and
to help investigators discover the truth.
A Portuguese newspaper said yesterday officials were investigating a Es126m
(Pounds 504,000) subsidy awarded by the employment ministry for the launch
of a magazine publicising ESF-funded training courses. The report alleged
that the subsidy was made from Portuguese government and ESF funds, with Mr
Pinto Cardoso's knowledge but without approval by the European Commission.
The attorney-general, Mr Jose Cunha Rodrigues, and the head of Portugal's
judiciary police, Mr Mario Mendes, on Thursday briefed a parliamentary
commission on the progress of investigations into several cases of alleged
misuse of ESF funds.
Mr Cunha Rodrigues said afterwards that he expected several important cases
to come to court by the end of 1994. Officials are investigatiing more than
400 cases of alleged misuse of ESF funds. So far, only 21 have reached the
courts. Investigators complain of a lack of resources.
Controversy over spending of ESF funds for training has been simmering for
several years. Allegations of misuse of funds were the subject of an
inconclusive parliamentary inquiry in Portugal last year.
The European Commission said yesterday it had not given its agreement to
finance the project in question and had not transfered the money to the
Portuguese authorities. 'We will investigate further,' said a commission
spokeswoman.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Ukraine N-strategy doubted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EU efforts to agree on a support framework for the overhaul of Ukraine's
energy sector, to make possible the early closure of the Chernobyl nuclear
reactors, have been clouded by leaked reports calling into question the
strategy and its costs.
The EU's Corfu summit is expected to agree a common position on the
Ukrainian nuclear safety question today to take to next month's G7 summit in
Naples. No figures for EU aid will be decided, in the hope of extracting
maximum financial pledges from the US and Japan in Naples.
The essential idea is to raise funding sufficient to shut Chernobyl and
complete construction of five unfinished Soviet-era reactors to western
safety standards.
The EU made clear last week to President Leonid Kravchuk, when the 12 signed
a wide-ranging partnership agreement with Ukraine in Luxembourg, that
closure of Chernobyl was of paramount concern to west European governments.
An April report by experts from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and the World Bank, leaked by Greenpeace, the environmental
campaign group, underlines the inadequate safety standards of plant design
and operation in Ukraine; the near bankruptcy of the nuclear sector, which
constrains upgrading and maintenance, leads to staff shortages, and risks
shoddy construction; and the plethora of estimates on the costs of safe
nuclear power generation.
Goskomatom, the Ukrainian nuclear authority, provided the EBRD/World Bank
team with an estimated cost of Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 790m) to complete five
new reactors under construction at Zaporozhe, Rovno and Khmelnitsky. A year
ago, the EBRD reported to the G7 that the cost of completing just two of
these reactors would be Dollars 1.5bn, about half of it in hard currency.
The Ukrainian government has since said that the overhaul of its nuclear
sector could cost up to Dollars 14bn.
Without western aid, it predicts the likely completion of only one of the
five new units - already 95 per cent finished - but only to local safety
standards. The fact-finding mission also warns that Ukraine could go ahead
with its February decision to re-start next year Chernobyl's second reactor,
damaged by fire in 1991.
The EU and its G7 partners, by falling in with Ukraine's nuclear ambitions,
on the evidence of the EBRD/World Bank report face a greater challenge than
they have acknowledged.
Western nuclear construction companies, moreover, may balk at accepting
contracts in the Ukraine because there is no legal regime to protect them
from liability in the event of accidents. Under international conventions,
such a regime would have to be put in place with the consent of neighbouring
countries. 'They will not sort this question out in the near term,'
predicted Mr Antony Froggatt of Greenpeace. 'The west is playing with fire.'

FT  25 JUN 94 / Berlusconi goes into a minefield with aplomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's new tycoon premier, took a sure first step on
to the European stage yesterday in spite of a modest attempt to trip him.
Arriving at his first EU summit for the pre-meeting signings of an EU
agreement with Russia and EU membership treaties with Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Norway, he faced an immediate snub.
Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's Socialist European affairs minister, who has
played the lead role in his country's six-month presidency of the EU,
greeted each of the arriving heads of government with a handshake, but then
turned his back on Mr Berlusconi and left it to the Greek head of protocol
to bring him in to the meeting.
The Greek presidency denied it had withheld the normal greeting and added to
the snubs Italian ministers have been getting from some of their colleagues
because of Mr Berlusconi's inclusion of neo-fascists in his coalition. In so
far as the head of protocol did his duty, the Greeks ate their cake and had
it.
But Mr Berlusconi was unfazed, appeared to sleep through most of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's speech, and signed each treaty with a great
flourish and oversized B. Then, alone among the 12 leaders, he bounded over
to Nordic and Alpine newcomers and shook each by the hand - seizing the
photo-opportunity of visual endorsement by the squeaky-clean democrats from
the north.
He had begun his day at a 1 1/4 -hour breakfast with Mr John Major, the
British prime minister. The UK, often isolated in EU affairs, is attracted
by Rome's new Eurosceptical tone, and anxious to cement an alliance with it.
The two agreed to hold an Anglo-Italian summit soon.
British officials said Mr Major and Mr Berlusconi voiced 'a fair amount of
very similar positions on the way to go' on deregulation, flexible labour
markets, and on subsidiarity in EU decision-making.
But they refused to comment on whether the Italian premier shared British
distaste for Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's federalist prime minister, who
has been leading his fellow Christian Democrat rival, the outgoing Dutch
prime minister Ruud Lubbers, in the shadowy race to succeed Mr Jacques
Delors as European Commission president.
Italian officials were more forthcoming, saying that London and Rome agreed
the succession had been badly handled, and that it was not right for France
and Germany, Mr Dehaene's powerful backers, to impose him on others.
But Mr Berlusconi came to Corfu looking to bargain for a settlement of a
long-running row over Italy's flouting of EU limits on milk production, and
has threatened to hold up the EU budget increase planned for next year
unless he gets satisfaction. He also wants EU backing for former Italian
trade minister Renato Ruggiero to take over as head of the new World Trade
Organisation next year.
Some EU officials believe the Italian may have reached an understanding with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl on this package at their recent meeting, in exchange
for not blocking Mr Dehaene. Yet others predicted that Mr Berlusconi would
wait to see who the majority backed, and then join it.
But the Italian hand is only as strong as the way Mr Berlusconi plays it. To
cash in on support for Mr Dehaene, Mr Berlusconi was going to need a strong
feel for bluff, signals and timing. Mr Berlusconi risked raising Mr Lubbers'
hopes and incurring blame for a failure to reach agreement.
It usually takes a while to grasp the chemistry of the EU's negotiating and
hostage-taking. And it would be an unusual man who got it right first time.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Yeltsin signs plan to bring Russia back into Europe: FT
writers report from the start of the EU leaders' two-day summit in Corfu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and FT Writers
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday signed a landmark 'partnership'
agreement with the European Union which strengthens political and economic
ties, and holds out the prospect of a free trade area at the turn of the
century.
Mr Yeltsin, visibly pleased, told EU leaders at the Corfu summit the
agreement was of historic importance: 'There is a clear definition of the
various stages of bringing Russia back into economic Europe as an equal
partner.'
The partnership and co-operation agreement - similar in scope to the pact
signed this month between the EU and Ukraine - is a central plank in western
strategy aimed at stabilising post-communist Russia.
It also aims to ease Russian nationalist fears of encirclement as more
countries which were formerly Soviet satellites or neutrals, from the Baltic
to the Adriatic, are drawn into the democratic, market-oriented orbit of the
European Union.
In a telling sequence, minutes after Mr Yeltsin was whisked away in his
armoured black Zil, the leaders of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway
stepped into his place in St George's Chapel to sign accession treaties to
the European Union. Poland and Hungary have already applied to join the EU,
with the Czechs in the wings.
Yet EU diplomats believe their policy of embracing Russia is paying off.
This week, Russia became the 21st country to enter the Nato alliance's
Partnership for Peace, dropping its earlier demands for a special status and
joining its former communist satellites in central and eastern Europe.
Next month, the Group of Seven industrialised nations will welcome Russia as
a member of the G8 at their summit in Naples. The new political grouping is
calculated to appeal to Russia's demands to be treated as a great power.
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, said the partnership agreement
was more than a symbolic act. It amounted to a quantum leap in relations
with Russia which would encourage foreign investment in Russia and
liberalise trade.
Last year, Russian exports to the Union were valued at Dollars 17.4bn
(Pounds 11.4bn), around 50 per cent of its total exports. Main items
included minerals (44 per cent) and wood products (14 per cent). EU exports
to Russia were Dollars 13.5bn, with one third being electrical machines and
parts; processed foodstuffs made up 16 per cent.
The agreement contains several important 'safeguard' mechanisms aimed at
regulating two-way trade before 1998, when the EU and Russia will decide
whether to embark on the far more ambitious goal of a free trade area. Its
main features include:
EU support for Russian accession to the General Agreement on Trade and
Tariffs and the successor World Trade Organisation. Meantime, both sides
agree to consult before increasing tariffs on each other.
Removal of all EU quotas on Russian exports, with the exception of certain
textile and steel products. But Moscow may introduce limited restrictions in
sectors facing heavy jobs losses, or those which could lose market share to
more competitive western companies.
Safeguard clauses may be introduced on either side to curb sudden surges of
imports, similar to those in Gatt. These require parties to show there has
been substantial injury to domestic producers.
Enriched and natural uranium. Thanks to pressure from France, which has the
largest share of the EU market, the pact includes safeguard clauses similar
to an earlier 1989 pact with Russia. The aim is to conclude a separate
agreement covering nuclear fuels by 1997.
Investment and business. The pact removes obstacles to the free flow of
capital, including direct investment as well as repatriation of profits.
Once established in Russia, EU companies cannot be subjected to restrictive
legislation for three years following the passage of any new law. Mobility
of labour and management should increase, too.
The most vexed topic in the negotiations concerned the Russian banking
sector. After much huffing and puffing, Moscow has agreed to scrap by 1996 a
decree maintaining curbs on foreign banks. Meantime, this law will not apply
retrospectively to the five banks already given licences in Russia - Credit
Lyonnais and Generale de Banque of France; Dresdner Bank of Germany; and the
Dutch INGBank and ABN Amro.
Mr Yeltsin called for trust between the EU and Russia and welcomed ever
closer political and economic integration inside the Union. Russia intended
to press for 'more and more integration' in the Commonwealth of Independent
States, he said.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Kohl plays up the Saxon angle: Summit diary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has clearly not forgotten last year's remark by Mr
Theodore Pangalos, Greece's European affairs minister, that the re-united
Germany has 'a bestial giant's strength and a child's brain'. Both he and Mr
Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, managed to arrive too late for
the Corfu summit's opening dinner, in honour of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin. Greek officials were not convinced by their excuse of being delayed
by a last-minute campaign trip to Saxony-Anhalt ahead of Sunday's state
elections.
Still, Mr Pangalos demonstrated that six months of chairing EU meetings have
done nothing to make him more tactful. Having criticised the neo-fascists in
Italy's government, he refused to shake hands with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
Italian prime minister, in full view of the television cameras yesterday.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister whose uncertain health is a
constant worry to the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, appeared to
have put on a new face for a meeting of European Socialist parties on the
eve of the summit. From a distance he had a suntanned glow to his
complexion. Close up, however, delegates noticed that he was wearing a thick
layer of make-up.
His young wife Dimitra visited the shrine of St Spyridon, the patron saint
of Corfu and the islanders' health. His mummified remains are carried around
the town every three months, recalling a miraculous escape from the plague
in the 17th century. Mrs Papandreou was seen to light a large candle to his
memory.
There were unkind comments - and not just from the Greeks - that President
Yeltsin had kept everyone up too late on Wednesday night. Dinner dragged on
until 1am, while a cheerful Mr Yeltsin talked and drank toasts to the EU's
economic pact with Russia. But he left most of his food untouched, causing
consternation among the waiters at the Corfu Palace Hotel, who postponed
removing his plate long after the other guests had finished each course.
Mr Yeltsin then bunked down aboard the Alexandros, a yacht belonging to Mr
John Latsis, reputedly the wealthiest Greek shipowner of all, berthed in
Corfu harbour and surrounded by a flotilla of Greek warships. Last week, Mr
Latsis took former US President George Bush and his family for a cruise of
the Greek islands on the Alexandros. This weekend, he is is rumoured to be
discussing with Mr Yeltsin a multi-billion-dollar deal for shipping Russian
oil to Greece through a pipeline to be constructed through Bulgaria.
One EU leader has the right sense of priorities. Mr Albert Reynolds, the
Irish prime minister, arranged to leave yesterday's session of talks early
and head for the press centre so he could watch Ireland's World Cup soccer
game against Mexico on television. Greek state television, broadcasting the
match, arranged a special hook-up with RTE, its Irish counterpart, so Mr
Reynolds could listen to an Irish rather than a Greek commentary.
However, Mr John Major, UK prime minister, turned down an offer to play in a
Saturday cricket match on Corfu between two local clubs. His advisers were
quoted as saying it would be 'too frivolous'. Cricket, a leftover from a
period of British rule in the Ionian islands, flourishes on a pitch just
outside the palace where the summit is being held.
Mr Major, who played a stylish cover drive before injury in a car accident,
will probably regret his decision. He may have to spend much of the
afternoon waiting his turn in the queue to leave the island. Because Corfu
airport is too small to accommodate all the EU leaders' flights, most of
them are parked at a Nato airbase on the Greek mainland. Bickering among
member states over the order of departure is causing headaches for the Greek
Defence Ministry.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Japan's prime minister fights to defeat no-confidence vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's nine-week-old minority government was early today fighting for
survival after talks aimed at averting a no-confidence vote in the
government broke down.
The five-party government of Mr Tsutomu Hata was still hoping to persuade
the opposition Social Democrats to rejoin the coalition. This would give it
enough votes to defeat a no-confidence motion launched by the Liberal
Democratic party, the largest opposition group.
The vote was scheduled for the early hours of this morning. The impasse
followed a breakdown in talks between Mr Hata, the prime minister, and Mr
Tomiichi Murayama, leader of the Social Democrats.
It increased the risk that Japan will descend into another leadership crisis
just before the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in
Naples at the start of next month. Japan was expected to present to its
partners plans to reinforce the fragile revival of the world's second
largest economy.
'Japan will lose the trust of international society,' warned Mr Ichiro
Ozawa, the government's strategist. 'We must send prime minister Hata to the
summit . . . if the entire cabinet resigns, we won't be able to form a new
cabinet in time,' he said.
Mr Hata and coalition officials yesterday refused SDP conditions that the
prime minister should resign and that the government should water down plans
for a rise in indirect taxation and possible sanctions against North Korea.
The Social Democrats walked out of the government just after it was formed
in April, in protest at plans to exclude them from policy making. Angry SDP
leaders warned yesterday they would put down their own no-confidence motion,
in addition to the one launched by the LDP. The outcome of the motion was
impossible to predict as both the main opposition parties are divided along
generation lines.
The LDP and SDP old guard are tempted to vote down the government in the
hope of forcing an early general election, before parliament has a chance to
pass a pending bill to reform the electoral system.
The older generation fears it would do worse under the new system. The
younger generation, including new parties such as Mr Hata's Japan Renewal
party, wants an election under the new system, which it sees as a chance to
improve on its successes in last summer's election.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Independent to accuse Murdoch of predatory pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, RAYMOND SNODDY and DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent, plans to go
to the Office of Fair Trading next week to accuse Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation of predatory pricing by reducing the cover price of The Times to
20p.
The renewed accusation that Mr Murdoch is trying to drive other papers, such
as The Independent, out of the market through such tactics was backed by Mr
Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary.
He wrote yesterday to Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair
trading, urging him to investigate the national newspaper pricing war.
As the row over the price-cutting intensified, the Stock Exchange said it
had found no evidence that last month's sale of 12.5m shares worth Pounds
73m in The Telegraph group by its proprietor Mr Conrad Black had any
connection with this week's cover price cut of The Daily Telegraph from 48p
to 30p.
The investigation had been asked for by the institutions which bought the
shares, now worth Pounds 30m less because of the cover price cut. Telegraph
shares fell another 17p to 332p yesterday compared with the price of 587p at
which Hollinger, Mr Black's Canadian holding company, sold the shares.
In the national newspaper industry, it became clear yesterday that few, if
any, other national newspapers plan to enter the price-cutting battle - at
least for the time being.
The exception is The Independent, which may soon reduce its price from 50p.
The rise that took it to that figure came at the time of the initial Times
cut from 45p to 30p and is now acknowledged as a mistake.
It is likely to go to 45p, in line with The Guardian, following pricing
experiments by The Independent which suggested a significant circulation
boost at that figure. The paper first complained to the OFT about predatory
pricing last September when The Times went to 30p - a complaint that was
rejected. The company feels its case is much stronger now.
Mr Matthew Symonds, the paper's executive editor, said: 'If this is not
predatory pricing, I don't know what is.'
When The Times was at 45p, Mr Symonds said, the news trade received 17.5p of
the cover price and News Corporation 27.5p. Because the news trade margin
had been fully protected, News International was now receiving around 2.5p
for each copy.
Mr Cook told Sir Bryan that a reduction of competition if other titles were
forced out of the market would not be in the interests of readers. The
price, Mr Cook said, 'is an ugly battle for domination between media barons,
and it is readers who are likely to be the long term casualties from the
fallout'.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Banks' action fails to lift dollar: Share and bond prices
fall - US Treasury 'prefers' stronger currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE, PHILIP COGGAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Concerted central bank inter-vention failed to lift the dollar yesterday,
prompting heavy declines in share and bond prices amid speculation that the
US Federal Reserve would be forced to raise short-term interest rates again
to defend the US currency.
Up to 17 central banks, led by the Fed, bought in excess of Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 1.95bn) three days after the dollar had fallen briefly below Y100, a
post-1945 low.
The dollar initially rallied on the intervention, climbing to Y101.8 and
DM1.61, but then fell back to Y100.9 and DM1.5972 by the London close. It
closed in New York at Y100.525 and DM1.584, below the levels at which the
central banks first intervened.
Confirming the action, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, said: 'Our
actions today in co-operation with our Group of Seven partners and other
monetary authorities reflect a shared concern about recent developments in
financial markets.'
In a hint that central banks would try again to stabilise the dollar, he
added: 'We look forward to continued co-operation to maintain the conditions
necessary for sustained economic expansion with low inflation.'
After the close of European trading, a senior Treasury official tried to
revive confidence with a much stronger statement: 'We intervened today to
demonstrate that this administration prefers a stronger dollar. In the
context of recent economic developments, it is our view and the G7's, that
further appreciation of the mark and yen would be counterproductive for
global recovery.'
The most that senior Clinton administration officials have previously said
is that the US sees 'no advantage in an undervalued currency'. The statement
about prefering a stronger dollar, however, came too late in the New York
afternoon to influence market sentiment.
The view on Wall Street was that the Fed might have to raise the short-term
Federal Funds rate, currently 4.25 per cent, at, or before, the next planned
meet ing of Fed governors and regional presidents on July 5-6. In London,
traders said the central bank action had failed, reinforcing the view that
intervention was ineffectual.
'If the best that the central banks can do is shift the dollar by one
pfennig, they might as well pack their bags and go home,' said Mr John
Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International (Europe).
The failure of the intervention depressed stock and bond markets in Europe
and the US. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 62.15
at 3,636.94, having fallen fast enough in early trading to trigger the
market's 'circuit breakers' which limit computer program trading. Treasury
bond prices also fell sharply, with the benchmark 30-year government bond
dropping 1 1/4 points, pushing the yield up to 7.517 per cent.
The FT-SE 100 index fell 65.8 points to 2,876.6, a new low for the year. In
Germany, the DAX index dropped 16.79 points to 2,005.31 to finish the week
with a 2.2 per cent loss overall. Both German bunds and UK gilts fell by
around  5/8 of a point yesterday.
Yesterday's concerted intervention followed similar action on May 4 and
intervention by the Fed in April to try to stem the dollar's decline.
Earlier this week, President Bill Clinton, Mr Bentsen and Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Fed chairman, attempted to talk the dollar higher by emphasising the
strength of the US recovery and the encouraging outlook for inflation.

FT  24 JUN 94 / C&amp;W units in talks on AT&amp;T alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies controlled by Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group,
have been in talks with AT&amp;T, the largest US telecoms operator, about
forming an international alliance, despite C&amp;W claims that it is not
interested in such a tie-up.
Mercury, C&amp;W's UK subsidiary, drew back earlier this month from joining
AT&amp;T's Worldsource international partnership, in what an insider called a
'knife-edge' decision. However, Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's largest undertaking,
is still in talks and may soon join Worldsource.
C&amp;W's manoeuvring emerged as AT&amp;T announced an alliance with Unisource, the
venture between the Swedish, Dutch and Swiss national telecoms operators.
Unisource, of which Telefonica of Spain is an associate member, will take an
unspecified equity stake in Worldsource. It will market Worldsource-branded
products in Europe, geared to the growing market for one-stop international
telecoms services for multinational companies.
AT&amp;T's alliance is in fierce competition with two others launched in the
past year - a Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.5bn) tie-up between British
Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest US operator; and a Dollars
4.2bn alliance, forged last week, between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom,
and Sprint, the third largest US long-distance operator.
AT&amp;T had hoped to include Mercury in yesterday's announcement. Although the
UK operator would have become only an associate of Worldsource, the
concentration of multinationals in London made it attractive to AT&amp;T. Mr
Mike Harris, Mercury chief executive, said: 'There was a real problem in
getting into bed with AT&amp;T, given their existing international partners.'
KDD, the largest Japanese international operator, is an equity member of
Worldsource, and Telstra, the Australian national operator, an associate.
Both compete with operators in which C&amp;W holds stakes - IDC in Japan and
Optus in Australia - and those companies made representations to C&amp;W against
Mercury allying with AT&amp;T.
Mr John Tonroe, finance director of Hongkong Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a
57.5 per cent stake, said the company was open to joining Worldsource,
denying that C&amp;W would veto such a move. Mr Harris acknowledged that
Hongkong Telecom might adopt a different strategy to the rest of C&amp;W.
Mr Robert Morris, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: 'C&amp;W really does have a
dilemma about how it fits into the emerging international alliances.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / The Corfu Summit: Disquiet over island facelift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CORFU, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
From the gleaming salmon-pink paint on Corfu's crumbling seafront mansions
to roads unusually free of potholes for a Greek island, it is clear that an
expensive facelift has been carried out in preparation for staging this
weekend's European Union summit.
The government says it has spent Dr14bn (Pounds 36.8m) on the Corfu summit,
though local officials say the bill is likely to be nearer Dr20bn.
The scale of government spending for the summit in Corfu, which receives
Dr2bn a year in EU structural funds, has been criticised by left-wing Greek
politicians and some EU diplomats, who argue it is too much, given Greece's
position as the union's poorest member state and its high level of debt.
Comparatively little EU funding has been disbursed for the summit. According
to the regional government office on Corfu, the main expense is a Dr3.3bn
upgrading of Corfu airport.
Mr Nikos Hytiris, in charge of EU disbursements in the Ionian islands, says:
'Like other improvements carried out for the summit, it will help to boost
the island's tourist industry long after the summit is forgotten.'
This weekend's summit is shorter than usual, with only one formal working
session of three hours, squeezed between the siesta hour and an official
dinner.
The main reason for restricting official working hours is that the Greek
prime minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou, who will chair the meeting, has a
heart problem that requires him to rest frequently.
The Dr1.9bn being spent on renovating the 19th-century palace of St Michael
&amp; St George, formerly home to the Greek Royal Family, includes Dr160m for a
temporary structure to serve as the meeting room for government leaders from
the 12 EU countries and the four new member states.
Because the council chamber, constructed of metal and bullet-proof glass
with a dramatic view across the Corfu strait to Albania, was built over the
palace's main courtyard, it is due to be removed the day after the summit.
'The courtyard was the only space in the building big enough for a European
council meeting, complete with interpreters' booths. But the state
archaeological service insists it has to come down immediately afterwards,'
said Mr Konstantinos Kouvaras, managing director of Avax, the Greek
construction company responsible for the turnkey project.
It is some consolation that the German government, which takes over the EU
presidency from Greece on July 1, has offered to buy the oval conference
table and chairs specially made for the meeting, he added.
The other main renovation project is the international press centre, a Dr3bn
conversion of an 18th century fortress designed for a garrison considerably
smaller than the 3,000-strong contingent of journalists covering the event.
Afterwards, the building will become Corfu's conference centre.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank have each bought 10 per cent of Buderus from
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled industrial and mining group, Reuter reports
from Frankfurt.
Metallgesellschaft sold its 79.9 per cent stake in the heating appliances
group in a placement which would lead to a cash injection of DM1.2bn,
Deutsche Bank, its largest creditor, said earlier this month.
Commerzbank's purchase of a 10 per cent stake 'arises from the long-standing
business links between Buderus and Commerzbank', the bank said.
Metallgesellschaft sold its Buderus stake as part of a restructuring after
creditor banks to Metallgesellschaft agreed to a DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.1bn)
rescue package at the beginning of this year.
Mr Hermann Mund, chairman of Deckel Maho, the German machine-tool maker,
said the company was not in danger of collapse and the group would emerge
from bankruptcy, Reuter reports from Munich.
'The company will at all events continue in operation, probably with
partners,' Mr Mund said.
Possible partners include machine-tool makers Gildemeister and Traub.

Northern Yemeni forces pounded the southern city of Aden with the heaviest
artillery barrage of Yemen's civil war yesterday as the south called for
sanctions to force the north to stop the attacks, Reuter reports from Aden.
Shells crashed into Aden's northern suburbs of Mansoura and Sheikh Othman at
a rate of one a minute in the evening after a brief afternoon lull.
Residents said that, for the first time since the war began on May 4, almost
all Aden's residential areas were being bombarded by northern forces, which
are trying to crush the south's bid to secede from a united Yemeni state.
Aden's population was estimated at 350,000 before civil war broke out. It
has grown to over 400,000 as refugees fled into the city.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Taiwan to hold talks with China
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan has agreed to hold working-level talks with China next month in an
effort to 'promote cross-strait dialogue and rapprochement,' a senior
Taiwanese official said yesterday.
Mr Kao Koong-lien, vice-chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, also
indicated Taipei's willingness to resume high-level meetings with Beijing,
but the timing and agenda remain unclear.
The move signalled a thaw in recent tensions sparked by the killings of
Taiwanese tourists in China's Zhejiang Province in late March. Ties plunged
to a seven-year nadir after the robbery-murder-arson attack on 24 tourists
aboard a pleasure boat on Qiandao Lake near the city of Hangzhou.
The two sides will discuss repatriation of illegal Chinese immigrants and
airline hijackers, fishing disputes and safety of Taiwanese travelling in
the mainland.
This would be the fifth round of administrative talks since the second half
of last year. Previous rounds have degenerated into squabbles over
sovereignty issues.

Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, yesterday stepped up the White
House campaign to steer the world trade pact through Congress, stating that
all 50 US states would be winners under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, Reuter reports from Washington.
In a co-ordinated campaign, the treasury department released its own
pro-Gatt study, repackaging the trade pact as nothing less than a tax cut.
'The reduction in trade barriers resulting from the Uruguay Round will lead
to the expansion of trade and increased market opportunities abroad for
every US state,' Mr Brown said.
The commerce department, the voice for business in the administration,
released 50 reports breaking down the US export picture both state by state
and sector by sector.
The Gatt agreement is due to come into force next year, providing Congress
signs on. 'It would be worse than an embarrassment in having completed
successful efforts to break the gridlock ..and not be one of the first
countries to ratify it,' Mr Brown said. 'We're committed to achieving that
goal this year.'
Seeking to prevent delays, the White House has stepped up its lobbying
campaign, painting the treaty as part and parcel of President Clinton's job
creation programme.
'All states, localities and US industry is demonstrably helped by expanding
market opportunities abroad,' Mr Brown said, adding that exports have risen
dramatically over the past seven years, and forecasting that the trend would
accelerate as more commercial barriers crumble.
'Nearly two-thirds of the 50 states, 32 in all, increased export sales of
merchandise by Dollars 1bn or more (in the seven-year period). Clearly Gatt
is a major economic plan for long-term US economic growth and stability,'
said Mr Brown.
Ordinary Americans too should feel the benefits, according to the treasury
analysis. As of last year, 39 states now export more than Dollars 1bn worth
of merchandise a year, he said.
The biggest percentage gains in raised exports are being achieved by states
such as Nebraska, South Dakota, Vermont and New Mexico. However the biggest
gains in dollar terms are still the largest exporters, California, Texas,
Washington state, New York, Ohio and Illinois.

FT  24 JUN 94 / State sell-offs boost for Latin American economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin American government privatisation of state enterprise and moves to
lower import barriers and deregulate business have had an immediate benefit
on productivity in the region, according to a study published today.
The assessment of Latin American productivity by the management consultancy
McKinsey, found that privatisation, in particular, had provided a striking
example of the potential for productivity improvements.
It argues that the efficiency improvements seen to date in Latin America
suggested that multinational companies 'should look at Latin America as a
growing region where their knowhow can be transferred in a profitable way'.
The wave of acquisitions of local companies by foreign multinationals
'points precisely in this direction', the report said.
Productivity improvements were significant in two of the four industries it
studied: telecommunications and steel. In the most marked improvement, the
productivity of telephone workers in Argentina doubled from 1989 to 1993  -
to 66 per cent of US levels.
However, the report also concluded that in three of the four industries,
labour productivity was very low. This was in part the fault of inefficient
management, described as a 'bottleneck' in the process of achieving
productivity gains. Management was often overly hierarchical, reflecting a
bureaucratic rather than a managerial approach.
'In steel, productivity averaged 37 per cent of the US level, 31 per cent in
the food processing industry and 29 per cent in the retail banking
industry,' it said.
It noted particularly poor performance in the Argentine banking industry  -
at 19 per cent of the US level  - and in the Colombian steel industry at
only 15 per cent.
In general, state-owned industries were significantly less productive than
their privatised counterparts.
'State-owned banks in Brazil pay their employees almost three times the
private sector levels, but their employees are only half as productive as
private sector banking employees.
'The Dollars 10bn difference in wages is equivalent to the amount the
country pays as interest on its foreign debt,' the report said.
There was one exception: Colombia's state-run telephone company, where
workers were as productive as those in the US.

FT  24 JUN 94 / EU leaders pressed to pick Delors successor: Germany will
call another summit next month if deadlock remains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
European Union leaders were under pressure last night to settle at their
Greek summit the divisive issue of who should replace Mr Jacques Delors as
European Commission president.
The 12 heads of government arrived in Corfu last night for the two-day
summit, where chances of breaking the deadlock are generally believed to be,
at best, even.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, appeared to retain a clear
lead over his main rival, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime
minister. But the UK and Italy have still not signalled an intention to back
either of them.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned on Wednesday that the German EU presidency
would call another summit next month if the 12 failed to agree on a
successor to Mr Delors during their time in Corfu.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, tried to be positive by
suggesting that 'we'll do everything we can' to reach agreement: 'I want to
be optimistic. I think we will succeed.'
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, formally backs Sir Leon Brittan,
the EU trade commissioner, as an outside contender, but the UK prefers Mr
Lubbers to Mr Dehaene, who is being promoted by France and Germany.
On arriving, Mr Major said: 'It is important to get the right result.
Whether that will be here or not I'm not sure.' He refused to comment on Mr
Dehaene's candidacy.
In the UK yesterday, Ladbrokes, the bookmaker, was quoting Mr Dehaene as 1-3
(on) favourite and Mr Lubbers at 7-2. Mr Brittan was trailing on 7-1 and Mr
Peter Sutherland, outgoing head of the Gatt world trade organisation, was
quoted at 8-1.
The Belgian and Dutch leaders, both Christian Democrats, agreed at a meeting
of EU Christian Democrat parties in Brussels on Wednesday that neither would
veto the other. Both are expected to leave a dinner tonight when their
colleagues try to break the deadlock.
The Netherlands intends to push hard its claim to the top Brussels job,
according to Dutch officials, on the grounds that it is the only
founder-member of the Euro-club not to have held the Commission presidency.
It will also be argued that the Netherlands will shortly become the largest
net contributor to the EU budget on a per capita basis.
The Dutch may also seek to exploit fears that France and Germany, the
driving axis of the EU, are overstretching their power in trying to impose
Mr Dehaene.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian premier, is yet to indicate his
preference. He is looking to bargain for a settlement of a long-running row
over Italy's flouting of EU limits on milk production, and has threatened to
delay the EU budget increase planned for next year unless he is satisfied.
Mr Delors told journalists he was pessimistic about a deal on his successor.
The powerful Commission president may himself become a focus of controversy.
Mr Kohl wants him to head the group of experts the Corfu summit is expected
to set up to pave the way for the 1996 review of the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Delors is understood to be weighing the possibility against his prospects
of running as a Socialist candidate for the French presidency next year.
After this spring's voting rights dispute between the UK and its partners,
the 1996 review is expected to be as stormy as the talks leading up to
Maastricht.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (13): Fleet renewal may need foreign
capital - Domestic taxation is causing distress signals among shipowners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norway is one of the few nations that can boast a long maritime tradition,
but the industry is undergoing the kind of restructuring not experienced
since the 1970s.
Maritime activities account for 15 per cent of gross exports, making
shipping the country's third biggest export industry, and employs 61,000
people. The maritime environment consists of everything from shipowners to
brokers, shipyards, ship classification, maritime research, design and
engineering, specialised law firms and banks geared towards ship-financing.
The country's insurers and underwriters form the second biggest marine
insurance markets in the world, after London.
Last year gross freight revenue for the Norwegian-controlled merchant fleet,
the fourth largest in the world, rose to an estimated NKr45bn from NKr42bn
in 1992, after hitting NKr50bn in 1991.
Even the shipping sub-index on the Oslo bourse is recognised as one of the
most comprehensive shipping lists in the world, consisting of 38 foreign and
domestic shipping companies with a combined market capitalisation of around
NKr35bn.
After a period of difficult market conditions, the shipowners are cautiously
optimistic about prospects for 1994. According to RS Platou Shipbrokers
there was an improvement in tonnage balance in 1993 - despite
disappointingly weak growth of OECD countries - thanks to strong economic
expansion in China and massive oil stock building.
'Without these two components, tonnage balance would most likely have
deteriorated with falling freight rates and ship values as the consequence.
Instead, there was a moderate increase in freight rates,' according to
Platou.
Platou says that, given the uncertainties of economic development, the
over-dimensioned shipbuilding industry and a life span of the fleet built in
the 1970s that is constantly being extended, the potential for the dynamics
on the supply side of shipping are enormous.
'This environment generates a more unpredictable and more exciting market
structure than perhaps ever before,' the Olso-based shipbroker believes.
Given the uncertainty over markets and increased competitive nature of the
industry, Norway's shipowners argue that the domestic tax regime is forcing
them to resort to flags of convenience and is inhibiting renewal of the
fleet.
The shipowners that stay in Norway are forced to seek foreign capital,
causing the ownership structure of the shipping firms to change dramatically
as the internationalisation process picks up momentum.
If this development continues, Norway's maritime environment may be in
danger of becoming a historical reference if shipowners follow through on
threats to relocate elsewhere in the world in the pursuit of taxation
regimes which do not undermine competitiveness.
Seven years ago, Norway's shipping industry experienced a major revival with
the establishment of the Norwegian International Ship register (NIS) which
worked as an explosive catalyst for attracting Norwegian ships back to a
Norwegian flag.
According Mr Ole Jacob Libaek, chairman of Oslo shipbroker O-J Libaek &amp;
Partners: 'It was the first positive signal ever for Norwegian shipping of
acceptance by Norwegian society and politicians.'
The primary reason for the establishment of NIS was to stop the flood of
Norwegian owners to the flag-of-convenience or 'open registers' such as
Bermuda and Panama by offering broadly similar savings on crew costs.
Just before NIS was established, the fleet sailing under the Norwegian flag
had dwindled to around 9m deadweight tonnes (dwt). The NIS register peaked
three years ago when it became the register of choice for 917 ships
comprising 40.6m (dwt). By this year, the NIS fleet had, however, been
reduced to 790 ships of 33.3m dwt.
Mr Libaek believes that the success of NIS, in spite of uninspiring global
market conditions, led to the 1992 tax reform, the timing of which could not
have been worse because it coincided with a new global recession.
Under the previous tax regime, shipowners had up to eight years to reinvest
profits. Almost overnight taxes for investors buying second-hand tonnage
became payable 'up front'.
Needless to say, the second-hand market all but disappeared, shutting off an
important source of risk capital needed by shipowners. Consequently,
according to Mr Libaek, only a doubling or tripling of ship values could
rescue Norwegian shipping.
The market never improved to the extent that this was to happen, and the new
tax law therefore led to a new depletion of the Norwegian fleet with sales
abroad - mostly to the Greeks - becoming the order of the day.
The Norwegian Shipowners Association (NSA) estimates domestic shipowners
need to raise between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 30bn over the next decade to
maintain their 10 per cent share of the world fleet and to finance fleet
renewal. By comparison, the current market value of the Norwegian owned
fleet is about Dollars 17bn.
Mr Rolf Westfal-Larsen, a former NSA president, estimates Norwegian
shipowners must earn at least 25 per cent more than their competitors in
order to accumulate the capital needed to renew the fleet.
The average age of the Norwegian owned fleet is around 13 years - younger
than the world average - but there is nevertheless the need for renewal.
'Norway's shipping industry is in a period of transition. Although a number
of shipowners are optimistic about the future, a question nevertheless
remains over where activities will be conducted in future. This is a result
of Norway's corporate tax structure and the pressures of globalisation. The
taxation issue probably would not have become so important an issue were it
not for the need to renew the fleet,' said Mr Rolf Saether, managing
director of the NSA.
Mr Saether believes the 'right' corporation tax could lead to a new revival
of the industry. 'What we need is the possibility to reinvest profits in new
tonnage without being penalised by taxes. This would help the industry
enormously and this change is needed urgently. Norway's 28 per cent
corporate tax is still far above that of our competitors,' he argues.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (14): On the fast track from Lillehammer -
The Winter Olympics may have opened a door for upmarket tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norway has launched an ambitious campaign to encourage tourism, in the hope
of capitalising on the success of the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer earlier
this year. The target is the the big spender.
For 16 days in February, spectacular images of the country's unspoilt nature
appeared on television screens throughout the world. During the games no
fewer than 10,000 articles appeared in US newspapers alone.
No wonder superlatives abound to describe the country's natural beauty, from
the midnight sun in summer to the craggy snow-capped peaks in winter; and it
helped that, during the Olympics, the sun shone every day, melting heart of
almost anyone tuned in to Lillehammer.
Norway believes the country is just the place for people who want to get
back to nature and experience the good, clean, simple life. It certainly is
not a destination for the finicky tourist, who expects the level of service
and luxury found throughout continental Europe; and it is definitely not for
those with a meagre budget.
In 1993, more than 3m foreign tourists spent an estimated NKr16bn in Norway,
or some NKr1bn less than the revenue generated by fish exports.
If Norwegian tourists are taken into account, the spending spree reached
NKr55bn, according to the tourist board (Nortra). It calculates that, if
growth in tourism runs at an annual 6 to 7 per cent, by the year 2000
foreign tourists will contribute NKr23bn annually to the economy.
This year Nortra expects income from tourism to expand by 10 per cent, and
forecasts that no fewer than 4.5m visitors will head for Norway, more than
half of them this summer, and up to 80 per cent of them purely for leisure.
With tourism one of the country's fastest growing industries, many
Norwegians fear that an influx of holidaymakers could harm the environment.
But the foreign ministry's carefully targeted promotional campaign should
calm anxiety that droves of shallow-pocketed travellers will descend on
Norway's rugged mountains, craggy cliffs and myriad fjords.
According to a senior ministry official, the typical tourist visiting Norway
is seeking a 'special' holiday filled with culture, nature and culinary
delights (the country's rich seafood tradition offers everything from arctic
cod to salmon, as well as a wide range of whale dishes).
This tourist is at least 45 years old, travels without children and does not
mind packing wellingtons and rain gear. He or she would not normally
complain about prices, and is likely to be a mid-level executive and a
culture enthusiast.
'This is exactly the group we are targeting,' explained the ministry
spokesman. 'We have no plans to expand our marketing efforts to attract
youth, the masses or others outside this group, because our product could be
destroyed.
'We are not looking for the big numbers, but the big spenders. It's more
interesting for us to attract, say, a German executive who returns to Norway
year after year.'
According to a survey undertaken ahead of the games, the impact of the
Lillehammer Olympics alone - the so-called 'OL effect' - could increase
tourism by an estimated 5 per cent this year.
The foreign ministry began to devise its strategy for capitalising interest
in Norway long before the games ended, and it aims this year to undertake
substantial media campaigns in the US, Germany, the UK and other European
countries.
Last autumn, together with the Norwegian Soccer Association, it embarked on
a promotional campaign that is culminating during the current World Cup,
where a wide cross-section of foreigners has gathered. Plans include a
video-taped Norwegian current affairs programme for television, business
seminars, cultural events and presentations of Norwegian food.
There is also a three-year agenda of high-profile cultural events in the US
and Spain next year, and in Japan in 1997. These include a Norwegian film
festival, in co-operation with the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and
concerts by the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra and Trondheim Soloists.
Norway not only sees an opportunity to boost tourism by exploiting the image
conveyed to the world during the games, it also believes that business and
industry can benefit from the global exposure of the country's involvement
in other recent important events - for example, its role as mediator in the
historic peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
'There is a link between extensive media coverage and the export of
Norwegian goods and services,' said Mr Jan Egeland, state secretary of the
foreign ministry, who was directly involved in the peace negotiations.
In the three years before the Winter Olympics, tourism rose by 30 per cent,
helped by a surge in interest from Britain, Germany, Holland, and the US.
Yet, for all the efforts in marketing Norway abroad, there is work to be
done at home to remove awkward idiosyncrasies that can frustrate and
disappoint visitors. Nortra admits that there is some way to go in improving
the service-mindedness of Norwegians, to encourage them not to close shops
during holidays and weekends and other peak traffic periods, although
progress has been made in recent years.
Nortra disputes claims that Norwegian prices are on the whole far higher
than elsewhere in Europe, particularly when it comes to accommodation. It
urges visitors, for example, to negotiate prices for hotel rooms,
particularly in Oslo where capacity is normally abundant.
But tourists may be shocked to find that the cost of a half-litre of beer in
a pub can be more than NKr40 (Pounds 3.70) and that for a modest dinner for
two, including a bottle of table wine, they will have to pay at least
NKr700. A large pizza alone can cost up to NKr250.
Prices like these make extended stays for families almost prohibitive; and
many activities, such as concerts, cruises and mountain hiking, are geared
more towards adults than children.
One of the fastest growing segments of the domestic tourist industry is that
of the recreational vehicle traveller. But Norway acknowledges it is little
equipped to accommodate such vehicles; few RV parks exist, and there are few
chemical and waste receptacles for dumping effluent generated by RVs.
Nortra forecasts that between 60,000 and 100,000 RVs will motor around the
country this year, representing a 20 per cent increase over 1993. There are
about 970 inspected and classified camping sites, some of which offer
hook-up facilities for electricity, showers and toilets.
Camping fees range between Dollars 10 to Dollars 22 a night, while cabins
can be rented for Dollars 29 to Dollars 90 a night.
Not unexpectedly, Norwegian travel brochures make little mention of RV
facilities, but focus primarily on sightseeing by rail, boat, bus or car.
But if you drive, expect to pay the highest petrol prices in Europe, running
at about NKr7.50 a litre.

Mr Hartarto was promoted to be Indonesia's co-ordinating minister for trade
and industry last year after serving as minister of industry for two
consecutive terms.
He explains the government's policy on deregulation of the economy.
Question: The government is working on a trade deregulation package to
complement its hosting of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec)
conference later this year. Could you give any hints as to what might be
expected in this package?
Answer: The deregulation package is actually linked with a trend in the
world for globalisation.
It is a basic need to further deregulate the economy. As you know, we are
always implementing prudent macro-economic management. That is very
important, and then to enable our economic growth we emphasise investment
and exports.
On investment we have recently issued new regulations which will hopefully
boost foreign investment and this is also linked to the restructuring of the
economies of certain countries in this region such as Japan, Korea, Hong
Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia. We have to compete globally.
The latest deregulation package is not enough. We must also deregulate
export and import procedures and then deregulate tariffs. This will also be
announced very soon because we have to comply with Asean's (Association of
South East Asian Nations) free trade requirements and also Gatt (General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) requirements. Unilaterally, we will reduce
our tariffs, probably in the near future. The final tariffs will be between
0 and 5 per cent. And then we also will remove, hopefully, all the
non-tariff barriers.
Q: How much of a threat are the economies of Vietnam, China and India to
Indonesia?
A: We should not think about threats. What we have to do is deregulate the
economy and I do believe that investors take note of the experience of
Indonesia in the past 25 years during which we have been able to maintain
6.6 per cent growth on average every year. So this is actually a trust which
we can use to attract more investment.
Q: The petrochemical, aircraft manufacturing and agricultural sectors remain
highly regulated. Do you foresee any changes in these sectors?
A: Certain areas of agriculture are still protected but we have to follow
the rules. They cover six commodities, such as rice, soyabeans, cloves,
white onions. But we have to change.
Q: Many sectors of the economy are dominated by well-connected businessmen.
Do you think that deregulating them could evolve into a big political
battle?
A: No. We have to deregulate every sector, reducing tariffs.
Q: The government recently announced some drastic changes to restrictions on
foreign investment in Indonesia, but opening up the media sector to
foreigners was not well-received. Did you expect such a reaction?
A: Well, from the beginning the media sector was not opened. Explanation was
rather late and that created the reaction. When the team explained about the
latest deregulation package they did not explain fully that media was not
included.
Q: Foreign investors here complain that while the government is committed to
deregulation, they often have to fight with a bureaucracy that does not have
the same intentions as ministers. How will you tackle this problem?
A: The next deregulation package will follow this up. Hopefully it will be
issued very soon. They are now working on that. It will deal with new
investment, foreign investment, domestic investment, export and import
procedures.
Q: When can that package be expected?
A: Within this month or next.
Q: There appears to be a real urgency about it.
A: Yes, it is urgent. It is for our own sake.
Q: What sparked off this urgency?
A: The fact that we had problems with our domestic banking system. The
requirements for capital investment for the next six years are so huge and
we have to maintain growth of 6.5 per cent. So we have to do this.
Q: How important do you think high technology industries such as aircraft
manufacturing and ship building are to Indonesia's economic development?
A: This is of strategic value and so we maintain we have to develop these
sectors also. But as far as ship-building is concerned, it is not only
relying on the state but also on the private sector. We are not only
exporting textiles and shoes, we are also exporting capital goods, something
that is not well-known. We are exporting paper plants to Iran and Iraq,
turnkey plants to Northern Ireland and France, chemical plants to China. We
have the engineers to do that. We are exporting ships, which cost Dollars
55m each, to Sweden. We are also exporting helicopters.
Q: There has been much talk and controversy surrounding the development of a
nuclear power industry in Indonesia. How likely do you think it is that
Indonesia will build a nuclear power reactor?
A: Our power requirements for the next six years are the same as required
during the past 25 years. So it means that power requirements need to be
developed and relying on thermal power only is not sufficient. We have to go
nuclear one day. There is no doubt about it.
Q: What role will foreign capital play in domestic power generation?
A: Mostly we will rely on foreign investment. Once we agree on the transfer
price on the power entering our national grid system I think it will be
clear enough.
Q: Indonesia has embarked on a policy to privatise many of its state-owned
industries, and privatisation of the telecommunications industry is already
under way. What is the next step in this process and what other sectors will
be included?
A: Sectors which have good prospects. Those sectors which have good returns
and reliable returns. State-owned companies are among the biggest taxpayers
in this country.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (14): Diplomatic row highlights
sensitivity to criticism - Manuela Saragosa reviews foreign policy in the
context of the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A diplomatic row between the Philippines and Indonesia earlier this month
highlighted once again Indonesia's sensitivity to criticism from abroad
about human rights abuses in East Timor - but also hinted at the fragility
of political unity within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(Asean).
Relations between Indonesia and the Philippines became decidedly
uncomfortable in May. The question of East Timor, always a thorn in the
flesh of Indonesia's foreign policy, was at the centre of a diplomatic spat
between the two countries which are usually content to march under Asean's
banner of solidarity.
It started when the University of the Philippines, based in Manila, agreed
to host the Asia Pacific Conference on East Timor. In the argument which
followed, an angry Mr Ali Alatas, the Indonesian minister for foreign
affairs, threatened to break off diplomatic relations with the Philippines
if the Filipino government did not ban the conference.
A diplomatic envoy sent expressly from the Philippines did his best to
explain that his government had no constitutional power to prevent the
conference from taking place because it was organised by non-governmental
organisations. Asked if the incident could damage relations between the two
countries, Mr Alatas responded: 'It could be a possibility.'
The conference went ahead anyway, but Indonesia's lamentations were not
completely without effect. The Filipino government tried to bar foreign
academics and human rights campaigners attending the conference from
entering the country; in a number of cases it was successful.
'The whole affair was very embarrassing,' a Jakarta-based diplomat says. It
was embarrassing for the Philippines, which felt obliged to succumb to
Indonesian pressure, and it was embarrassing for Indonesia because of the
criticism which followed.
The Philippines and Indonesia accused one another of interfering in each
other's domestic affairs. ( The pillars of Asean rest on promises by its
member states - Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and the
Philippines - not to meddle in each others' politics.)
The problem, as one Asean official sees it, is the 'differing levels of
tolerance for political openness within Asean member states.' In Indonesia
people do not have the right to assemble freely - government approval is
needed for gatherings attended by five or more people - but the Philippines
is a struggling democracy where freedom of assembly is guaranteed by the
country's constitution.
The manner in which Indonesia handled the incident was in direct contrast to
its usual policy of keeping a low profile - and in contrast, too, to its
highly applauded efforts in attempting to negotiate a settlement in the
Cambodia conflict. As the row over the conference unfolded, Indonesia was
accused of bullying a friendly neighbour. More to the point, the incident
also demonstrated the lengths to which Indonesia will go to defend its
stance on policy towards the former Portuguese colony.
The irony is that the noisy protests made by the Indonesian government gave
the conference worldwide publicity and brought East Timor back into the
headlines. Besides, it clashed with Indonesia's earlier policy of
guaranteeing more openness about the East Timor issue, in what it hoped
would 'promote understanding of the problems in the region.'
Earlier this year, foreign journalists were invited on a
government-sponsored tour of the region. The aim was to demonstrate how much
money had been spent by the Indonesian government in improving East Timor's
infrastructure and building schools and hospitals.
As Mr Irawan Abidin, director of information at the ministry for foreign
affairs, put it: 'Indonesia's sincere intent to give substance to the
freedom won by the people of East Timor is reflected in its continuous
efforts to accelerate the social, economic and political development of East
Timor.'
However, the film footage of the Dili massacre of November 1991, which
showed the military shooting into a crowd of unarmed independence
demonstrators, is still fresh in many people's minds. What the Indonesian
government does not appear to have anticipated, in its objections to the
Manila conference, was the bad publicity it would earn. Indonesian
newspapers bewailed the fact that attempts to stop the conference helped
develop it into a media blitz which portrayed Indonesia as the 'bad guy'
member of Asean.
One speaker invited to attend the conference, Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, the
wife of French President Francois Mitterrand, accused the Indonesian
government of exercising 'tyrannical pressure' on her not to attend. Critics
say that Indonesia's outrage at the holding of the conference only lent
credence to human rights activists' accusations that the Indonesian
government is tyrannical and authoritarian.
That is exactly the kind of reputation the government is trying to shed now
that it is becoming more tolerant of public debate. There is growing
irritation in government that the only time Indonesia makes the headlines
abroad is on matters relating to East Timor.
Meanwhile, Asean officials are anxious to point out that this kind of
dispute between member states is not unusual. In the past, for example,
there have been territorial disputes between Thailand and Malaysia which
have eventually been resolved. 'It is not unusual to see something like this
happening in Asean,' says an official. 'But it is certainly not the end of
Asean.'
Officials say that Asean, which was set up in 1967 to provide a forum for
economic co-operation, could not afford to break up over an argument between
two member states, even if their policies differ significantly. In an
increasingly competitive economic environment, 'Asean realises that it has
to stick together,' the official says.
The diplomatic row between Indonesia and the Philippines may have been
intense, but it was very short-lived. By mid-June, two weeks after the end
of the East Timor conference, President Suharto assured a Filipino senator
that he supported 'traditional relations of friendship' and senior officials
in Manila were quoted as saying that relations between the two countries
were back to normal.
But it remains to be seen how Indonesia will react if further conferences on
East Timor take place in the south east Asian region. Mr Murdiono, the
Indonesian state secretary, said that a representative of the Filipino
government promised there would be no more conferences on the subject, but
senators in the Philippines claim to be unaware of this promise.
Indonesia's handling of the East Timor conference may have been a veiled
warning to neighbouring countries to steer clear of sensitive issues in the
country. In the meantime, critics say that the affair has done little to
improve the government's reputation.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (11): Not much left on the shelf - Energy,
the oil's running low, turn up the gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The era of Norwegian 'elephant' size oil discoveries, as they are known in
the industry, is over. While it is too early to write the country's obituary
as an oil producer, there is little geological evidence that current levels
of oil production can be sustained beyond the decade.
Currently western Europe's biggest oil producer, with daily output of more
than 2.4m barrels, Norway's ranking would have fallen behind Britain this
year had the government not opened the oil taps full-bore, to compensate for
a loss in revenue caused by weak oil prices and a weaker dollar.
According to forecasts by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based energy
consultant, crude oil production will hit 2.67m barrels a day this year and
rise to 2.82m b/d in 1995, before peaking at a daily rate of 2.85m barrels
in 1996.
In 1993, the state's net petroleum revenue comprised slightly less than 10
per cent of total revenue, while petroleum exports accounted for one third
of total exports, and related investments represented one third of total
Norwegian investment. Petroleum also represented 15 per cent of GNP.
Total capital expenditure in the offshore petroleum sector last year peaked
at a record estimated NKr60bn, 7.5 per cent of GDP, and may have added
substantially to mainland GDP, because oil equipment goods - production
platforms in particular - are, for a large part, manufactured by land-based
industry.
But there is no immediate prospect of any new, significant oil discoveries
being made on the Norwegian continental shelf. The last big discovery -
Norne, made in 1986 - is expected to yield peak annual production of around
15m barrels of oil a year, just 12 per cent of that of the giant Statfjord
field, discovered 20 years ago, at the dawn of Norway's oil age.
The size of new discoveries is expected to diminish to an average 20m tonnes
of oil equivalent, compared with 90m tonnes for fields now producing, and
40m tonnes for those currently being developed.
Earlier this year, the government proposed a comprehensive overhaul of
energy policy, and more recently scrapped immediate plans to sharpen
petroleum taxes - both moves in a desperate attempt to stimulate petroleum
activities to stem the awaited steep decline in oil output.
In a white paper presented in March, the government called for exploration
acreage to be expanded by 16 per cent, and for reform of rules for exploring
in the Barents Sea, to make it more attractive. It also intends to speed up
the process for approving oil discoveries for development, and a number of
proposals have been made to streamline licensing rules and management of the
state's oil and gas resources.
Norway has little choice but to stimulate oil activity; not only is output
set to decline dramatically, but stiff competition has emerged from oil
regions elsewhere in the world vying for investment.
For the first time in many years, foreign oil companies operating in Norway
are having to fight for funds from headquarters to maintain investment.
Several are even undertaking substantial streamlining operations, in which
staff levels are being cut sharply.
Earlier this year, the French oil company Total announced a strategic
reorientation in which it closed its office in Stavanger, Norway's oil
capital, retrenched to Oslo, cut staff from 150 to 100 - all to achieve
annual cost savings of more than NKr20m.
Total has also warned that interest in Norway's next licensing round, for
which new acreage will be put on offer next year, will be kept at a minimum
unless the country's draconian tax regime is realigned to reflect the
reality of current oil prices.
In Norway's 14th licensing round last year, both Esso and Shell refused to
apply for high-risk acreage, and subsequently withdrew from bidding in
protest against stringent operating conditions.
Mobil recently announced that it would complete a reorganisation of its
drilling department in August, after finishing its last well as operator.
'With no wells to drill, we cannot justify keeping together a drilling group
sized as we are to drill wells and accomplish the myriad of other activities
associated with being an active operator,' drilling manager Iain Montgomery
told staff.
Elf Aquitaine this month revealed plans for a dramatic reduction in staff in
Stavanger, and numerous other oil companies are reluctant to embark on new
development projects while oil prices remain weak and petroleum taxes high.
Investment in the petroleum sector is expected to fall by 8 per cent this
year, and will decline dramatically within the next two years unless oil
companies commit to new projects.
Last year, Norway boosted recoverable petroleum reserves by 259m tonnes of
oil equivalent to 5.89bn tonnes, but the increase was due to adjustments to
reserves of producing fields and discoveries not yet developed, rather than
to exploration success.
Out of a total of 18 wildcat explortion wells drilled in 1993, just three
small discoveries were made, yielding only 9m tonnes. Optimists, however,
point out that 60 per cent of the continental shelf has yet to be opened for
exploration.
What is certain is the success which Norway is achieving in the transition
to becoming an important gas-producing nation. Its share of the western
European gas market will soon reach 15 per cent.
'While our oil production will probably reach its zenith in the near future,
the large investments in gas-field development will lead to a substantial
increase in Norway's gas production from 1995 to the year 2000,' says Mrs
Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister.
Gas production is expected to reach as much as 70bn cubic metres by the turn
of the century, while gas sales contracts already amount to more than 50bn
cubic metres annually.
More than half of western Europe's proven gas resources are found on
Norway's continental shelf.
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, believes that, while the 20th
century was the age of oil, the 21st is set to become the gas era,
particularly as concern for the environment becomes the driving force behind
the growth of gas consumption.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (12): State giant is obliged to explore
overseas - Profile / Statoil, whose future has been assessed by a leading
investment bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Last month, two independent government-commissioned valuations assessed the
value of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, at between NKr72bn and
NKr80bn.
The purpose of the appraisal - the first ever, but now planned to be
undertaken on an annual basis - was to help the government in its assessment
of the value and relative performance of Statoil within its industry; but it
also makes a good reference tool for eventual privatisation of the group.
The highly sensitive issue of privatisation is not currently on the
government's political agenda, and is not likely to emerge until Norway can
no longer provide sufficient petroleum reserves to underpin Statoil's
production or continue to supplement the group's reserves' base.
Goldman Sachs International (GSI), the US investment bank, assessed
Statoil's worth at between NKr72bn and NKr78bn; while Fiba Nordic
Securities, a domestic firm, valued the group at NKr80bn, or 17 times
expected 1995 earnings of NKr17.6bn and three times book value.
Statoil was established in 1972 as a vehicle to participate in exploration
and development on the Norwegian continental shelf, and began basically as a
two-man show and a telephone, managed by Mr Arve Johnsen until 1988. It
expanded rapidly into downstream operations with Mr Johnsen at the helm, and
by 1984 began managing the state's direct financial investment in petroleum
operations.
Mr Harald Norvik succeeded Mr Johnsen in 1988, and currently oversees 12,000
employees within and outside Norway. He is faced with the daunting task of
finding more oil elsewhere in the world to maintain the group's output and
reserves; and, to this end, he established an alliance partnership with
British Petroleum nearly five years ago, to help shoulder the burden of
expense related to foreign operations.
Statoil currently consists of four principal operating units: exploration
and production, natural gas, refining and marketing, and petrochemicals. GSI
ranks Statoil as the seventh largest independent oil company in the world.
Last year, its total production reached 204m barrels of oil equivalent, or
560,000 boe per day. By the end of 1993 reserves stood at 3.87bn boe, giving
a reserve life of 19 years.
In order to improve its declining oil production profile, Statoil has
embarked on an ambitious international exploration search.
'Recent successes in the Far East, combined with the enormous growth
potential of the former Soviet Union, make this new business development a
potentially high-growth, though high-risk, area,' GSI said.
Since 1991, Statoil has revised its proved reserves upwards by about 191m
boe, or 33 per cent of total production, but GSI believes there is
significant upside potential for the estimate.
The US bank forecast that Statoil's total production would fall from 221m
boe this year to 178m, or by some 20 per cent, by the year 2000, with the
outlook for oil even more dramatic, in line with the general prognosis for
Norway's production.
With the important fields of Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg in decline,
Statoil's oil production is expected to fall by 35 per cent to 124m barrels
by the year 2000.
'With no immediate prospect of significant discoveries on the Norwegian
continental shelf, and the relatively immature and uncertain nature of
Statoil's international exploration potential, it is unlikely that Statoil
will be able to change the trend in oil production in the near term,' GSI
said.
The US bank points out that the most significant discovery on the NCS since
1986 has been the Norne field, operated by Statoil, with peak production
from this field expected to be around 14.6m barrels a year - or 12 per cent
of the peak production from the giant Statfjord field.
'On the international side, only the Azeri and Chirag fields in Azerbaijan
offer the potential for significantly boosting Statoil's oil profile,' GSI
said, but warned that, given the unstable political environment in the
region, Azerbaijan should not be relied on to fill the gap.
At the same time, Statoil faces rising production costs, lower revenue
generated by pipeline tariffs and uncertainty over future gas contracts,
according to GSI.
Concern is expressed over Statoil's ability to formalise new gas sales
contracts, which currently amount to 3.0bn cubic metres annually and are
expected to more than triple by 2002.
However, the bank believes that by then Statoil may be competing with
cheaper supplies from other domestic producers or a more politically stable
Middle East.
'Should Statoil not be able to tie in sufficient supply contracts for its
gas, then some developments may well be delayed, which would further
negatively impact the company's overall declining production profile,' GSI
warned.
Nevertheless, Statoil benefits from a well-protected Scandinavian retail
market, in which it has captured a 25 per cent share, owns two modern
complex refineries and, by 1995, will be well-placed to reap rewards from a
forecast upswing in the European petrochemicals industry.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (9): Controversy persists over
conservation issues - David Lascelles looks at mining, natural gas and
forestry developments in the Indonesian part of Borneo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Kalimantan, as the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo is known, is a
huge wilderness, thinly populated and rich in resources.
The terrain extends from high mountain peaks, through lush rain forests to
the mangrove swamps and lazy rivers of the coast. Despite difficult working
conditions - torrential rain and few roads - the island has important
industrial projects, particularly in East Kalimantan where some of the
richest energy and forestry resources lie.
But development is controversial: it creates social and economic strains and
stirs up environmental concerns.
Sensitive to international criticism, the Indonesian government has been
arguing that development and conservation can go hand in hand in developing
the area's potential.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (12): 'We are deep in the rain forest' -
David Lascelles looks at mining, natural gas and forestry developments in
the Indonesian part of Borneo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All around us, trees draped in bright green foliage rear more than 100 feet
into the air. At our feet, the orange clay has been churned up by
bulldozers. Close by we hear the roar of a chain saw followed by the slow
crash of a falling tree.
We are deep in the Kalimantan rain forest, in one of the giant logging
concessions which supply the bulk of Indonesia's timber. This one, covering
a huge area of 470,000 hectares, belongs to the International Timber
Corporation of Indonesia (ITCI). We are here because ITCI is keen to rebut
accusations that it is ravaging the forests.
Suwardi Suwasa, who is in charge of forest rehabilitation, explains that the
concession has been divided up into 35 blocks, and only one may be logged
each year. Even then, an inventory has to be prepared and accounted for to
the authorities, and only trees measuring more than 50cm across may be
felled. This form of selective logging, which removes up to 10 trees per
hectare a year, is healthy for the forest, Suwasa explains, because it lets
in light and encourages regeneration.
He shows us a spot logged five years earlier. The 'pioneer' species which
recover first are already 20 feet high, creating an environment for the
slower growing, longer lasting species to return.
After felling, logs are loaded up to 10 at a time on to huge haulage trucks
and sent off to the saw mills where they are transformed into plywood,
boxes, furniture and even conservatories for English suburbia.
The ITCI operation looks impressive to visitors. But environmentalists say
it is not typical of logging operations on the island, where much felling is
done illegally, with the connivance of the authorities. It is certainly easy
to see the results of earlier rapacious logging along the coast where whole
tracts of land have been flattened, and now lie neglected. Another worry is
that Indonesia may increasingly turn to fast-growing eucalyptus to feed its
ambitious plans for a domestic paper industry. But the forestry industry is
beginning to hit back at these accusations. Mr Djamaludin Surjohadikusumo,
minister of forestry and a former forester, acknowledges that there are
'weaknesses in the chain of control,' but he emphasises that steps are being
taken to beef up enforcement - he points to the growing number of
concessions which are cancelled each year because the holders have failed to
heed the rules.
Apart from employing more foresters, he is encouraging the industry to set
up an eco-labelling system so that purchasers of Indonesian wood can know
that the timber came from properly managed forests. The scheme, which would
be independent of government, has the support of non-governmental
organisations.
'The industry needs a sustainable supply,' he says. 'Without it the industry
would commit suicide.' He estimates that illegal logging amounts to between
4m and 6m cubic meters a year, compared to official production of about 30m
cu m - 'but no one really knows'.
The forestry industry on Kalimantan also supports a local independent
research institute, Wanariset, which is funded by Tropenbos, the Dutch
foundation, and multilateral lending agencies such as the World Bank. Mr
Willie Smits, the Dutchman who runs it, says that the basic intentions of
the Indonesian forestry industry are 'good', but implementation of the rules
is a problem.
His institute is developing ways of managing the forests more economically
through botanical research and computerised management. He envisages a time
when anyone buying a product made of Indonesian timber could identify the
precise location of the tree which supplied it, and obtain an aerial
photograph showing whether the area had been regenerated.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (11): Natural gas on the equator - David
Lascelles looks at mining, natural gas and forestry developments in the
Indonesian part of Borneo

Bontang lies almost exactly on the equator. The air is hot and steamy, and a
warm breeze blows in from the sea. But ice several inches thick coats the
huge compressors where natural gas is being liquefied at temperatures below
 150 degrees centigrade.
Each year the giant Bontang plant produces 15m tonnes of liquefied natural
gas (LNG) from the surrounding gas fields and loads it on to special
container vessels for shipment to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Developed
nearly 20 years ago at a cost of some Dollars 3.5bn, it is now the largest
of its kind in the world - a big contributor to Indonesia's overseas
earnings.
Over that period, a complete town has sprung up along what was previously an
empty coastline, dotted with a few fishing villages. Still hard to reach by
land because of the poor roads and muddy rivers, Bontang is linked to the
outside world mainly by air and sea. Although the plant itself only employs
1700 people, it helps to support a community now estimated at close on
100,000 people. But out at sea, within sight of the plant, a small village
still perches on stilts: the home of the orang lau, or sea people who live
offshore.
In the past, Bontang has been overshadowed by Indonesia's other LNG plant at
Aceh in northern Sumatra which was developed more rapidly. But Bontang is
about to take the lead. As Aceh's output levels off towards the end of this
decade, Bontang's will continue to grow. Last November it opened its sixth
train, or production line, and it has plans to add a seventh by 1997 and an
eighth by the end of the decade, by which time capacity will be about 20m
tonnes.
Mr Subroto, the plant's manufacturing manager, says that the only constraint
on the scope for growth is the ability of the gas field contractors to
supply the gas fast enough. The market for the LNG is there: the fuel-hungry
electricity utilities of the Pacific rim are expected to double their
consumption by 2010, and there is space at the plant for the additional
trains.
Bontang is owned by Pertamina, the state oil and gas company. But it is
managed by PT Badak, a company jointly owned by Pertamina, a consortium
representing the Japanese customers who financed construction of the plant,
and two of the companies which supply the gas: Total of France, and Vico (a
joint venture between Lasmo of the UK and Union Texas Petroleum).
The gas comes from fields to the south of the plant, linked by a network of
pipes running through the forests and mangrove swamps, culminating at the
Badak processing plant just below the equator where the gas is made to the
right blend and pressure for transmission up to Bontang. The fields also
supply the Kaltim fertiliser plant just to the north of Bontang - again one
of the largest of its kind in the world. Badak marks the spot where the
first oil and gas was found in the area - by Roy Huffington of Texas
(Huffco) in 1971. Huffco's properties later became part of Vico, with Lasmo
acquiring its interest in 1991 when it bought Ultramar.
Since the Huffco finds, Total has been successful in discovering large new
offshore fields in the mouth of the Mahakam River, despite the difficult
operating conditions. The French company will shortly become the main
supplier to Bontang, contributing about three quarters of the gas needed to
fulfil new contracts currently under negotiation. 'Our gas reserves will
continue to improve,' predicts Mr Bernard Vitry, Total's representative in
Jakarta.
The total capacity of the fields supplying Bontang is about 33 trillion
cubic feet, of which Total has about half.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (13): Big decisions to be made - As the
oil surplus dwindles, David Lascelles considers energy needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Indonesia's oil surplus dwindles, the country faces increasingly large
questions about its energy future.
In some areas, Jakarta's policy is clear: the place vacated by oil is to be
filled by other energy sources, which Indonesia fortunately has in
abundance, notably liquid natural gas and coal. But in others, important
decisions have still to be clarified: how are the ambitious targets for
power generation to be achieved? And how is burgeoning demand for refined
products to be met?
Indonesia currently produces some 1.5m barrels of oil a day, of which it
exports about half. But although it has managed to maintain production at
this level for some years, there is little prospect of it being increased.
No major new finds await development, and all the most promising and
accessible areas have been well explored. Meanwhile, domestic fuel
consumption is increasing at the rate of about 5 per cent a year, raising
the possibility that some time early next century Indonesia will cease to
have any oil to spare.
Of the alternative energy sources, natural gas seems to have the brightest
prospects. Already a world leader in the export of liquefied natural gas,
Indonesia hopes to build on this position, but the pattern of production
will change.
Until now, the Aceh LNG project in northern Sumatra has been the spearhead.
Although Mobil has a new offshore field with 1.5tr cubic feet of gas still
to develop there, Aceh's output will begin to level off through the rest of
this decade. Meanwhile, Total has made substantial gas discoveries in East
Kalimantan which have opened the way for important expansion of the
20-year-old Bontang LNG plant there. A fresh round of contracts is being
negotiated with utility customers in Japan, on the basis of which two more
production lines will be added to Bontang bringing its capacity to 20m
tonnes a year. (see separate article on this page).
A question mark remains over the large gas field discovered by Exxon at
Natuna in the northern offshore region of the country. The new energy
minister, Ida Bagus Sudjana, halted negotiations last year, blaming the poor
economics of the project. The feeling among the Jakarta oil and gas
community is that its remoteness and the high carbon dioxide content of the
gas deposit have weakened its chances.
The outlook for coal is also good. Following the liberalisation of licensing
in the 1980s, several foreign companies have launched projects, mainly in
Kalimantan, including CRA, BP and BHP. This has led to a dramatic increase
in production and exports which has propelled Indonesia into the position of
the world's fourth largest exporter of steam coal. Production last year
reached 28.6m tonnes, with exports amounting to 19mt. The expectation is
that production this year will reach 33mt, with exports rising to 24mt.
Most of this coal is produced from efficient open cast mines where reserves
are large, warranting development plans extending several decades. In
Kalimantan the coal quality is also good, with low sulphur, ash and moisture
content.
The question is the extent to which Indonesia will deploy these resources of
gas and coal for its own domestic use.
The government has an ambitious electricity programme for which it is trying
to obtain private sector investment. The objective is not just capacity
expansion, but a reduction of the current heavy reliance on oil for power
generation. The 10 year plan aims to create some 15,000MW of new capacity,
most of it coal-fired, but some also using gas.
Dozens of foreign companies are chasing the business, and a number of
projects have been agreed involving concerns such as British Gas and Enron,
mainly drawing gas from small offshore fields in the Java Sea. But the big
decisions have still to be made. 'Everyone's trying to sniff out what's
happening,' says a western oil executive.
'The gas in Kalimantan and Aceh is for export,' says Mr Suyitno
Patmosukismo, director general of the oil and gas directorate. 'Other
concentrations will be developed for domestic use, for power generation.'
An important milestone was passed in January when PLN, the state power
company, struck its first electricity purchase contract with a private
sector generator, showing that agreement could be reached on prices. The
plant, the coal-fired Paiton plant in East Java, is a joint venture between
Mission Energy, GE, Mitsui and PT Batu Hitam Perkasa, an Indonesian concern.
A permanent debating point in the energy industry is the quality of
investment incentives for foreign companies. This has become more critical
now that Indonesia needs to stimulate a greater exploration and production
programme.
Last year, the government improved the profit share for companies operating
in the less mature areas of eastern Indonesia and the offshore provinces:
they will get 35 per cent rather than 20 per cent. But other changes reduced
some of this benefit, leaving oil industry executives less than
enthusiastic. A big sticking point is the government's refusal to
consolidate taxation so that expenses incurred in one contract can be used
to offset profits in another.
Mr Suyitno says: 'There is a dialogue with the companies and we try to
consider their concerns. But in the oil and gas area we do not need any more
action to open our door wider.'
Another potential difficulty is abandonment costs. Early contracts between
Pertamina, the state oil company, and foreign contractors, omitted to
specify who was responsible for removing equipment when production was
finished. Foreign oil companies have taken the line that since Pertamina
owns all oil industry assets, it should logically pay. Pertamina is now
specifying in new contracts that foreign companies are responsible for these
costs, but the question of who pays in old contracts - where millions of
dollars are at stake - remains unresolved.
'According to our law and the law of the sea which Indonesia has agreed to,
we have to remove it,' says Mr Suyitno. 'But the cost must be borne by the
companies. We are discussing it with them.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (10): Sangatta coal is of high quality -
David Lascelles looks at mining, natural gas and forestry developments in
the Indonesian part of Borneo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'That's the Sangatta seam we're chasing' says John Arkeveld, pointing at a
thick black line in the hillside. We were standing on a muddy hilltop
overlooking a huge man-made hole. All around us, dump trucks growled their
way about, heaving out huge loads of glistening black coal.
Sangatta is one of the largest open-cast coal mines in the world. Set 13km
inland from Kalimantan's east coast, the three-year-old operation is already
producing some 10m tonnes a year, and is aiming to go up to 12m. Last month
the mine set a world record by loading just under 200,000t of coal on to a
single cargo ship.
The existence of coal in East Kalimantan has been known for some time. But
Sangatta was only developed recently as a result of licensing deregulation
by the Indonesian government. The Sangatta licence was won by Kaltim Prima
Coal (KPC), a 50:50 joint venture between British Petroleum and CRA, the
Australian mining company part owned by RTZ.
The mine is highly attractive. for a number of reasons. The coal is of
exceptionally high quality: it is low in sulphur, ash and moisture; the
seams are thick (up to 14m in places); and the reserves are estimated at
590m tonnes, enough for nearly 50 years. Production is already 50 per cent
above plan.
Furthermore, the mine is linked by conveyor belt to a deep sea berth which
means that the output can be shipped out cheaply. Most of the production is
exported, mainly to power generation utilities in Japan, Taiwan and Hawaii.
But against that, the seams have turned out to be more complicated than the
geologists expected, so mining costs have been higher than first thought.
Also, steaming coal prices have fallen by a quarter since the mine got into
production in 1991.
The mine cost Dollars 570m to develop, and KPC pays the Indonesian state
coal company PT Batubara a 13.5 per cent royalty on all the coal it takes
out. Mr John Slater, the managing director, declines to discuss the
operation's finances, but he says that production costs are at the lower end
of the world scale, mainly because the coal can be shipped out so easily.
He is also optimistic on prices: 'We are at the bottom of the cycle, and
we'll see prices come back a little,' he says, noting that spot prices could
rise in Europe. (CRA reported a profit of Dollars A44m on its half share in
the mine last year, double the previous year's profit).
Another difficulty is that Sangatta lies next door to the Kutai national
park, one of the few areas of virgin forest left in East Kalimantan, which
makes it an easy target for environmentalists. KPC is helping to fund
conservation projects to protect the area, and has a programme to reforest
the open pit itself. What is not specified in the contract is who pays for
the final clean-up costs once mining is finished.
The mine employs 2300 people and provides jobs for another 2000 contractors;
it is the main source of employment for miles around. Employees get access
to high class shops, education and health services. But this also sharpens
the divide between the haves and the have-nots, the latter clustering
hopefully round the mine in little villages.
How long BP and CRA will remain in control at Sangatta remains to be seen.
Under the terms of their agreement with the government, they are required to
offer up to 51 per cent of the business for sale to Indonesian interests
between 1996 and 2001. Ironically, BP has been selling off most of its coal
operations elsewhere in the world as part of its big rationalisation drive.
But it held on to Sangatta because of its exceptional prospects.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (8): Contemplating Europe - Karen Fossli
finds non-oil industry has benefited from lower costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norway's non-oil industry last year clawed its way out of the doldrums,
where it had been trapped for more than five years.
The return to profitability has been spurred to a great extent by an
improvement in the domestic economy, which was helped by a sharp increase in
oil activity, rather then a marked improvement in main export markets.
For the past two decades, the country's land-based industry has remained
largely in the shadow of the petroleum industry. 'The manufacturing sector
has been driven mostly by the oil industry, which has entered a period of
decline,' according to Mr Tor Steig, the chief economist at the
Confederation of Business and Industry (NHO).
This means that the prospects for the sector are mixed: the driving force of
oil industry is entering a downturn, while export markets are only beginning
to show signs of recovery. This means that investments in capacity are
likely to remain on hold until export markets pick up momentum and the issue
of membership of the European Union is clarified.
Norwegian industrial competitiveness has nevertheless improved sharply over
the past few years, mostly because of modest wage settlements and improved
cost-competitiveness, rather than domestic currency weakness.
A recent report on Norway, by analysts at Kleinwort Benson, concluded that
the Norwegian cost base in 1977 was an estimated 26 per cent higher than
that of its main competitors, but has since narrowed to about 11 per cent,
having improved by as much as 8.6 per cent over the past year. The
differential is forecast to narrow to 2 per cent by the end of 1995.
In many ways Norway could be compared to a developing country, for its main
exports consist mainly of raw materials rather than finished products.
Manufacturing industry accounts for just 15 per cent of gross domestic
product, which is considered a minimum for modern industrialised countries.
And with the uncertainty over Norway's vote on membership of the European
Union later this year, investments on expanding domestic capacity will
remain on hold, despite improvements in export exports. EU membership is the
single biggest issue concentrating the minds of companies which rely on
exports and which already have a high concentration of operations outside
Norway. NHO, which represents 11,000 companies which provide jobs for over
400,000 people, has urged its members to vote yes in the referendum.
In a recent survey, nearly 90 per cent of 310 industrial leaders polled said
membership would have a positive effect on business and industry.
With the exception of the food-processing industry, many of Norway's
industrial leaders believe that membership will lead to lower costs and
higher exports. Every fourth industrial leader polled in the survey also
believed EU membership would lead to greater investment in plant and
operations in Norway. Not surprisingly, EU optimism rises almost in direct
proportion to the level of exports of the companies polled, and it is the
export-driven companies that plan to increase domestic investment in plant
and operations if Norway's becomes a member.
Although the poll could not establish a direct link between EU membership
and plans to relocate production outside Norway, several of the country's
business and industrial leaders have cautioned that it may be necessary to
do just that.
Foreign investors are also wary of providing risk capital to companies that
face the prospect of remaining outside the EU - in spite of Norway's
membership of the European Economic Area, the largest free-trade zone in the
world.
Investments in industry have been declining for several years, and while the
government is optimistic that overall investment in Norway will regain
momentum this year, investment in manufacturing industry may even decline
until the results of the referendum are known.
The government, however, forecasts that investment by non-oil industry will
increase by 5.25 per cent this year and that the mainland economy will
expand by 3.5 per cent.
Mr Steig believes the government's forecast for private consumption, at 3
per cent, is grossly underestimated and that it is more likley to grow by 8
per cent. He says that each percentage point increase in private consumption
translates into NKr800m in extra VAT revenue for the government, and in 1994
could create 20,000 jobs, but that industry will nevertheless in future rely
more on exports than on domestic private consumption as its main fuel for
growth.
NHO is optimistic about the prospects for mainland industry, whose order
book rose by 9 per cent from the third quarter of last year until this
year's first quarter, with exports to Europe's automobile industry being the
driving force.
The order book for the metals industry alone rose by 11 per cent in the same
period, but Mr Steig points out that the Norwegian economy is at an early
stage in the overall upturn of the European economic cycle.
One of the stronger sectors emerging is the furniture industry, whose
exports soared by 13 per cent between last year's third quarter and this
year's first quarter interim. After near collapse, caused by Norway's
recession, the industry reoriented its strategy towards exports.
Mr Arve Thovik, head of the Federation of Norwegian Process and
Manufacturing Industries, is cautious in his optimism about the strength of
Norway's export markets. 'Until Europe finds its way, it will be difficult
for Norway, as the future production patterns of Europe are only just being
established,' he believes.
Mr Thorvik thinks membership of the EU would allow Norwegian land-based
industry to remain in Norway, in spite of the distance to markets, higher
taxes and higher costs. 'If we join, we know we will be part of the
structural decisions to be taken in the EU, and this will affect our
investment decisions and long-term strategies. The uncertainty will be
removed,' he said.
In the event of a No vote, Mr Thorvik does not believe there will be a mass
exodus of industry from Norway, but that investment in capacity will be made
in companies with operations outside Norway, causing value creation for
Norwegian industry to stop up.
He heads a lobbying group called 'From Nei til Ja' ('From No to Yes'),
consisting of members who rejected membership in 1972 but will vote yes in
November. 'I would rather see Norway enter the EU ready and willing than a
Norway which grudgingly backs into the EU like some other countries have,'
he said.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (10): The state maintains its grip - The
banks look healthier after a period of crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a gruelling five-year period of consolidation and massive credit
losses, Norway's banks returned to profit in 1993, emerging from the
country's worst banking crisis since the war.
A near-crash of several banks forced the government to undertake a
far-reaching rescue operation, which subsequently made the state the biggest
shareholder in the top three commercial banks, in what is proving to be a
lucrative investment.
During the past five years, the commercial banks alone were forced to cut
staff by a third, close 40 per cent of their domestic branches, retrench
from foreign operations and reduce operating costs by nearly 30 per cent in
real terms.
Only this year have they been able to concentrate efforts on maintaining
market share, though concern is being expressed over what appears to be
relaxation of lending practices in the face of heated competition - a key
element of the crisis, which engulfed the banks in the first place and
resulted in unprecedented high levels of credit losses.
Nevertheless, the banks' asset quality during the past year has improved,
helped by a steady upturn in Norway's oil-dependent economy, which is
rebounding from a seven-year recession that began when world crude oil
prices in 1986 plunged to their lowest level in more than a decade.
Because of the economy's upturn, which began last year, the banks have seen
a consistent decline in the level of non-performing loans during the past
few quarters, and consequently improvement in loan loss provisions.
Despite the banks' improved health, the minority Labour government has
stressed that the state will maintain until further notice a majority
shareholding of at least 50 per cent of Christiania Bank and Den norske Bank
(DnB), the country's two biggest banks. The state also owns all the share
capital of Fokus Bank, the third biggest commercial bank, which it is likely
to shed.
The state last year, however, reduced its stake in Christiania Bank to 68.9
per cent, from 98.8 per cent. But last December the it lifted its DnB
shareholding to 87.5 per cent from 69 per cent in an unpopular move in which
it converted NKr3.5bn in preference capital, which it had invested in DnB,
into 350m shares to once again shore up the bank's weak foundation.
The preference capital was converted into shares with a face value of NKr10,
but with DnB's shares trading at an average of about NKr18 this year on the
Oslo bourse, the move by the state was not only astute but also quite
lucrative.
Since 199,1 Christiania has received more than NKr9bn in state support,
while DnB has received more than NKr7bn, but the government has not escaped
criticism of the way it handled the crisis.
A report published recently pointed out that the Bank of Norway, which has
been in charge of administrating the state's shareholding and investments in
the banks, has earned more than NKr18bn from the banking crisis - at the
expense of the banks' former shareholders who were, in some cases, forced to
nullify the value of their bank shares - in the form of shareholdings and
interest on loans supplied to the banks by the central bank when the banks,
suffering from a lack of foreigners' confidence, had difficulty in raising
capital outside Norway.
Nevertheless, the government has pronounced the banking crisis dead and, for
the first time in many years, Christiania was able to tap the domestic
market for capital. Last December, it raised NKr1.88bn in fresh equity
through a successful share issue. It helped that the bank had reduced net
non-performing loans to 5.6 per cent of total loans at the end of 1993, from
7.1 per cent at end-1992, and that the outlook for the economy was bright
and expected to be brighter this year and next.
DnB is currently finalising plans to undertake a share issue in the second
quarter of this year, to raise about NKr2bn. Of this, NKr1bn will represent
a share capital increase, while the remainder will derive from a sale of
DnB's shares held by the state.
Both Christiania and DnB returned to profit last year, benefiting
substantially from securities' gains resulting primarily from a rise in bond
prices as domestic interest rates fell sharply. Underlying performances
improved, however, and should be sustained if the banks have learned the
lessons of past sins and avoid the lure of rapid credit expansion to boost
market share.
Norway's regulators are beginning to express concern over just that issue.
Recently the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission (BISC), the
industry watchdog, decided to survey the banks' routines for issuing housing
loans. The BISC is uneasy over a sharp rise in housing prices, which it
believes may be caused by competition among the banks to finance loans to
the highest degree possible, irrespective of property values.
However, Mr Trond Reinertsen, managing director of the Norwgian Banks
Association, shrugged off suggestions that the banks may fall into old
routines. 'Credit demand will grow in line with growth of domestic
consumption, perhaps a little stronger,' he said. Credit demand in the past
year has been moderate, increasing by between 1 and 2 per cent, while the
banks have seen credit expansion of nearly 7 per cent.
Mr Reinertsen argues that this level of growth is only natural, following a
five-year period in which there has been little credit demand as households
have struggled to reduce debt and consolidate savings in the midst of
Norway's recession.
'This is not a credit-financed expansion but credit financed by growth in
incomes,' he explained, adding that Norway's economy is currently strong,
rising from a very low level. 'It has been a number of years since there has
been credit expansion.'
According to the government, the economy showed strong growth in the second
half of 1993, and mainland GDP (excluding oil and shipping) grew by nearly
2.0 per cent from 1992 to 1993. The government is predicting a further
upturn in the mainland economy this year, fuelled by increased private
consumption and housing investments.
The household savings ratio is expected to fall by one percentage point to
about 4.25 per cent this year and total GDP growth is forecast at 4.0 per
cent.
Investment in the mainland economy is forecast to increase by 5.25 per cent
this year, while investment in the petroleum sector is expected to plummet
by 8 per cent after hitting a historically high level in 1993.
Mr Reinertsen warns, however, that the issue facing policymakers is to cut
back on government spending to allow private consumption to expand further.
Government spending, currently about 8 per cent of GDP, must be reined in,
he says. By comparison, the Bank of Norway estimates the banks' underlying
credit expansion at close to 11 per cent in the past year, and believes the
expansion has been between 9 and 11 per cent during recent months.
Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, finance minister, recently warned the banks not
succumb to past habits. 'We are not in a position to repeat the mistakes of
the 1980s,' he said. 'There are recent examples which suggest that the
lessons learned from the past have yet to take hold,' he told a recent
conference.
Norway's savings banks account for the strongest growth in housing lending,
while the commercial banks' growth has been fuelled more by corporate
lending. The savings banks, since 1987, have boosted their market share for
private loans to 33 per cent from 28 per cent, at the expense of commercial
banks whose market share shrunk to 21 per cent from 28 per cent.
In March, Christiania, DnB and Union Bank of Norway, the country's biggest
savings bank, received a fillip when the IBCA, London-based rating agency,
upgraded the individual, short-term and long-term ratings of the banks,
reflecting their return to profit last year, the positive outlook for the
economy and the continuing strong support of the state.

When, in 1988, Erik Tonseth took the helm of Kvaerner, Norway's second
biggest publicly-quoted group, he started to look for a yard which could be
acquired to build ships for the company's fleet.
Little more than five years later, Kvaerner has become Europe's biggest
shipbuilder, and one of the three biggest in the world, and Mr Tonseth has
led a successful expansion of the group in which sales and profits have more
than tripled.
About 35 per cent of Kvaerner's sales are generated from shipbuilding; oil
and gas contracting contribute 30 per cent, mechanical engineering 20 per
cent, pulping 11 per cent, and shipping 4 per cent.
Shipbuilding revenue is expected to increase by NKr1.5bn to NKr10bn in 1994.
But Mr Tonseth is is in no doubt about the effect a No vote on EU membership
would have on Kvaerner's future: 'We would have to consider if it would be
good for us to remain in Norway. About 40 per cent of our shareholders are
outside Norway, along with two-thirds of our employees. Both these
proportions will increase substantially in future, so we could not afford to
remain in a closed, nationalistic environment.'
Although Norway's long tradition as a maritime nation has probably been the
single biggest factor influencing Kvaerner's industrial participation, Mr
Tonseth does not believe the country is unique. 'We could be in Switzerland
as a financial holding company and survive, but we could not have a
vigorous, active management based there. We could be in Britain or
elsewhere. . . But wherever we are, it must be in an environment where there
is interest in our industry.'
Kvaerner's expansion into shipbuilding began in the summer of 1988, when the
group acquired the loss-making Govan shipyard on the Clyde, in Scotland. The
plan was to build gas carriers for Kvaerner's fleet. Five years later, the
long-troubled yard achieved its first profit in 30 years. And this year it
is forecast to make a profit of Dollars 5m.
'In retrospect, the acquisition was not the best decision,' admited Mr
Tonseth. 'We had many ex-shipbuilders but no active shipbuilding
organisation, and then to buy a yard which desperately needed new management
and a new way of thinking was a fairly ambitious move.
'Govan also needed total support from its new owner. At the time, Kvaerner
was not really in a position to give this level of support to the yard,
which is why it took so long for us to turn it around.'
Kvaerner's strategy was then to acquire a yard which could not only meet the
group's internal demand for ships but could also participate in an upswing
in shipbuilding foreseen by the group, and without requiring huge
investments.
'We believed that, with our resources, we could become a major factor in
this industry. We were very convinced that by 1995 the shipbuilding market
would improve. So, establishing that strategy, we bought the Masa-Yards in
Finland and four small yards in Norway.'
The acquisition of the four Kleven yards has been a success for Kvaerner.
'These yards already had good management and a good reputation in the
market,' explained Mr Tonseth. 'With our resources, they were able to take
on bigger engagements than they otherwise could have managed, because of
their fairly limited financial flexibility. These yards are regarded among
the world's best when it comes to building chemical carriers and reefers.'
The acquisition of Masa-Yards has also been a success. The two yards, in
Aabo and Helsinki, are among the most technologically advanced in the world,
and came equipped with strong leadership and expertise.
It also helped the yards' competitiveness when Finland floated the domestic
currency in 1992, resulting in a devaluation of the markka. This underpinned
the yards' bid to win a substantial contract last year  - in competition
with Japanese and Korean yards - to build four LNG carriers for the Abu
Dhabi National oil company.
'The Masa-Yards have a proud history, and were basically good yards which
needed a willing shareholder to help them realise their potential. They have
done outstanding work and this has become a successful marriage,' Mr Tonseth
said.
Last year, Kvaerner acquired Warnow Werft, in Rostock, in eastern Germany
for a symbolic sum and a pledge to modernise the yard which is about 20 per
cent complete. While it is too early to judge whether Warnow has been a
successful acquisition, it did achieve satisfactory results in 1993, and
operations exceeded expectations.
'Our motivation to acquire Warnow was not specifically with shipbuilding in
mind, but for Kvaerner to secure a major industrial engagement in Germany,'
explained Mr Tonseth. 'In retrospect, I would say that we have fulfiled
expectations relating to the yard, which has advanced significantly since we
became involved.'
Kvaerner's next objective for is to establish a bridgehead in China. The
group is currently seeking to negotiate a joint venture with the Chinese in
the Dalian New Shipyard. 'If China is a waiting game, there is no urgency on
our part,' said Mr Tonseth.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (8): Stern specifics - David Lascelles
on the banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I specifically urge all parties related to banking activities to stick to
ethical and efficient practice in managing the industry.'
These stern words came last month from no less a person than President
Suharto - a clear indication of the serious straits in which Indonesia's
banking industry finds itself.
Suharto made his utterance just as the Indonesian press was regaling its
readers with details of the Bapindo trial in which Mr Eddy Tansil, a local
businessman, is accused of defrauding Bapindo, the state development bank,
of the equivalent of over Dollars 430m. The case has sent shock waves
through the Indonesian political and business establishment with its
suggestion of corruption in high places. But it has also forced the
Indonesian authorities to confront the extent of bad loans in the country's
notoriously manipulated state banking sector.
According to an announcement by Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, the finance minister,
last February, 21 per cent of loans worth Dollars 7bn in the seven state
banks are either bad or in default. He told a parliamentary hearing that
much of this was the result of collusion between the banks and their
customers, and promised a massive clean-up. The ministry of finance has now
set up a supervisory team with Bank Indonesia, the central bank, to pick
through the state banks' loan books.
Mr Sudradjad Djiwandono, who became governor of Bank Indonesia a year ago,
says: 'Although there's a big public uproar over Bapindo, we had already
begun to address the issue of bad loans.' He says that a wide range of
measures is being adopted to strengthen the banking industry - and
supervision.
All this attention to banking - fed by the new openness Suharto has
sanctioned - might be thought highly embarrassing, coming as it does on the
heels of problems in the private banking sector as well. But many bankers
welcome it as evidence of government determination to get banking back to
health. 'It's long overdue,' says a foreign banker in Jakarta.
The private sector's problems date back to the ill-judged deregulation of
the banking industry in 1988, releasing banks from tight controls on
reserves and branch numbers. The banks used their new-found freedom to go on
a lending spree which came to a halt a couple of years later, when the
central bank tightened monetary policy to rein in credit growth.
Since then, many private sector banks have been forced to merge, or turn to
their shareholders for more capital. Last year Bank Summa, one of the
country's largest, was wound up on government orders.
But the road back to health has proved long and arduous. The central bank
tightened capital requirements to meet the new Basle regulations in 1991,
but had to loosen them again last year to mobilise more lending, although
the level of bad debts was still high. 'By the end of this year, I can say
that we shall have a very clean portfolio,' says Mr Glenn Yusuf, a director
of Bank Niaga, a leading private sector bank.
But the shake-out has still some way to go, in many people's view. The
number of banks in Indonesia, 243, is considered to be far too large. At the
same time, the number of properly qualified personnel is too small: this
means that banks are badly managed. Another underlying problem is that many
of Indonesia's largest banks form part of wider industrial conglomerates
where they are treated as 'in-house' banks. Much of the banking sector's
difficulties stem from the incestuous relationships that result.
The central bank is trying to cut down the amount of linked lending by
enforcing the internationally accepted ceiling of 20 per cent of assets to a
single customer. But because the problem is so large, it has had to give
banks a breathing space by allowing them to insure the credit risk on any
over-limit loans until 1997.
The problems of the state sector have also had repercussions on private
sector banks. Many of Indonesia's largest companies relied heavily on state
banks for their funding. But now that the state sector is more tightly
policed, these companies have been forced to turn to private banks instead -
putting pressure on the private money markets and helping to push up
interest rates.
Some companies have also begun to turn to foreign banks operating in
Indonesia. But there are limits to the growth of this market because foreign
banks are required to restrict most of their lending to export-related
business. There are also limits on their ability to raise funds externally.
The sharp growth in bad loans has exposed another bugbear for bankers: the
difficulty of recovering debts through the courts because of inefficiency
and corruption. reform of the law affecting the rights of creditors and
depositors is one of the items on the central bank's agenda.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (7): Insider thrills and spills - The
Jakarta stock exchange is 70 per cent foreign driven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Jakarta stock exchange has provided investors with an object lesson in
the thrills - and spills - of emerging markets.
Last year the exchange was a star performer: the composite index doubled,
triggering a flood of company flotations and rights issues. But after
hitting a three-year high in the first week of January, it went into a
nosedive which wiped 25 per cent off share values. In recent weeks prices
have begun to creep back up again, but the experience has caused analysts to
look more warily at the market - and its smaller sister in Surabaya.
The ostensible cause of the sell-off was the Federal Reserve Board's
decision to raise US interest rates in February. But with a domestic crisis
bubbling up in the state banking sector, and ethnic riots in Medan, there
were other reasons for investors to be nervous.
Analysts say that it is important to understand that unlike other south east
Asian markets, Jakarta is not dominated by local Chinese traders. This means
that there is less of the speculative investment seen on other regional
exchanges. On the other hand, 70 per cent of the trading is driven by
foreign investors, which means that Jakarta is vulnerable to whatever Wall
Street or London fashion says about emerging markets.
Jakarta's modest capitalisation of about Rp 40tr (Dollars 19.2bn) and the
relatively small number of stocks traded (183) make for the poor liquidity
widely considered to be one of the exchange's biggest drawbacks.
The strong family ties linking shareholders of the biggest companies also
mean that investors have to beware of insider trading. Nor is fraud unknown:
last year, counterfeiters fed over a million forged share certificates on to
the market, forcing suspension of trading in five listed companies. Some of
the exchange's limitations are bureaucratic.
A further curb is the limit of 49 per cent on foreign ownership of the
listed stock of Indonesian companies. This rule is more stringent than it
appears because many large Indonesian companies only list a small proportion
of issued stock - as little as 10 per cent. So foreign investors are being
excluded from a sizeable area of potential investment territory.
Against that, however, the market is relatively open by south east Asian
standards: there are no capital controls, and foreign stockbrokers can
become members of the exchange by forming partnerships with local concerns
(27 have). The exchange also has ambitious plans to automate operations and
move to scrip-less trading later this year, which will greatly increase its
trading capacity (currently limited to 5,000 manually entered deals a day),
and reduce dealing costs.
Nonetheless, it was a blow to the exchange when Indosat, the large
state-owned telecommunications company, decided to go to Wall Street for its
forthcoming privatisation.
The recent crisis in the banking sector has sharpened the need for
alternative sources of finance, and the government is keen to see the stock
market take on a heavier share of the load. Much of the task of
strengthening the exchange lies with Mr Bacelius Ruru, the chairman of
Bapepam, the capital markets supervisory agency, which is part of the
ministry of finance. He is trying to improve the market's reputation, and
persuade the ministry to relax some of the more onerous regulations. Items
on his agenda include more disclosure both of the finances of listed
companies and of trading in their shares. Bapepam is a standard-setting body
for company accounts; it is working with the accounting institutes to
improve the rules. He is also trying to raise standards for initial
offerings. Documents are vetted more closely, even if this holds up the flow
of new issues.
Mr Ruru has told the ministry that the 49 per cent rule should be removed -
although so far with no result. He is in less of a hurry to remove the 15
multiple rule. 'It's a way to teach the market how to behave. People should
float shares out of need, not greed.' Nonetheless, Mr Ruru says this will
only be temporary 'We don't want our market to be different from the
others.'
Insider trading is a bigger problem. Bapepam does not have the powers to
deal with it effectively: there have been no successful prosecutions,
despite what brokers say are blatant cases where shares have moved sharply
in advance of price-sensitive news. Part of the problem is cultural. As an
official puts it: 'An exchange without insider trading is like a night club
without girls.'
However, Bapepam has tried to protect the independent shareholders in large
companies with dominant family shareholders.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (6): Private king - Profile / Mohamad
Hasan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the tight-knit Indonesian business community, the same names keep
cropping up - such as Mr Mohamad Hasan. Universally known as Bob, Mr Hasan
heads one of the small number of enormous personal business empires which
control much of the country's economic activity.
By his own count, Mr Hasan owns more than 100 companies with interests
ranging from forestry and construction to insurance and banking. But
although his wiry figure and impish looks are a familiar public sight, his
personal affairs have remained very private - often wrapped up in the
yayasans, or quasi-charitable foundations which conceal much of Indonesia's
wealth.
Mr Hasan has never floated shares on the public exchanges. In a recent
interview he said his group made no use of debt either.
But the influence of the Hasan empire extends well beyond mere business. Mr
Hasan is close to President Suharto, whom he got to know in the 1950s when
he was a regional military commander. Today the two meet regularly to play
golf. The mere association of Mr Hasan with some initiative is enough to get
it off the ground.
Like most of Indonesia's business tycoons, Mr Hasan is of Chinese ethnic
origin - a somewhat touchy matter in a country which resents Chinese
commercial domination. But if this has been a disadvantage, it is greatly
outweighed by his links with Suharto, which are closer than any cabinet
member's. To reinforce these ties, Mr Hasan changed his name (it was
originally The Kian Sang), and converted to Islam, joining Suharto on the
haj to Mecca. He is also said to make a point of not employing Chinese
staff.
The heart of the Hasan empire lies in forestry and wood products. His
personal power base is reinforced by his chairmanship of Apkindo, the
Indonesian plywood trade association whose members account for over three
quarters of the plywood supplied to the world market.
This forestry connection has made him a controversial figure, not merely
because of Apkindo's powerful grip on the wood products business, but also
because of international concern about the destruction of the rain forests.
Mr Hasan denies that Apkindo sets prices: 'That would get us in a lot of
trouble.' He has also gone on the offensive to defend Indonesia's forestry
practices, visiting Strasbourg earlier this year to put his case to
Euro-MPs.
'We want the world to know that we care about our forests,' he says, adding
that Indonesia has a detailed plan for its forest management, and has
embarked on initiatives to enforce the law on concession holders, such as
aerial surveillance and an eco-labelling scheme. Asked about the extent of
illegal logging, he says; 'There's a small quantity.'
Mr Hasan believes that natural resources must underpin Indonesia's economic
growth. 'Everyone is going into electronics, cars and steel. But you need a
table to put your computer on, a case for the diskette. We can make those
things. They're complementary.'
Now in his 60s, Mr Hasan has begun to pull back from direct day to day
involvement with his businesses. His real interests, he says, are the string
of sporting and community causes with which he is involved. He heads
Indonesia's athletics, gymnastics, golf and chess associations.
He is also a member of the Business Council for Sustainable Development  -
the Swiss-based group of environmentally concerned businessmen - and is in
the process of setting up an Indonesian branch of the Duke of Edinburgh's
Award. 'These are my businesses. My industries are my hobbies,' he says.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (6): 'We'd survive a No vote' - The prime
minister replies to questions put to her by Hugh Carnegy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland first became prime minister in 1981, and has gone
on to become the dominant figure of her generation in Norwegian politics.
Since leading her Labour party to victory in last September's general
election, her overriding concern has been to achieve approval for Norwegian
entry into the European Union in a referendum due on November 28 this year.
It is a project that flies in the face of heavy popular opposition. If she
fails to win a Yes vote, her future as prime minister will inevitably be
cast into doubt. Mrs Brundtland answered the following questions for this
survey:
Q: What are the issues upon which you will fight the campaign for a Yes vote
in November?
A: The accession treaty (agreed with Brussels in March) shows that Norway is
welcome in the EU. It includes satisfactory solutions to issues of vital
importance to us, such as control over natural resources and an active
regional policy. Norway would benefit from participation in the
decision-making process in the EU, and would use its influence to intensify
co-operation to promote employment, equitable social development,
environmental protection and peace between the countries of Europe. As a
member of the EU, we would continue to pursue the main lines of the economic
and foreign policy we have followed throughout the post-war period. Norway
has a natural place in this forum.
Q: If Norway votes No, as it did in 1972, what will be the consequences for
the country?
A: If the country votes against membership, we shall have to build on our
membership of Nato, our associate membership of the WEU (Western European
Union) and on the EEA (European Economic Area) agreement. This would
obviously be a second-best solution and would give Norway less influence on
developments in Europe, developments on which we are extremely dependent
given our open economy and strong ties to Western Europe.
Q: In 1972, the No vote was devastating for Labour. What would be the
consequences for you personally and for the party if you fail once again?
A: The Labour party has conducted a thorough, open and broad-based debate on
the EU issue for several years. Despite disagreement (within the party) on
the issue, the way it has been dealt with has helped to strengthen the
party. At the same time, the party leadership and the government has made it
clear that the referendum will decide the issue, and the result will be
respected by all our members. The Labour party is thus also prepared to
continue in power in the event of a No vote. The country needs stable
leadership and firm government and, in the current political situation, the
Labour party is the political force that can provide this.
Q: As a member of the EU what would Norway's attitude be in the debate about
the future shape of the Union?
A: The EU is based upon close co-operation between independent states. This
co-operation must be developed gradually, with a view to meeting challenges
and resolving problems that cannot be dealt with by countries on their own.
We are in favour of stronger decision-making mechanisms in areas where it is
necessary to intensify efforts to promote sustainable development and
stimulate employment. At the same time we subscribe to the principle of
subsidiarity.
Q: With oil production soon set to start falling, there appears to be an
inherent weakness in the mainland economy which threatens the long-term
prospects for the economy as a whole. What are you doing to address this?
A: The government has pursued a policy in which the fiscal and structural
policy measures have been designed precisely to stimulate economic
development and employment in the mainland economy. There are many signs
that this is now yielding results. We are making active use of the public
budgets to increase employment, strengthen the private sector and invest in
expertise and other infrastructure. Now that the economy has entered a phase
of relatively vigorous growth, it is important to strengthen the country's
financial position. The deficit on the fiscal budget will also be reduced
this year and further next year. It is true that our oil production will be
reduced in a few years' time, but given the increase in gas production, the
production on the Norwegian shelf will continue to be a mainstay of the
economy for many years to come. Increased production on mainland Norway will
therefore enable us to maintain balanced growth. The cost-competitiveness of
the Norwegian economy has improved considerably, and the prospects for the
mainland economy are better now that they were a few years ago. This means
we are becoming less dependent on oil.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (7): Lawyer, 47, accepts daunting brief -
'There's no such thing as the end of history,' says the party leader facing
a huge struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jan Petersen, the new leader of Hoyre, Norway's Conservative party, has a
political mountain to climb.
Beaten into third place in last September's general election by the Centre
party, Hoyre's traditional position as the main opposition to the ruling
Labour party has rarely been so under threat. With deep differences now
dividing Hoyre and the Centre party, the prospect of the Conservatives again
leading a non-socialist coalition government, as they did in the 1980s,
appears remote.
But Mr Petersen, a 47-year-old lawyer with 13 years experience in the
Storting, is undaunted. He faces, he admits, a marathon task. But, he
insists: 'There is no such thing as the end of history. The surest thing in
politics is that it is very difficult to make predictions. We have to
believe that we will make it into government again.'
The last time Hoyre led a government was as recently as 1990. But the
administration collapsed after barely a year in office, irrepairably split
between Hoyre's strong advocacy of Norwegian membership of the European
Union and the equally strong anti-EU stance of the Centre party.
The low point for Hoyre came in last year's election when the party was for
the first time overtaken as the biggest non-socialist party by the Centre
party, winning less than 20 per cent of the vote. It was a far cry from the
party's heyday in the early 1980s when, under former Prime Minister Kare
Willoch, Hoyre polled almost 32 per cent of the vote.
After the September debacle, Mrs Kaci Kullman Five resigned as party leader.
In April, Hoyre turned to the bearded, self-effacing Mr Petersen. The new
leader's politics are in the centre of the conservative stream. For most of
the past 10 years he has concentrated on foreign affairs, leaving him with a
low domestic profile.
But he intends to make a virtue of this, casting himself as a responsible
leader of a credible alternative government. Once November's referendum on
joining the EU is over - a campaign in which Hoyre supports the Labour
government - Mr Petersen will place the emphasis on the need to stem
Norway's government deficit and inject more market-oriented policies.
'We should try to move in the direction of freedom of choice in Norwegian
affairs  .. a lot of people are fed up with what they perceive as the
arrogance of the government. Labour is definitely not the 'natural' party of
government. Very slowly, we are moving upwards again.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (4): Suharto is untouchable - Manuela
Saragosa notes more open debate in politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Suharto is unlikely to go down in history as a born-again
democrat, but his recent calls for more open public debate, with his moves
to reduce the number of military men in government, indicate that there is
change brewing.
The changes started when Mr Suharto, a former general, entered his sixth
five-year term in office in March last year, having run in elections as the
sole presidential candidate and been backed by both opposition parties and
the ruling Golkar party.
First, he introduced a surprise cabinet reshuffle. Out went many of the
older 1945 independence generation ministers; in came younger faces. In the
process, members of the armed forces were reduced to eight from 11 in a
41-member cabinet, with only two of them on the military's active service
list.
A few months later, President Suharto was calling for more open public
debate. Politically sensitive subjects such as his own succession, human
rights in East Timor, and the role of ethnic Chinese Indonesians in the
country's business and economy are no longer completely taboo. 'The degree
of political openness is unrecognisable from three or four years ago,' says
a Jakarta-based western diplomat.
To be sure, Mr Suharto and his family remain untouchable. Earlier this year,
students who demonstrated outside parliament, demanding that Suharto account
for his leadership, were each sentenced to six months imprisonment for
defaming the president. Open discussion of Mr Suharto's family business
monopolies, which extend from satellite communications to cement
manufacturing, also remains off limits in the national press. What is
interesting is not that the press has become bolder, but what has motivated
Mr Suharto to call for more open public debate.
Observers point to his increasingly frequent hints that he may step down
when his presidential term ends in 1998 - he will turn 77 that year - but
they also mention the strain involved in keeping a lid held down on a
society which is demanding more democracy to accompany its more open
economic policies.
The national press is still constrained by a law which empowers the
government to revoke publication and broadcasting licences when 'the wrong
kind of information' is dispersed - but Jakarta roof tops are littered with
large satellite dishes, soaking up information from international
broadcasting networks.
'Mr Suharto realises that with globalisation it is inevitable that people
know about what is happening instantly,' says Mr Juwono Sudarsono, professor
of International Relations at the University of Indonesia. 'He realises that
managed openness is better than a complete clampdown. It is more effective
in managing change.'
Political analysts say that Mr Suharto's moves to foster open political
debate show he is concerned about the legacy he will leave when he steps
down. Over the last few years he has successfully dubbed himself as 'the
father of development' in Indonesia and his rule is credited with
consistency in sustaining a healthy level of economic growth.
Politically, his track record is not squeaky clean, particularly on the
subject of human rights. An attempt to set the record straight on that front
was carried out earlier this year when the Indonesian government invited
journalists from all over the world to attend a government-guided tour of
East Timor - part of a campaign to improve Indonesia's international
reputation. The campaign is accompanied with a gradual reduction of military
presence in government. The military, however, remains a force to be
reckoned with.
Much of the public debate in the press is a reflection of the power
struggles taking place in the ruling elite - technocrats and military men
battling with technologists - and debate between the generations. Political
analysts note that a new generation of ministers has entered Indonesian
political life and that, unlike the 1945 independence generation, they are
less concerned with cohesion and national unity. Many of them have been
educated in the west and have tasted political freedoms which they do not
have at home. They stand behind the drive for more transparency in
government. However, rather than argue things out in parliament, some
politicians have resorted to tossing subtle barbs at each other in the
press.
One example is the controversy surrounding Mr JB Habibie, the minister of
technology and research. Pressure on Mr Habibie's demands for a budget of
Dollars 1.1bn for the purchase and upgrade of the former East Germany's
fleet of warships was mounted by the minister of defence and security, who
commented to journalists that the budget request was excessive. A few days
later the minister of finance forced Mr Habibie to slash his budget to
Dollars 482m.
Increased political openness has also had its negative manifestations. Some
newspapers have used their freedom to vent racist feelings against ethnic
Chinese Indonesians.
Their grievances are based on the fact that the ethnic Chinese control about
75 per cent of the country's private capital although they only make up
about 2 per cent of the population.
Observers say that attacks on ethnic Chinese Indonesians are also veiled
criticisms of government officials who benefit from their association with
large Chinese-dominated conglomerates, and an indirect attack on President
Suharto, who has often protected Chinese business interests in Indonesia.
It is certainly true that resentment of ethnic Chinese domination in
industry and commerce has been an enduring characteristic of Indonesian
politics since independence.
But some observers say that in this sprawling archipelago, consisting of
hundreds of different ethnic groupings who together count as the world's
fourth largest population, things could easily slip into chaos. They point
to the labour riots, laced with anti-Chinese sentiment, in the north
Sumatran town of Medan earlier this year.
In the meantime, Indonesians are watching the massacres in the former
Yugoslavia with a mixture of horror and interest. Events there are a grim
reminder of the consequences of ethno-nationalism.
Analysts say, however, that a Balkan type break up is unlikely to occur in
Indonesia because there is a strong sense among the ruling elite and
military that stability is essential to keep up the momentum of economic
growth. Thus, while the press may be bolder, there is still no freedom to
assembly, no freedom of association and people's right to information is
limited.
As Mr Sudarsono puts it; 'The government wants to strike a nice balance
between openness and stability.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (5): Disputes can turn violent - Victor
Mallet analyses the growing pains of industrial revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia's industrial revolution has not been without growing pains.
Strikes and demonstrations by factory workers have become increasingly
frequent since the beginning of the decade, and labour disputes have
occasionally turned violent.
The owners of export-oriented factories - for whom cheap labour is one of
the main attractions of Indonesia - are understandably concerned about
rising labour costs and the risk of unrest.
But employers are aware that Indonesian workers are still much cheaper than
most of their counterparts elsewhere in south-east Asia; and they know that
the lower-paid workers of Vietnam and China are starting to demand more
money for factory work.
Indonesia's fledgling independent trade union movement has found support
from a motley collection of allies, including liberal non-governmental
organisations from Indonesia and abroad who have helped to inform workers of
their rights, and the US administration, which has threatened to withdraw
tariff privileges from Indonesian exports to the US if Jakarta fails to
adhere to international labour standards.
Indonesian employers, most of them from the ethnic Chinese minority, have
also unwittingly contributed to the increasing strength of the local labour
movement; some have fuelled the resentment of workers by paying less than
the official minimum wage (currently Rp3,800 a day in Jakarta) or by
treating employees with exceptional harshness; one factory was reported to
have deducted Rp500 from workers' pay each time they went to the lavatory).
Trade unionists already proclaim two martyrs whose names are known by
industrial workers throughout the country: Marsinah, a woman labour activist
and watch factory employee who was tortured, sexually abused and murdered
last year (three of the company's employees were recently found guilty of
the crime but the men say they were forced to confess and the authorities
have been accused of a cover-up); and Rusli, a rubber factory worker whose
body was found in a river in Medan, north Sumatra, following a demonstration
in March that was broken up by riot police.
In April, thousands of Medan workers went on strike, and demonstrations
degenerated into rioting directed at the ethnic Chinese; one factory owner
was dragged from his car and killed before the armed forces restored order.
More recently there have been several strikes on the main island of Java.
The independent Indonesian Welfare Labour Union, established two years ago,
has led the struggle for higher wages and better conditions, but the
government has refused to allow the union to register and occasionally
arrests its officials. Instead, the government insists that workers must be
represented through the officially sanctioned All Indonesia Workers Union,
an organisation headed not by a worker but by a textile magnate who is also
a member of the ruling Golkar party.
Government officials argue that Indonesian workers are not sufficiently
educated to establish their own union and that an officially-controlled
union is justified by the need to maintain law and order. Mr Suwarto,
director general for industrial relations and labour standards at the
ministry of manpower, says: 'How can they organise for themselves without
being guided by the government?'
He adds: 'Here in Indonesia, if there are 50 people carrying banners, in
five minutes there will be hundreds and then thousands - and stone-throwing
 -because of unemployment.'
He acknowledges that the ministry sometimes has difficulties in enforcing
the minimum wage rules and other labour legislation, pointing out that there
are only 700 labour inspectors covering 147,000 companies.
Asked about allegations that employers routinely bribe inspectors to ignore
company malpractices, Mr Suwarto replies that it is impossible for the
government to act against corruption without proof.
Employers, meanwhile, have threatened to lay off workers if wages continue
to rise. They say Indonesian productivity is low and they normally employ
more people than they need as part of an informal social contract involving
low wages on the one hand and job security on the other. With 2.5m school
leavers entering the workforce each year, and an estimated 30-40m
Indonesians either unemployed or underemployed, factory owners say they do
not see much economic justification for increased wages.
The independent trade union (known by its Indonesian acronym as the SBSI,
not to be confused with the government-backed SPSI) argues that wages and
conditions should be improved both to provide workers with a living wage and
to ensure that labourers are treated in accordance with the international
agreements to which the Indonesian government itself has subscribed.
Trade unionists - and foreign businessmen - repeatedly refer to the fact
that whereas wages account for only about 7 per cent or 8 per cent of total
costs for a typical company in Indonesia, bribes for government officials
can account for between 10 and 30 per cent: the obvious way of pleasing
employees and employers alike is to abolish corruption and use the money
saved to raise wages.
The SBSI, which now claims to have more than 250,000 members, inevitably
finds itself straying into the political arena, confronting the government
on such issues as freedom of association (theoretically guaranteed in the
constitution) and the role of the armed forces (which are dominant in
politics and frequently intervene in factory strikes).
'My struggle is to build a strong civil society through a strong trade
union,' says Mr Muchtar Pakpahan, SBSI leader. 'Only a strong trade union
can balance the domination of the military.'
Should the government attempt to close down the SBSI, he says, 'I will
organise a rally to topple the government if the government acts against the
law and against the constitution.'
Some military leaders have likened the SBSI to a subversive communist
organisation, and the Indonesian government may be tempted to emulate its
counterparts in Malaysia and Singapore by suppressing the independent trade
union movement. Even if that happens, Indonesia is unlikely to be able to
resist domestic and international pressure for higher wages and better
working conditions.
This was one of topics raised by the International Labour Organisation's Mr
Heribert Maier, who called for a new Indonesian labour code based on ILO
principles during a recent visit to Jakarta. As he said in a speech to
Indonesian officials: 'The events of the last few years, months or even
weeks in the country have shown quite clearly that the evolution of its
industrial relations has not kept pace with its rapidly developing economy
and industry.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (5): Trying to win it the Ali way - Hugh
Carnegy finds most Norwegians are still Eurosceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, the bid by prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's minority
Labour government to persuade Norwegians to join the European Union looks
like an exercise in political masochism.
In 1972, Norwegians voted no in an earlier referendum on the question, after
a bitterly divisive campaign that toppled the Labour administration of the
day and prompted the resignation of the then prime minister, Mr Trygve
Bratteli. Twenty-two years on, the country appears to be, if anything, more
hostile to EU membership. Opinion polls have for months shown opposition -
excluding undecided voters  - at around 55 per cent, ahead of the 53.5 per
cent majority achieved by the No side in 1972.
Senior government officials freely acknowledge that the task of reversing
this obstinate trend in time for this year's referendum on November 28 will
be, at best, extremely difficult. 'We have said all along that if we get the
campaign right, we have a chance. But if we get it wrong, we have no chance
at all,' says an aide to Mrs Brundtland.
To that end, the emphasis from the government side to date has been on
preparing the ground for a Yes campaign that will not move into top gear
until after the summer holidays, rather than campaigning itself. This is
partly to ensure that the Labour party, in particular, does not splinter
over the issue despite the anti-EU stance of many of its supporters. But it
is also a deliberate attempt to try to draw the sting of the No side before
the last vital few weeks of the campaign.
The prime minister's aide likened the tactics to those once employed by
former world heavyweight boxing champion Mohammed Ali. 'We will take all the
punishment and then try to hit them at the end.'
So far, the government's plan has gone well - notwithstanding the lack of
movement in the opinion polls. Labour survived a surge in last autumn's
general election by the fiercely anti-EU Centre party which saw the
opposition Conservative party - the strongest advocate of EU membership -
knocked back into third place in numbers of seats in the Storting
(parliament).
The accession agreement secured with Brussels in March was accepted as
favourable by key sceptics in the government, notably Mr Jan Henry Olsen,
the fisheries minister. Lately, a Labour party congress has seemed set to
endorse EU membership as official party policy.
Above all, the Yes vote in this month's Austrian referendum has started a
ball rolling, which Mrs Brundtland hopes will pick up speed with a Yes vote
in fellow applicants Finland and Sweden in October and mid-November,
creating a momentum which will turn the issue her way in Norway.
Crucially, opinion polls in Norway have shown a small majority for joining
the EU if neighbouring Sweden, where opposition is also still very strong,
decides to join. EU supporters believe large numbers of voters - perhaps 40
per cent or more  - are still undecided or persuadable.
Mr Johan J. Jakobsen, former leader of the Centre party, now leader of its
parliamentary group and a leading figure in the well-organised No campaign,
admits that a Swedish Yes vote would make for 'a very close race' in Norway.
The other side of the coin, however, is that a Swedish No would all but
ensure a Norwegian No. Given the great uncertainty that still surrounds the
outcome in Sweden, the No side in Norway remains extremely confident that it
will prevail.
In 1972, the key factors in the No victory were the fear of the
politically-important fishing communities that allowing outside fishermen
access to Norwegian waters would devastate already depleted stocks, and a
broader fear that a process of population shift away from Norway's remote
northern regions would be accelerated by membership.
There are strong echoes of these themes again in the new No campaign. 'The
main issue is the question of democracy,' says Mr Jakobsen. 'Many Norwegians
feel the EU is developing in a direction in which democracy will be
diminished. They are against an integrated, federal Europe. They fear we
will have no influence and too much power will lie in the hands of
bureaucrats.'
Secondly, he says, there is a fear that Norway's control over its natural
resources - its oil and gas, its fisheries, minerals and water  - will be
subjugated to policy made in Brussels. This in turn, he says, will mean
Norway will have less ability to sustain its policies of sustaining rural
communities through big regional and agricultural subsidies and of
maintaining the extensive welfare system.
The Yes campaign acknowledges the potency of these arguments in a country
jealous of its independence, which it won from Sweden only in 1905 and which
was interrupted traumatically by Nazi occupation during the second world
war.
'I believe if you analyse all the important elements in the popular
resistance to membership, it boils down to uncertainty, fear and insecurity
about everything from defence to unemployment,' says Mr Arve Thorvik, leader
of a group of prominent people who campaigned for a No vote in 1972, but now
favour membership.
The Yes side's attempts to overcome these fears have so far been
ineffective, however. Norway's membership of the European Economic Area
market access agreement with the EU means most of the trade benefits of full
membership have already been achieved. Politically, the argument that
Norway, already a member of Nato, needs to deepen its involvement in
European moves towards common security policies is undermined by conflicting
signals coming from inside the union of what its existing members want to
achieve.
'We have to sell an argument that is hard to sell these days, and that is
solidarity,' says Mr Thorvik. 'There is no immediate economic argument for
entry, the main argument is political and it is difficult to sell an EU
which itself is lacking in direction.'
What the Yes side is left with is the worry that Norway will be left
isolated if it stays outside the EU. But Mr Jakobsen is unimpressed by this
line of attack. 'We are not afraid of that,' he says. 'Norway is in Nato and
plays a role in so many international organisations. Norway will always be
an interesting partner for other countries.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (4): Nato still seen as the basis for
security - Foreign policy, the country's role as peace-broker has led to new
tensions at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There can have been few moments in the near nine decades since Norway gained
its independence from Sweden in 1905 when the country's international
reputation stood as high as it did last year, when it helped pull off the
historic peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
The months of providing secret settings for the talks and occasionally
sensitive mediation between two of the world's most bitter enemies paid off,
not just in the agreement signed on the White House lawn, but also in a
burst of goodwill and appreciation for Norway from around the world.
It was a reward for a foreign policy long pursued by Norway to be an
independent nation, standing outside big power blocks, which, with the help
of generous aid contributions, can play a role in promoting peace and
stability on a scale beyond its small size and remote northern location.
But, at least since the second world war, when Norway was occupied by the
Nazis, there has been another side to this coin. With the experience of the
war fresh in the nation's mind. and the cold war with the neighbouring
Soviet Union deepening, Norway became a founder member of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation (Nato) in 1949.
Now, within months of concluding the Israel-PLO accord, Norway has concluded
an agreement with Brussels to join the European Union, a step deliberately
taken to ensure that the country stands inside the organisation seen as
driving long-term political and economic strategy in Europe.
The Norwegian electorate has once before rejected membership of the European
Community, in a referendum in 1972. As the campaign builds for the new
referendum in November, the tension between the two aspects of Norwegian
foreign policy are again evident - and could have an effect on the outcome
of the vote.
'Norway has a strong tradition of idealism in foreign policy and a weak
strain of realpolitik,' says Mr Nils Morten Udgaard, a foreign policy
commentator for the daily newspaper Aftenposten. 'What happened in the
Middle East is part of the idealistic tradition. If the idealistic tradition
becomes too strong, it could suppress those features of realpolitik such as
relationships with the large European countries.'
The so-called idealistic side of foreign policy identified by Mr Udgaard is
certainly strongly in evidence at present. In the Middle East alone, Norway
now has nine areas of involvement. These include: chairing a donors group
responsible for steering international aid funds to the new Palestinian
self-rule authority, and provision of observers helping in the effort to
suppress violence in the West Bank town of Hebron.
Norway has also been deeply involved in efforts to bring peace to former
Yugoslavia, with its former foreign minister, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg,
acting as the United Nations peace envoy. It has, since 1990, been helping
to mediate between the two sides in the internal conflict in Guatemala.
Lately, Norway has hosted at least one meeting to probe ways of achieving
peace in Sudan.
Such involvements have grown out of a Norwegian commitment to providing
foreign assistance that has seen aid efforts extended to 100 countries over
the past 30 years. Mr Jan Egeland, the deputy foreign minister who was
closely involved in the Israel-PLO talks, says the Norwegian method of
administering assistance through non-governmental agencies has allowed Oslo
to build up trust, and to provide discreet channels of communication between
warring parties without involving large numbers of government officials.
Those campaigning to keep Norway out of the EU are afraid that this role -
and the invaluable international prestige it has won the country - will be
jeopardised by joining a union committed to harmonising foreign policy
stances.
But Mr Egeland insists that this is not so. 'We will not change our foreign
policy by joining the EU. There is nothing involved in membership that will
stop us taking initiatives for peace and democracy around the world, covert
or overt. In fact, joining the EU will be a net gain for us, because we
could rely on the networks of the EU, especially in follow-up work.'
The government is nevertheless acutely aware that the EU's commitment under
the 1991 Maastricht treaty, to work towards common foreign and strategic
policies, is regarded with deep suspicion by many Norwegians wedded to
Oslo's role as an independent peace-broker.
This may seem in conflict with the country's long-established and
long-accepted membership of Nato. But Nato membership is seen as a vital
element in the country's defence policy, distinct from deeper political
involvement in Europe. The government is therefore stressing that Norway
wants to see the maintainance of Nato as the key to the country's security,
and does not intend to upgrade its current observer status within the
Western European Union.
'Norway has two feet - one Atlantic foot and one European foot,' says Mr
Egeland. 'This makes us feel very strongly that we need Nato for the
Atlantic leg.'
Norway, the government argues, must join the EU to be able to influence
developments in Europe. 'We should go in to be able to shape events in out
part of the world. It is better to sit at the table than to stand out in the
hallway,' says Mr Egeland.
With a strong currency, low inflation and a relatively small budget deficit,
Oslo is also a potential 'core' member of the drive towards a European
Monetary Union set out at Maastricht. But talk of any kind of political
union is unpopular and played down by the government.
'The problem is,' says Nils Morten Udgaard, of Aftenposten, 'that the
decisive issue in the EU debate is solely political, and that is very
difficult to sell.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (2): Can the non-oil sector fill the gap? -
The economy, although most indicators are pointing upward, uncertainty lies
ahead

<TEXT>
Norway, long bolstered by the benefits of North Sea oil, is entering a
critical phase that will determine whether it can sustain its position as
one of Europe's most prosperous nations into the next century.
This year, almost all the economic indicators are pointing upward after
several years of recession and stagnation. The economy as a whole is set to
grow by up to 4 per cent in 1994 and do even better next year. When oil and
gas revenues are excluded, the forecasts still show healthy growth, with
so-called mainland GDP expected by the OECD to increase by 2.25 per cent in
1994 and by 3 per cent next year.
Inflation, at less than 1 per cent a year, is among the lowest in Europe.
The total government deficit for 1994 is estimated to reach 2.8 per cent of
GDP, again among the lowest in western Europe. The balance of payments will
show a large surplus of more than 2.5 per cent of GDP. Unemployment, the key
domestic political concern, has stabilised and should fall slightly to 5.5
per cent of the workforce (although a further 3 per cent are on government
training schemes).
In the next few years, however, there are challenges to be faced which raise
important question-marks over whether this optimistic outlook in the
short-term can be extended into a pattern of steady long-term growth.
This autumn, Norwegians, along with their Nordic neighbours in Finland and
Sweden, will decide in a referendum whether to join the European Union: the
minority Labour government, the opposition Conservative party and the vast
majority of the business community say a vote against membership would
threaten already low investment flows and weaken the economy in the long
term - but so far a majority of voters are still against joining.
Moreover, the stream of oil and gas revenues that has so boosted Norway over
two decades is expected to start declining at least by the end of the
century.
Norway has already suffered one big oil 'shock', when prices fell
dramatically in 1986. In the space of one year, the oil industry's
contribution shrank from 18.5 per cent of GDP to 11 per cent. Over the
subsequent years, heavy increases in production have pushed the figure back
up to 16 per cent of GDP, but oil production will start to fall in 1996.
Natural gas revenues will help, at least for some years, to meet the
shortfall. But the concern is whether the country's relatively weak non-oil
economy, which is dominated by the public sector, will be strong enough to
fill the gap as output from the petroleum sector starts going down.
These worries have been exacerbated in recent years by a sharp deterioration
in the public finances. An expansionary fiscal policy, adopted by the Labour
government since 1990 to offset the rigours of recession, has led to a
deepening of the state budget deficit (as distinct from the overall
consolidated government deficit) to 12.5 per cent, excluding oil-related
items.
In its latest report on the Norwegian economy, the OECD warned: 'Unless this
deficit problem is addressed, the implications for the future would be a
reduced level of government expenditures or higher taxes relative to GDP.'
The government is well aware of these longer-term difficulties and has set
out, in a 1994-97 programme presented to parliament last year, a strategy
for dealing with them. It is based on a significant tightening of fiscal
policy, a move to hold down transfer payments in favour of infrastructural
investments, and a general shift in emphasis from the public to the private
sector.
Mr Svien Harald Oygard, the senior official at the finance ministry, says
that already the effects of this programme are beginning to be felt. This
year, public expenditure will rise by less than 1 per cent - well below the
levels of GDP growth. The growth in the public sector's share of employment,
which rose from 23 per cent to 30 per cent from 1980 to 1992, is set to
stop.
Low recent wage settlements, a weakening of the value of the Norwegian krona
since it was floated in late 1992 and a steady fall in interest rates over
the past year have helped produce a significant improvement in the
cost-competitiveness of Norwegian industry.
'We feel now that we are achieving growth that has a sounder base, with
further strengthening of our competitiveness and increased investments, and
growth that is better balanced between the public and private sectors,' says
Mr Oygard. 'I believe we will continue with an ambitious incomes policy and
quite a strong tightening of fiscal policy to allow room for a monetary
policy that is not so tight.'
Mr Steinar Juell, chief economist for Christiania Bank, gives the government
credit for so far sticking to its programme to get the public finances under
a tighter rein. But he still sees some warning lights in the longer-term
perspective.
He remains afraid that inflationary pressures will resurface as unemployment
comes down, and is worried by some evidence - such as a smart recovery in
car sales - that private consumption might return to unhealthy levels. It is
estimated to increase by 3 per cent this year.
Although the savings ratio, at more than 5 per cent, is still comfortably
positive - compared with alarmingly negative in the late 1980s - it is once
again falling. 'The turnaround has been much stronger than I had expected,'
says Mr Juell. 'I thought people had longer memories and would be more
careful.'
Mr Juell and the OECD also share worries about the need for further
structural reforms in the economy. Among these are the so-called sheltered
sector of the economy - industries such as agriculture and food-processing -
which are protected by subsidies and import controls.
If Norway votes to join the EU, such protections will have to be
progressively removed. With agricultural assistance making up 77 per cent of
producer income, some 75 per cent more than the OECD average, reforms are
seen as essential in the long term to achieving a competitive and vigorous
agro-industry. But staying outside the EU would remove the incentive to
achieve such changes.
Tackling such issues is a necessary part of preparing the Norwegian economy
for the time when oil revenues decline. 'It is not possible to do that much
(to prepare for the post-oil era) without adopting a centrally-planned
economy. It is therefore all the more important to emphasise the
competitivity of manufacturing industry,' says Mr Juell. 'We must avoid the
mistakes of the 1970s and 1980s. We have to keep wages and inflation under
control and eliminate the budget deficit. Then it will be easier to create
alternative employment.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (2): Protectionism does not help - A
growth economy faces some serious challenges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the international community is full of praise for the Indonesian
government's consistency in sustaining average annual economic growth of 6
per cent over the past 25 years, the cabinet's economic team, which took
over the reins of power in April 1993, faces some serious challenges.
In order to maintain this momentum, the government estimates that it will
need Dollars 305bn in its new five-year development plan, Repelita VI. Some
73 per cent of that must come from the private sector. It is needed to
maintain thecountry's growth momentum.
The economic team must tackle jealously guarded protectionist measures in
some sectors, together with growing concern among some high-ranking
officials that deregulation does little to alleviate the level of poverty.
The economy appeared to be teetering on the edge of a crisis at the
beginning of this year. Foreign debt had reached the worrying Dollars 90bn
mark; inflation was climbing; growth in non-oil exports was slowing down;
the oil price plummeted on international markets and foreign investment
appeared to be levelling out.
At the same time, the government reported a budget deficit of Dollars 8bn
for the fiscal year 1994 .
It had been hit hard by the worldwide slump in oil prices, which sparked off
fears of a sharp one-off devaluation of the Indonesian rupiah, reminiscent
of the 45 per cent devaluation that occurred in 1986. Oil prices have since
climbed back from their year-long lows, so that the government's Dollars
16/barrel oil price assumption for its fiscal 1995 budget appears to be
realistic.
Meanwhile, foreign investment has also picked up. Analysts point to steady
improvements in consumer demand and economic recovery in the developed
countries as factors which could lift Indonesia's economic growth as high as
7 per cent this year, after expanding by 6.7 per cent last year.
The looming crises did, however, bring home Indonesia's sensitivity to
external economic factors. The country's oil exports may only account for a
third of total exports, compared with two thirds at the beginning of the
1980s, but oil revenue is still an important part of the budget. That will
remain the case as long as non-oil exports rely to a large extent on wood
products and textiles. Textile prices slumped by about 25 per cent last
year, accounting for much of 1993's sudden slowdown in growth of non-oil
exports.
What is needed to reduce the country's sensitivity to fluctuating oil prices
is diversification of the non-oil export sector - a difficult feat to
accomplish. Many of the country's most important economic figures are
politically well-connected and have assumed monopolistic roles, protected by
high tariffs.
There is also growing friction at the unequal distribution of wealth in the
country, an issue which economists say is being used as a back door way of
getting at deregulation.
The discrepancies between rich and poor are most striking in the cities,
where luxury shopping malls, selling the latest western fashions at
extravagant prices, tower over beggars and street vendors ekeing out a
miserable existence. President Suharto is credited with reducing by
two-thirds the number of people living in poverty since he took power in
1967. 'There is great sensitivity to distribution of wealth in many very
high quarters,' says a Jakarta-based economist.
The Indonesian government has been introducing deregulation packages
regularly since the mid-1980s, but while deregulation of foreign investment
has been relatively easy to push through, deregulating trade has been
troublesome.
'A lot of export potential remains untapped,' the Jakarta-based economist
says. 'There needs to be further deregulation but this has been met with a
lot of resistance in the government, particularly deregulation of the
agricultural sector, because this area of the economy delivers huge sources
of rent to key economic players.'
The latest deregulation package on foreign investment, introduced on June 2,
was welcomed by economists and analysts who predict that it will
significantly improve Indonesia's investment climate relative to competitors
for foreign funds such as China, India and Vietnam.
The move was well-timed. The minimum wage was raised by 46 per cent at the
beginning of this year and it would be unwise to scare off labour-intensive
industries while there are 2.5m people entering the work force every year.
Easing restrictions on exports is proving more difficult, although
economists estimate that high tariffs and protectionist measures could be
costing the economy as much as 2 per cent in annual economic growth. These
high rates of protection raise the costs of raw materials, and therefore
production costs, for many local producers. Competing on international
markets under these conditions is impossible.
The problem is deep-rooted - some of the industries in question are
controlled by President Suharto's family and friends. Economists point to
the petrochemical sector, where last year the government introduced a 25 per
cent import tariff on polypropylene resin accompanied by a 30-40 per cent
import tariff on the plastic films with which resin is made.
In the agricultural sector, import tariffs help maintain an artificially
high price for sugar, which in turn hampers the development of an
export-oriented food processing sector. The problem extends to the pulp and
paper industry, where frustrated paper users formed an association to lobby
the government.
Despite dire warnings about the consequences of high levels of
protectionism, the lobby - which includes publishers and printing companies
 -has had little success so far. Mr Fauzi Lubis, chairman of the Indonesian
Printing Company Association, was quoted recently in the national press as
saying: 'Out of the country's 100 notebook manufacturers, only nine are
still operating.'
Donors and government technocrats are equally concerned at the high cost of
heavy industry projects being undertaken by Mr B J Habibie, the minister of
technology and research, at a time when the government is struggling to
balance its fiscal 1995 budget. Mr Habibie's eagerness to develop aircraft
manufacturing, car and nuclear power industries has caused a storm of
controversy, reflecting the policy struggles taking place between
technologists and technocrats in government.
Although analysts recognise Mr Habibie's efforts in fostering a
highly-trained work force, they argue that it is impossible to leap-frog to
development through technical wizardry.
If the growth of non-oil exports does not pick up and the current account
deficit continues to grow hand in hand with foreign debt, the government's
technocrats will certainly gain the upper hand. In the meantime they face
the unenviable task of battling with well-connected business monopolies and
cash-hungry state enterprises.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (3): This year looks rosier - Manuela
Saragosa looks at foreign investment
</HEADLINE>

After years of hearing complaints about restrictions on foreign investment,
the government has at last greatly reduced the limits, in order to increase
the flow of funds into the country. At the beginning of June the government
decided to scrap rules stipulating that foreign companies must reduce their
stakes in joint ventures to a minority shareholding after 20 years of
operation.
Moreover, it announced that it would open up sectors as diverse as
telecommunications, civil aviation, nuclear power, electricity, and seaports
to partial foreign ownership - all previously barred.
It was necessary. With 2.5m people a year entering the Indonesian workforce,
to say nothing of a 46 per cent rise in the minimum wage at the beginning of
this year, and increased competition for foreign funds from neighbouring
Asian countries, Indonesia had to take action to improve its investment
climate.
Deregulation had assumed a sense of urgency. Many Japanese investors have
been operating in Indonesia since the mid-1970s; their investment licences
were coming up for renewal. Under the old regulations they faced becoming
minority shareholders. Officials say that some Japanese companies were
threatening to pull out of Indonesia altogether.
The latest deregulation package 'was very, very big news for us,' says Mr
Yohsuke Udaka, director of PT Teijin Indonesia Fiber. He says it will
increase Indonesia's appeal to foreign investors and also strengthen his
company's argument to expand their activities in Indonesia.
Nevertheless, the five-year tax holidays which are offered to foreign
companies setting up shop in China, together with Indonesia's high interest
rates and bureaucratic hold-ups, may continue to convince some investors
that they should move elsewhere. 'We realise we have competitors,' says Mr
Asril Noer, director of overseas promotion at the Investment Co-ordinating
Board (BKPM). 'Developing countries have to compete for foreign investment.
Many are trying to make their investment climate more attractive than
others. But so are we.'
The latest deregulation package, however, had to tackle some stiff
opposition. Ministers initially decreed that the media sector would be open
to foreigners - but that decision was quickly squashed after an outcry from
Mr Harmoko, the minister of information, who complained that opening up the
media to foreign ownership threatened the country's national integrity.
President Suharto assured Mr Harmoko that any foreign ownership of the media
sector would be illegal.
The event demonstrated that nationalism is still an effective instrument in
thwarting attempts at deregulation. But it neither surprised nor
disappointed investors, who say that any benefits derived from investing in
Indonesian media are outweighed by the risks.
Meanwhile, foreign investors are still digesting other points in the latest
deregulation package which so far have remained uncontested.
They include extending foreign companies' operating licences to 30 years
from 20 years, and abolishing regional restrictions and a minimum capital
requirement of Dollars 50m on full foreign ownership. All have been hailed
as important breakthroughs - at the right time. Last year foreign direct
investment in Indonesia, excluding oil and gas exploration, showed an
unexpected drop to Dollars 8.4 bn from Dollars 10.3 bn a year earlier. Mr
Noer at the Investment Co-ordinating Board blames last year's drop on the
recession in Japan, Indonesia's largest foreign investor.
But things look rosier this year. According to the latest statistics from
the Investment Co-ordinating Board, foreign direct investment totalled a
healthy Dollars 5.03bn by mid-May. But the figures must be treated with
caution, because historically only about half of approved foreign projects
by value are implemented.
Companies complain about the bureaucratic obstacles they bump into when
doing business in Indonesia. They protest that the country's legal system
does not provide adequate protection, especially in anti-dumping
legislation. Getting approval for an investment project is long and arduous,
although steps have been taken to speed up the process. Once that is
overcome, some investors complain that they have problems getting raw
materials into the country because customs officials hold them to ransom.
And they find it impossible to work the tax rebate system. 'The problem is
that the bureaucracy tends to divert the good intentions of ministers,' says
a disenchanted investor.
Mr Noer at the Investment Co-ordinating Board points out that despite
complaints, applications keep rolling in. Ministers, meanwhile, have
indicated that they will not become complacent.
'We are discussing the next deregulation package,' says Mr Saleh Afiff,
co-ordinating minister for economic and financial affairs. 'Many other
things have to be done.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (1): A confident nation is wary of change -
Polls suggest that most people disagree with the government over EU
membership. Hugh Carnegy and Karen Fossli examine the pre-referendum mood.

<TEXT>
Norway's Labour government is poised this summer like a ski-jumper in
mid-air, whose perfect take-off could yet end in a painful crash landing.
Under the leadership of Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, one of Europe's most
experienced prime ministers, Labour has skilfully prepared the way for the
country at last to join the European Union - along with its fellow Efta
(European Free Trade Area) members, Austria, Finland and Sweden - on January
1.
Labour, although a minority administration, is virtually unchallenged in
power after strengthening its position in the Storting (parliament) in last
September's general election. After long and difficult negotiations, it
concluded an accession treaty with the EU in March, which even many sceptics
within Labour welcomed as a good deal.
In the meantime, the mood of the nation has rarely exuded such
self-confidence. The oil-boosted economy is on the up after several
laggardly years, and is set to grow by up to 4 per cent this year - one of
the fastest rates in Europe. Great pride was generated last autumn when it
was revealed that Norway had secretly helped two of the world's most bitter
foes - Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation - to reach an
historic peace accord.
Earlier this year, Norwegians revelled in the international praise the
country won for its impressive organisation of the Winter Olympics at
Lillehammer and celebrated a record haul of gold medals by its athletes. To
cap an unprecedented year for a nation devoted to sports, the Norwegian
football team qualified for the world cup finals for the first time since
the war.
But for Mrs Brundtland and her government, these are mere diversions: the
real test lies ahead in the shape of a referendum on EU membership, on
Monday, November 28.
Despite several years' unequivocal advocacy of membership by Mrs Brundtland
(and most of the business community), opposition to joining remains deeply
entrenched in Norway. Opinion polls have for months consistently shown the
No camp with a majority of up to 56 per cent. Even many top politicians and
government officials privately doubt whether they can turn opinion around in
time.
Memories of 1972, when Norwegians voted down a proposal to join the European
Community, destroying the Labour government of the day, are vivid as Mrs
Brundtland seeks to avoid a crash landing in November.
The No campaign revolves round the widespread perception that EU membership
involves a significant erosion of national sovereignty, will threaten the
country's control over its cherished natural resources - especially oil and
fish - and mean an end to Norway's long-standing policy of encouraging
people to remain in the far-flung northern communities through heavy
agricultural and regional subsidies.
These arguments proved decisive in 1972 and are hardly less potent now, in a
country which only won its independence from Sweden in 1905 and suffered
occupation by the Nazis during the second world war.
Opposition in parliament is led by the rurally-based Centre party, which,
under the charismatic leadership of Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein, stormed to
become the second largest party in the general election on the back of its
fierce anti-EU stance. Outside the Storting, opposition is grouped under the
well-organised 'No to the EU' campaign.
'Our side is much more enthusiastic - the Yes side is finding it very
difficult to generate any momentum,' says Mr Johan J. Jakobsen, leader of
the Centre party's Storting group. 'They are badly organised, while all the
No groups have accepted that the No-to-the-EU movement co-ordinates all
opposition activities.'
Faced with this unpromising outlook, Mrs Brundtland has by no means been
idle. Working closely with Mr Thorbjoern Jaglund, who took over as official
Labour leader in 1992, she has managed to keep the party together under a
pro-EU policy, despite the presence of a large anti-EU Labour faction.
Above all, the government achieved an accession accord with Brussels which
was sufficient to ensure that senior ministers like Mr Jan Henry Olsen, the
fisheries minister, and Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, the foreign minister, who were
in the No camp in 1972, are now firmly behind Norwegian membership.
Norway made minimum concessions on allowing EU fishing boats more access to
Norwegian waters, and maintained Olso's full control over fish resources in
its northern waters until 1998. The deal requires little change in Oslo's
control of oil concessions and its ownership of the national oil company
Statoil. Norway's heavily subsidised farmers will have to adjust to much
lower EU farm prices, but will be cushioned by transition funds. Norway will
keep its stringent environmental regulations and its state monopoly of
alcohol retailing.
With the detail of the accession terms settled, the government - backed on
the issue by the opposition Hoyre, or Conservative, party - could switch its
campaign to the chief motivation for joining the Union: Norway's desire to
be a partner in an organisation seen as shaping the economic and political
future of Europe. 'Norway has a natural place in this forum,' insists Mrs
Brundtland.
This, however, is proving a difficult case to make in a prosperous country,
which has long been satisfied with the security afforded by membership of
Nato and already has most of the economic benefits of full EU membership
through its participation in the European Economic Area agreement with
Brussels.
Recognising this, the government deliberately engineered a sequence by which
Norway will vote last on the issue - after Austria (which confirmed its
entry in a referendum earlier this month), Finland and Sweden. Opinion polls
show clearly that the best chance of winning a Yes vote in Norway is if
Finland and especially Sweden vote Yes in their respective referendums on
October 16 and November 13.
The irony of letting Sweden, Norway's former ruler, effectively decide the
issue is not lost on many Norwegians. The No camp still believes it can win
even if Sweden votes Yes.
A No vote would be a huge blow to Mrs Brundtland, who has made EU membership
something of a personal mission. Her government would also be badly wounded,
having invested so much in the belief that it can turn opinion around. The
opposition parties, though themselves deeply split, would doubtless seek a
repeat of 1972 when prime minister Trygve Bratteli resigned.
But Mrs Brundtland insists this will not happen. 'The Labour party is
prepared to continue in power in the event of a No vote in the referendum,'
she told the FT (see page 3 of this survey). 'The country needs stable
leadership and firm government, and in the current political situation, the
Labour party is the only political force that can provide this.'
Its policy under this 'second best solution', she said, would be 'to build
on our membership of Nato, our associate membership of the WEU (Western
European Union) and on the EEA agreement.' A No vote is expected to have
little economic effect. But the pro-EU side fears a longer-term drain on
investment in the Norwegian economy, which could seriously damage the
country as it begins to face the prospect of a decline in oil and gas
earnings after the turn of the century.
This year, the economy looks stronger than for some time. The annual
inflation rate is below 1 per cent. The current account is in surplus, and
the central government deficit is set to decline. Unemployment, at an
historically high 6 per cent for Norway, is stabilising.
But the economy has a core structural weakness in the narrowness of its
non-oil manufacturing base, which the government and independent economists
agree must be addressed. A decision to stay out of the EU would be a
short-term relief to sheltered sectors such as the food processing industry.
But in the longer term, much needed investment, to increase the volume of
value-added production in Norway, could be jeopardised.

Indonesia is a stable country with a steadily-growing economy. Uncertainty,
however, now surrounds the succession

With President Suharto at the helm of power over the past 27 years,
stability has been the predominant characteristic of Indonesian politics and
economics.
Now in his sixth term as president, however, Mr Suharto is giving
increasingly frequent hints that he plans to make this term his last as head
of state - although he remains as reluctant as ever to name a successor.
Like the traditional wayang, a theatrical performance where shadow images
are held in front of back-lit screens, Indonesian politics is not
transparent and nothing is clear-cut. It is difficult to gauge Mr Suharto's
intentions, as it is certainly not the first time since he took power that
he has hinted that he may step down.
And yet Indonesians are attaching more significance now to suggestions that
he is planning an exit than they have done in the past. Mr Suharto will be
77 when his term ends in 1998 and there are signs that the jockeying for
power has already begun.
The uncertainty is making some investors jittery. Perhaps in recognition of
this, during the last year Mr Suharto has opened the doors just a little to
demands for increased political openness, although direct criticism of his
family's wide-ranging business interests and monopolies remains off limits
in the domestic press.
It will require some skill to balance stability with openness.
Indonesia is a huge country. Its 13,000 islands extend 5,000 km from one end
to the other and its 187 million inhabitants include hundreds of different
ethnic groupings and make it the fourth most heavily populated country in
the world.
The labour riots in the northern Sumatran town of Medan earlier this year,
where demonstrators ran amok, protesting against their ethnic Chinese
employers' unwillingness to adhere to a 46 per cent increase in the minimum
wage, reminded many people of how things can go wrong.
The ethnic Chinese are estimated to control some three quarters of
Indonesian private capital - although they make up only a tiny 2 per cent of
the country's population - and they are resented on this account.
Indonesia's ethnic Chinese, after years of being criticised for dominating
local businesses, are now being scorned for investing in China instead of
Indonesia, although much of the money channelled to projects in China is
already held offshore in Hong Kong or Singapore.
That criticism comes after domestic and foreign investment declined last
year amid stiff competition for foreign funds in neighbouring Asian
countries. According to Mr Hartarto, the co-ordinating minister for trade
and industry, deregulation of the economy has taken on a sense of urgency.
'We have to change,' he says.
Change is taking place. In June this year a radical deregulation package for
foreign investment was introduced and a trade deregulation package will
follow.
The government has said it needs Dollars 300bn to meet its investment
requirements, both domestic and foreign, for its new five-year development
plan - the sixth of its kind.
More than two-thirds of that total will have to come from the private
sector. An increase in investment is also needed to maintain the momentum of
growth in the economy - growth which has averaged 6 per cent a year over the
past 25 years.
The latest deregulation package comes on the heels of one of the biggest
corruption scandals in Indonesia's history since independence, as the drive
for political openness prompted Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, the minister of finance
in President Suharto's cabinet, to expose the extent of bad loans at state
banks.
The Bapindo banking scandal, which involved an ethnic Chinese businessman
defaulting on loans received on recommendations made by former cabinet
ministers, did little to help investors' confidence in the country -
although the revelations have highlighted Mr Muhammad's commitment to
cleaning up the state banking sector.
None the less, this corruption case is symbolic of the problems that beset
the Indonesian economy.
Foreign investors say they must struggle against a stubborn bureaucracy and
against corruption. These handicaps have earned Indonesia a reputation for
having some of the highest hidden business costs in Asia.
Government officials do not deny that there is a problem, but they promise
that deregulation packages, scheduled to appear in the near future, will
deal with it.
Another economic policy issue is the debate hotting up in the Indonesian
government between 'technocrats' and 'technologists'.
Technocrats, who have steered Indonesia's economy down a path of export-led
growth, are constantly battling with technologists, who are led by the
country's enthusiastic minister for research and technology, Mr B J Habibie.
Technocrats want to maintain austere budgetary policies after the budget
deficit widened significantly last year. Technologists want the state to
pump billions of dollars into heavy industry projects - such as, for
example, aircraft manufacturing - which critics say are not making adequate
commercial returns.
At the same time, there is growing concern that the benefits of export-led
economic growth are not filtering down to the country's poor, an argument
sometimes used to thwart attempts at deregulating the economy.
President Suharto, the self-proclaimed 'father of development', is credited
with greatly reducing levels of poverty since he came to power. Yet
discrepancies in wealth in the cities, and the gap in average income between
the more prosperous islands of Java and Bali and the out-lying islands, is
of growing importance to many government ministers.
This concern, together with nationalists' fears that an open economy will
lead to too much foreign domination, could be forceful enough to limit
further deregulation measures. The latest foreign investment deregulation
package was well-received in the business community, but an attempt to
deregulate the media sector was immediately squashed after outcries from
nationalist quarters.
The non-oil export sector, however, needs the deregulation in order to
diversify and become less sensitive to swings in world demand and prices.
Last year the non-oil export sector showed a slowdown in growth.
There is a sense of urgency about this, because Indonesia's economy is
burdened with growing private and public foreign debt.
Exacerbated by the recent weakness of the US dollar, the country's foreign
debt is now estimated to be between Dollars 90bn and Dollars 100bn. In the
meantime, economists question whether the borrowed money is being used
productively to generate the exports needed to pay it off.
It is against this background that ministers are positioning themselves in
case President Suharto does decide to make this term in office his last.
There are many who aspire to his position, but few who are likely to meet
the stringent requirements.
First, if Mr Suharto's successor is to survive, he must be accepted and
approved by the military.
Second, it is impossible to imagine the world's largest Moslem country under
the leadership of anyone but a Moslem.
Third, he must be someone accepted in the international community,
especially in the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) in which
Indonesia is a very active member.
Because President Suharto is unwilling to prompt any premature power
struggles, he is unlikely to hand out any clues.

FT  24 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Unigate gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Milk producer Unigate firmed as rumours over the possible sale of its stake
in Dutch group Nutricia resurfaced. Unigate has a 34 per cent shareholding
in the baby food manufacturer, most of which it gained when it sold
Nutricia, its Cow and Gate food business, in 1981.
Speculation over Unigate's next move has featured intermittently in the
stock market ever since, with some suggestions that the UK group might at
some stage be considering a full bid.
However, yesterday's talk favoured a disposal and the shares gained 3 at
366p. Heinz, of the US, Swiss group Nestle and Germany's Altana were being
linked with the gossip which, if true, would most likely be followed by a
full bid. Analysts estimated the stake's worth at around Pounds 250m.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel lost a strong early advance to end a
penny off at 278p. The group reported a 67.7 per cent take-up of the UK part
of its Pounds 858m rights issue.
A quiet day's trading in Thorn EMI followed the release of the MMC inquiry
into compact disc prices, which dealers said had already been discounted in
the shares. The report cleared the record companies of collusion, a result
which had been widely leaked to the market several weeks ago. Thorn also
announced after the market closed that it had reached agreement on the sale
of its defence business to Thomson-CSF, of France.
Analysts said the long-awaited disposal would hasten the demerger of the
leisure group into its music and rental constituents. The shares eased 2 to
1043p.
First Leisure slid a further 10 to 279p following results on Wednesday
considered by the market as mildly disappointing. But the continued weakness
led some specialists to the belief that the shares could be undergoing a
rerating.
Grand Metropolitan retreated 15 to 390p on 6.7m traded as Smith New Court
trimmed its 1995 profits forecast from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 957m.
Clearing bank TSB fell 9 to 211p after reporting half-year profits of Pounds
226m, up from Pounds 80m previously and in line with market forecasts. TSB
also confirmed market speculation that it intends to buy a big building
society.
Engineering group ML Holdings rose 4 to 45p after several brokers upgraded
current year profits expectations following the group's return to profit. It
reported profits of Pounds 5.2m, against an Pounds 11.2m loss in the
previous year.
A Rolls-Royce presentation to analysts and institutions in the City
generated little enthusiasm for the stock, which finished a penny softer at
181p after trade of 7.2m.
Business services group BET firmed a penny to 115p after NatWest Securities
turned more positive on the stock. NatWest said: 'With the risk factor much
reduced, and personnel and textile rental sensitive to improving employment
trends, we can no longer be negative on the stock.'
Results from Southern Electric were at the top end of market forecasts and
the shares ran up 6 to 559p.
There were mixed fortunes for four new stocks. Book publishers Bloomsbury
Publications came to the market at 105p and was bought up to 110p, while VCI
slid 9 to 141p. Property agency Chesterton fell 3 1/2 from its issue price
to close at 100 1/2 p. Fragrance house CPL Aromas ended the session 10 ahead
at 160p.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: UAL's low-cost division to start
flying in October
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, yesterday stepped up the US air
fare war by announcing that its new unnamed low-cost subsidiary would start
flying on October 1.
It said the specialised short-haul carrier would take to the skies with an
initial daily schedule of 82 flights spread among 14 routes on the West
Coast of the US. It declined to specify the routes, but said seven were
served by United and seven were not.
Services would be expanded rapidly to 129 flights in November and to 143
flights in December. Fares would be announced later, but would be 'very
attractive', UAL said.
United's plans for the new airline, dubbed U-2, depend on shareholder
approval of its plan to give employees a 55 per cent controlling stake in
the parent company in exchange for Dollars 4.9bn-worth of labour
concessions. The vote is due on July 12.
At least one big institutional investor has said it would vote against the
plan. However, if approved, the labour concessions will provide United with
the cost structure it needs to fight back against other low-cost carriers
such as Southwest Airlines.
United said in addition to low fares, its new operation would feature
intensive use of Boeing 737 aircraft with fast turnrounds. But unlike
Southwest, it plans to offer first-class as well as economy class, seat
assignments at the airport, and in-flight food and drink.
United will be the second of the big US carriers to set up a low-cost
airline-within-an-airline to compete with smaller low-cost carriers. The
first was Continental Airlines with its CALite operation. A third big
carrier, Delta Air Lines, has rejected the idea in favour of all-round cost
cutting.

FT  24 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical group Wellcome was dragged down with the market, but one
leading US analyst was telling clients that the UK company could be the next
target for a signif-icant merger or takeover in the sector.
Dr Jonathan Gelles of Wertheim Schroder believes the US holding in Wellcome,
officially about 3.6 per cent, has doubled in the past month. The
performance of the shares reflects buying interest, probably from the US.
Wellcome has outperformed the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index by 9.5 per
cent, and the sector by more than 5 per cent, since the start of June.
Dr Gelles argues that Wellcome Trust, which still controls 40 per cent of
the company, is only interested in maximising profits in order to further
research and would be quite happy to see a merger or acquisition. He
believes the company has a take-out value equivalent to about 900p a share.
Yesterday the shares retreated 16 to 586p.

FT  24 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph plunges on price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Publishing stocks pre-empted the weakness in the London stock market as The
Telegraph saw its shares sold heavily after joining battle in the price war
started by the Murdoch newspaper group.
The stock touched a low of 340p and closed 191 down at 349p with 6.3m shares
traded, one of its biggest daily turnovers since flotation at 325p a share
two years ago.
The Telegraph decision to cut its weekday cover price to 30p from 48p and
the accompanying statement that revenue would fall by Pounds 40m this year
sent analysts scurrying to lower their forecasts for this year and next. And
news that The Times is to reduce its price further, announced after the
market closed, is likely to cause further turmoil in the sector today.
It also marked a significant scaling up of the price battle in the UK
newspaper industry and consequently sent shares in United Newspapers, owners
of the Daily Express, down 83 to 510p, Daily Mail Trust 178 lower to 1275p
and Mirror Group Newspapers, which not only has a big stake in the
Independent but is also suffering the effects of the price cut by Mr
Murdoch's Sun newspaper, down 31 to 134p with 14m shares changing hands.
The Stock Exchange is believed to have launched a full inquiry into the
Telegraph share trading. In particular, the exchange will be looking very
closely at when the company first began to consider cutting its newspaper
cover price. A month ago, Hollinger, the Canadian company controlled by
Telegraph owner Mr Conrad Black, offloaded 12.5m Telegraph shares at 587p,
and under Stock Exchange rules a company cannot deal in its shares if it has
undisclosed price-sensitive information.
Ms Lorna Tilbian of SG Warburg said: 'All hell will break loose. You cannot
place a stake on May 19 and have a price war on June 23.' Ms Tilbian cut her
current year Telegraph profits forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 47.5m and
her estimate for next year by Pounds 22.5m to the same figure.

FT  24 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued worries about inflation brought heavy selling in Footsie futures,
helping to reverse an advance in the cash market, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened firmly at 2,988, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 fell
on inflation worries to trade around the 2,880 level for the next few hours.
The lunchtime release of stronger than anticipated US durable goods data
brought renewed fears of an increase in interest rates. Futures traders sold
the contract heavily, with independent traders (locals), together with a
leading US investment bank, noted as active participants in the trading. The
strong downward pressure was soon having an impact on the cash market and
after initial resistance it too buckled under the selling pressure,
reversing an early advance.
The contract traded at a discount to the underlying market for a large part
of the session.
September ended at 2,935, down 33 from the previous day's close and at a
20-point discount to its fair value premium to cash of about 13 points.
Volume was 15,580.
It was a dull day in the traded options sector and turnover was 24,025
contracts, against a previous 33,792 lots. The FT-SE 100 option only saw
business of 9,236 contracts. British Gas was the busiest stock option with
2,627 contracts traded.

FT  24 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sell-off in futures undermines
initial advance - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market suddenly developed a mind of its own yesterday
afternoon, reversing an early advance to fall sharply in the direction of
the year's lows. Weakness in UK shares contrasted with firmness in other
markets, including the British government bonds sector.
In early afternoon, the FT-SE 100 Index dipped to 2,936.5, a fall of nearly
24 points and within 5 points of the closing low recorded at the beginning
of this month.
The turnround from the 19-point gain at the market opening coincided with
news that US durable goods had risen by a potentially inflationary 0.9 per
cent in May; but traders also referred to general nervousness ahead of
publication today of the UK government White Paper on the pensions industry,
which some analysts fear may urge that funds increase weighting in bond
markets.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,942.4 for a loss on the day of
18 points. Although trading in equities increased, the selling pressure came
through the stock index futures markets, where two large sellers, one of
whom, at least, was a US firm, drove the September contract on the Footsie
to a substantial discount and undermined the stock market.
Selling was not confined to the Footsie list but spread across the full
range of the market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index declined 24.3 to 3,436.9.
However, non-Footsie stocks made up only about 45 per cent of the day's Seaq
total of 540.2m shares; on Wednesday, 463.3m shares were traded through
Seaq, for a retail, or customer, value of Pounds 1.3bn, a return to healthy
profitable levels of equity trading for the London-based securities
industry.
At first, UK shares followed trends in European bond and stock markets,
moving higher as the US dollar steadied in response to the assurances
overnight from President Clinton and the US trade secretary that the US
currency would be defended. But London equities appeared to part company
with other markets in the second half of the session.
An outstanding feature was the collapse of shares in The Telegraph, together
with losses in other UK newspaper shares, as a sharp cut in the Telegraph
cover price indicated a significant upgrading of the UK press circulation
war sparked off by price cuts by the Murdoch group publications. The
Telegraph share price fell by about one third and the London Stock Exchange
announced an inquiry into share dealings.
There was also a fall in Mirror Group Newspapers, head-on rival with the
Murdoch tabloids and also the new owner of The Independent, which also
reduced its cover price, albeit for only one day.
Eurotunnel advanced at first in spite of some disappointment with the
take-up of only 67.7 per cent of the rights issue. The stock lost its gain
before the close and traders commented that the share price would be
vulnerable to any further shakeout in equity markets.
London's concentration on its own concerns masked developments elsewhere.
But strategists said that the clouds remain over the outlook for the US
dollar and that markets would continue to look for more decisive action on
the US currency than indicated by the US trade secretary.
Some investors had hoped for a cut in key rates from the Bundesbank
yesterday and there was some disappointment when the German central bank
made no move on its discount or Lombard rates.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Technology issues push Dow
lower

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US technology stocks resumed their downward slide yesterday, depressing the
Dow Jones Industrial Average and sending the Nasdaq composite into a
tailspin, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow finished 25.68 off at 3,699.09, its lowest level since May 17, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 3.46 at 449.63. New
York SE activity remained moderate, volume amounting to 256.5m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite shed 1.97 to 431.25,
while the Nasdaq composite suffered its third big setback in four sessions,
dropping 11.89 to 700.85, now more than 100 points off its March zenith.
There was no solid news to trigger the renewed weakness in the computer
sector. It appeared to be a continuing reaction to Lotus Development's
profits warning earlier in the week. However, some analysts said SoundView
Financial Group's downgrading of Cisco Systems, a computer networking
concern, was the catalyst.
With relative calm returning to the foreign exchange markets, equity
investors had attempted to build on Wednesday's solid advance. The dollar
was helpful, climbing above Y101 on speculation that central banks were
preparing to intervene to support the US currency. The rescue mission did
not materialise but the dollar held firm nevertheless.
Bonds were supported early in the day by developments in the foreign
exchange markets. The day's economic news was not uniformly positive but
neither did it seem to present any obstacles.
The Commerce Department said orders of durable goods had risen by 0.9 per
cent in May, against expectations of a 0.4 per cent gain, but most of the
overall increase came from a rise in aircraft orders.
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported an increase of 3,000 in claims for
unemployment benefit last week, while economists had expected a slight
decline.
Both sets of data pointed to a moderating growth rate which, on balance, is
positive for equity investors hoping that the Federal Reserve will delay its
next move to lift interest rates until late summer.
Still, stocks appeared to be in a holding pattern, with the activity in
bonds or currencies, and the fresh economic data, failing to generate either
excitement or disappointment. The blue chips were showing moderate gains by
mid-morning, but tailed off as the afternoon began, mirroring a slow, steady
erosion of the bond market's early gains.
However, by mid-afternoon, technology issues had clearly broken into
retreat. On the Nasdaq, Lotus shed a further 7.38 per cent, or Dollars 2 5/8
, to close at Dollars 33 3/4 , while Microsoft declined Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 50 1/8 and Wellfleet Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 21 1/4 . Cisco fell
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 21.
On the Big Board, Micron Technology lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 31 1/4 ,
Texas Instruments Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 74 1/8 and IBM Dollars 1 to
Dollars 61.
In takeover news, the aborted battle for Kemper pushed the insurance
company's share price up Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 , a new 52-week
high. The trading followed an offer by Conseco to buy the company for
Dollars 67 a share in cash and stock, and the subsequent withdrawal of a
Dollars 60 a share cash bid by GE Capital, a General Electric subsidiary.
Canada
Toronto finished weaker after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index fell 17.6
to 4,034.5 and declining issues outnumbered advances by 426 to 336. Most of
the index's decline came in the final hour of trading. Turnover totalled
54.2m shares.
Nine of the 14 stock groups lost ground. The transportation sector led the
way down, dropping 1.99 per cent. Industrial products and energy were off
1.07 and 1.02 per cent respectively.
Hollinger retreated CDollars 1 3/4 to CDollars 14 3/8 on news that the
London Stock Exchange was investigating a 34 per cent fall in the shares of
its UK newspaper subsidiary, The Telegraph plc, after the company cut the
price of the Daily Telegraph.
Brazil
Sao Paulo closed 1.83 per cent down in local currency terms in thin volume
after investors stayed on the sidelines and traders worried about today's
performance.
Brokers said the US stock market's fall yesterday afternoon, coupled with
concern about volatility in the dollar and a lack of local news, kept
investors out of the market.
The Bovespa index lost 586 points at 31,400, after having risen in the
morning session to 32,734. Volume was low at Cr454.5bn (Dollars 181.9m).

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei up 2.2% as region
remains cautious
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The easing of the yen against the dollar and the parliamentary approval of
this year's budget encouraged sentiment. The Nikkei 225 average jumped 2.2
per cent, topping the 21,000 level for the first time in three days, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index gained 458.89 at 21,040.21 after a day's low of 20,637.43 and high
of 21,068.01, recouping part of a 4.2 per cent fall seen during the previous
three days. Arbitrage buying and purchases by financial institutions pushed
shares higher, absorbing a steady flow of selling by arbitrageurs closing
their positions.
Investors welcomed the decline in the yen from its record high against the
dollar, and comments from US and Japanese authorities aiming to halt the
volatility. The long-awaited passage of the budget for the current year also
boosted investor confidence. Construction shares gained support on
expectations of new public works spending.
Meanwhile, comments by the Socialist party, which had split from the
coalition last April, hinting that it might rejoin the government, also
heightened hopes that a general election this summer could be averted. The
opposition Liberal Democratic party proposed a vote of no confidence
yesterday against the current administration, but this cannot be passed
unless the Socialist party co-operates.
The Topix index of all first section stocks climbed 32.27 to 1,681.24 and
the Nikkei 300 rose 6.79 to 306.07. Gains outscored declines by 991 to 107,
with 101 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.28
to 1,369.44.
Volume totalled 390.8m shares, against 495m. Newly established investment
funds were also buyers, but some investors remained inactive due to
continued nervousness in the currency market.
Domestic investors were buying blue chip manufacturers, including steels and
shipbuilders. Mitsubishi Heavy was the most active issue of the day, rising
Y18 to Y792, and Kawasaki Steel put on Y11 at Y411.
Mitsubishi Oil, which rose earlier in the week on reports that the company
had discovered oil in Vietnam, eased Y10 to Y1,040 on profit-taking.
High-technology issues, which have been battered by the recent surge in the
yen, rebounded. Hitachi rallied Y20 to Y1,040 and Sony Y50 to Y6,120.
Automobile companies were also higher, with Mitsubishi Motors up Y11 to
Y972.
In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 362.38 to 23,321.57 in volume of 37.4m
shares.
Roundup
Activity was thin in all major Asian markets, concern on the US interest
rates making investors cautious.
HONG KONG closed higher on the firmer US dollar, the Hang Seng index
improving 89.95 to 8,966.79. Turnover was light at HKDollars 2.81bn.
Hopes of agreement in Sino-British negotiations on financing of the new Hong
Kong airport helped the market; overseas investors were cautious, awaiting
direction on US interest rates.
Asia Securities soared 14.3 per cent to HKDollars 2.40 on speculation that
the stock exchange might grant the company a waiver from the rules demanding
that at least 25 per cent of its shares be held by the public.
KUALA LUMPUR closed lower as election rumours died. The KLSE composite index
slid 11.93 to 1,003.50 in volume of 160m shares.
SYDNEY was volatile on a nervous bond market and a weak Australian dollar,
the All Ordinaries index finishing 11.6 better at 2,022.5 but off the day's
high of 2,034.2. Turnover was ADollars 579.0m.
WELLINGTON saw signs of recovery in good volume. Turnover was quite high at
NZDollars 55m, and forestry stocks were the main beneficiaries as the
NZSE-40 index moved forward 30.49, or 1.5 per cent, to 2,060.1.
JAKARTA drifted lower in thin volume which shrank to only 7.4m shares worth
Rp38.6bn. The official index was finally 2.17 down at 470.96.
BOMBAY's 30-Share index fell 66.42 to 4,257.2. The market leader, Associated
Cement, reported a 12 per cent drop in profits and the shares receded Rs140
to Rs4,100.
MANILA closed firmer for the second day in succession after a nine-day fall,
the composite index gaining 6.20 at 2,822.15. PLDT continued to rise,
closing five pesos better at 1,700, but overall volume fell sharply to
654.3m shares, from 1.15bn on the day before.
KARACHI stocks ended easier in trade thinned by a threatened 'strike' by
business and industry this week against higher taxes in the budget. The KSE
100-share index dipped 8.0 to 2,342.69.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa fails to find spur
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg was mixed as the generally improved mood following Wednesday's
nat-ional budget was countered by a lower gold bullion price.
Trading was slow, as the package failed to spur a hoped-for recovery in
demand, particularly by foreign investors.
A stronger rand hampered export-oriented companies, especially gold mining
issues, after bullion's softer showing undermined prices in the sector. The
overall index finished 17 softer at 5,688, industrials firmed 4 to 6,586 and
golds lost 21 at 2,222.
De Beers retrieved an early fall to end unchanged at R113.75. Anglos shed 50
cents to R238 and JCI R1 to R105.
Iscor collected 5 cents at R3.63, adding to its 9-cent advance registered on
Wednesday. SAB was steady at R91.

<TEXT>
Shares in Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn Lebanese company created to develop
central Beirut, opened the first day of trading yesterday at Dollars 111, an
11 per cent premium to the issue price, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo.
The secondary market in Solidere stock, which will be the foundation of a
revived Beirut bourse, opened under the auspices of the Societe Financiere
du Liban, owned by Lebanon's commercial banks.
The Solidere price was agreed at a morning fix, under a trading system
developed by Andersen Consultants.
Around 100 shares were traded as investors tested the market.
A second daily price fix will be introduced on Monday and a third soon
thereafter. Trading is currently limited to 'B' shares, which were issued in
an offer to Arab investors late last year. Trade in 'A' shares, which
Solidere exchanged for titles to land in central Beirut, will open only once
the final allocation has been decided - a process still undergoing a
judicial review.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourse recovery, but dollar
fears revive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar had a better day in Europe but renewed US fears of currency
weakness, after continental market hours, sent brokers pensively home,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT tried to move on the news, or the absence of it, retreating from
its highs after the Bundesbank announced that it would leave key interest
rates unchanged for at least the next two weeks. The Dax index rose 27.68 to
2,022.10 on the session after a high of 2,038.54.
In the afternoon the bund future reacted by half a point after its earlier
gains, said Mr Jens Wiecking at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf; equities followed
suit, falling then recovering to end the day at 2,032.52.
Turnover rose from DM8.5bn to DM9.2bn. Deutsche Bank lost ground in the post
bourse, ending at DM684.50 after a rise of just DM1.50 to DM688 on the
session on exposure to debt markets, property scandals and recent talk of
management changes.
Merck Finck was not looking for a sustained equities recovery. 'As the most
important bond investors are still heavily over-invested', it said this
week, 'they will be inclined to use any recovery to reduce or unwind
lossmaking bond positions. As a consequence, the recovery potential for
German bonds will be dampened in the weeks ahead, so that equities should
not expect much support from this side.'
PARIS saw the CAC-40 index dip to 1,908.32 in reaction to the Buba news
before regaining its confidence once again to close the session, and the
account, at 1,939.02, up 21.98 or 1.1 per cent.
Eurotunnel ended 30 centimes down at FFr24.70 as the takeup of the UK side
of the rights issue came in above expectations, and the bourse authorities
said that it had opened an official enquiry into the movement of the shares
prior to the issue coming to the market. The result of the French side of
the issue is expected early next month, and the takeup level is forecast to
exceed that in the UK.
Euro Disney was one of the day's losers, off FFr1.50 at FFr16.
MILAN held on to early gains, although it remained cautious in the absence
of clear government action to tackle the budget deficit.
The Comit index rose 15.81, or 2.3 per cent to 707.44; but there was concern
that further profit-taking could emerge at around the 710 point level. In
contrast, the real-time Mibtel index finished 45 higher at 11,190, after a
day's peak of 11,331.
The insurance sector remained under pressure ahead of Monday's public
offering and private placement of 51 per cent of Ina, the state insurer.
Generali slipped L150 to L42,100, Fondiaria dropped L430 to L13,230 and Ras
lost L300 to L25,500.
The new shares of Mondadori, the publisher, finished at L15,480 as they made
their debut, compared with an opening L15,260 quote and the L15,000 offer
price. The old shares, which have dividend rights and are quoted separately,
rose L684 to L15,984.
MADRID reacted to early strength on Wall Street, Iberdrola, Repsol and
Telefonica accounting for some 40 per cent of the day's Pta29bn turnover as
they rose Pta29 to Pta979, Pta135 to Pta3,995 and Pta35 to Pta775
respectively.
However, the outstanding gain, given the recent unpopularity of banks on
poor bond market trading experience, was a Pta500, or 4.8 per cent rise to
Pta11,000 for Bankinter, picked out with Banco Popular this week by Mr Bryan
Crossley at Hoare Govett for their 'almost irresistible combination of high
rates of profitability, strong balance sheets and low market ratings.'
AMSTERDAM made a hesitant recovery assisted by strength in the bond markets,
helping the AEX index to a day's gain of 4.64 or 1.2 per cent to 387.38.
One of the day's best performers was Nutricia, the food group. There were
reports, which the Dutch company denied, that Unigate of the UK might be
considering the sale of its stake to Heinz of the US . Nutricia's shares
added Fl 3.40 to Fl 84.00.
ZURICH continued higher in response to firmer bond futures, but the SMI
index edged back from 2,641.1, its best level of the day, to finish 31.0
ahead at 2,626.7.
Banks and insurers continued to lead after their recent long slide. UBS
bearers rose SFr37 to SFr1,147 and Zurich Insurance gained SFr34 to
SFr1,320.
The weak dollar, however, continued to dampen the performance of
industrials. Nestle added just SFr5 to SFr1,115 while Ciba lost SFr3 to
SFr709.
OSLO recovered after recent weakness, underpinned by lower debt market
yields. The all-share index rose 10.19 or 1.8 per cent to 577.58 in turnover
of NKr365m.
Shipping and industrial stocks led the advance. Elkem A shares gained NKr7
to NKr83 as a wage agreement averted the threat of industrial action at two
of its aluminium plants. Norsk Hydro, benefiting from higher aluminium and
oil prices, added NKr4 to NKr214.
TEL AVIV rose 2.75 per cent, supported by aggressive buying by portfolio
managers. The Mishtanim index finished 4.63 ahead at 173.17 in low turnover
of Shk132m, but it was still 3.1 per cent down on the week.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Warsaw equities fall 2.6%
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's privatisation ministry announced yesterday that it would be
lowering the minimum share offer price for Rolimpex, a state-owned farm
products trader, as the country's stock market tumble hit privatisation
revenues and new share issues.
Warsaw's equity market fell a further 2.6 per cent yesterday in heavy
volume, bringing its drop on the week to 14 per cent.
The government was originally planning to offer half of the shares in
Rolimpex at a minimum of 300,000 zlotys per share, which would have valued
the company on a price/earnings ratio of 14, a premium to the current
multiple of 11 for the bourse.
Mr Andrzej Gruszka, a government official, said the minimum price would
certainly be lowered by the time the offer opened on July 4.
Meanwhile, Elektrim, the power energy and telecommunications equipment
specialist which has a rights issue on offer, faces having to turn to the
underwriters as the slide on the bourse has left the rights price, of 1.2m
zlotys, far above the current share price of 785,000 zlotys.
Polifarb Cieszyn, the paint producer, and Okocim, a brewery, which are both
listed on the stock exchange, have also been forced to place the majority of
their rights issues with underwriters.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar chases rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wild rumours of a cut in German interest rates and concerted central bank
intervention to support the dollar bounced the US currency around in narrow
trading yesterday, writes Motoko Rich.
The dollar rose on early morning rumours that the Bundesbank would reduce
the discount rate or set a lower fixed repo rate at its monthly central
council meeting.
Afternoon talk of a concerted intervention effort spiked up the US currency
again, but the central banks did not show their hands before the close in
London, where the dollar ended at DM1.6035 from DM1.6006 and Y101.150 from
Y100.695. It closed in New York at DM1.6040 and Y101.35.
Sterling showed signs of independence from the US currency as it turned in a
stronger performance against both the D-Mark and the dollar.
Traders were made tentative by speculation that the Bundesbank was about to
cut its discount rate or set a lower fixed repo rate. They accordingly gave
the dollar a boost towards the DM1.61 level in the morning, as they awaited
the results of the Bundesbank's central council meeting.
The dollar opened lower in New York against the D-Mark after Bundesbank
president Mr Hans Tietmeyer made the ambiguous remark that 'the Bundesbank
is not interested in a falling dollar'. Hopes for a cut in German interest
rates were further squashed when Mr Tietmeyer commented on the growth of the
M3 money supply. 'We believe the current interest rate structure would
contribute to slowing in M3 growth,' he said.
The markets grew jittery in the afternoon when rumours of concerted central
bank intervention circulated. But the banks stayed out of the ring again,
although some said the US Federal Reserve bought some dollars on behalf of
the Bank of Japan.
Analysts were beginning to doubt the possibility of group action by the
central banks to support the dollar. 'I think we have passed the time when
the grand slam intervention that the market was afraid of will be needed,'
said Mr Michael Feeny, economist at Sumitomo Bank. 'I think the dollar is
consolidating.'
After the release of figures for US durable goods orders in May, commerce
secretary Mr Ron Brown said the numbers were 'a very good sign', indicating
continued growth in the US economy with virtually non-existent inflation.
US durable goods orders rose by 0.9 per cent, against expectations of a 0.5
per cent increase. In addition, US initial jobless claims last week were at
352,000, up from a revised 349,000 for the previous week.
The markets treated the data with indifference, although the figures for
durable goods were better than expected. 'Markets tend to react to figures
either in a very positive or very negative way only if major figures go
their way,' commented Mr Chris Dunis, economist at Chemical Bank. 'Otherwise
they tend to disregard the figures as not important.'
Sterling rose steadily against the dollar and the D-Mark during the day,
escaping from its recent slavish relationship to US currency trends.
'There was institutional buying of pounds,' said Mr Rob Loewy, economist at
Midland Global Markets. 'It looked like half-year squaring off. The markets
took profits against the first move above Dollars 1.50.'
Mr Loewy said an improvement in the UK gilts market also helped the pound.
'The markets have also focused on the government's tough talking on the rail
strikes and recent indications that the government is attempting to keep
public spending down,' he said. 'All of these things have encouraged
sentiment.'
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 700m assistance
at established rates after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 750m. The Bank
also supplied late assistance of around Pounds 40m.
The Swiss franc remained stable, although slightly lower, against the dollar
after the Swiss National Bank said it was not intervening to support the US
currency.
At its semi-annual news conference in Zurich, Swiss National Bank president
Markus Lusser said he had no diff-iculties with the current D-Mark/Swiss
franc exchange rate. Mr Lusser also said the exchange rate was not hindering
the country's economic recovery, which investors interpreted as a vote of
confidence in present interest rates.
The European crosses were stable throughout the day, with the lira and the
peseta gaining some ground against the D-Mark. The German unit ended in
London at L982.6 from L983.3 and at Pta82.98 from Pta83.24. Against the
Swiss franc, it finished at SFr0.842 from SFr0.841. It closed unchanged
against the French franc at FFr3.422.
Bank of Portugal governor Miguel Beleza's resignation did not affect the
escudo, which held at Es103.4 per D-Mark.
In the futures market, the December short sterling contract saw 26,000 lots
traded and settled at 93.85 from 93.74. The December Euromark contract,
after 47,000 lots dealt, closed at 94.85 from 94.87.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper attains new high as oil
prices fall further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading contracts at the London Metal Exchange built on Wednesday's rally
yesterday with copper touching fresh 21-month highs at one point. But oil
prices and soft commodities extended their falls.
Having tested downside support on Wednesday morning the LME copper contract
challenged overhead resistance in early trading yesterday, when the three
months delivery position peaked at Dollars 2,507 a tonne. But profit-taking
was attracted at that level and the market quickly shed about Dollars 30.
Renewed buying took it back to Dollars 2,483.50 a tonne at the close, up
Dollars 32 on the day.
Dealers did not think that the stalling of the rally signalled the end of
coppers' bull run, which has seen prices soar from 1994 lows of Dollars
1,725. 'It looks to have found good support on the dips and should bounce
back towards Dollars 2,500,' one told the Reuter news agency. He added that
today's announcement of the level of stocks in LME warehouses 'could be the
key'.
The earlier highs were attributed mainly to robust demand in after hours
trading on Wednesday, which sparked covering against short positions,
speculative interest and Chinese buying.
Aluminium was also lifted early in the session by reports of Chinese buying
and fresh speculative interest. At one stage the three months position hit
fresh a three-year high of Dollars 1,492 a tonne before easing back in line
with copper. It closed at Dollars 1,487.50 a tonne, up Dollars 16 from
Wednesday.
Lead received a boost from commission house buying and European trade
interest, which helped to lift three months metal from a late afternoon low
of Dollars 555.50 a tonne to Dollars 560 in after hours trading.
Although oil prices fell yesterday, traders remained optimistic that
fundamentals were still positive and that the underlying upward trend was
intact. The price of the benchmark Brent Blend for August delivery was
Dollars 17.10 a barrel in late London trading yesterday, after having closed
at Dollars 17.48 on Wednesday.
Mr Lindsay Horn, trader at the London office of US investment bank Lehman
Brothers, said yesterday's correction was tantamount to the market 'stopping
to change horses'.
He said Brent was holding up well given the fact that most of the upward
price pressure had been on West Texas Intermediate because of supply
bottlenecks in the US Midwest.
At the London Commodity Exchange meanwhile robusta coffee prices continued
their downwards movement after Brazil's announcement on Wednesday that it
would sell 300,000 bags to exporters over the next two months. The September
futures contract slipped by Dollars 39 to Dollars 2,240 a tonne, deepening
losses made on Wednesday, when the New York market was weak.
In spite of early strength, cocoa prices followed coffee downwards on fairly
heavy selling by speculators. The second position futures price in London
fell by Pounds 25 a tonne to Pounds 975 a tonne.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: New Zealand hopes distribution
deals will boost kiwifruit sales - Terry Hall explains the reasons behind a
significant change in arrangements for handling exports to Britain and Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New arrangements with major fruit distributors in Britain and Japan mark a
significant change for the New Zealand kiwifruit industry, which in the past
adopted a largely 'do it yourself' policy in these countries.
The Kiwifruit Marketing Board, the co-operative body that controls all
exports of the fruit, last month tied up distribution agreements with Geest
in the UK and US group Dole in Japan to handle its fruit sales for the new
season.
Mr Eric Henry, the chief executive says the development follows last year's
restructuring of the board when, under pressure from bankers, the emphasis
was on cutting costs and the size of the crop to manageable levels and
reducing debts. This followed the devastating NZDollars 90m loss suffered in
the 1992-93 season.
Pessimists were predicting the demise of the New Zealand kiwifruit industry
at the start of last season, arguing that it was internationally
uncompetitive. However despite another difficult year in Europe and Japan,
Mr Henry says the industry has outperformed its New Zealand fresh fruit
rivals 'in terms of price, volume and grower returns'.'
Total grower returns rose by NZDollars 108.3m to NZDollars 292.5m (Pounds
113m) in the year to December 31. Sales were up sharply, with the board
selling 49.2m trays, or 89 per cent of the crop. It would have sold more had
climatic conditions been better. For an unknown biological reason New
Zealand grown kiwifruit did not keep as well as usual last season forcing
the dumping of a substantial quantity in the closing stages of the season.
Mr Henry says that this condition could occur again this year, which is why
the board is trying to sell as much fruit as possible in the opening months
of the season.
'This makes sense,' he explains. 'You get the highest returns then. After
that costs start to climb for fruit in storage, competition increases and
condition can deteriorate.'
The appointment of Geest as the board's exclusive UK agent is an effort to
boost sales there sharply.
Mr Henry, who is just back from Europe, says UK sales of New Zealand
kiwifruit are significantly below what they should be. 'Britain has about
the same population as Germany,' he says: 'but we sell six times as much
there'.
One possible reason for the difference, says Mt Henry, is that Germans are
more health conscious. 'They appreciate the healthy properties of
kiwifruit'.
Only 6 per cent of New Zealand kiwifruit shipped to Europe is sold in
Britain. Last year the country bought 2m trays, but Mr Henry hopes to triple
this in three years. Most of the kiwifruit sold in Britain now comes from
Italy, France and Chile.
Under the agreement Geest will provide a nationwide wholesale distribution
and logistics service. The board will continue direct pricing and marketing
policies, and for the first time will appoint a UK manager who will be based
at Geest's headquarters.
Under the new structure the board will have direct access to the consumer
market, giving it the opportunity to respond quickly to seasonal swings and
to deliver tailor made promotions to supermarkets.
The deal with Dole in Japan is the first such distribution agreement the US
company has signed. It is also the first time it has marketed fruit under a
label other than its own.
Mr Henry says that this is a recognition of the strong image of New Zealand
kiwifruit in the Japanese market. Japan, one of New Zealand's most important
markets, last year bought nearly Dollars NZ200m worth of New Zealand
kiwifruit, which commands a substantial margin in that market.
Dole will undertake the storage and direct merchandising, including
preparing pre-pack items for supermarkets.
With the first shipments of the new season's fruit headed for export
markets, Mr Henry says he is optimistic about prospects in most markets,
apart from the US, where the anti-dumping order remains in force.
Before the order was introduced New Zealand was selling 4m trays there
annually, but this season it will attempt to sell only 700,000 trays. 'That
market is basically uneconomic,' Mr Henry says.
The board will retain a role in the US market in the hope that the
eventually the US will lift its open-ended anti-dumping measure.

Three traders in Shanghai have been detained by the Chinese government in
connection with their alleged role in operations that led to losses last
year on the London Metal Exchange copper contract, according to Metal
Bulletin Fast Track, reports Reuter.
Two of the traders worked for the metal trading department at the
state-owned China International Trust and Investment Corporation and one was
an employee of the Shanghai Machinery and Electrical Bureau.
The traders are alleged to be responsible for large losses when the Chinese
were unable to meet margin payments as copper prices rose.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar industries respond to
adversity - Canute James reports on efforts to revive flagging productivity
in the Caribbean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sugar producers in the Caribbean Community, whose major market is the
European Union, have been having a difficult time, and some have been forced
into financial and administrative restructuring to improve efficiency and
production.
The problems have raised questions about the ability of some regional
producers to meet their quota obligations to the EU and the US.
Regional industries have benefitted from new loans, others from the
cancellation of debts, the servicing of which had been a burden on their
operations. Elsewhere industries have called on new managements as part of
their restructuring.
These smaller producers in the Caribbean, unlike Cuba and the Dominican
Republic, have been forced to concentrate on satisfying their lucrative
markets in Europe, and some have been driven to import sugar for domestic
use.
Combined production in the Commonwealth Caribbean countries fell by 3 per
cent to 732,000 tonnes last year, with St Kitts-Nevis, the smallest
producer, the only one to record an increase. The problems facing the
region's industry are illustrated by the state of the sector in Barbados,
which is undergoing a USDollars 30m rehabilitation programme. The aim is to
improve the industry's efficiency, increase the level of mechanisation and
re-equip mills, to enable higher production.
The island will have to import sugar this year to meet domestic demand
because all output from the current harvest is being shipped to Europe to
fulfil the quota to the EU. The industry will achieve its production target
of 50,000 tonnes, but this is 4,000 tonnes less than the country's EU quota.
The additional sugar for Europe will come 'drawing down on carry-over stock
from last year,' industry officials say. They deny that sugar will be
imported for transhipment to Europe as 'it would be in contravention of our
legal agreement with the EU for supplying sugar'.
The prospects for an improvement rest on the planned restructuring of the
industry and the administrative skills of Booker Tate of the UK, which has
been contracted to manage the industry. The Barbadians are clearly hoping
that Booker Tate can emulate the success it has had in Guyana where
production last year was slightly below that of 1992 but 50 per cent more
than 1991.
The importation of management skills four years ago was followed by a World
Bank loan of USDollars 15m to the Guyanese industry for the rehabilitation
of aspects of the industry, and to improve productivity. There has also been
improvement of irrigation and drainage systems in the industry.
The growth in production, which was dramatically evident in 1992, is
continuing. Good weather and higher productivity lifted the country's sugar
production from the first of the industry's two harvests to 109,000 tonnes,
14,000 tonnes more than the first harvest of last year. The industry is
anticipating combined production from both harvests this year at 250,000
tonnes, and if this is achieved it will he the highest annual output in the
past nine years, officials say.
Guyana will be able to meet its export commitments this year to the EU and
the US, as well as satisfying domestic demand.
The financial restructuring of the industry in Trinidad and Tobago has also
contributed to improved production. The government recently assumed debts of
about USDollars 530m owed by the state-owned Caroni, the country's sole
producer. The company also recently received new funds of Dollars 21m for
financing pre-harvest operations.
This relief, and an improvement in the quality of canes and reduced labour
unrest, helped to lift the country's sugar production from the 1994 harvest
to 127,612 tonnes, 17,000 tonnes more than last year, and the highest in 20
years, according to industry spokesmen. This will allow the industry easily
to meet its export quotas to the EU and the US, and a further rise in
production is forecast for next year.
Jamaica's hopes for significantly higher output than last year's 224,000
tonnes have been set back by prolonged labour unrest and bad weather. A
strike by the industry's field and mill workers earlier this year to protest
at the slow pace of negotiations between their unions and mill owners, and
unseasonably heavy rains, have cut production by about 25,000 tonnes. The
industry had been forecasting output of 245,000 tonnes this year.
The expected improvement was based on improved efficiency in the industry
following the sale in January of four of five state-owned mills to local and
foreign investors. Planned retooling of the mills and improvements to
another four, which have always been in private hands, has led the industry
to forecast national output in the next two years at about 350,000 tonnes a
year.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When selling resumed in Australia on Tuesday prices generally were firm to
unchanged. A slightly easier tendency appeared the next day, but by Thursday
prices were again firm. However, the real test of values will come next
week, at the closing sales for the 1993-94 season, when there will be
substantial quantities of wool on offer. It is noted that there has been a
fall of inquiry for stockpile wool. Last week's sales, reports Wool
International, totalled 4,687 bales, of which 3,418 were for deferred
delivery. At June 17 the stockpile amounted to 3,678,788 bales. While most
traders continue to predict a reasonably firm start to next season's sales,
a key factor in the longer term is the reluctance of spinners to pay prices
for tops which fully reflect current replacement costs. The market indicator
was 627c/kg on Thursday.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Cautious buying extends recovery in
European prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds extended Wednesday's recovery yesterday, helped by
cautious buying from investors who had been sidelined for weeks.
Some participants said the markets may be bottoming after months of sharp
declines. 'We are close to the bottom,' said Mr Nigel Richardson at Yamaichi
International. 'We are approaching a level where investors are ready to come
back to the market.'
However, others said it may take a while before bonds can stage a
sustainable recovery.
'If a bullish turnround is actually beginning, a re-test of the lows will be
needed to strengthen the base from which to build a sustainable uptrend,'
argued Mr Karl Haeling, of Deutsche Bank.
'I see this as a much-needed bear-market correction,' commented Mr Graham
McDevitt of market analysts IDEA. He expects the recovery to continue
near-term, underpinned by chart-technical factors, but warned that bonds
might succumb to some profit-taking before the weekend.
German bonds ended a volatile session firmer, with the longer maturities
outperforming the short end. The Bundesbank council's decision to leave
official interest rates unchanged prompted some slippage after early rumours
of rate cuts.
Cautionary comments from council member Mr Otmar Issing, who said markets
should not conclude that the recent pattern of regular five basis point cuts
in the securities repurchase rate would automatically continue, further
damped interest rate optimism.
Some traders have been speculating that the Bundesbank may set fixed-rate
repos through the summer period, possibly at a rate below the current 5 per
cent.
In late trading, the September bund future on Liffe was about 0.47 points
higher at 92.37.
UK gilts gained slightly in thin and nervous trading that saw sharp rises
and falls throughout the day.
But analysts remained sceptical about how long the recent improved sentiment
 -due largely to the halt in the dollar's slide and the perception that a US
interest rate increase is not imminent - will last. Most activity continued
to take place in the futures market, with few cash transactions.
'The fundamental problems still remain - to do with funding, economic
recovery and the strength of inflationary pressures,' said Mr Simon Briscoe,
of S. G. Warburg Securities. 'The market will continue to look for reasons
to fall back again,' said one trader.
Analysts confirmed rumours that the Bank of England supplied a modest amount
of bonds yesterday to market-makers which have suffered from recent bond
volatility.
The Bank announced that a Pounds 150m tranche of 4 3/8 per cent index-linked
gilt due 2004 was exhausted in late afternoon trading.
The long gilt future was up  11/32 points at 100 1/8 in late trading, off
the day's high of 100 31/32 reached after an early technical squeeze but
above the low for the day of 99 23/32 .
French bonds ended a volatile day sharply higher, lifted by early buying in
the futures market and follow-through cash buying in the afternoon. The
September notional bond future on Matif rose 1.26 points to 114.70.
US Treasury bonds were mixed yesterday amid conflicting economic signals and
further improvement in the dollar.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/16 lower
at 86 1/4 , yielding 7.40 per cent. The two-year note was  1/16 better at
100 3/32 , to yield 5.933 per cent.
Perhaps the two most crucial pieces of economic news of the week were
released yesterday morning, but neither of them was particularly conclusive.
The Commerce Department said that new orders of factory goods last month had
risen 0.9 per cent, substantially higher than the consensus forecast of 0.4
per cent.
However, the inflationary implications of the gain were mitigated by a 2.5
per cent decline in orders of non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft.
Treasury prices dipped on the announcement but heavy selling pressure failed
to materialise in early trading.
Later in the morning, the Labor Department had some unqualified good news
for the fixed-rate investors looking for signs of moderating economic
growth. Initial claims for unemployment benefit last week climbed by 3,000,
against expectations of a 3,000 decline.
In the foreign exchange markets, developments were mildly positive, as the
dollar moved above the Y101 mark on unfounded speculation that central banks
were poised to intervene on the US currency's behalf.
Commodity prices, excluding gold and oil, were softer, in keeping with a
week-long trend.
As a result, Treasuries turned around and nudged in to positive territory by
mid-morning.
However, prices soon began to erode again as traders remained tentative
pending any convincing developments, either in terms of economic news or
movements in the commodity or foreign exchange markets.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Vereinsbank taps Czech
fixed-rate debt sector
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bayerische Vereinsbank has become the first foreign bank to tap the Czech
koruna fixed-rate debt market, launching a Kcs1bn issue with a three-year
maturity and a coupon of 11 per cent.
The issue, through a subsidiary - BV Finance Praha - and guaranteed by
Vereinsbank's Prague branch, was placed with domestic and international
banks and was priced at 101.45 per cent.
The bank will use the proceeds for Czech koruna lending. It said it had
tapped the Czech koruna market to eliminate currency risk.
Prague has an active and liquid short-term money market but access to
long-term capital is difficult.
'Three-year money doesn't exist in the (Czech) interbank market,' said Mr
David Svojitka, Vereinsbank treasurer in Prague.
'This is the only way to get long-term money at a reasonable price. The
market was hungry for a new instrument at an attractive yield.'
Domestic companies and the Czech Republic have previously issued Czech
koruna bonds but Mr Svojitka said Vereinsbank expected to return to the
market again later this year.
The bank has applied for a licence to set up a German-style mortgage bank in
the Czech Republic and if the application is successful it 'will seek to
issue bonds with at least a five-year maturity'.
Three further Czech koruna issues are expected to come to the market this
summer. Bankers say another foreign institution may make an issue later this
year.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Improvement in sentiment brings a
flurry of issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was an emerging-market flavour to the eurobond market yesterday as an
improvement in sentiment in European government bond markets encouraged a
flurry of issuance in a variety of currencies.
The Province of Buenos Aires launched its first deal under its medium-term
note programme when it raised Dollars 100m through an offering of three-year
eurobonds.
Lead manager Salomon Brothers said the bonds were mainly bought by emerging
market funds in the US through the 144a tranche. A portion of the offering,
which was priced to yield 333 basis points over Treasuries, was swapped into
yen to appeal to Japanese investors.
The other emerging-market borrower of the day was the National Bank of
Hungary which made its first appearance in the euro-guilder sector.
Lead manager ING Bank said the deal was part of the issuer's strategy of
broadening its investor base and accessing more markets. Syndicate managers
noted that this was also the first euro-guilder offering by an emerging
market borrower for five years.
The Fl 150m issue of five-year bonds, which were priced to yield 235 basis
points over comparable Dutch government bonds, was bought mainly by domestic
institutions attracted by the yield spread. When the bonds were freed to
trade, they traded at 98.70, down from the re-offer price at the launch of
98.835.
Rabobank also tapped the five-year area of the euro-guilder sector when it
raised Fl 500m. Some syndicate managers expressed surprise at the yield
spread of 18 basis points over five-year Dutch government bonds which in
their view was several basis points wider than Rabobank's usual target.
They said the generous pricing reflected the issuer's desire to ensure a
favourable response from investors to this relatively large deal. The bonds
were targeted mainly at retail investors since institutions were still
looking at the longer end of the yield curve.
Elsewhere, the D-Mark sector saw some activity as Wuestenrot Finanz, the
German mortgage institution, issued DM500m of five-year floating-rate notes.
The discounted margin on the notes was 21 basis points over Libor.
The deal was arranged by CS First Boston which also raised DM250m for itself
through an offering of five-year eurobonds.

<TEXT>
Foreign exchange dealers expect currency markets to be relatively stable in
the next three months, according to a survey by Foreign Exchange Letter, a
newsletter published by Institutional Investor.
More than two-thirds of dealers expect there to be no significant change in
D-Mark/sterling, French franc/D-Mark, and yen/D-Mark rates.
However, nearly half expect the yen/dollar rate to languish below Y104. (The
survey was conducted in mid-June, prior to the recent sharp fall in the
dollar.)
Among chief dealers, 67 per cent expect to see more portfolio fund
management business, and 33 per cent predict more leveraged fund business.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Havas chief sees 'real
opportunity' for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Havas, the French media and leisure group, yesterday confirmed that it was
on course for profits growth this year and announced plans to reinforce its
links with France Telecom, the state-controlled telecommunications group.
Mr Pierre Dauzier, chairman, told Havas's annual general meeting in Paris
that it had 'a real opportunity for profits recovery' in 1994. Havas, which
was hit last year by economic recession, saw net profits fall to FFr708m
(Dollars 129m) from FFr823m in 1992.
The group has already experienced an increase in sales this year with
turnover growth of 6.1 per cent for the first quarter continuing through
April and May. It should also benefit from exceptional profits on various
transactions against a FFr60m exceptional debit last year.
Havas said it expected to make an exceptional profit of FFr55m on a deal
completed yesterday whereby it has taken full control of Office d'Annonces
(ODA), the advertising arm of France Telecom's directories.
The deal leaves France Telecom as a significant minority shareholder in
Havas with a 5.5 per cent stake following the issue of 2.7m new Havas
shares.
Mr Dauzier yesterday stressed that the ODA transaction was intended to be a
catalyst for future co-operation between the two French groups. 'This deal
cements our relationship,' he said.
The relationship between Havas and France Telecom has already attracted
controversy following the recent row over the resignation of Mr Andre
Rousselet as chairman of the Canal Plus media group.
Mr Rousselet's resignation followed moves against him by Havas and other
shareholders. Mr Rousselet claimed the moves were part of France Telecom's
long-running efforts to win influence over Canal Plus.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T's hidden global agenda -
Unisource alliance does not tell whole story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's announcement of an international telecoms alliance between AT&amp;T
and Unisource, the joint venture between the national operators of Sweden,
Switzerland and the Netherlands, was as significant for what it concealed as
for what it revealed.
While the Unisource deal confirms AT&amp;T's European ambitions, it raises
questions about the group's strategy in Latin America and its future
relationship with Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK operator.
The alliance with Unisource had been expected. A year ago, when AT&amp;T
launched its Worldsource venture with KDD, the Japanese telecoms group, and
Singapore Telecom, it said it needed European partners to be credible and
planned to gain them by the end of 1994.
Worldsource's brief is to exploit the market for one-stop facilities for
multinational companies. Of an estimated 2,400 multinationals, 800 have
facilities in Europe. Europe's markets are slowly opening up to competition
from new entrants against national operators. An alliance with insiders was
critical to AT&amp;T.
British Telecommunications ruled itself out by forming a Dollars 5.3bn
alliance with MCI, AT&amp;T's most bitter rival in the US long-distance market.
AT&amp;T tried to secure the other two European telecoms giants, Deutsche
Telekom and France Telecom. However, its efforts failed amid a growing
perception that an alliance worth forging would probably fall foul of
regulatory authorities unprepared to tolerate a union of three of the
world's four largest telecoms operators.
That left AT&amp;T with only one serious European option - Unisource, a joint
venture launched earlier in the year. It was not just a process of
elimination. Mr Alex Mandl, the Austrian-born chief executive of AT&amp;T's
communications services division who masterminded the negotiations, did not
underestimate the potential to weld Europe's smaller operators into a strong
third force.
Unisource's attraction to AT&amp;T was heightened by two alliances it formed
last year: with Telefonica, the Spanish national operator; and with Sita, a
global data network operator owned by airlines, aviation and freight
companies, opening up a potentially lucrative market for 'one-stop'
international telecoms services.
Unisource was urgently seeking a US alliance. Earlier this year it came
together with AT&amp;T in a successful bid to provide telecoms facilities to an
association of more than 30 European multinationals. Yesterday's deal flowed
from there. 'It brings us what we needed to make a strong competitor in this
international market,' said Mr Viesturs Vucins, Unisource chief executive.
For Unisource the benefits are worldwide reach; AT&amp;T's brand name; and
access to AT&amp;T's standards and products, of which the most important is its
corporate 'voice' networks, which Unisource plans to be marketing under the
Worldsource brand by the end of this year.
However, yesterday's announcement concealed two significant aspects of
AT&amp;T's international strategy. First, its interest in Telefonica is only
partly due to the Spanish operator's European presence: more important,
analysts believe, is Telefonica's substantial interests in Latin America,
where AT&amp;T's influence is weak and its vulnerability to competition growing.
Telefonica is active in every sizeable Latin American market, apart from
Brazil, and expects to draw at least 15 per cent of its revenue from the
region this year. Through Telefonica International it has stakes ranging
from 6 per cent to 79 per cent in operators in Chile, Argentina, Venezuela,
Puerto Rico and Peru.
AT&amp;T has been in talks about taking a stake in Telefonica International
separately from its designs on Unisource. That option will remain open, even
after Telefonica becomes an equity partner in Unisource - a move expected
next month.
AT&amp;T's immediate Latin American interests are defensive. The disparity
between incoming and outgoing tariffs between the region and the US has
stimulated a growth in operators offering 'call back' facilities from the
US, costing AT&amp;T dear.
The threat to AT&amp;T is not marginal. About 20 per cent of outgoing
international calls from Venezuela are estimated to be made through 'call
back' arrangements, with much of the traffic carried by AT&amp;T's US
competitors. Mr Nick Smith, analyst with Credit Lynonnais Securities in
Madrid, said: 'AT&amp;T wants to normalise the regime in Latin America, and
Telefonica offers the best prospect of doing so.'
The second aspect concerns AT&amp;T's relationship with Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK
international operator as yet non-aligned in the battle for the
multinationals. For the past year C&amp;W has claimed to be its own best
strategic partner in the international arena. In reality, the group has been
heavily engaged in negotiations with AT&amp;T. Mercury, its UK operation, came
close to agreeing to join Worldsource earlier this month; Hongkong Telecom,
by far C&amp;W's largest concern, is still in negotiations.
C&amp;W claims that Hongkong Telecom can safely go its own way, since it is
relatively insignificant to the global market for multinationals. But if
AT&amp;T plugs into the heart of the C&amp;W group, speculation about the future of
C&amp;W's limbs will inevitably escalate.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Recapitalisation recommended for
Australian retail chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The voluntary administrators of Brash Holdings, the Australian electronics
retail chain which ran into financial difficulties when its banks refused to
roll over ADollars 61m (USDollars 46.9m) of borrowings last month, are
recommending that the company be recapitalised.
The recapitalisation would be undertaken via a ADollars 40m injection from
interests connected to Mr Ong Beng Seng, a Singaporean businessman.
The administrators are recommending that the investor take control of
Brash's trading assets.
They said that under the agreement with Hotel Properties/Reef Holdings - two
companies associated with Mr Ong - unsecured creditors would get an
estimated 38 cents in the dollar, while secured creditors could receive up
to 75 cents in the dollar. Banks, whose security was established in February
1994, would get 64 cents in the dollar.
HPL/Reef has sizeable interests in Australia, as well as Asia, the US and
UK. Its Australian assets range from the Planet Hollywood restaurant in
Sydney, to Hyundai Automotive Australia.
According to the administrators, Mr Ong has no plans to break up Brash's, a
170-store chain. They expect the new owner to try to relist the Australian
group.
The administrators have been soliciting offers for the company since they
were called in on May 2.
They said that 10 proposals or indicative offers had been received, but that
the HPL/Reef solution was 'the best offer for the business'.
Creditors must approve the plan, and a meeting has been called for June 30.
MIM, the Queensland-based metals group, has signed formal loan agreements
for the financing of the McArthur River zinc-lead-silver project in the
Northern Territory.
The facilities allow for USDollars 153m of base funding and contingencies
and a further ADollars 15m in working capital facilities.
The banks involved are Westpac, NatWest Markets Australia, Credit Lyonnais,
AIDC and Citibank.
The project will cost ADollars 250m and the mine is due to begin
commissioning in mid-1995.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: China development bank focuses
on infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The newly-established State Development Bank, an important element of
China's financial sector reforms, expects to lend Yn80bn (Dollars 9.3bn)
this year for projects in such areas as power generation, transport and
telecommunications.
Mr Yao Zhenyan, president of the bank - which has been modelled on the
Development Bank of Japan - said that the process of evaluating loan
requests began within days of the bank being formed in May.
The bank's most important function will be to assume the state-oriented
lending responsibilities presently shouldered by China's 'big four'
specialised banks, allowing them to become commercial entities.
The specialised banks had functioned almost as aid agencies for the
government's infrastructure needs and were given little encouragement to
make independent assessments of the projects.
Mr Yao indicated that the new bank would concentrate its energies in the
power sector (where there is significant demand for capital),
telecommunications and transport.
The bank, which has registered capital of Yn50bn, would raise Yn65bn for
lending to development projects. It would rely on central government
support, but would also tap the commercial banks and eventually would float
bonds domestically and internationally.
Mr Yao said the bank would shy away from lending for construction, which
would be the main responsibility of the Agriculture Development Bank, one of
three recently established policy-lending institutions. The other is the
Import and Export Credit Bank.
But the State Development Bank would support large construction projects
such as the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze river. It was providing Yn3bn in
loans this year for the civil works.
Mr Yao was adamant that the bank would not assume responsibility for the bad
loans of the specialised banks.
Western officials had predicted this would be one of the bank's functions.
'We say old problems should be solved through old channels, and new problems
should be solved using new methods,' he said. 'If we take over the problems
our bank would go bankrupt in three years.
'While commercial banks must be profit-oriented, our bank must not be
loss-oriented,' he added. 'This demands that what we will run is a bank and
not a currency pool.'
Some estimates have put China's infrastructure requirements to the year 2000
at Yn700bn. This includes 121 important projects designated by the state.
The State Development Bank also planned to participate in BOT
(build-operate-transfer) funding operations and other forms of financing
aimed at attracting foreign capital.
Mr Yao ranked China's three priority infrastructure areas as the Three
Gorges project, the Beijing-Kowloon railway, and power plants 'all the way
to Tibet'.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Neste swings back into black
after shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Neste, the state-owned Finnish oil and petrochemicals group, staged a
dramatic return to the black in the first four months of the year,
rebounding to a FM210m (Dollars 39m) pre-tax profit from a loss of FM719m in
the same period last year.
The turnround reflected a big restructuring plan instigated last year to
halt a succession of losses and prepare the group, at present 97 per cent
owned by the state, for partial privatisation.
The government intends to keep a majority stake in Neste, but will
eventually sell off the rest of the company.
Group sales in the four months to the end of April fell to FM17.9bn from
FM24.6bn, following the merger of Neste's petrochemicals and polyolefins
operations in a 50:50 joint venture with Norway's Statoil, called Borealis.
Turnover was also reduced as Neste trimmed its trading activities to ensure
trading operations did not account for more than their historical 50 per
cent share of group turnover. Neste intends to focus increasingly on oil and
energy.
Low crude oil prices held down profitability for Neste's oil production, and
refining margins were tight. But operating profit was up sharply at FM443m,
compared with FM229m last time, and financial costs tumbled to FM233m from
FM948m, producing the turnround at the pre-tax level.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Market turmoil puts 'King
Kidder' to test - Few observers expect mortgage-backed bonds to rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the Dollars 1,600bn market for mortgage-backed bonds, Kidder Peabody is
the undisputed king. Even after the recent turmoil, in the market and at
Kidder, it remains the dominant force in the market.
The question for Kidder, is whether this market, which until recent months
provided the bulk of its profits, will ever rebound to 1992-93 levels.
Mortgage-backed bonds, known as pass-throughs, are created by securitising
pools of domestic mortgage loans. But only about half of all mortgage-backed
bonds outstanding are held as plain pass-through securities. The rest have
been converted into structured bonds, each with a different risk and payment
profile. These structured securities are known as collateralised mortgage
obligations (CMOs).
It is in the creation of CMOs that Kidder has made its name. It is the
activity that has given rise to most speculation on Wall Street about the
firm's financial health.
CMOs are structured to meet the different risk appetites and cashflow needs
of different customers. For example, US banks - traditionally big buyers of
CMOs, though their purchases have dropped sharply - have used short-term
securities to lift the yield on their large bond portfolios, while adjusting
the interest-rate sensitivity in their basic banking business.
Plain mortgage-backed bonds are highly liquid but the tranches of
individually-tailored CMOs into which they are carved may not be -
particularly when prices are falling and there are few buyers. That is what
happened in recent months.
In the rout in US fixed-income markets as the Federal Reserve raised
interest rates this spring, mortgage-backed bonds fell faster than most.
Mr Joseph Hu, an analyst at Oppenheimer, says the benchmark mortgage-backed
issue, the 8 per cent Ginnie Mae bond maturing in 2008, yields about 100
basis points more than Treasuries. Last year, that spread averaged 80-85
basis points.
Since these bonds are backed by the US Treasury, the premium mainly reflects
a risk which is unique to mortgage-backed bonds. If borrowers opt to pay off
their loans early as interest rates fall (as happened last summer) bond
holders are faced with reinvesting at the new, lower market rates.
On the other hand, if borrowers choose not to pre-pay the loans because
interest rates are rising (the experience of this spring) then the average
lives of the bonds are extended, making their yields less attractive.
With a positive US yield curve - albeit not as steep as at the start of the
year - bond holders demand a higher yield for holding longer-term bonds.
The recent swings in the interest rate cycle has earned mortgage-backed
securities the nickname 20-20 bonds. 'They could last 20 months, or 20
years,' says Mr Hu.
Banks have been among the biggest sellers of CMOs. For regulatory reasons
they hold mainly short-term paper, and are forced to sell as the bonds'
duration grows longer. The pressure has spilled over into other fixed income
markets, as managers have sold long-dated Treasuries or other liquid bonds
to offset the extra duration injected into their portfolios by the changing
pre-payment habits of mortgage holders.
These pressures have made the mortgage-backed market one of the biggest
sources of concerns among followers of the securities industry.
With falling prices and less liquidity, it is no surprise that Kidder has
been besieged by reports of big losses. It has suffered indirectly from the
loss of liquidity that hit some parts of the CMOs market.
Askin Capital Management, a specialist fund group that invested in CMOs,
declared itself insolvent as the market dried up. Kidder, which traded
heavily with the firm and held its bonds as collateral, faces a loss of
about Dollars 20m.
Kidder has denied similar problems in its portfolio. Since March, the firm
had cut its holdings of CMOs to under Dollars 10bn from Dollars 16bn, Mr
Jack Welch, chairman of General Electric, the firm's parent, said. This was
not a fire-sale, added Mr Dennis Dammerman, the GE chief financial officer
who was this week put in to run the firm. With fewer new bonds being
underwritten, it was natural for Kidder's inventory levels to run down.
GE and Kidder deny that Kidder has sold off its most liquid holdings first,
leaving it with securities with no ready market. The firm had made sales
from every part of its bond portfolio in recent weeks, said Mr Dammerman.
Its holdings of bonds which have been on its books for more than six months
have fallen to Dollars 430m in the past month from Dollars 600m. The
valuation of its portfolio has been scrutinised by auditors KPMG, among
others.
Inevitably, given its position as the biggest trader in this market, Kidder
has taken losses. GE put these at Dollars 25m-Dollars 30m since the end of
March. This was far less than the Dollars 100m that an internal analysis
last autumn had suggested it could lose in such circumstances, Mr Welch
said. Such stress-testing is common among securities firms as a way of
assessing their potential exposure to rapid price movements.
The direction of the mortgage-backed market, and a review of Kidder's
internal controls in the wake of the Joseph Jett scandal, could prove more
significant for Kidder in the long term. New issue volume has dried up in
recent months as demand for the bonds has fallen. Few expect a repeat of the
recent bull market in bonds.
Kidder is at least holding its position in the market, whatever its internal
troubles. In the first three months of this year, it underwrote Dollars 26bn
of bonds, or a quarter of all new bonds sold, according to figures compiled
by Securities Data. This was more than double the market share of its
nearest rivals. Since the end of March, it has remained in front, with a
market share of 19 per cent, ahead of Salomon, with 17 per cent of the
market.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Labatt lifted by strong brewing
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
John Labatt, one of Canada's two largest brewers, said new products helped
to push beer sales up 4 per cent to CDollars 389m (USDollars 278m) in the
fourth quarter ended April 30, and up 6 per cent to CDollars 1.8bn for the
full year.
Operating profit rose 19 per cent for the year to CDollars 260m, with
Canadian brewing operations leading the way.
However, the US operations also did well, showing 18 per cent growth in
volume and benefiting from removal of the tariff on Ontario beer exports to
the US last August.
In Europe, Birra Moretti's operating results improved and UK sales rose
sharply with inclusion of pub revenues.
Since the year end, Labatt has added 168 pubs, bringing the total to more
than 500 in England and Wales.
The broadcasting, sports and entertainment group posted a 15 per cent gain
in sales for the year, but operating profit slipped because of losses in an
entertainment unit.
Overall, Labatt reported consolidated fourth-quarter net profit from
continuing operations of CDollars 28m, or 26 cents a share, up from CDollars
9m, or 5 cents, a year earlier on total revenues of CDollars 516m, up 16 per
cent.
For the full year, net profit was CDollars 155m, or CDollars 1.53 a share,
up 17 per cent from CDollars 133m, or CDollars 1.32, in 1993.
Sales were CDollars 2.3bn, up 9 per cent.
The year-earlier period excluded special charges taken mainly for the
writedown of Labatt's US dairy business to net realisable value.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Motorola invests in Mexican
cellular group

<TEXT>
Motorola, the US electronics and telecommunications group, is to acquire 42
per cent of Baja Celular, a cellular telephone company in northern Mexico,
in return for investing more than Dollars 100m in the company.
The stake in Baja Celular will give Motorola direct or indirect equity
interests in the four cellular companies that cover the 2,000-mile Mexico-US
border, and all of northern Mexico. Motorola has stakes in the two cellular
companies that cover north-east Mexico, while Baja Cellular, and its
fully-owned subsidiary Mobitel, cover the north-west.
Motorola will invest in Baja Celular with Grupo Protexa, a Mexican
industrial concern, with which it has agreed to form a joint venture to
explore telecommunications opportunities in Mexico.
Motorola plans to form a new company with Protexa that would acquire
Motorola's cellular interests, the company said.
Protexa announced last week that, overall, the new company would invest
about Dollars 1.5bn in Mexican telecommunications.
The company will participate in the tender for a long-distance telephone
concession, and in wireless data and personal communications services.
Protexa said it had begun preliminary negotiations with Sprint, the US
carrier, over offering long-distance services in Mexico, although Motorola
would only say that the company was in talks with various US and European
carriers.
Motorola said it had no plans to increase its stakes in cellular companies
in northern Mexico. The company had taken equity interests to participate in
the cellular business along the fast-growing border area, and to promote and
sell Motorola cellular technology, it said.

<TEXT>
Rio Algom, the Canadian mining group which brought the Cerro Colorado copper
property in northern Chile on stream last February, is reorganising its
north American metals distribution business.
The Atlas Alloys operation with 12 service centres in Canada, Vincent Metals
with 15 locations in the US, and Aceromex in Mexico, together with annual
sales of nearly CDollars 600m (USDollars 433m), are being put into a new
division called North American Metals Distribution, headed by Mr Norman
Smith, now president of Vincent.
During the recession, Rio Algom considered selling its metals distribution
business because of poor prices and low margins, but it has now decided to
develop it further in Canada and US.
'Margins are better in the US where we are likely to expand by acquisition,'
said Mr Forbes West, vice-president. 'But strong Canadian capital spending
could justify growth in Canada as well.'
Rio Algom has invested USDollars 280m in 100 per cent-owned Cerro Colorado.
The mine uses the solvent extraction process and has annual capacity of
40,000 tonnes. This will be increased by 50 per cent in the next few years.
Rio Algom is also exploring other Latin American based metals properties.
RTZ sold its 51.5 per cent interest in Rio Algom in 1992 for CDollars 362m.
Since then the company has pushed ahead in Chile, plans to develop a
USDollars 250m zinc-copper property in Wisconsin jointly with Exxon, and is
buying a 25 per cent royalty interest in the pre-tax profits of the rich
Polaris zinc mine in the Canadian arctic. Rio Algom also gets a 25 per cent
interest in any expansion of reserves.
The Wisconsin mine and the CDollars 57m investment in Polaris will provide
Rio Algom with a strong base in zinc.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: CPC Intl to shed 2,600 jobs in
cost cutting plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CPC International, the US-based food company whose brands include Hellmann's
mayonnaise, Knorr soups and Mazola corn oil, is to shed 2,600 jobs from its
international workforce of 39,000 over the next two years as part of a
cost-cutting plan.
It said the restructuring would bring a pre-tax charge of Dollars 227m to
second-quarter profits, equivalent to Dollars 137m after tax or 92 cents a
share.
About two-thirds of the charge represented the non-cash costs of writing off
assets, including some plant closures, it said.
CPC has been increasing efficiency over several years by consolidating
production. Past moves have included the closure of six plants in North
America and substantial relocation of production within Europe.
Yesterday, however, Mr CR Shoemate, chairman and chief executive, said the
action already taken was not enough. 'The charge announced today represents
a longer-term, more aggressive view. We are taking actions now for
competitive advantage in the major world markets at the end of the decade,'
he said.
A large proportion of the job cuts will fall in Europe, where unification is
increasing cross-border competition. CPC is responding by transferring
production of its various brands to the plants where they can be produced
most efficiently - for example, by moving production of its Knorr products
for the Nordic market from Switzerland to the Netherlands.
CPC is taking similar action to increase the efficiency of its consumer food
businesses in North America. It said it was also taking steps to strengthen
its competitive position in its Latin American corn refining business.
In the first quarter, volume gains and lower financing costs helped CPC
report a 9 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 98.1m on turnover 6
per cent ahead at Dollars 1.74bn.

units from ICI
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ICI, the international chemicals group, is to sell some of its North
American operations to Harrowston, a Toronto-based company which emerged
from the ashes of the fallen Belzberg family empire.
Harrowston declined to reveal terms but said the deal would be all cash.
The deal involves ICI's polyols businesses and includes a factory in
Delaware which makes a wide range of polyhydric alcohols used in the
pharmaceutical, oral care and confectionery markets. The deal remains
subject to US regulatory approvals and completion of detailed negotiations.
Harrowston's chief executive is Mr Brent Belzberg, nephew of Mr Sam Belzberg
who made a name in the 1980s as one of North America's most formidable
corporate raiders. The Belzbergs' empire, linked through the First City
Financial group, was hit by several loss-making investments and the slump in
real estate markets.
Harrowston was created from First City's remnants in the early 1990s and
recapitalised by a group of large Canadian institutional investors. The
Belzberg family no longer has a stake in the company, beyond a small
shareholding and options held by Mr Brent Belzberg.
As in its latest deal, Harrowston's strategy is to buy businesses put on the
block as part of the rationalisation of much larger companies.
It has bought ICI's North American sulphur products division as well as a
small division of Du Pont, the US chemicals group, and a retail meat
distributor.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: GE Capital out of Kemper race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kemper, the US insurance, fund management and stockbroking group, was on the
verge yesterday of falling to a highly-leveraged Dollars 3.25bn bid from a
smaller US insurance concern.
Conseco, a 15-year-old company based in Carmel, Indiana, offered Dollars 67
a share in cash and securities for Kemper, topping a nearly Dollars 3bn, or
Dollars 60-a-share, all-cash offer from GE Capital, the financial services
subsidiary of General Electric. Hours after Conseco's bid, GE Capital
announced it was dropping out of the race.
In a move which appeared designed to throw GE Capital off-balance, Conseco
had said its offer would expire on Sunday.
GE senior management has been mired recently in the gathering crisis at its
Kidder Peabody securities subsidiary, which culminated in a change in
management at the firm on Wednesday.
Yesterday, GE Capital responded to the new offer with a brief statement
wishing Conseco and Kemper success and adding it would not submit a
counter-bid.
Mr Stephen Hilbert, Conseco's chairman, said he had proposed a merger to
Kemper a year ago, but had been rebuffed.
The new bid follows Kemper's move to put itself up for sale, a decision
which was prompted by the unwanted approach from GE Capital.
Conseco has taken over 11 insurance companies since it was set up by Mr
Hilbert in 1979 with capital of Dollars 10,000. The scale of its
acquisitions grew sharply after 1990, when it set up a buy-out fund to bring
in additional finance. GE Capital was one of the partners in that fund, Mr
Hilbert said.
If successful in its bid for Kemper, Conseco said it would transfer the
company's life assurance and real estate businesses to a
recently-established fund. This fund has committed equity of Dollars 624m,
and its two biggest investors are Conseco and Calpers, the public-sector
pension fund, each with Dollars 100m.
Conseco said it would pay Dollars 56 in cash for each Kemper share, together
with Dollars 11 worth of its own shares, based on the closing price of
Dollars 50.50 on Wednesday.
It said it had obtained a commitment from Citibank for Dollars 1.22bn of
senior bank finance, and a letter from Morgan Stanley expressing confidence
in its ability to raise a further Dollars 750m of subordinated debt.
The acquisition, and sale of some Kemper businesses to the new buy-out fund,
would leave Conseco with gearing of 47 per cent, compared with a current
level of around 17 per cent, said Mr Hilbert. He added, though, that the
Kemper businesses would bring it secure fee income, enabling it to support
the extra debt costs.

<TEXT>
Thomson-CSF, the French electronics company, is planning to buy the missile
electronics and optronics business of Thorn EMI, the diversified UK
industrial group.
The deal, which would give Thomson-CSF the European lead in missile
electronics that it already holds in optronics, is subject to final contract
negotiation and approval by the French and UK governments.
The Thorn EMI business has a turnover of Pounds 90m, with slightly more than
two-thirds coming from missiles.
Mr Francois Carayol, strategic director for Thomson-CSF, said the deal would
lead to closer co-operation with British Aerospace Dynamics, with whom Thorn
EMI works on the Rapier and Asraam missiles. It would also increase
Thomson-CSF's workshare on the Trigat anti-tank missile.
Mr Carayol claimed this would not cause conflict with Matra, the missile
making division of the French Lagardere group, which is separately
negotiating with BAe to form a joint missile company.
Thomson-CSF already has a Anglo-French joint venture with Pilkington
Optronics. It said the new deal would give it a role in the European Fighter
Aircraft.

<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has broadened Europe's assault on
Japan's domination of the the world market for advanced liquid-crystal
displays (LCDs) by selling a 10 per cent stake in its Flat Panel Display
subsidiary to E. Merck of Germany.
The transaction means Philips' stake in the company will fall to 70 per
cent. It declined to give financial details.
The Dutch group's two existing European partners, the French companies
Thomson and Sagem, will each retain their 10 per cent holdings in the
Eindhoven-based Flat Panel Display.
E. Merck, a chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, makes materials used in the
manufacture of LCDs, and wants to keep abreast of developments in the field,
according to Philips.
The Eindhoven factory already sells active LCDs, but full commercial
production is not due to start until autumn.
As the only European contender in the LCD market, it is gearing towards
challenging the lead built up by Japanese companies such as Sharp, Toshiba
and Hitachi.
Flat Panel Display, established in 1993, employs 650 people. Philips has
said that the company's potential turnover over the next few years could run
into hundreds of millions of guilders.
Unlike passive LCDs, which are widely-used in digital watches, active LCDs
can accommodate colour moving pictures, making them an important part of
displays in 'notebook' personal computers, as well as in consumer
electronics. They can also be used as flat-screen televisions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Avesta Sheffield, the Swedish-British stainless steel group, has revised
upwards its profits forecast for 1994, on the strength of rising sales
prices for stainless steel.
Avesta, 40 per cent-owned by British Steel, returned a SKr111m (Dollars
14.2m) profit after financial items in the first quarter of this year, on
sales of SKr3.98bn. It said at the time it expected that level of
profit-ability would be maintained for the whole year.
The group says the return will be 'significantly better' if current market
trends continue. Avesta Sheffield, formed in 1992 through a merger between
Sweden's Avesta and the stainless steel interests of British Steel, showed a
loss in 1993 of SKr98m.
Volvo has sold a data company specialising in airline crew timetable
calculation to Ad Opt Technologies of Canada for USDollars 3m. The sale is
part of the Swedish group's strategy of divesting all its interests not
related to core vehicle manufacturing operations.
Merged, Ad Opt, owned by Canadian institutional investors, and Volvo's
Carmen Systems will become a leading specialist in aviation and transport
time-tabling, Volvo said. Carmen's clients include Scandinavian Airlines
System (SAS), Lufthansa and Alitalia. Ad Opt has concentrated to date on
aircraft scheduling in the North American market.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Olivetti and GM arm in satellite
joint venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Olivetti, the Italian computer manufacturer, and Hughes Network Systems, a
subsidiary of General Motors of the US, have formed a joint venture to
exploit the market for business satellite communications in Europe.
Each company will own 50 per cent of the venture, called Hughes Olivetti
Telecom. The first service, Hotstar, will provide interactive data and voice
links between customer sites at a monthly rent of Dollars 280-Dollars 380 a
site.
Each partner has invested an initial Dollars 2m in infrastructure. Total
investment over the first five years is expected to be Dollars 25m.
The venture is targeted at large companies with more than 30 sites. It aims
to build and manage a pan-European network based on a form of satellite
communications called VSat (very small aperture terminal), which is
increasingly being used to provide two-way communications services to
businesses in the US and Europe. The first 'hub' for the service will be
based in London. Talks are under way on establishing hubs in other European
countries. Transmission licences are being agreed on a case-by-case basis.
The initial investment cost is comparatively low, because Hughes is already
an important manufacturer of satellite communications equipment  - it claims
70 per cent of the world VSat market - and because Olivetti has already
established a Europe-wide marketing and computer services network.
The companies say the new infrastructure will meet the telecommunications
requirements of large corporations. However, the intention is also to offer
new services such as software distribution and personalised newspapers.
VSat systems are able to support a combination of voice and data
communications, and can be cheaper than terrestrial equivalents. Some 75,000
two-way VSat systems have been installed in the US.

Canada's financially-troubled Confederation Life Insurance is examining the
future of its UK operations ahead of a proposed capital infusion from
Winnipeg-based Great-West Life Assurance.
Confederation said its options included the sale of its successful UK arm,
which includes a bank as well as group and individual insurance businesses.
The Stevenage-based UK operation had total assets of CDollars 1.8bn
(USDollars 1.3bn) at the end of last year, and manages funds of some Pounds
5bn (Dollars 7.6bn). Pre-tax profits in 1993 were Pounds 27.9m compared with
Pounds 14.2m in 1992. Premium income last year was Pounds 629m against
Pounds 715m in 1992.
The company is one of the leading providers of pooled pension products for
medium- sized companies, while its team of 850 direct sales agents markets a
range of unit-linked individual insurance contracts, including standard term
and savings products.
Last year's results included a CDollars 7.1m profit from Confederation Bank,
whose growth has recently been spurred by an offshore deposit-taking
operation in Jersey. The bank offers residential mortgage loans and deposit
account facilities.
Overall, the UK subsidiary, which began trading in 1906, has 1,600 employees
and 58 regional branches.
Confederation is a mutual company owned by its policyholders. It has
suffered from the downturn in the North American property market, which
resulted in loan losses of CDollars 147m last year.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Italian bank plans restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the state Treasury-controlled Italian bank, has
announced a far-reaching restructuring plan as part of preparations for
possible privatisation.
The plan shows that Mr Mario Sarcinelli, who took over as BNL chairman in
April, is moving quickly to distance the group from its turbulent past, and
reposition it as a competitive 'universal' bank.
One effect of the plan will be to hive off L700bn (Dollars 436.7m) of
outstanding unguaranteed loans to Iraq into a separate financial vehicle.
BNL Finance will buy the loans at their current depressed market value.
Unauthorised loans to Iraq, made by BNL's Atlanta branch, were revealed in
1989, triggering an international outcry. BNL is fighting through the courts
to force repayment of a further Dollars 350m of guaranteed loans to Iraq.
The most important part of the BNL restructuring, however, is the absorption
of three medium and long-term credit subsidiaries into the main part of the
group. This will increase total assets of the parent company to L145,545bn
from L108,506bn. Mr Davide Croff, BNL's joint managing director, said
yesterday the process of BNL restructuring would be 'very quick'.
However, Mr Sarcinelli, former director-general of the Treasury and
vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
would not be drawn on a possible date for privatisation. He reiterated that
BNL would need new capital, either through a cash injection from the
Treasury, or through the transfer of a Treasury-owned credit institution
into the BNL portfolio.
Separately, the Treasury is preparing for the eventual sale of more of its
shares in Imi, the financial services group partly privatised in January.

FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Argentaria seeks to delay next
phase of sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentaria, the state-controlled Spanish banking group, wants to hold back
its next phase of privatisation until next year, while it lays the ground
for new expansion plans, chairman Mr Francisco Luzon said yesterday.
A third share flotation, reducing the government's stake to a minority, was
expected by the end of this year. Almost 50 per cent of the shares were
placed on the stock markets in two heavily-oversubscribed tranches last
year, bringing in Pta296bn (Dollars 2.2bn) to the Spanish treasury. Some 24
per cent of the capital is in foreign hands. Mr Luzon indicated this might
rise to 30 per cent in the next privatisation phase.
He said he envisaged that the government would retain at least a 20 per cent
share 'for a relatively long time', in the interests of stability.
Argentaria was formed three years ago through an amalgamation of the state's
banking interests.
Privatisation would have to take place gradually whatever government was in
place, Mr Luzon said, referring to the possibility of an early general
election. An election now would probably replace the current Socialist
government with a conservative Popular Party administration.
At the bank's first open annual shareholders' meeting today, Mr Luzon will
set out his strategy in the wake of Argentaria's failed bid in April for
control of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the banking group
restructured after Bank of Spain intervention late last year. The contest
for Banesto was won by the private-sector Banco Santander.
Mr Luzon said Argentaria aimed to become more competitive, winning market
share in new business areas and reinforcing its international and investment
banking sides.
It was 'in a buying mood', he said, indicating that expansion in retail
banking might entail acquisition of a bank or an additional branch network.
However, it had no specific plans. Argentaria was also looking at
non-banking investments in service sectors such as mobile telephones.
At the same time, Argentaria would be ready to sell its 24 per cent stake in
Banco Atlantico, a Barcelona-based bank controlled by Arab Banking
Corporation, if it were offered a good price.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo signs migraine deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, Europe's biggest drug company, has signed another deal in a string of
collaborations with biotechnology companies.
The company has bought most of the worldwide marketing rights to migraine
treatments developed by Spectra Biomedical, a California group.
The terms of the deal were not revealed beyond a three year agreement for
research payments and that Glaxo would pay royalties to Spectra on product
sales.
Glaxo is seeking to develop a successor to its current migraine treatment,
Imigran, which is one of its fastest growing products.
The tie-up with Spectra takes to 12 the number of biotechnology
collaborations established by Glaxo. It is the first in migraine.
Spectra's approach is to try to determine the genetic basis for migraine.
This is the first collaboration for Spectra, an unquoted company started a
year ago by Mr Stephen Peroutka, formerly head of neuroscience at Genentech,
the Californian biotechnology company which is 60 per cent-owned by Roche,
the Swiss drug company
Mr Peroutka said the number of staff was likely to double to 20 over the
next 12 months.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Caledonia ahead 26% to Pounds 45m - Bulk of
growth provided by associated companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caledonia Investments, the investment vehicle controlled by the Cayzer
family, yesterday announced a 22 per cent increase in its net asset value
during the 12 months to March 31, from 559p to 681p.
Pre-tax profits increased by 26 per cent, from Pounds 36m to Pounds 45.2m.
The bulk of the growth came from the associated trading companies, primarily
Bristow Helicopters and Exco, which increased their contribution from Pounds
12.2m to Pounds 23.7m.
The results were in line with analysts' expectations, and the shares were
unchanged at 688p.
Bristow was only owned for 9 months of the 1992-93 year, but the company had
a strong year in 1993-94, repaying Pounds 36.5m of debt to reduce the total
to Pounds 79m.
Mr Peter Buckley, chairman, said a weaker oil price had led to a tougher
North Sea market, and Bristow's earnings were likely to decline in the
current year.
Exco, included for seven months in 1992, contributed Pounds 41.5m, up 52 per
cent, in the year to December 1993 aided by a surge in volumes in the
government securities market.
Exco's flotation should be launched next week, but Caledonia has said that
it will maintain its 27.3 per cent stake. The flotation will not affect the
stake's book value, but it could substantially boost external valuations of
Caledonia's worth.
The industrial division, principally 75 per cent-owned Amber Industrial,
contributed Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 3.8m) which included Pounds 700,000 from the
sale of Causeway Steel Products.
The property and services division suffered a loss of Pounds 1.8m due to a
Pounds 3.7m provision against valuations.
The company has a broad spread of smaller investments. These include a 23
per cent stake in Close Brothers, the merchant banking group, which is now
worth about Pounds 51m after a profits turnround last year.
Caledonia is proceeding with a 33 per cent stake in Sun International, which
recently invested in a Dollars 125m (Pounds 82.2m) resort development in the
Bahamas.
At the year end, Caledonia had cash and short-term deposits of Pounds 59.2m.
The recommended final dividend of 10.8p makes a full-year distribution of
16.2p (15p), up 8 per cent.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tom Brown's survival days - Tim Burt
considers the strategy to turn round United Industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Tom Brown took control of United Industries last year he pursued a
single strategy: survival.
Burdened with debts of Pounds 6.6m, he knew the precision tools and springs
manufacturer needed major surgery if it was to make it through the
recession.
Three months after his arrival he unveiled the first part of his 'pain
first, relief later' strategy by announcing losses of Pounds 3.63m,
including Pounds 2.27m of exceptional costs, and warning of choppy
conditions ahead.
Having abandoned the helm at Fenner, the engineering group which he likened
to steering an oil tanker, Mr Brown soon realised he was on board a much
smaller vessel.
'The company was being run to keep the banks from the door. The debt
repayment programme was stripping all our funds and my job was simply to
keep it afloat.'
A year later, United Industries has undergone a refit which saw it double in
size and emerge with a new management crew.
Although Mr Brown has been widely credited with the relaunch, he claims the
initiative was born not in the company's Leicester headquarters but in the
City offices of Smith New Court.
Concerned at the group's lack of working capital, he asked the financial
advisers to consider a Pounds 2m rights issue to raise fresh cash and reduce
debt.
Smith New Court was unimpressed.
'They told us we were just fiddling with deck chairs and to go for something
bolder,' recalls Mr Brown.
Encouraged to think big, United began casting around for acquisitions which
would return it to profitability after three years of losses.
The search ended with a familiar partner - BBA Group. The engineering
company, which effectively gave birth to United in 1988 by selling it stakes
in United Spring &amp; Steel Group and Ratcliffe Industries, attracted Mr
Brown's attention last August when it unveiled plans to sell up to 12
subsidiaries with a combined turnover of Pounds 200m.
Following lengthy negotiations, United last month announced the Pounds 25m
acquisition of three BBA businesses, Holden Hydroman, Perplas and Railko,
funded with a Pounds 26m placing and open offer.
Ironically, the deal, which doubled the group into a business with turnover
of Pounds 60m a year, probably would not have taken place had it not been
for the steady fall in United's share price following the October 1987
crash.
BBA, which received a 21.23 per cent stake in United for Ratcliffe and
United Springs, could not afford to sell after the shares tumbled from more
than 140p to about 14p.
'Had it not been for the recession and collapse in the share price, BBA
would have got out and we might not have survived,' admits Mr Brown.
Having resuscitated the group, Mr Brown has begun focusing on expansion and
strengthening its three pre-acquisition divisions - materials handling,
springs and precision machinery.
He discounts a fire sale but admits that doubts remain on the long-term
future of subsidiaries which continue to suffer in worsening markets.
In the bleakest scenario, United would no longer be able to sustain its
existing businesses and become dependent on the plastics and seals
activities of the acquisitions.
While declining to predict the future shape of the group, Mr Brown has
indicated his determination to concentrate on the purchases.
'At BBA these businesses had a Cinderella complex because they were always
on the periphery. We've brought them centre stage and we're offering them
new challenges and access to international markets.'
There is also a growing awareness that some United products might sit more
comfortably within other groups, but wary of demotivating its workforce, the
board declines to specify its main areas of concern.
Nevertheless, some industry analysts believe the materials handling
business, which makes automated storage systems, may be sold. They point to
United's recent nine month results, showing losses of Pounds 1.5m, in which
it highlighted very difficult conditions in the division.
Cautious by nature, Mr Brown says only: 'We cannot have any weak positions.
Something which isn't strong, I'd like to see in other hands.'
He is, meanwhile, pressing ahead with a reappraisal of group strategy and
instilling his expansive vision of a business which can no longer rely on
sales in Britain and Europe alone. If his gamble pays off, the latest
acquisitions will provide the springboard to new markets and product areas.
Predicting a return to profitability this year, he says: 'We have to grow
and put more emphasis on marketing, then volumes will come up. That is the
key to our survival.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: High stock market activity helps ShareLink
to Pounds 6.19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ShareLink Investment Services, the share dealing company which floated last
July, almost doubled annual profits after a year of unusually high stock
market activity. Immediate prospects, however, are more subdued.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 6.19m in the year to March 31, against Pounds
3.12m. The comparative figures have been prepared as if the group then
existed in its present form.
Turnover rose to Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 14.3m). It was bolstered by the third
British Telecommunications privatisation issue, a more than doubling in the
amount of personal equity plan funds under administration and rising
subscriptions to information services.
However, the company warned that trading volumes on the UK equity market had
declined since February and that 'if these conditions were to persist
throughout the current year, ShareLink's earnings would suffer'.
Mr David Jones, the chief executive and biggest single shareholder, said,
however: 'I don't think we'll see volumes go down. The only debate in
ShareLink is when the upturn will take place.'
The group announced that it was preparing moves into Europe and North
America. Mr Jones talked of 'advance negotiations' but said there would be
no immediate moves. He added that ShareLink was planning to enter mortgage
broking and selling, although not with its own capital.
ShareLink's immediate aim is the expansion of its services outside simple
share transactions so that it reduces dependence on what can be a volatile
stream of income. 'If we convert 20 per cent of gross turnover into fixed
earnings, then we'd have 200,000 account holders and Pounds 1bn under
administration,' Mr Jones said.
Earnings per share rose to 26.11p (12.65p). A proposed final dividend of 6p
brings the total for the year to 9p.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hilclare broadens security interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hilclare, the USM-traded maker of lighting and security products, yesterday
announced that it was paying up to Pounds 9m for First Security (Guards) and
was making a placing and open offer to fund the Pounds 4.95m cash element of
the price.
Hilclare's shares were suspended at 43p yesterday at the company's request,
and will remain suspended until July 19 following an annual meeting on the
preceding day to approve the deal.
Mr Ian Quinlan, chairman, said that Hilclare aimed to concentrate future
operations in sectors of the security industry which would be selected for
their potential to generate significant profit growth and cash flow.
FSG, which provides security guarding services almost exclusively within the
area bounded by the M25, was 'the first stage of this strategy'.
Of the initial Pounds 8m consideration, Pounds 4.95m is payable in cash,
Pounds 2.35m in new ordinary shares and Pounds 700,000 in secured
convertible loan stock. A further Pounds 1m is due if FSG achieves specified
profit targets.
Samuel Montagu has conditionally underwritten a placing of 21.52m ordinary
shares at 23p, giving Hilclare a market value of Pounds 8.4m - 4.8m of the
shares were subject to an open offer to qualifying shareholders, also at
23p.
Hilclare also yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 482,000 (Pounds
54,000) for the year ended March 31, after making a Pounds 396,000
exceptional charge this time for its withdrawal from the production of
control panels for security systems.
Turnover fell to Pounds 2.64m (Pounds 2.9m) and operating profits on
continuing operations slipped from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 43,000. The
recommended single final dividend is an unchanged 0.5p.
Mr Quinlan said trading in the current year had started well for the
enlarged group.
The chairman said Hilclare intended to change its name to Orbis and was
planning a move to the main market.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Prudential buys Wimpey share of Little
Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Wimpey yesterday announced that it had exchanged contracts to sell
its 50 per cent share of the Little Britain property scheme in the City of
London to the Prudential, the life assurance company, for Pounds 95m.
The 473,000 sq ft office building, which was completed in 1991, is at the
end of London Wall and is occupied by Clifford Chance, a firm of lawyers.
Nippon Life owns the other 50 per cent of the property, which it bought for
Pounds 110m in August 1991. The freeholders are the Corporation of London.
The deal is expected to be completed next week. It has an initial yield of
7.5 per cent.
Mr Joe Dwyer, Wimpey chief executive, described the sale, which equates to
its book values, as satisfactory. 'Consistent with our strategy, it is a
further significant step in realising our portfolio assets for investment in
our core activities,' he said.
The sale is in line with Wimpey's strategy, announced three years ago, of
disposing of long term property investments. The company now has just Pounds
60m of investment property to dispose of, most notably its Vantage West
project in west London, which will be sold once it has found a tenant.
Prudential said it was interested in making further property acquisitions.
'Notwithstanding the size of this purchase, Prudential are still in the
market for further City investments where the long term returns are
attractive,' said Mr Howard Dawson, Prudential's associate director.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Loss at Clyde Blowers widens to Pounds 0.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clyde Blowers, the maker of equipment for boiler cleaning and materials
handling, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 514,313 in its seasonally
unfavourable half year to the end of February, compared with a deficit of
Pounds 17,632 last time.
The result was in line with forecasts made in April. Turnover nearly
trebled, from Pounds 2.27m to Pounds 6.14m.
Clyde has been transformed since Mr James McColl bought a 29.9 per cent
stake in 1992 and became executive chairman.
In 1993 the company bought Sturtevant Engineering, a Brighton-based maker of
pneumatic conveyancing equipment, and Boiler Products Engineering, a boiler
cleaning concern based in Belgium. In April this year it bought
Simon-Macawber, a maker of pneumatic pressure and vacuum conveyancing
equipment, from Simon Engineering for between Pounds 4m and Pounds 4.5m,
funded by a Pounds 5.2m rights issue.
Mr McColl said the loss reflected the continued restructuring of the core
company and its acquisitions, and to the fact that the first half is
traditionally slow because of weak orders for spare parts in the winter. He
expected a profit for the full year; profits for the 12 months to end-August
1993 amounted to Pounds 205,000.
'We have now got to the critical size we want to be, with annualised
turnover of about Pounds 27m, with the Simon-Macawber purchase adding Pounds
14m annual sales,' said Mr McColl. 'We're going to concentrate on organic
growth rather than acquisitions for the next year to 18 months.'
The company is negotiating to sell part of its site at Clydebank for
conversion to a discount food store. The development potential of the rest
of the site is being examined and the company may move to a better facility.
Losses per share widened to 9.79p (0.53p) but the interim dividend goes up
to 1.5p (1.33p).

<TEXT>
Thorn EMI, the rental and music group, said yesterday it had agreed in
principle to sell part of its defence activities to Thomson-CSF, the French
defence electronics group.
The deal, while not unexpected, amounts to a significant step in the
consolidation of the European defence industry, where pressure to merge has
been growing because of falling defence procurement budgets.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Turnover of the activities sold, which
include missile-fusing systems and electro-optics, was about Pounds 80m last
year. Some 1,100 people work in the division affected, which is based at
Hayes in Middlesex.
Thomson-CSF is already a strong player in electro-optics, while the Thorn
unit it is now acquiring expects to do lucrative work providing thermal
imaging and infra-red systems for the European Fighter Aircraft.
The deal leaves out Thorn's defence electronics activity in three other
centres - Crawley, Wells and Rugeley - whose combined sales were about
Pounds 110m last year.
However a company spokesman said it was still hoped to dispose of those
businesses. 'As it is our strategy to concentrate on the music and rental
sectors, we will continuing to looking new homes for the remaining defence
electronics businesses,' he said.
The Crawley unit provides electronic support systems such as radar and
jamming devices for ships and aircraft, and analysts said the British
government would look carefully at any deal which let this business fall
into foreign hands.
MoD officials have said they have no objection to foreign interests taking
equity stakes and earning dividends from British defence companies.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: ML recovers with Pounds 5.23m and restores
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ML Holdings, the aerospace, defence and electronics group, yesterday
reported a Pounds 5.23m pre-tax profit for the year to March 31, compared
with an Pounds 11.2m loss last time.
The group underscored its return to pre-tax profits - the first since 1991 -
by proposing to resume dividend payments.
Earnings per share of 2.9p compared with losses of 18.4p and the board is
recommending a 0.85p final dividend. It intends to pay both an interim and
final dividend in future. The shares closed 4p higher at 45p.
Mr Howard Grant, chief executive said: 'In 1993 we laid down our strategy
for recovery. The first stage of the process has been successfully
completed. We now intend to build upon this so that recovery leads into a
period of growth.'
Turnover increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 100.5m (Pounds 84.9m) with
particular strength in overseas markets. Overall sales per employee advanced
by 30 per cent.
An operating profit of Pounds 6.39m compared with a Pounds 7.01m loss
previously. The turnround was underpinned by a strong recovery in the
aerospace and marine division, which achieved an operating profit of Pounds
3.84m (Pounds 488,000 loss) on turnover up by 19 per cent to Pounds 46.1m.
The aircraft and cargo handling division reported an Pounds 334,000
operating profit, compared with a Pounds 756,000 loss, on turnover increased
16 per cent to Pounds 26.8m.
The electronic component distribution division increased operating profits
by 61 per cent to Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 1.38m) on turnover up 19 per cent to
Pounds 27.6m.
Net interest costs were reduced to Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 2.74m), partly
reflecting a decline in borrowings which fell to Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 13.8m),
equivalent to gearing of 39 per cent.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Southern Electric up at Pounds 222m -
Advance bolstered by strong performance from non-core businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp improvement in the performance of non-core businesses helped
Southern Electric, the power distributor in the south-east of England, to
increase annual pre-tax profits by 18.5 per cent to Pounds 222m, a figure at
the top end of City expectations.
Turnover for the 12 months to March 31 fell slightly to Pounds 1.78bn
(Pounds 1.8bn). Earnings per share were ahead 17 per cent at 64p and the
recommended 16p final dividend makes a total of 22.7p, an increase of 15.8
per cent.
While operating profits of the distribution business were up 2 per cent at
Pounds 182m, the supply business achieved a 49 per cent improvement to
Pounds 32.4m, including Pounds 15m of profits from previous years recovered
under regulatory adjustments. Non-core businesses chipped in Pounds 18m
(Pounds 2.4m).
The sharpest improvement was shown by MP Burke, the utility contractor,
which lifted profits from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 4.3m. Southern's contracting
arm also impressed with a Pounds 3m contribution, against Pounds 600,000 in
1992-93. Losses from Powerhouse, Southern's retailing joint venture, were
reduced to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 7.2m).
The improved core performance was helped by the company's cost-cutting
efforts. In the main business, manpower was 497 down at 4,771.
Southern charged Pounds 21.6m against profits for future restructuring and
Pounds 12m for information technology costs already incurred.
COMMENT
Southern's shares have taken a bigger hit than most of its rec counterparts
in recent weeks, but this probably owes more to the institutions targeting
bigger companies when offloading stock than to any disenchantment with the
group. There was certainly nothing to complain about in yesterday's results.
The core job cuts mean that Southern should easily be able to exceed its
target of 1,000 within three years from March 1993. Simplifying management
structures will also help to reduce costs, which Southern expects by the
mid-1990s to be Pounds 25m lower than 1992-93 levels. Meanwhile, the
non-core business are performing well enough to suggest that the target of
producing 15 per cent of profits from them by the end of the century may be
over-cautious. Generation activities alone could be contributing Pounds 15m
to Pounds 20m within a couple of years. The potential downside, as for all
the recs, is the regulator's distribution review due for completion this
summer. However, Southern seems as well placed as any to cope; last year's
profits were depressed by a cautious approach to provisioning. And if things
get really tough, Southern could perhaps think about releasing some of the
Pounds 24m it has previously provided for adverse European rulings on
pensions; other power companies have already done so. On a prospective yield
of about 5.7 per cent, assuming a 25.8p dividend this year, the shares are
not overpriced compared with other recs.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Windsor back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Windsor, the insurance broker which specialises in sports, leisure and
contingency business, is back in the black. The group, which was hard hit by
write-downs on a property investment in 1993, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 18,000 for the six months to March 31.
The corresponding loss last year amounted to Pounds 1.9m, including Pounds
1.7m exceptional items. Earnings per share were 0.01p (loss 5.64p and an
adjusted loss of 0.61p).
Windsor said it was in talks to let its troublesome investment property, a
25,000 sq ft office block in Hemel Hempstead, Herts. Some Pounds 1.7m in
provisions were incurred as a result of writing down the market value of the
property last year and Windsor has lost over Pounds 2m on the property since
it was acquired in 1989.
The group's core insurance business continued to perform well.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals behind 56% rise to Pounds 22m
at Courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Courts, the home furnishings retailer, yesterday became the second UK
company to pay foreign income dividends, but went one step better than its
predecessor, BAT, by offering to absorb the tax cost for investors.
Courts is increasing the final pay-out by 36 per cent to 5p, for a total 27
per cent ahead to 7p. The increase in the final dividend represents a 9 per
cent improvement on the previous final, plus an additional 25 per cent rise
on the higher pay-out to protect shareholders from a 25 per cent tax burden.
Mr Bruce Cohen, chief executive, said the decision to pay FIDs would benefit
both investors and the company by helping to eliminate its advance
corporation tax surplus. Courts was likely to continue paying further FIDs,
given its unrelieved ACT burden of some Pounds 4.2m, he added.
Mr Cohen was speaking at the announcement of Courts' results, which showed a
56 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.1m for the year to
end-March. The outcome included an exceptional credit of Pounds 9.43m
following the flotation of a stake in its Singapore subsidiary and property
losses.
The results were about Pounds 2m below expectations, with analysts expecting
profits of Pounds 15m before the Singapore credit. Forecasts for the current
year were pulled back from about Pounds 17m to Pounds 14m and the shares
fell 24p to 779p.
The disappointment came from dull trading and adverse currency movements in
the Caribbean region. Courts' other overseas businesses continued to move
ahead, particularly in south-east Asia.
Sales of overseas businesses grew by 26 per cent to Pounds 148m, with
profits before deferred income and exceptional credits up by 16 per cent to
Pounds 22.6m.
Transfers to deferred credits rose by 30 per cent to Pounds 11.8m. The
transfers arise from Courts' hire purchase scheme, which is particularly
popular in Asia. Courts finances the lease deals itself, but does not take
the income from product sales into profits until payments are made. This is
put into a deferred profit reserve which stood at Pounds 49.3m at the
year-end. This would eventually flow through to profits, Mr Cohen said.
The UK had shown signs of a recovery in the housing market, although it was
still 'far from buoyant', said Mr Cohen. Nevertheless, Courts was encouraged
enough to revive its expansion programme, which had been on hold for some
time. Five new superstores were planned for this year, to bring the total to
34.
Earnings rose by 73 per cent to 65.36p. Excluding the exceptional credit,
earnings were 21 per cent higher at 31.17p.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise may start buying Lasmo shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation mounted yesterday that Enterprise Oil could next week begin
buying shares in Lasmo, its unwilling bid target, as the deadline draws near
for acceptance of its Pounds 1.7bn bid.
Enterprise, which almost two months ago launched its hostile all-paper bid
for Lasmo, is allowed to buy up to 10 per cent in the market. It is believed
that Enterprise has set aside Pounds 150m for share purchases if it is not
confident it can reach 50 per cent through straight acceptances.
Meanwhile, the rival oil explorers yesterday exchanged what are expected to
be their final shots in the bid battle before shareholders make up their
minds next week.
Both companies reiterated their arguments for and against the offer. Mr
Rudolph Agnew, chairman of Lasmo, said acceptance of the offer would mean
giving away a disproportionate share of assets and future growth for an
'inadequate share in an enlarged company'.
Enterprise accused Lasmo of repeating 'the same tired assertions'. It said
an enlarged company offered better gearing to the oil price through the
warrants being offered to shareholders, and greater financial strength to
exploit assets. It is expected to send a detailed document to Lasmo
shareholders tomorrow.
The argument will now be carried directly to institutional investors, with
both sides spending the last seven days canvasing for support. Mr Graham
Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive, is currently in the US
doing the rounds of institutions.
Enterprise's shares fell 10p to 413p, while Lasmo shares were steady at
149p.

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tex
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced project volume and further provisions for exceptional costs hit
second half trading at Tex, a provider of consumables to the plastic, steel
and energy industries.
As a result, the company finished the year to March 31 with a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 273,000, against a Pounds 94,000 loss, after exceptionals of
Pounds 204,000 (Pounds 46,000).
At the interim stage, Tex had turned round a Pounds 146,000 loss into a
profit of Pounds 486,000, after Pounds 104,000 charges last time for factory
closure and redundancy costs.
Turnover rose 25 per cent to Pounds 20.8m (Pounds 16.7m). Mr Anthony
Burrows, chairman, said the slow recovery from the recession had continued,
reflected in higher but erratic levels of demand and pressure on margins.
Mr Burrows explained that although trading was improving, it was not yet
sufficient to recommend a dividend - the last payment was in 1990. Earnings
per share were 2.4p (1.5p losses).

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Snacks setback at JLI Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A setback in its snack foods operations was behind a decline at JLI Group in
the year ended March 31.
Trading profits at the snacks and ingredients maker showed little change at
Pounds 5.85m (Pounds 5.95m) but after carrying restructuring and
reorganisation costs of Pounds 1.15m, pre-tax profits were down by the same
amount at Pounds 4.06m. Turnover of Pounds 111.6m (Pounds 104.7m) included
Pounds 3.89m from acquisitions.
On a divisional basis food services reported operating profits of Pounds
2.45m (Pounds 2.06m) on turnover ahead to Pounds 42.1m (Pounds 40.7m); food
ingredients increased to Pounds 2.56m (Pounds 1.53m) on sales of Pounds
38.5m (Pounds 31.2m) but snack foods fell to Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 2.86m) on
turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 32.8m).
Mr Yoav Gottesman, chairman, said the company had tackled underperforming
areas and addressed changes in its market, and the current year had begun in
line with expectations. He saw potential for growth 'both organically and
through strategic acquisitions'.
The final dividend is raised to 3.2p, making a total of 4.8p (4.65p) on
earnings per share of 7.1p (9.3p).

FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Singed fingers among the recs - Michael
Smith on the diversification lessons for power companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contrast could be instructive. After electricity privatisation four
years ago, East Midlands Electricity was intent on broadening its horizons
and became the most acquisitive of the 12 regional power companies.
Manweb, however, stuck to its core businesses, even to the extent of holding
back from the dash for gas in which all other 11 regional companies invested
in generation plants.
The two companies were this week displaying the results of their policies.
East Midlands was not flattered by the comparison.
While Manweb's pre-tax profits rose by 14 per cent to Pounds 126m, East
Midlands reported a Pounds 100m fall to Pounds 51m after taking an
exceptional hit of Pounds 130m as a result of diversifications into
contracting and home security and write-offs on its retailing interests.
It seems to have learnt its lesson. Mr Nigel Rudd, recently appointed
chairman, made his name as the head of the acquisitive Williams Holdings,
but he says electricity companies should stick to what they know about and
concentrate on their core activities.
East Midlands has ruled out for now the possibility of following other
regional power companies in providing other utility services. But what about
other companies? Are there more non-core problems ahead?
Almost certainly there are; but the worst fears are about what the companies
will be tempted to diversify into in the future, rather than what they have
already grown or bought into.
After seeing the disastrous results of the privatised water company's forays
outside their main business, the power companies have been relatively
restrained.
SG Warburg Securities estimates that total investment on non-core activities
by the 12 regional companies is less than Pounds 650m, compared with their
market capitalisation of more than Pounds 12bn. Water companies, by
contrast, have spent about Pounds 1.4bn.
And whereas some of the water companies' most calamitous acquisitions were
overseas, the recs have ventured seriously outside the UK only recently.
This month Norweb paid Dollars 36m (Pounds 23.6m) for a 50 per cent stake in
two gas-fired co-generation facilities in Virginia. Yorkshire Electricity is
to pay an undisclosed sum, thought to be about Pounds 100m, for a 17.3 per
cent stake in Stockholm Energi.
Norweb's investment is viewed in the City as safe, if unexciting.
Yorkshire's foray into Sweden offers opportunities because of the
deregulation of that country's power market and is welcomed by analysts.
Other companies are also considering moves abroad. Midlands Electricity and
Eastern are looking at buying stakes in distribution companies in the Czech
Republic. City reaction would depend on the regulatory regime, which is
still being formulated by the republic.
But even here the outlays are likely to be relatively small, perhaps between
Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m for a stake.
In the UK, where most of the diversification has occurred, the biggest
acquisition was made by London Electricity, which paid Pounds 90m for the
electricity distribution networks of its three London airports.
This is performing above expectations, contributing Pounds 11m operating
profit last year. Again, the City approves because it is so close in nature
to London's core business.
Similarly there is only limited downside in the recs' moves into power
generation. It is possible that Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry
regulator, could rule that these are too expensive later in the decade and
prevent the companies from passing on the costs of what could be expensive
power to customers, but the likelihood seems slim.
He has already said that the deals do not conflict with the companies'
obligation to buy power economically.
There is perhaps more concern among investors about rec ambitions to become
broad-based utility companies. While it may make sense to sell gas and
telecommunication services to customers who already buy power from them, the
competition is intense.
Most of the companies have joined the race to get into the gas market before
it is opened up to competition in 1996, but telecommunications have
attracted fewer recs.
'We looked at it very seriously, but decided it was too risky,' says the
chief executive of one company. 'There are some very big players out there -
BT's profits are the same as our turnover - and they can afford to take big
losses to crowd competitors out of the market.'
Heavy competition is also responsible for extremely tight margins and in
some cases losses in the retailing and contracting businesses. These are not
businesses which most recs would choose to be in were they starting up from
scratch, but which are difficult and expensive to withdraw from.
Retailing and contracting are likely to provide most of the difficulties for
recs in the next year or so. More losses and write-offs are expected by
analysts, although few expect losses of the scale reported by East Midlands.
But perhaps the recs' biggest problems stem from the amount of money they
have.
Buying back shares is one way of dealing with the money, but there is strong
pressure to do more than that. 'On the one hand the City says
diversification is bad for regional power companies,' says one analyst. 'On
the other people say managements lack imagination if they do nothing.
'The recs cannot win either way, but there are bound to be one or two that
trip up by taking the diversification route.'
