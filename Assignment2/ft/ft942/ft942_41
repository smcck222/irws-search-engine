FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Northwest Airlines returns to
the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Northwest Airlines, the US carrier that returned to the stock market last
month after being taken private five years earlier, yesterday reported net
income of Dollars 18.3m in its first quarter, compared with net losses of
Dollars 100.3m last time.
The profit was in sharp contrast with the losses reported a day earlier by
American Airlines and USAir, which said they had been hit by a combination
of exceptionally severe winter weather and low fares.
However, Northwest's figures were flattered by two non-trading items. It
gained Dollars 9.2m before tax from an accounting item relating to its
employee stock ownership plan, and a further Dollars 12.7m from a cut in
depreciation expenses following a revaluation of some of its aircraft.
Operating revenues rose by 5 per cent to Dollars 2.13bn and earnings per
share were 5 cents, compared with losses of Dollars 1.86 last time.
One reason why Northwest's figures suffered less badly than those of
American Airlines and USAir is that its route structure is not concentrated
in the north-east of the US, where the worst of the winter weather struck.
The airline is also benefiting from wage and benefit concessions worth
Dollars 886m over the next three years, under an agreement with its
employees which will give them a 27.4 per cent stake in the company.
Mr John Dasburg, president and chief executive, said seasonal factors
usually produced a loss in the first quarter. He attributed the results to
the company's strategy of concentrating on profitable flying.
During the quarter Northwest rescheduled operations at its Memphis hub to
boost traffic and increase profits. It also announced new services in four
North American markets feeding its hubs.
Internationally, the airline announced a new Pacific spring schedule
including extra flights on its Detroit-Tokyo, Los Angeles-Osaka and
Tokyo-Shanghai-Beijing routes, and eliminated its unprofitable Los
Angeles-Sydney and Seattle-Seoul routes.
Northwest and its European partner, KLM Royal Dutch, also replaced first
class with world business class accommodation on intercontinental flights.

An arbitrator has failed to resolve the three-year succession dispute
between Harrison and Wallace McCain, the brothers who control McCain Foods,
the multinational frozen-foods group based in the Canadian province of New
Brunswick.
Though the mediator declared invalid a resolution passed by the McCain board
which sought to remove Mr Wallace McCain as joint chief executive, he made
no finding on the brothers' disagreement over who should succeed them. Mr
Wallace McCain favours his son Michael, while
Mr Harrison McCain prefers Mr Allison McCain, who holds a senior position in
the group's UK subsidiary.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Cummins ahead at Dollars 54.6m
for first term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Cummins Engine Company, the US manufacturer of heavy-duty diesel engines for
trucks, school buses, and power generation plants recorded a strong
improve-ment in first-quarter net earnings.
The group lifted net income to Dollars 54.6m, or Dollars 1.35 a share, on
sales of Dollars 1.1bn, up from Dollars 41.1m or Dollars 1.12 a share, on
sales of Dollars 1bn in last year's first quarter.
'We are pleased to show continued improvement in our results as we benefit
from good business conditions in most of the markets we serve,' said Mr
James Henderson, Cummins' president. 'We expect second-quarter performance
to be strong, with results above those achieved in the first quarter.'
Sales of engines for heavy duty trucks in the North American market were
particularly strong in the quarter, leading to increased production
schedules at Cummins' Jamestown, New York plant.
Cummins said sales to industrial markets also increased significantly over
the 1993 fourth quarter, particularly in the agricultural and con-struction
segments of its business.
Sales of power generation equipment declined from the fourth quarter, and
sales of mid-size engines also weakened.
This was the result of some business being pulled from the first quarter
into the fourth to avoid price increases associated with emission changes in
engines or equipment price increases.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Texas Instruments turns in best
quarterly results
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer,
yesterday reported its best quarterly results. It also announced a broad
restructuring of its European operations and the sale of some its software
product lines. About 1,064 jobs will be eliminated, most of them in Europe.
Net income for the quarter jumped to Dollars 134m, or Dollars 1.41 per
share, from Dollars 81m, or 85 cents, for the first quarter of 1993.
Strong growth in semiconductor sales produced a 30 per cent jump in
first-quarter revenues, to Dollars 2.45bn from Dollars 1.88bn in the same
period last year.
The company said it would create business centres with pan-European
responsibilities to replace its traditional country-by-country approach. The
restructuring is expected to result eventually in annual savings of about
Dollars 54m.
The first-quarter results include a pre-tax charge of Dollars 83m for the
costs of restructuring the European operations.
An additional pre-tax charge of Dollars 49m was taken for the costs of
divesting 'non-strategic product lines', primarily in information
technology, the company said.
Excluding the effect of charges and one-time royalty gains, profit from
operations for the quarter would have been Dollars 256m and net income would
have been Dollars 165m, or Dollars 1.74 per share.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Small shareholders seek bank
boardroom voice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholder meetings at Italy's state-controlled banks used to be brisk
affairs. Once IRI, the state holding company, had voted its majority stake
there wasn't much point in the 30 or 40 other shareholders present
prolonging the agony.
Privatisation seems to have changed all that, as 500 shareholders in Credito
Italiano learned to their cost last Saturday in Genoa's converted cotton
exchange. The first assembly since the December sell-off of IRI's 64 per
cent stake lasted until 5am on Sunday morning.
The prospect of spending most of the weekend in a half-empty conference
hall, with only professional investors and a well-thumbed annual report for
company, is still not a great draw for ordinary Italians. In Genoa, there
was little sign of the fabled Piccolo Azionista, the small shareholder for
whom 40 per cent of the bank's shares were reserved in the original sale.
Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), privatised in February, faces an even
tougher challenge attracting the small shareholder to its assembly in Milan
tomorrow.
But apart from disappointment about the low turnout - Credito Italiano had
expected at least 800 people in the 1,500-seat hall - there is also concern
about who will control strategy at the newly privatised banks. In
particular, analysts point out that many of the main shareholders of Credito
Italiano and BCI are old allies of Mediobanca, the Milanese merchant bank.
The theory goes that as the Italian banking system opens up to greater
domestic and international competition, Mediobanca will need to protect its
core activities of medium and long-term lending and corporate finance.
Stakes in the privatised banks are limited to 3 per cent, but directors
sympathetic to Mediobanca could still help ensure that relations with
Credito Italiano and BCI, both of which already distribute Mediobanca
financial products through their retail network, remain cosy rather than
confrontational.
Events since last weekend's Credito Italiano assembly seem to have confirmed
this interpretation. Of the 11 directors elected on Saturday, at least five
have strong Mediobanca links. Three, including the privatised bank's chief
executive Mr Egidio Giuseppe Bruno, are also Mediobanca directors and were
duly appointed to the Credito Italiano five-man executive committee at
Monday's first board meeting.
Observers expect Saturday's BCI meeting to yield a board similarly friendly
to Mediobanca, helped by the fact that Mr Pietro Grandjacquet, BCI's chief
executive, announced last weekend that he would not seek re-election. Mr
Grandjacquet, in spite of having a seat on Mediobanca's board, was said to
be the principal advocate of a more independent strategy for BCI. He could
well be replaced on Saturday by Mr Enrico Beneduce, a senior manager of BCI
and nephew of Mr Enrico Cuccia, honorary chairman of Mediobanca.
Whether Mediobanca decides to use this influence, and how, remains to be
seen. Other analysts believe the merchant bank's role has been exaggerated
and the independent line will be championed by representatives of
up-and-coming Italian companies not yet in the Mediobanca network, and by
directors nominated by foreign shareholders.
Mr Achille Maramotti, founder of the Max Mara fashion group, and Mr Leonardo
Del Vecchio of Luxottica, maker of spectacle frames, also won seats on the
Credito Italiano board. Still, they will have to fight hard if they want to
assert a dissident line.
Before last Saturday's meeting, Mr Gilberto Benetton, who looks after stakes
in both Credito Italiano and BCI for Edizione Holding, the Benetton clothing
group's parent company, said the purchase of shares reflected the group's
belief in the aims of privatisation. But he added: 'Up to now it was a
simple privatisation, but nobody knew who was in charge. These assemblies
are the moment of truth.'

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Cariplo aims to raise L2,000bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cariplo, Italy's biggest savings bank, is to place up to 22 per cent of its
capital on the stock market, in a move which could eventually raise between
L2,000bn (Dollars 1.23bn) and L3,000bn for the bank.
The bank - formally known as Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde -
announced last night it wanted to launch the first tranche of a two-stage
capital increase and flotation before the year-end.
Bank officials said the operation would give Milan-based Cariplo, which has
belonged to a public-sector charitable foundation since 1816, the same
flexibility to expand as its quoted competitors in Italy and Europe. The
foundation's shareholders will be asked to approve the operation on April
29.
The total amount raised by Cariplo will almost certainly top the L1,525bn
flotation of 20 per cent of Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's
biggest banking group, in 1992. Both flotations have been prompted by the
1990 reforms of the Italian banking system, allowing public-sector banks to
restructure and seek share quotations.
Cariplo plans to issue up to 600m new shares before the end of this year.
The bank said the price would be based on the book value of the bank's
equity, discounted for expected dividends, following comparisons with the
value of other Italian and European bank stock.
In the second stage, Cariplo intends to issue 400m subordinated bonds by
June 30, 1995, with warrants for the same number of new shares attached.
Holders will be able to exercise the warrants, at a price based on the
average quoted value of the shares before the offer, after January 1, 1996.
This will spread the impact of the flotation over several years. The Cariplo
board said it would seek authorisation to quote the shares, bonds and
warrants on the domestic and foreign markets.
Cariplo came under the judicial spotlight in February when Mr Roberto
Mazzotta, the group's chairman, resigned after being charged with
corruption. The charges related to allegedly phoney property transactions by
Cariplo's substantial pension fund, and alleged illicit funding of the
Christian Democrat and Socialist parties, which were the bank's main
political influence.

The company backed up an optimistic statement by proposing a 10 per cent
increase in the dividend, to L385 a share from L350.
Overall consolidated sales in the 120 countries where Benetton is now
established rose to L2,751bn, against L2,512bn in 1992.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Peugeot Citroen slides FFr1.4bn
into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peugeot Citroen, the French vehicles group, plunged into a net loss of
FFr1.41bn (Dollars 242m) last year, compared with a profit of FFr3.37bn in
1992, the company announced yesterday.
Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman, said that the loss, although smaller than many
analysts had expected, reflected the impact of the 'worst decline in the
European automobile market since the second world war'.
He also blamed a period of 'monetary anarchy' which had seen substantial
currency devaluations for foreign rivals in the UK, Italy and Spain.
According to Mr Calvet, the devaluations of the pound, the lira and the
peseta since 1992 had compounded the fierce competition in the car market.
He also criticised the monetary policy of the French government which, he
said, had resulted in excessively high real interest rates.
Last year's loss was the first at Peugeot Citroen since 1985 and prompted
the group to withhold a dividend.
In spite of last year's reversal, Mr Calvet cited encouraging factors. The
second half of last year showed a marked improvement over the first, with
net losses declining to FFr292m from FFr1.12bn between the two periods.
Mr Calvet said he expected the improvement to continue because of emerging
signs of economic recovery in some of the group's principal markets and a
strong boost to sales in France resulting from government measures. These
measures, which include a payment of FFr5,000 for car owners who trade in a
vehicle more than 10 years old to buy a new one, will help lift new car
sales in the French market to 1.85m this year from 1.72m in 1993, the
company said.
Sales last year fell to FFr145.43bn from FFr155.43bn, while production fell
by 14.5 per cent to 1.75m vehicles. The worst affected markets, according to
Mr Calvet were in continental Europe, with France, Spain, Germany and Italy
all suffering an overall decline of between 18 and 24 per cent.
However, Peugeot Citroen said it had managed to increase its share of the
European market during 1993, to 13.1 per cent in the last three months of
the year from 12 per cent in the first quarter. The company said the
increase reflected the impact of new models.
The improved financial performance in the second half of the year partly
reflected a series of cost-cutting and productivity measures.

against US arm of O&amp;Y

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The creditors which control Olympia &amp; York Developments have accused the
failed Canadian developer's surviving US arm of concealing crucial data on
the restructuring of the US operations.
A group of bank lenders, including Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp,
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Sanwa Bank of Japan, yesterday asked
an Ontario court to set a five-day deadline for the creditors and the US
company to agree on ways in which this information could be shared.
OYDL's most valuable remaining asset is an 80 per cent stake in the US
operations, whose flagship property is the World Financial Centre in New
York. However, ever since OYDL's restructuring in February 1993, tensions
have been apparent between the parent company's creditors, the US management
and the administrator who oversees OYDL's remaining interests.
The US subsidiary, which has managed to remain out of the bankruptcy courts,
is understood to have completed a working plan for restructuring its Dollars
5bn debt. However, it has refused to divulge details to OYDL creditors.
According to court documents, the US managers claim that some creditors,
notably CIBC and Sanwa, have a conflict of interest because they are also
direct lenders to properties involved in the US restructuring.
US management also maintains that it would be inappropriate for OYDL
creditors to receive information which is not generally known to US project
lenders.
But the creditors are concerned that the US managers, led by Mr John
Zuccotti, a former deputy mayor of New York, might be jockeying for
advantage in the restructuring process.
'The interests of the management are potentially not the same as the
Canadian equity owners,' a source close to the dispute said.

Nedlloyd, the Dutch-based shipping and road haulage group, said it expects
to post a profit this year for the first time since 1991, helped by a
further recovery in results at its ocean-shipping line.
Ocean-shipping recovered strongly last year, enabling the group to
compensate for losses in European road haulage.
Net losses in 1993 nearly doubled to Fl 12m (Dollars 59m) from Fl 58m in
1992. However, if non-recurring items such as restructuring costs and
extraordinary gains are excluded, the underlying trend shows a narrowing of
group losses to Fl 50m from Fl 73m the year before.
'The turnaround is well under way,' Mr Leo Berndsen, chairman, said.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bayerische Landesbank, the Bavarian state bank, is on the verge of taking a
25 per cent stake in Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank (MKB), Hungary's
state-owned foreign trade bank.
The transaction, which is to be formalised at MKB's annual general meeting
on May 3, will be the first western acquisition of an important Hungarian
state-owned financial institution and one of the largest bank privatisations
yet in eastern Europe.
The purchase price for MKB was not disclosed. However, ING Bank of the
Netherlands paid Dollars 60m for a 26 per cent stake in Poland's Bank Slaski
last December in the first major east-west bank tie-up.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the London-based
institution, is expected to take a 17 per cent stake alongside Bayerische
Landesbank. The acquisition plays a part in the EBRD's efforts to shore up
eastern Europe's banking system and thus fulfil its mandate to support, even
if indirectly, private enterprise in the region.
Bayerische Landesbank and the EBRD are buying into the strongest of
Hungary's four main commercial banks. MKB had a capital adequacy ratio of
about 11-12 per cent of its end-1993 balance sheet total of Ft238bn (Dollars
2.3bn), comfortably over the 8 per cent level recommended by the Basle-based
Bank for International Settlements.
MKB, with its emphasis on trade finance, suffered less from the bankruptcy
of industrial companies that have weighed down most of the state-owned
banking sector in Hungary.
Of the big four, only MKB had the capital strength not to require government
assistance last December. The state had to inject Ft110bn to restore
solvency to Magyar Hitel Bank, Kereskedelmi Bank and Budapest Bank, the
three largest commercial banks, and five smaller financial institutions.
Budapest Bank is the next bank in line for privatisation.

FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Best quarter at Texas
Instruments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Texas Instruments, the US semiconductor and electronics manufacturer,
yesterday reported its best ever quarterly results while announcing a broad
restructuring of its European operations and the sale of some its software
product lines.
In all, about 1,064 jobs will be eliminated, most of them in Europe.
Net income for the quarter jumped to Dollars 134m, or Dollars 1.41 per
share, from Dollars 81m or 85 cents for the first quarter of 1993.
Strong growth in semiconductor sales produced a 30 per cent jump in
first-quarter revenues to Dollars 2.45bn from Dollars 1.88bn in the same
period last year.
The company said it would create business centres with pan-European
responsibilities to replace its traditional country-by-country approach. The
restructuring is expected to result eventually in annual savings of about
Dollars 54m.
The first-quarter 1994 results include a pre-tax charge of Dollars 83m for
the costs of restructuring the European operations.
An additional pre-tax charge of Dollars 49m was taken for the costs of
divesting 'non-strategic product lines' primarily in information technology,
the company said.
Excluding the effect of charges and one-time royalty gains, profit from
operations for the quarter would have been Dollars 256m and net income would
have been Dollars 165m, or Dollars 1.74 per share, the company said.
Wall Street analysts had been anticipating net income of about Dollars 1.39
per share. TI's share price gained Dollars 3 1/2 to trade at Dollars 68 1/4
in mid-session yesterday, up from Wednesday's close of Dollars 64 3/4 .
At the annual meeting, Mr Jerry Junkins, TI chairman, announced plans to
raise the stock dividend to Dollars 1.00 per share from 72 cents.
TI said that most of its profit increase in the quarter came from higher
royalties on semiconductor patents and improved semiconductor operations.
Semiconductor orders and revenues reached an all-time high in the quarter,
the company said. Without the effect of restructuring charges, semiconductor
operating profit more than doubled over the first quarter of 1993. Even with
the effect of the charges, semiconductor profits were up significantly over
the first quarter of 1993.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cannon Street Pounds 5.5m in the black -
Further disposals under way in move to electronics distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cannon Street Investments, the mini-conglomerate, has returned to the black
with a Pounds 5.54m pre-tax profit for the year to January 1, compared with
losses of Pounds 115.5m.
The company has been pruned down from more than 50 small and disparate
businesses into a core of three main divisions, but ultimately it has chosen
to remould itself as an electronics distribution company.
Mr Tom Long, chairman, said that the leisure and food divisions, along with
other remnants of CSI's 1980s buy-all strategy, were effectively up for
sale.
Having undergone significant restructuring, CSI is cash generative and
operating profits are almost double interest costs. It therefore no longer
has to hurry into further sales of non-core assets.
The electronics distribution businesses accounted for Pounds 5.58m (Pounds
1.12m) of CSI's Pounds 8.39m operating profit before Pounds 2.56m of central
costs. Food and drink distribution contributed Pounds 1.35m, but the leisure
division lost Pounds 245,000, because of problems in its time share and tour
business. The hotels remained profitable.
Profits from discontinued businesses amounted to Pounds 839,000 but these
were more than offset by one-off restructuring costs of more than Pounds 1m.
There was a Pounds 2.43m profit from the sale of businesses last year,
primarily PM Tamson, the Georgian House Hotel and Cannon Materials Handling
 -the latter was sold at a loss.
Interest costs fell from Pounds 7.04m to Pounds 2.72m, as a result of debt
reduction and falling interest rates. At the year end, net debt amounted to
about Pounds 25.4m, down from Pounds 42.9m.
The company has restructured its balance sheet to enable it to pay dividends
for the first time since October 1992. It will first have to pay the Pounds
2.5m arrears on its preference dividend, however, and it is taking a
'prudent' view on the resumption of ordinary dividends.
COMMENT
Having sifted through the wreckage of what was once a high-flying
conglomerate, the new management of Cannon Street Investments has found a
worthwhile core. Its electronics distribution division increased profits
fivefold last year, and management plans to build around the Altai
subsidiary. Analysts expect profits to exceed Pounds 7m in the current year,
putting the shares on a p/e of 11.5. This leaves minimal downside for the
shares, while there is considerable upside if it can demonstrate success in
building up its new-found core.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Mirror AGM shakes off the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday was the day that Mirror Group Newspapers finally returned to
normal - two and a half years after Mr Robert Maxwell nearly brought the
company to its knees.
At its annual meeting yesterday the increasingly profitable company put its
past behind it with a change of name to Mirror Group and there was even
thanks for the efforts to help defrauded pensioners.
However, it was the questions from the floor that really gave the game away.
Instead of angry shareholders and pensioners demanding his resignation, Sir
Robert Clark, chairman, and his board faced a series of thoroughly normal if
sometimes slightly dotty questions. Just like any other company.
Mr Charles Wilson, managing director, was asked whether there were
facilities for guide dogs for the blind at the group's new home, the Canary
Wharf tower in London's Docklands.
The former editor of The Times said he did not think any blind staff were
employed at Canary Wharf but blind dog facilities could be provided if they
were needed.
Mr Barry Gorman from Sheffield doesn't read the Daily Mirror any more
because he thinks it is 'a fascist newspaper'. He's still a shareholder but
didn't want to have to come all the way to London for AGMs.
Mr Gorman, who views the appointment of Mr David Montgomery as Mirror chief
executive and Mr John Birt as director general of the BBC as all part of the
same Conservative conspiracy, accused the board of being afraid of facing
the socialist shareholders of the north.
However, the show was totally stolen by 70-year old Mrs Esther Allen who
asked why it was that sometimes the share price went up - and at other times
down.
Sir Robert, who has spent many years in the City, had a stab at answering
and suggested the price usually went up when there were more buyers than
sellers.
He confessed, however, that 'it's an art not a science'.
Mrs Allen, a munitions worker at the age of 20, who is about to appear in a
Daily Mirror D-Day supplement, brought the house down when she said that if
the Mirror share price was going to go up she would buy some more.
There was even the odd complaint about the large size of Mr Montgomery's
emoluments - Pounds 325,863 - and the low price of some directors' share
options - 61p.
It was the most normal MGN-Mirror Group annual meeting in modern times.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Etam advances 28% as margins improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Etam's battle to defend margins in the face of heavy discounting last year
from rival fashion retailers helped to boost annual pre-tax profits by 28
per cent to Pounds 14m.
The increase was achieved on virtually flat sales of Pounds 220.3m for the
year to January 29, against Pounds 220.7m last time.
Mr Keith Miles, finance director, said the refusal to cut prices had eroded
market share in the second half. This was 'a small penalty' for increasing
gross margins by one percentage point.
The retail scene had been difficult in the last six months due to price
competition from companies trying to 'sort themselves out', such as Burton
Group, Mr Miles said.
The discounting pressure had continued this year. However, there was some
evidence that the most aggressive discounters were beginning to wake up to
the impact on margins.
Meanwhile, Etam would seek to draw in a wider base of customers by
eliminating its 'cheap and cheerful image'. This would mean an extensive
refurbishment and marketing programme from next year.
Of the three brands, Etam had performed satisfactorily, Mr Miles said, while
Tammy, the children's wear operation, had improved sales. Snob, which
targets younger women, had performed below expectations.
Etam's truce with Oceana, the South African Lewis family's group which made
a hostile bid in 1991, was expected to bring benefits to all three brands,
said Mr Miles. Etam had already gained from the presence of Mr Michael Lewis
on the board; he joined when Oceana decided to back Etam's strategy for
recovery. Oceana holds 36.5 per cent of Etam.
'It was good to make peace,' Mr Miles said. 'The initial indications give me
great hope that the chemistry and synergy will be there.'
Mr Stanley Lewis, Michael's 71 year old father, will join the board as a
non-executive at the annual meeting.
Earnings per share rose 32 per cent to 13.57p; the final dividend is
increased to 5.75p, for a total up 9 per cent at 7.5p.
COMMENT
Etam's five year plan is coming through rather better than some might have
expected just 12 months ago. The decision to hold prices when all about Etam
were cutting furiously is paying off. Management is also getting to grips
with the need to revitalise the Etam brand, while Oceana's input will bring
some interesting benefits longer-term. The strategy is not without risk,
however, as price pressures are not likely to disappear soon. The most
immediate task will be to push up sales, without eroding margin. Forecasts
are for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 16.5m this year, making the shares -
on a multiple of 16 - look more attractive than for some time.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Salvesen director departs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christian Salvesen, the UK distribution, specialist hire and food services
group, yesterday announced the departure of a director who co-founded its
Aggreko business, which recently caused the group to issue a profits
warning.
Mr Gordon Tourlamain, 50, joined Salvesen when it acquired Aggreko UK in
1984. Aggreko, which hires out generators and temperature control equipment,
was a star performer until recently.
However, Salvesen's highly rated shares fell sharply in February when the
group said Aggreko was suffering from increasing competition in the US and
Europe. Last night the shares closed up 2p at 262p - well below last year's
peak of 398p.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said Mr Tourlamain's departure was 'quite
amicable - he's not leaving us because we have had a difficult time with
Aggreko'.
Salvesen said full responsibility for Aggreko would now be assumed by Mr
David Yorke, who founded the business with Mr Tourlamain. Mr Yorke would
report directly to Mr Masters.
Sir Alick Rankin, Salvesen's chairman, said: 'We are all grateful for all
Gordon's achievements over the years. He was responsible for introducing
Aggreko to the Salvesen group and he leaves behind him a strong and
profitable business.'

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Liberty enfranchisement of non-voting
shares to proceed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberty, the retailing and fabric group, is fulfilling its promise to
enfranchise its non-voting shares following a long campaign by dissident
investor Mr Brian Myerson.
The move will reduce the votes controlled by the founding families from just
over 50 per cent to about 40 per cent.
Mr Patrick Austen, who joined as chief executive from BTR a year ago,
described enfranchisement as 'a really ticklish problem'.
Six months ago the company said that it had decided in principle to make the
change but that trading conditions were then too difficult.
The group is proposing to compensate the voting shares, which account for 70
per cent of the total, with a 1-for-2 scrip issue, which would increase the
cost of a maintained dividend by 25 per cent.
Following an upturn in its retailing business, Mr Austen said the group
could now commit itself to holding the dividend on the enlarged equity this
year though he added 'it is too early to say the extent to which it will be
covered' by earnings.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 3.2m in 1993, with earnings
per share slipping from 9.05p to 8.02p. The dividend, however, is maintained
at 7.2p through a final of 5.35p.
Turnover edged up to Pounds 82.9m (Pounds 82.4m) but stocks were cut by
Pounds 2m to Pounds 16.5m.
However, the figures disguised a strong recovery in the retailing operation
and signs of improved demand in some of its overseas markets.
Mr Austen said the current period will also see the full benefits of last
year's initiatives, including the opening of its Heathrow outlet. Launched
just before Christmas this was soon outselling all the group's other
branches in the UK.
Retailing profits recovered to Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 331,000) on turnover of
Pounds 61.1m (Pounds 54.8m), led by strong growth in fashion.
But all overseas operations struggled, with sales in France, Japan and North
America sharply down. US losses mounted to Pounds 248,000 (Pounds 68,000)
and Mr Austen admitted the group's one store in Manhattan 'just doesn't
work'.
Liberty is to launch a new range of branded products which Mr Austen said
represented 'the area of greatest long-term potential' for the group.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Mersey Docks unties golden share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's golden share in Mersey Docks and Harbour was converted into
a 10p ordinary share by yesterday's annual meeting, severing lines of
control dating from 1970.
The golden share entitled the government to appoint three directors and
demand day-to-day management accounts. It was a legacy of the collapse of
the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board 24 years ago, when it defaulted on its
bonds, forcing a government rescue.
In practice, the golden share has not been exercised in any form since 1989,
when the company was restructured after the government wrote off more than
Pounds 100m of debts.
The government's sole connection with Mersey Docks now is as its biggest
shareholder, but it intends to sell eventually.
The annual report shows its holding was diluted from 20 to 13.9 per cent in
last year's rights issue, launched to help fund Mersey's takeover of the
Medway ports.
The stake is worth about Pounds 56m at present, prompting speculation that
the government may be holding on until the shares are more valuable than the
written-off debts. The effect then would be to transfer the cost of
modernising Liverpool docks from public funds to the stock market.
Shareholders questioned the sudden resignation last week of Mr Peter
Vincent, the Medway chief executive, especially since his name was still on
the printed agenda for re-election as a director.
Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said Mr Vincent's reasons were personal. He
also confirmed that Mersey Docks would not be affected by litigation over
the price of 250p each which Mr Vincent paid for Medway shares that were
later valued at more than Pounds 37 in the takeover.
Mr Waddell said first-quarter trading results were up to expectations and
the company was well on its way to replacing Medway turnover lost as a
result of a discontinued ferry service to the Netherlands.

Shares in Plysu fell 9p to 220p yesterday after the plastic container
manufacturer warned that profits for the year ended March 31 would halve
from Pounds 10.8m to about Pounds 5.4m, after charging reorganisation costs
of Pounds 1.4m this time.
Plysu said that in the light of recessionary conditions affecting its
continental markets, it was making further significant reductions to its
cost base, mainly in continental Europe.
The dividend however, is expected to be maintained at 7p.

The recovery seen in the second half of the previous year at Benchmark Group
continued in the six months to December 31. Pre-tax profits for the property
investment company were Pounds 1.24m, against losses of Pounds 3.08m,
restated for FRS 3.
The property division reported a turnround from pre-interest losses of
Pounds 577,000 to profits of Pounds 415,400. The overseas division, which
carries out portfolio investment, improved from Pounds 240,500 to Pounds
1.17m.
The pre-tax result was helped by a write-back of provisions of Pounds
258,300, against a charge of Pounds 1.69m, and lower interest costs of
Pounds 433,800 (Pounds 684,000).

<TEXT>
Bundaberg Sugar, the Australian subsidiary of Tate &amp; Lyle, is expected to
allow its ADollars 121m (Pounds 58m) offers for two crushing mills in
Queensland to lapse on April 29.
The company yesterday published the required formal notices stating that the
offers could not be declared unconditional. It has also passed the date for
notifying a further extension of the bids.
Bundaberg's decision to withdraw, follows a battle for control of the Tully
and South Johnstone mills, whose unlisted shares are mainly held by local
cane growers.
The turning-point came last week when South Johnstone shareholders voted
against lifting the limit on the number of shares which any single investor
could hold in the mill. Yesterday, an adviser to the mills said they would
now pursue their own plan to merge.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Tie Rack shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Tie Rack fell by 8p to 146p yesterday after the fashion neckwear
and accessories retailer warned that its performance this year could be
undermined by overseas recession and UK tax increases.
The group, which stocks products ranging from designer scarves to Winnie the
Pooh ties and Pink Panther socks, said sales in the current financial year
were below expectations and it was cautious about prospects.
Mr Roy Bishko, chairman, said: 'Consumer expenditure and confidence may be
affected adversely by tax increases. Overseas, France and Holland are
experiencing difficult market conditions and in Australia, despite the
improving economy, the retail environment is depressed.'
In the year to January 30, Tie Rack defied volatile consumer spending to
increase pre-tax profits by 31 per cent to Pounds 6.67m (Pounds 5.1m).
The improvement was underpinned by a strong performance in Britain - where
operating profits rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 5.72m - and continental
Europe, which contributed Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 1.14m).
Group operating profits increased to Pounds 6.15m (Pounds 4.5m) on turnover
of Pounds 78.2m (Pounds 67m).
Mr Bishko said sales were boosted by 37 new outlets, increasing the
portfolio to 301.
Their contribution, however, was hampered by increased US losses of Pounds
482,000 (Pounds 58,000).
Falling sales forced the group to close six stores in North America at a
cost of Pounds 350,000. Trading losses exceeded Pounds 130,000.
The figures were also affected by difficulties in France, where demand fell
and distribution was hit by transport strikes.
Mr Bishko said the group wanted to expand its airport division - comprising
25 shops in 15 countries - and open more stores in Europe and east Asia.
Funds would come from its year-end net cash balances of Pounds 11.2m (Pounds
7.4m).
Earnings rose from 6.1p to 8.04p and the dividend is increased to 1.75p
(1p).

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Telemetrix shares hit by US subsidiary's
reduced outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Telemetrix, the UK-based supplier of specialised electronic
components, test equipment and services, fell by 23 per cent after GTI
Corporation, its 58 per cent-owned US subsidiary, reported lower first
quarter results.
Telemetrix shares closed 23p down at 103p.
Mr Tim Curtis, chief executive, warned last month, when the group unveiled a
64 per cent profits increase for 1993, that pricing pressures which began in
the fourth quarter were affecting GTI's sales and margins on networking
products in the US.
Yesterday he expressed surprise at the reaction in the market.
GTI, which is separately quoted on Nasdaq, reported net income down by 56
per cent to Dollars 1.3m (Pounds 890,000) in the first quarter to March 31,
on sales which slipped by 2 per cent to Dollars 30m. Earnings per share
dropped by 66 per cent to 13 cents.
Mr Gary Luick, GTI's chief executive, said that first quarter unit volume of
the company's standard networking product line - 10Base-T - was 30 per cent
higher than a year earlier. It accounted for 54 per cent of sales at the
networking subsidiary.
However, he added: 'Competitive pricing pressures reduced net revenues by 3
per cent as we worked to protect our market share.'
Overall networking revenues were flat at Dollars 21.2m (Dollars 21.6m) in
the first quarter, but prices were 25 per cent lower than a year ago.
Mr Luick added that the company was addressing the lower price levels by
cutting costs and moving production to a new automated plant in the
Philippines, while preparing for the introduction of new higher-margin
products based on the latest networking technologies.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wyndeham Press makes Pounds 6.54m
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wyndeham Press Group, the printing and packaging company formerly known as
SW Wood, is making three acquisitions for a total of up to Pounds 6.54m and
raising Pounds 5.26m through a placing and open offer.
It also forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 1.02m) for the year
to March 31 and expects to pay a final dividend of 1.5p for a total of 2.25p
(1.25p).
It is buying Westway, a lithographic printer, and B+P, its associated
finishing house, for a total of Pounds 5.54m, comprising Pounds 5.33m cash
and the balance in shares.
Unity Paper Tubes, which makes cardboard tubes, is being acquired for up to
Pounds 1m in shares and a profit and net asset-related cash element of about
Pounds 850,000.
Most of the cash payments will be met from the issue of 5.26m shares which
have been placed at 100p. Shareholders can apply for shares on an 8-for-25
basis. The shares closed at 105p yesterday, down 1p.
Westway reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 710,000 (Pounds 286,000) in the
year to January 31 on turnover of Pounds 4.52m (Pounds 3.56m). Profits for
B+P for 1993 were Pounds 289,000 (Pounds 115,000) on turnover of Pounds
2.08m (Pounds 1.76m).
For the year to March 31 1993 Unity reported profits of Pounds 111,000.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Austin Reed buoyed by retail boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trebled profits in Austin Reed's retail division and a Pounds 2.81m one-off
profit on a property sale lifted the clothing group's annual pre-tax profits
from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 6.87m.
The advance came on turnover 8 per cent up at Pounds 65.4m.
The shares, a single class since the enfranchisement of the non-voting
shares last summer, rose 22 1/2 p to 199 1/2 p on the announcement.
The group was optimistic for the current year, stating that since the
January 31 year end its retail sales were ahead 14 per cent.
A final dividend of 3.5p is proposed to give a total of 5.5p (5p). The rise
reflected a balance between restoring the historic dividend, which peaked at
9.5p in 1990 and 1991 and a desire to rebuild cover towards a target of 2.
Earnings, excluding the property profit, were 9.8p (3.1p).
Mr Chris Thomson, finance director, said that cash generation plus the
property sale proceeds cut debt from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 4.1m, and gearing
from 20 per cent to 9 per cent. Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.65m to
Pounds 991,000.
He said since the enfranchisement the group had looked at acquisitions but
had found few opportunities. Enfranchisement had expanded the shareholder
register and helped the shares.
The group concentrated last year on the retail division, Mr Thomson said.
Selling area fell 4 per cent, through relocating to smaller shops with a
more focused product range, but retail sales rose 12.8 per cent to Pounds
50.7m.
Gross margins had risen by 2 percentage points, and the group had managed
its stock better to avoid heavy sale markdowns. With no inflation in prices,
like-for-like volume had been up 9 per cent. Retail profits rose from Pounds
896,000 to Pounds 3.01m.
Licensing profits were up from Pounds 1.73m to Pounds 2.48m, but the gain
was due to rises in the dollar and yen against sterling, with volumes flat.
Weak export markets left manufacturing profits down from Pounds 1.23m to
Pounds 536,000.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wm Low at Pounds 12m aided by property gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Wm Low jumped by 9p to 147p yesterday, after the Dundee-based
grocery retailer announced an increase in interim pre-tax profits from
Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 12.1m and said margins were stabilising.
Mr Philip Spicer, chief executive, said that while price competition had
knocked 0.5 per cent off the company's gross margin in the 28 weeks to March
19, an 'element of stability' had returned to the market.
'Everyone has looked over the precipice, seen what is down below, and
decided they don't like it,' he said.
Wm Low had been hit by price competition sparked off by J Sainsbury's
'Essential for essentials' promotion which began last October, as well as by
discounters such as Shoprite. But price pressure had eased recently.
The profits figure was flattered by a Pounds 5.03m exceptional gain on
property disposals, including the Coatbridge retail park.
Operating profits actually declined from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 8.53m, due
partly to one-off store closure costs of Pounds 600,000 and costs of Pounds
200,000 covering redundancies at head office.
The interest charge increased from Pounds 655,000 to Pounds 1.48m.
Mr Spicer said the company was starting to benefit from economies of scale
after closing smaller, underperforming stores.
It had closed its remaining 12 small stores, and opened four larger stores.
The average size of its 56 stores was now 16,500 sq ft.
Total sales increased by 2.5 per cent to Pounds 246m (Pounds 240m), thanks
to an 8.2 per cent increase from new stores.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.7p.
Earnings per share increased to 15p (13.34p) basic and from 12.01p to 13.23p
fully diluted.
COMMENT
Yesterday's news from Wm Low was somewhat brighter than its gloomy January
trading statement - as reflected by the share price reaction. Its claim that
stability was returning to the market echoed those of the big superstore
groups. But Scotland, a focus for expansion by both discounters and the
large multiples, will become increasingly competitive, and Wm Low could be
squeezed in the middle. With a low-key expansion programme in a low-growth,
low-inflation environment, Wm Low can hope for slow earnings growth at best.
Full-year forecasts of Pounds 15m, excluding the property gain, put the
shares on a multiple of 8.5, a discount to the sector which reflects the
unexciting prospects.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Henry Boot ahead 7% to Pounds 7.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry Boot, the Sheffield-based contractor, housebuilder and property
developer which has withstood the recession better than many of its rivals,
increased pre-tax profits by 7 per cent, from Pounds 7.08m to Pounds 7.59m,
in 1993.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 165m (Pounds 129m). The group is proposing to
raise its final dividend from 4.3p to 4.8p, increasing the total for the
year by 10 per cent to 6.5p (5.9p). Earnings per share increased from 18.9p
to 20p.
The company said that operating profits rose by a fifth, which compensated
for a reduction in interest received.
Contracting, however, remained difficult with prices 'ludicrously low'. The
market continued to suffer from over-capacity and remained very competitive.
Public spending cuts and tax increases had increased the anxiety felt by the
industry while the recovery was 'fragile at best'.
Nonetheless, the company said the number of homes completed last year had
risen by 62 per cent, with profits and sales benefiting from a change in the
mix of house types and lower interest rates.
It expected to increase further its investment in housebuilding as well as
expanding its interests in commercial property as those markets recovered.
Significant progress had been made in obtaining additional lettings and
rental increases which would benefit the group over the next few years. The
cash position had improved in spite of increased spending on land purchases.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Oxford Molecular for market with Pounds
29.5m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oxford Molecular, the first company to be spun out from Oxford University,
will be valued at Pounds 29.5m when its shares start trading on the Stock
Exchange next Thursday following a Pounds 10m placing.
Mr Tony Marchington, co-founder and chief executive, said he was very
pleased with the price, particularly in view of recent problems in the new
issue market.
'In spite of the tightening in the market in the last two weeks, the price
is exactly the same as we first discussed last May.'
Mr Marchington's stake will be valued at about Pounds 1m, although he has
agreed not to sell any shares for two years.
The company, which supplies computer software for use in drug design,
suffered a Pounds 1.2m loss on revenues of only Pounds 1.4m last year.
Mr Marchington said that after the placing he had telephoned Professor Tony

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: SB rises to Pounds 353m despite decline in
European sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in US drugs sales volume failed to offset declines in Europe
during the first quarter of 1994 for SmithKline Beecham, the healthcare
group.
Total drugs sales fell by 1 per cent to Pounds 874m (Pounds 886m), although
with currency effects stripped out, the sales were 1 per cent up.
Better performances from the other divisions - animal health, consumer
healthcare and clinical laboratories - pushed group pre-tax profits up by 15
per cent to Pounds 353m (Pounds 307m), resulting in earnings of 8.7p per
share, against 7.5p.
The dividend for the quarter is raised by 18 per cent to 3p, reflecting
'management's confidence in the future of the company'.
The shares rose 8p to 372p, reflecting the drugs sector's recently acquired
responsiveness to yield considerations.
Group turnover was Pounds 1.48bn (Pounds 1.52bn), a figure depressed by the
sale of the personal care business, which contributed Pounds 53m in the
first quarter of 1993.
The pharmaceuticals division was clearly split between sharp rises in sales
for newer products and declines for more established drugs.
Sales of ulcer treatment Tagamet, whose US patent expires next month, were 3
per cent lower in constant currency terms at Pounds 153m.
Sales of antibiotic Augmentin, the company's biggest product, fell by 8 per
cent to Pounds 191m. It was hit by measures implemented in January to cut
Italy's drugs bill which also affected other SB products. Some of those
measures have since been reversed.
The best-performer of the newer drugs was anti-depressant Seroxat/Paxil,
with sales up sharply to Pounds 77m.
New launch Kytril, an anti-emetic for chemotherapy patients, more than
doubled sales to Pounds 29m. It is competing directly with one of the stars
of Glaxo's portfolio, Zofran.
The group's over-the-counter medicines business, which should receive a
further boost in the second quarter with the launch of an OTC version of
Tagamet, increased sales by 11 per cent to Pounds 150m.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Helical Bar net assets increase 81%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Helical Bar, the property investment and development company run by Mr
Michael Slade, yesterday announced an 81 per cent increase in net assets and
a Pounds 110m property development programme.
The asset valuation of 299p a share, fully diluted, exceeded brokers'
expectations, and the shares rose 17p to 348p.
Pre-tax profits for the year to January 31 rose 12 per cent to Pounds 6.58m
(Pounds 5.88m), although this reflected the Pounds 7.2m fall in interest
payments, from lower interest rates and the reduction of debt, due to a
Pounds 20m convertible preference share issue. Net borrowings amounted to
Pounds 80m at the year end, representing gearing of 95 per cent.
Profits after tax and preference dividends fell to Pounds 4.39m (Pounds
4.73m), but a recommended final dividend of 3.3p makes an increased total of
5.8p (4.8p) for the year.
After three years of disposals and the write-down of property valuations,
Helical moved back into the property market last spring, and invested Pounds
60m in properties and development sites during the year.
The company upwardly revalued its investment portfolio by Pounds 14m, after
suffering Pounds 3.3m in write-downs in 1992-93. It also carries an
estimated Pounds 3m surplus on its trading properties, but this is not
included in its asset valuation.
Helical's overall strategy is to achieve rental income comfortably above
interest and administration costs, and add spice through its development and
trading activities.
In 1993-94, these costs amounted to Pounds 7.4m, compared with gross rental
profits of Pounds 12.1m.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Pelican considering bid for Forte cafe
chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pelican Group, the acquisitive restaurant operator, was yesterday said to be
considering a bid for Dome, the cafe chain owned by Forte, the hotels and
restaurants group.
The London-based company is thought to be arranging finance for an agreed
bid, which could involve a rights issue to raise more than Pounds 10m.
Such a move would signal the next stage of the expansion strategy pursued by
Mr Roger Myers, Pelican chairman.
Unveiling a threefold increase in profits earlier this year, he said: 'We
are now in a position to continue our strategy of creating multiple
restaurant chains. We have many concepts available for expansion throughout
the UK.'
The acquisition of Dome - comprising 10 restaurant bars in London, one in
Cambridge and one in Oxford - would lead to a 36 per cent expansion of
Pelican, which already operates 28 outlets.
Industry analysts said Forte had already been involved in inconclusive talks
over the future of Dome and were ready to sell it.
Although the group refused to comment yesterday, it is understood to be
considering a disposal in order to focus on its core hotels and roadside
catering businesses.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Oriel turns in Pounds 1m for first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oriel Group, the insurance broker, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.06m
in the first quarter of 1994, against a loss of Pounds 146,000 last time.
The group, having completed the restructuring which began in 1992, made an
operating profit on continuing activities before exceptionals of Pounds 1m
for the whole of 1993. But the inclusion of discontinued activities left a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 74,000) for the year.
However, reflecting the group's underlying profitability and the expectation
of further progress this year, the final dividend is a same-again 3p for a
maintained total of 5p.
Full year losses per share were 8.9p (5.8p), but this had improved to
earnings of 2.9p (2.4p losses) for the first quarter.
The full year loss was struck after a Pounds 1.6m write-off arising from the
disposal of Hayward &amp; Company, while in addition, further provisions of
Pounds 200,000 were charged.
Warranty Holdings, the new car warranties company acquired during the year,
turned in a 1993 pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.01m.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: British Dredging up 81%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Improved margins, rather than a higher volume of business, helped British
Dredging, the building materials, ship repairing and concrete products
group, to pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.91m for 1993, up 81 per cent from
Pounds 1.06m last time.
Underpinning the rise was an improved operating profit of Pounds 1.38m
(Pounds 232,000), slightly offset by reduced interest income of Pounds
172,000 (Pounds 457,000).
Turnover increased to Pounds 36m (Pounds 33.7m). Mr Fane Vernon, chairman,
said this was due almost entirely to a full year's trading from the Selco
Trade Centre, Cardiff, which opened in July 1992.
The group plans to invest in more building materials distribution outlets,
with one opening next year and others to follow. Locations for the new
centres have not been revealed.
Mr Vernon said the group would make further progress as the volume of
business grew. He believed that this would happen this year, 'although there
is very little sign of it yet'. He added: 'BDC Concrete Products, which used
to be one of our star earners, has shown slightly improved volumes of
business.'
Earnings per share rose by 86 per cent to 7.91p (4.26p). A final dividend of
3p is proposed, making a total of 5.6p (5.2p).

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cluff Resources cuts losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cluff Resources, the mining group which yesterday reported a reduced loss of
Pounds 218,000 for 1993, expects to join the world's top 50 gold groups in
1995-96 by producing more than 130,000 troy ounces a year.
Mr Algy Cluff, chairman, said: 'I am confident that we are at the threshold
of a substantial improvement in our group's fortunes.'
There were losses of Pounds 2.54m in 1992, re-stated to take account of its
recent acquisition of Aberfoyle, which has agricultural and industrial
interests in Zimbabwe.
Cluff produced 59,860 ounces of gold last year, down from 72,238 in 1992,
primarily because of a mill breakdown at the Freda Rebecca mine in Zimbabwe.
Mr Cluff said output would bounce back to between 70,000 and 76,000 ounces
this year.
Full production at the recently-acquired Ayanfuri mine in Ghana should start
at an annual rate of 30,000 ounces in 1995.
Cluff's new gold loan - Zimbabwe's first - carrying interest at 5.6 per cent
would cut interest payments substantially this year after a jump from Pounds
631,000 to Pounds 1.41m last year.
Net losses were Pounds 762,000 (Pounds 3.94m) or 1p (5.4p) a share.
The company is not paying a dividend for the third successive year.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Babcock restructures energy side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement by Babcock Internat-ional of a fundamental restructuring of
its energy division is a crucial component in the new strategy unveiled
yesterday by Mr John Parker, chief executive at the engineering group since
October.
Behind the exceptional charge of Pounds 25m for reducing the division's
overheads and manufacturing capacity lies an important shift in the balance
of power from the manufacturing plant in Renfrew to the unit's headquarters
in Crawley.
Mr Parker made clear yesterday that this division had been the cause of the
group's profit and cash problems. According to estimated results for the
year ended March 31, the division lost Pounds 29.3m, compared with a profit
of Pounds 11.2m.
The loss excludes the exceptional charge, but includes the Pounds 15m
provision on the flue gas desulphurisation contract at National Power's Drax
power station in North Yorkshire.
It also includes additional provisions from 'the prudent assessment of the
out-turn of contracts,' settlement of outstanding claims undertaken as part
of Mr Parker's strategic review of the group and unrecovered overheads as a
result of a lack of manufacturing volume.
The clear message yesterday from Mr Parker and from Mr Nick Salmon,
Babcock's managing director, was the need to 'fix energy'. This means that
450 jobs are to go at Renfrew, reducing the manufacturing workforce there to
about 400. Financially, the aim is to cut manufacturing operating costs at
Renfrew by 30 per cent or Pounds 11m a year.
The reshaping goes much deeper, however. Mr Salmon wants to move the
division away from a 'manufacturing-led' culture, where everything revolved
around keeping Renfrew full, to a business driven by technology and
engineering, and held together by project management skills.
Significantly, Mr Duncan Cox, the division's new managing director, will be
based at Crawley, rather than Renfrew. Mr Cox joins the group next week from
Zurn Energy, the US boiler company.
COMMENT
A hefty right issue gives Babcock some financial muscle to weather the
vagaries of international contracting, but at the same time the group is
clearly signalling that there will be no repeats of Drax. Shareholders may
now have to look on the rights issue, the restructuring of energy, and the
exceptional charge as perhaps the only realistic way for the group to go
forward - without the new money Babcock could not sort out the energy side
and develop its good positions in the materials handling and process
businesses. Only a die-hard optimist could be shocked that there is no final
dividend, but finishing the year with net cash of Pounds 3.9m is a welcome
surprise and a sign that the new team has grasped the nettle. Forecast of
Pounds 27m for this year puts Babcock on a p/e of 15 on a pro forma
post-rights basis.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: A Fisher plans Pounds 59m Danish buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, has agreed to buy
a Danish-based seafood company in a deal worth Pounds 59m.
Shares in the group fell 6p to 57p after it announced a 1-for-6 rights issue
at 52p per new ordinary share to raise Pounds 51.2m. The group also plans to
cut its interest bill by redeeming preference shares worth Pounds 46.9m.
The Rahbek Group, a producer of chilled and frozen fish recipe dishes, is to
be bought for Pounds 40m in cash plus the assumption of about Pounds 19.1m
of debt.
Rahbek's factories in the UK and Denmark supply valued-added products to
leading European retailers such as Marks and Spencer.
Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, said the acquisition was 'a
further significant step towards creating a group with strong positions in
markets with good growth opportunities, while further reducing exposure to
pure commodity distribution and trading businesses.'
Rahbek's operating income for 1993 amounted to Pounds 3.6m on sales of
Pounds 119.1m, although profits were adversely affected by a strike by
Danish fishermen.
Albert Fisher yesterday also reported increased pre-tax profits of Pounds
30.6m (Pounds 22.8m) for the six months to February 28, on sales of Pounds
606m (Pounds 550m).
Under FRS 3, earnings rose to 3.52p (2.66p), but stripping out a Pounds
10.5m exceptional gain on disposals, they fell to 2.23p (2.5p). The interim
dividend is held at 1.85p.
The group said cost reduction continued to be a priority, but the benefits
from action already taken continued to be offset by poor trading conditions.
The recession in continental Europe, the effects on margins of the retail
price wars and produce price deflation in North America all had a negative
impact.
In general it remained difficult to predict any real improvement in the
second half in its key markets.
COMMENT
The market did not like this deal - mainly because analysts hate to see an
acquisition being funded by paper with a prospective yield of 8 per cent.
They did, however, understand its strategic logic: Albert Fisher simply must
get away from the commodity end of the market, which continues to spring
unpleasant surprises, particularly in the US. The group is certainly paying
a full price for an acquisition which it says will be earnings neutral in
the first year, but promises future benefits. A prospective multiple of 11
fully reflects the market's disgruntlement with this so-far unfulfilled tale
of jam tomorrow. Only real profits performance will dispel the doubts which
have kept the shares under a cloud.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: WEW firms 16% to Pounds 5.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEW Group, the discount retailer formerly called Amber Day Holdings,
yesterday reported a 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.2m
in the six months ending January 29.
WEW, which has 61 stores trading under the What Everyone Wants banner, was
refinanced last December by a placing and Pounds 15.5m rights issue which
allowed Warburg Pincus, the US investment institution, to raise its stake
from 17 to 25 per cent.
The US investment house is backing the group's aim to double the number of
WEW stores to about 125 over the next five years, in the process of
expanding across the whole country from its current strongholds in Scotland,
the north of England and the Midlands.
Mr Peter Carr, chairman, said that despite the anticipated impact of tax
increases, the company was still on course to realise the real potential of
its retail format.
Turnover rose from Pounds 61.3m to Pounds 66.4m. The group said Christmas
trading was encouraging and the performance of its then six newest stores
had exceeded initial expectations. Trading at the beginning of the second
half was poor and only started to improve in late March, ahead of tax
increases in April.
Mr Carr said that the buying and merchandising functions, critical to the
group's ability to improve merchandise ranges and allocations, were being
strengthened.
Three new stores opened in time for Easter - in Inverness, Wishaw and Oldham
 -were already trading ahead of budget. Together with a further store
intended to be opened before the end of July, new store openings during the
current financial year would reach 10.
Earnings per share rose by 9 per cent to 2.72p (2.54p), but the interim
dividend is cut to 0.35p (1.1p).

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capitol Group, the security specialist, yesterday announced that it is
coming to the market via a placing with institutional investors likely to
value the group at about Pounds 11m.
The pathfinder flotation prospectus for the group was issued yesterday.
Capitol was founded in 1983 by ex-policeman Mr Ken Dulieu, managing
director. It specialises in security and related services in investigatory,
audit and stocktaking, and port and ferry security.
The group announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 838,000 (Pounds 341,000) for
the year ending March 31 1994. Turnover was Pounds 6.64m (Pounds 5.12m) and
operating profit, before exceptional and non-recurring items, was Pounds 1m
(Pounds 714,000).

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Increased efficiency behind CWS rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Co-operative Wholesale Society, the largest co-operative food and non-food
retailer and the UK's biggest farmer, yesterday reported an increase in
trading profits from Pounds 51.3m to Pounds 58.7m, in spite of a difficult
UK trading climate.
Total turnover for the year to January 8 declined slightly from Pounds
3.21bn to Pounds 3.11bn, due to the sale of milk businesses and the transfer
of some warehouses to retail societies.
Mr David Skinner, chief executive, said the retail business, which was now
the society's biggest activity, had performed well in spite of intense price
competition in the grocery sector.
Total retail sales increased 5 per cent to Pounds 1.62bn, although
like-for-like sales increased only marginally. But profits increased 36 per
cent to Pounds 38.8m.
The increase in efficiency resulted largely from the creation of the
Co-operative Retail Trading Group, a partnership of several regional
co-operatives and CWS Retail.
Mr Skinner said many smaller stores were being converted from supermarkets
into convenience stores, which was helping them to withstand the growing
competition in the grocery market. Many had a strong customer base and were
in locations where the large grocery multiples were unlikely to open stores.
Total sales in the food manufacturing division were unchanged at Pounds
304m, with an increase in sales to UK multiples offset by a fall in sales to
co-operative customers. CWS is in discussion about the possible sale of the
food manufacturing group.
Profit before interest rose from a restated Pounds 30.8m to Pounds 50.7m,
while the interest charge fell by nearly Pounds 4m. Dividend and share
interest payments to members went up by 30 per cent to Pounds 7m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Loganair, the subsidiary of Airlines of Britain which serves the highlands
and islands of Scotland, is to lose its separate identity and enter a
franchise arrangement with British Airways.
Airlines of Britain, whose principal subsidiary is British Midland, will
also consider an approach from Loganair's management to buy the airline.
Mr Scott Grier, managing director of Loganair, said he was securing
financial backing for a management buy-out which he hopes to conclude in the
next two to three months. The franchise arrangement does not depend on this.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Caird falls Pounds 26.5m into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caird, the lossmaking waste management company crippled by a series of
acquisitions in the 1980s, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Pounds
26.5m, after slightly higher than expected provisions and write-downs of
Pounds 24m. This compared with Pounds 3.4m profits previously.
The group sought to reassure investors that the worst was past, however,
with news that it had broken even in the second half at the operating level.
Sales fell 15 per cent to Pounds 18.1m, with revenue from continuing
business down 11 per cent. The shares rose by  3/4 p to 8p.
Mr David Weir, the chief executive appointed last year to restructure the
group, said that while Caird was not yet out of the woods, 'we are confident
the group will be able to trade profitably this year'.
Caird was encouraged by what appeared to be a sustained increase in landfill
prices from 'the uneconomic levels which the industry has been seeing for
the last few years. Mr Weir said prices had risen by between 8 and 9 per
cent over the last 12 months, although this had varied substantially between
regions. Prospects for the special waste side were less encouraging.
Mr Weir said Caird's main task this year would be to 'trade in line with
expectations and build confidence so we can do something else'.
The state of the group's balance sheet, with net debt of Pounds 21.9m and
shareholders' funds which have fallen from Pounds 47.1m to Pounds 17.2m,
would need to be addressed. In the medium term, Caird is expected to make a
capital reconstruction.
The losses were largely the result of a Pounds 24m provision, of which
Pounds 23m had been announced at the interim stage. This covered the
rationalisation, including a 26 per cent reduction in the workforce and
closure of unprofitable sites. Some Pounds 17.6m was due to asset
writedowns.
There is no dividend, against last year's interim of 1.33p. Losses per share
rose from 0.36p to 49.66p.
COMMENT
Caird has hopefully swept out all the skeletons with these provisions and
looks better than for some time. It has made good progress on cutting costs
and is generating cash to help reduce debt. A number of property disposals
this year may do much to help ease the burden. Nevertheless, 1994 is not
likely to be exciting. Forecasts are for anything from a marginal loss to a
tiny net profit, with little prospect of a dividend before 1996. The shares
are also likely to be shadowed by the prospects of a capital restructuring.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Roxboro makes Pounds 55m purchase and
placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roxboro, the specialist electronic and electrical products manufacturer
which came to the market in November, plans to acquire Solartron, a sensors,
transducer and measurement instruments group, for an initial Pounds 55.3m,
including Pounds 12.3m of assumed debt.
The group, which raised Pounds 11.9m net of expenses when it was floated at
230p a share last year, also announced a placing and open offer at 255p to
raise Pounds 30.6m on the basis of 37 new shares for every 100 held.
The placing of the 13m shares, subject to a recall of 8.7m, is fully
underwritten by Samuel Montagu with James Capel as brokers. Roxboro's shares
closed up 14p at 284p.
Roxboro will pay an initial Pounds 26.4m in cash and issue 6.1m shares to
the vendors who include Solartron's management and Schroder Ventures which
backed a Pounds 35m management buy-out from Schlumberger in November.
A further consideration of up to Pounds 10m will be paid subject to the
Solartron operations achieving pre-tax profits of between Pounds 6m and
Pounds 7.5m in the year following acquisition.
Mr Harry Tee, Roxboro's chief executive, yesterday rejected suggestions that
the price was too high. He acknowledged that Solartron's management buy-out
team led by Mr Philip Tempest, managing director, struck 'an absolutely
superb' deal but said, 'for us it is still an excellent deal because it is
earnings enhancing immediately'.
He said the acquisition would double Roxboro's turnover and profits. As a
result it raised its forecast dividend for this year to 4.5p against the
1.9p flotation forecast.
Solartron reported profits of Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 4.1m) before tax and group
charges of Pounds 800,000 last year on turnover of Pounds 48.2m (Pounds
44.7m). It makes electo-mechanical devices which are used widely throughout
industry to measure pressure, density, displacement, temperature, flow,
viscosity or other variables.
COMMENT
This is a smart deal even though it would have been even sweeter at the
bargain buy-out price five months ago. The sensor and transducer markets are
among the fastest growing segments of the electronic components industry and
Solartron already has a strong or leading position in more than a dozen
different niche markets. The acquisition fits group strategy and Roxboro
expects to improve further Solartron's margins. Gearing after the purchase
will be an acceptable 29 per cent, and will fall. The market has already
given the deal its approval by lifting the shares 5 per cent.

FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: City shows its approval
for the merger - Share price for Abbey National slips as investors wonder if
it will be a casualty of new organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The wide divergence of the share prices of Lloyds Bank and Abbey National
yesterday indicated the size of the stone thrown into the stagnant pool of
the UK retail financial services market by Lloyds' Pounds 1.8bn bid to be
the first bank to take over a building society.
The rise in Lloyds shares was a vote of faith not only that it was paying a
good price for the country's sixth biggest society but that the two
organisations together would be a menacing new force in the mortgage market.
Abbey National, the former building society, would be an obvious casualty.
The logic of a large bank joining forces with a building society is obvious.
The gradual consolidation of the society movement from 110 societies in 1991
to 84 today is part of a process by which the UK mortgage market is
increasingly dominated by a shrinking number of powerful players.
The slump in the UK housing market has reduced the total market heavily.
Total net new mortgage lending was Pounds 16.9bn in 1993, compared to Pounds
18.3bn in 1992, and Pounds 33.2bn in 1990. At the same time, banks have
strongly stepped up their competition with societies to sell new mortgages.
Banks' market share of new advances rose to 39 per cent this year, compared
with 21 per cent in 1992, as they used cheaper wholesale funds to undercut
societies. Societies have to rely more heavily on retail deposits, which
they have to use to fund 60 per cent of mortgages under law.
British banks are facing very weak loan demand from small and medium-sized
companies, which makes them eager to sell more mortgages. But despite their
flexibility, they have not sold as many mortgages as they would like. Only 4
per cent of Lloyds customers have mortgages with the bank.
Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, attributes this to greater
specialist knowledge of how to manufacture and distribute new products by
societies. Banks have also failed thus far to break decisively the British
perception that a society is the natural place to buy a mortgage.
A second advantage for a bank is that it diversifies the earnings stream
from cyclical corporate lending. Despite the savage slump in house prices in
the late 1980s, the total bad debts of the top 20 societies last year were
less than Barclays' Pounds 1.9bn provisions against bad lending.
Mr Pitman has constantly emphasised that Lloyds must push down its cost of
capital in order to boost return on equity. Somewhat improbably, he
attributed a large part of the rise in Lloyds' share price yesterday to a
reduction in the cost of capital arising from a diversified earnings stream.
From the point of view of societies, acquisition by a bank has clear
attractions. First, it breaks the wholesale funding limit which societies
are pressing the Treasury to raise. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester only funded 25
per cent of mortgages from wholesale funds, but others are more pressed.
More importantly, acquisition by a bank gives a society at least theoretical
access to a much wider distribution channel. Lloyds has 1,930 branches
compared to the 230 C&amp;G branches, and also offers it the potential of
selling mortgages through Lloyds Abbey Life and financial services agencies.
This was the heart of the reasoning which led Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G's
chief executive, to approach Lloyds through C&amp;G's investment banking
adviser, JP Morgan, last autumn. He believed there was an urgent need to
find ways of selling more products - and raising income  - from the same
cost base.
Wide distribution of mortgages through few branches has been the reason why
C&amp;G has achieved an extremely low ratio of costs to income of 26 per cent,
compared with a 48 per cent average ratio for the top 10 societies. Mr
Longhurst thought it could only improve this ratio with more income.
C&amp;G is already strongly dependent on other sources of income than its
branches. Only 20 per cent of business comes from branches, with 22 per cent
of mortgage loans being made to existing borrowers, and 58 per cent coming
through referrals from independent financial advisers.
'The key to Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is that we stuff more product through
fewer branches, but thereby hangs the problem,' said Mr Longhurst yesterday.
'We have not got very good distribution in a static market, and if we can
get extra distribution somehow, we can push down costs more.'
For all these reasons, the two men are confident that they had struck a
large blow to others. They will together supply 7 per cent of domestic
mortgages, and become the fourth largest mortgage provider. Mr Pitman said
that both Halifax Building Society and Abbey National would be his prime
competition.
'This will definitely change the competitive equilibrium of the market,'
said Mr Pitman. 'Some of the small societies may combine with others. There
might well be other societies approaching banks to take them over. Whether
they can get as good a deal out of them is another matter.' Yet the apparent
logic of the deal - combined with support from the deal from ratings
agencies and analysts - raises the question of why it has not happened
before. In fact, the big regulatory, cultural and structural differences
between societies and banks have prevented such moves. The regulatory hurdle
is the Building Societies Commission, whose guidance against third parties
such as banks making payments to members will be tested in the High Court in
May. Although the commission is officially neutral, it is thought to be
cautious about its charges being taken over.
This was thought to be one factor behind the failure of the only previous
attempt of a bank to take over a society. The bank was a vehicle called Bank
of Edinburgh which abandoned its attempt to acquire the Heart of England
society for reasons thought to include regulatory difficulties.
The structural problem is that because societies are mutual organisations,
it would be virtually impossible for a bank to take one over without the
agreement of the board. The stiff requirements for members' approval in most
societies' rules mean that boards could easily scupper hostile bids.
These voting requirements also mean that even with the approval of top
managers, a society may be difficult to acquire. Although many of C&amp;G's 1.4m
members will be happy to accept the Pounds 500 minimum offer, the bid could
easily come unstuck if a hostile lobby group emerges among them.
Lloyds has tried to prevent the possibility of fuel being added to such a
fire by agreeing with C&amp;G that its board will not recommend any other offer
within a set period. But if another bank made a larger offer, it could be
hard for C&amp;G's board to resist putting it to members indefinitely.
Both men were sounded confident on this point yesterday. Mr Longhurst said
it would be hard for another bank to make an offer mixing cash with shares
because of the difficulty of dividing payments to members. 'I do not think
it would be easy for anyone else to participate,' said Mr Pitman.
Yet even if such hurdles are surmounted by next year, the theoretical
attractions of the relationship could yet prove difficult to achieve in
reality. C&amp;G was careful to set its terms for an acquisition, insisting on
maintaining its managerial independence and a separate board.
In order to maintain this divide without tension between the two
organisations, C&amp;G will have to fulfil what for the moment remain
theoretical attractions. If Lloyds cannot in practice sell many more
mortgages through its branches with the society's help, the vision will not
succeed.
Mr Pitman insisted that Lloyds in any case did not want to tinker with C&amp;G's
winning formula. 'We knew we were buying a brand, and we knew that if we
damaged the brand we would destroy what we had bought.' He said Lloyds had
also supported the idea of maintaining a separate board.
Yet both men admit that the theoretically attractive and amiable alliance
would come under severe strain if C&amp;G failed to perform as expected under
Lloyds' umbrella. 'In a disaster scenario, if you own something 100 per
cent, then you have to do something about it,' said Mr Pitman.
'To a certain extent, we have to take it on trust,' said Mr Longhurst. 'But
the price they are paying suggests that they value what we are doing and
they are not going to mess around with it too soon.' That was the mood in
both organisations yesterday; it remains to be seen how long it lasts.

FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: Customers likely to get
bonanza pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester customers stand to receive a bonanza if the deal
with Lloyds Bank goes through as planned and if the Building Societies
Commission approves the decision to divide the Pounds 1.8bn between C&amp;G's
staff and 1.4m customers.
That C&amp;G should have managed to negotiate such generous terms with Lloyds is
perhaps fitting, since it was C&amp;G which set the fashion for paying bonuses
when it took over Guardian building society in 1990.
'There is nothing to touch this,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, building
societies analyst at UBS. All C&amp;G customers as of March 31 1994, will
benefit once the takeover is completed.
Borrowers
Those who have a mortgage will receive a cheque for Pounds 500 for each
mortgaged property. Those in arrears will receive Pounds 500 credited to
their mortgage account.
Savers
A distinction is drawn between savers who are voting members and those who
are not. Those who hold a share account, such as Cheltenham Gold, London
Share, Instant 7 or the society's tax-exempt special savings account are
automatically voting members, as are borrowers.
But of C&amp;G's 1m investors, 60,000 are not members and a further 130,000  -
children and those with a balance of less than Pounds 100 - are members
without voting rights.
All savers will receive a percentage - expected to be 10 per cent - of the
balance in each of their investment accounts, to a maximum of Pounds 10,000
per account, as long as the account was open on March 31 and remains open
until the takeover is completed. The 10 per cent will be calculated on the
lower balance at March 31 1994, or on the completion date. Children's
accounts also qualify for the pay-out.
In addition, investor voting members will receive Pounds 500 as long as they
were members of the society at December 31 1993. Trustees who are voting
investors also share this benefit. A borrower with a share account would be
able to pick up two lots of Pounds 500 as well as the percentage balance
payment.
Creditors
Investors in the society's permanent interest-bearing shares on or before
March 31 1994, are entitled to Pounds 500 if they are a voting member, as
well as a percentage of the balance.

FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: Marathon trek into the
unknown has now begun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the firing of the starting pistol yesterday, the deal between Lloyds
and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester will now begin a marathon trek through the
regulatory thicket in its path.
Some parts of the path are untrodden, even by Abbey National, which
converted to a bank in 1988.
The deal is not expected to be concluded for more than a year. Before then
there are some complex and precise procedures C&amp;G must undertake in order to
shed its mutual status and become a bank.
The first stop will be the High Court, probably late next month. What
happens there, in what is being billed as a friendly action brought jointly
by C&amp;G and the Building Societies Commission, the statutory regulator, will
determine whether the deal can go ahead. The Commission has been seen as
being hostile to takeover of societies by non-societies.
There are two points on which both sides are seeking clarification.
The Commission's concerns focus on the parts of the 1986 Building Societies
Act which relate to cash payments. Can a 'third party' make payments to a
society's members and can cash be distributed to anyone who has not been an
investing member of the society for at least two years?
In 1989, the Commission issued guidance to members saying that these
restrictions applied. This has been seen as a deterrent to takeovers but the
lawyers for C&amp;G and Lloyds clearly think there is room for doubt.
Beyond that obstacle C&amp;G still has to be approved as a bank by the Bank of
England. This is likely to take place over the summer and will involve
independent auditors looking at the books.
C&amp;G's statutory transfer statement, due to be sent to all members in the
autumn, must be signed and approved by the Commission as accurate and
containing all the material information members will need to make a
decision.
A Lloyds Bank extraordinary meeting has been scheduled for mid-November. A
special general meeting of C&amp;G, which all the society's qualifying members,
totalling more than 1m, are entitled to attend and vote, is pencilled in for
later the same month.
The proposals for the C&amp;G meeting must be approved by two separate
resolutions for borrowers and investors.
A simple majority of those voting is sufficient for borrowers' consent. The
position for voting investors, however, is more complicated.
Either it must be supported by 75 per cent of those voting, with a minimum
turnout of 50 per cent or it must win the consent of those holding 90 per
cent of the total value of shares held on voting day. The second alternative
may be particularly relevant given the structure of the sweeteners.
If all goes smoothly, C&amp;G will probably apply to the Commission for
confirmation of the deal in March next year. Even then, the Commission can
hear representations from interested parties - mainly members - if there are
any who believe that the process has not been properly handled.
Assuming all has gone well, that should be the end of the relationship
between the Commission and C&amp;G.

FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: Rest of sector given
something to think about
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH

<TEXT>
The news of the deal filtered through yesterday to the annual meeting of
Woolwich Building Society, where the question was raised most pertinently by
an investor in both Woolwich and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester.
Her intervention was perhaps the first pointed example of what may become a
trend. 'Other societies' investors may be asking themselves how much their
society would be worth,' Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, said.
The deal also poses a difficult question for building society managements.
The common theme of societies' reactions was that C&amp;G had been widely
expected to do something. Its character of being a niche society in the
mortgage market meant that what would make sense for C&amp;G would not
necessarily make sense for other large societies.
Even so, at least one leading society is holding a special senior management
meeting today to discuss the issues arising from the deal. Mr Longhurst was
right to envisage his equivalents scratching their heads.
Societies, however, are cautious and conscious of the benefits they derive
from being mutuals. There is no sign of an immediate stampede to follow C&amp;G
into plc status, though in the longer-term the deal does make it more likely
that societies will convert.
'It does not change our position on mutuality,' said Mr Mike Blackburn,
chief executive of Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest. 'The last
five years' results have clearly demonstrated our ability to compete
effectively as a mutual with the best in the financial services industry.'
Similarly, Mr Peter White, chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester commented
merely that it was all the more important to continue with the strategy the
group had been developing.
Others see more fundamental changes. Mr Peter Robinson, Woolwich managing
director, for example, saw the deal as potentially meaning the end of the
traditional building society merger, by having changed the scale of
incentives that are be offered to members.
It will also increase the pressure for radical changes from the review of
the Building Societies Act being carried out by the Treasury. The results of
the first stage are due to be announced next month.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, the second largest
society, is among those advocating that legislative constraints on societies
should be abolished, in order to allow them to compete more effectively.
And as smaller and weaker societies worry how the presence in the mortgage
market of the powerful combination of Lloyds and C&amp;G will undermine their
ability to compete, there is another, perhaps brighter, side for them to
consider. The revived interest of banks in building societies may mean that
there is a new category of potential rescuers for them if they do fail.

FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: City debates the value of
offer to C&amp;G members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester members might think Pounds 500 a good price
for something they did not realise they owned, the Lloyds Bank offer
prompted a debate in the City over how much the building society is really
worth.
On the most widely used measure, the price/earnings ratio, Lloyds is getting
a bargain. On the basis of C&amp;G's 1993 net profits of Pounds 132m, after
provisions for bad and doubtful debts of Pounds 75.9m, Lloyds is paying only
13.6 times earnings, while shares in Abbey National, the building society
turned bank, trade on 15 times historic earnings.
Yet both sides of the debate argue that this is the wrong yardstick and,
given the lack of market comparisons, adopt more fundamental valuations.
JP Morgan, C&amp;G's financial adviser, based its valuation on a dividend
discount model.
Mr Terry Eccles, a JP Morgan managing director, explained: 'It is a
company's long-term dividend paying capacity that really determines its
value. Then you add something to give a reasonable acquisition premium.'
The fundamental valuation was arrived at by taking management's five-year
forecasts for growth in profits and assets, estimating the reduced capital
to assets ratio the Bank of England would require of C&amp;G after converting to
a bank and then calculating the excess capital it could pay out in
dividends. Discounting the whole stream back to the present gives the
valuation.
Taking this valuation JP Morgan then compared measures such as the implied
prospective price/earnings and price/assets ratios with those of a selection
of banks, including Abbey National. 'The numbers were not too far out,
although Abbey National was at a relative premium,' said Mr Eccles.
But some analysts believe the valuation is far lower than a purchaser could
afford.
Mr Martin Hughes, banking analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'When
valuing a business you need to look at the internal generation of capital
and C&amp;G is very capital generative.
'C&amp;G is likely to have retained profits of around Pounds 170m this year. So
assuming 10 per cent annual growth in its balance sheet (which was Pounds
864m at the end of 1993) that leaves Pounds 90m of surplus capital.'
Mr Hughes is assuming that C&amp;G's assets will have reached Pounds 1.04bn by
the time the deal is concluded in 15 months, leaving Lloyds goodwill of
Pounds 760m. But at that rate of generation of surplus capital, that sum
would be made up in only eight years.
Mr Hughes says a third party could afford up to Pounds 2.5bn, without
accounting for C&amp;G's market position.

FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: Pitman confident takeover
will not be his final flourish as bank chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday night at a cocktail party in the City, a finance director of
one of Britain's largest banks was musing about the last few years of Mr
Brian Pitman as chief executive of Lloyds. 'Has he left it too late to buy
something? Would he have time to make an acquisition work now?' he asked.
They have been the most asked questions at gatherings of British bankers in
the last year. As Mr Pitman's retirement looms, speculation has grown about
how he will finish his career at the helm of the UK's most successful bank.
Mr Pitman's strategy of concentrating on using his bank's UK branch network
to sell financial products which undercut rivals on price has led to
increasing questions over what his next step will be. He has done little to
dampen speculation that he needed an acquisition to maintain momentum.
Mr Pitman took over as Lloyds' chief executive in 1983 after spending nearly
all his career in the bank. Together with Sir Jeremy Morse, the previous
chairman, he set a strategy of narrowing the range of the bank's business.
The strategy was noticeably successful in avoiding some of the traps
encountered by other banks in areas such as lending to large companies and
operating retail banks in the US. But Lloyds' share price has
under-performed in the past 18 months as questions have grown about the next
stage.
The questions have surfaced with renewed urgency since Lloyds declared
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.01bn last year, and strengthened its tier 1
ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets to 6.6 per cent. The bank appeared
to be starting to generate cash for which it had no obvious use.
Analysts and bankers started to ask whether Mr Pitman might make an error in
rushing into the wrong acquisition before 1995, the year he is due to
retire. Mr Pitman expressed some satisfaction yesterday that he had not done
so, and the rise in the bank's share price showed others agreed.
'We are not throwing money down the drain, which is what everyone feared,'
he said. But although the purchase would leave Lloyds with little spare
cash, Mr Pitman was careful to quash the notion this was definitely his last
flourish.
'I have got another opportunity on my desk today which came out of the blue.
I'm not telling you what it is,' he said. It seems there is plenty of room
for speculation yet.

FT  22 APR 94 / Gardner Merchant rises 50% after break from Forte
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gardner Merchant, the contract caterer bought by the management from Forte
for Pounds 402m at the end of 1992, lifted profits by 50 per cent for the
year to January 31 and took turnover through the Pounds 1bn barrier.
Europe's biggest caterer said no date had been set for its flotation, but
City analysts suggested that if it were to come to the market this year, it
could be valued at Pounds 600m or more.
Gardner reported profits before interest and tax of Pounds 46.9m (Pounds
31.3m) on turnover up from Pounds 980m to Pounds 1.02bn. Margins improved
from 3.2 to 4.6 per cent.
The results were good, said one analyst, but they should have been better in
1992 when the management was distracted by bids and buy-out plans.
Mr Garry Hawkes, chief executive, said the first year of independence had
been 'one of the most successful years in our history'. He cited strong
morale, helped by the fact that 1,000 managers were shareholders. Their 8
per cent stake is expected to rise to 20 per cent when the company is
floated. A further 6,800 employees have been granted the right to share
options.
Mr Hawkes said the group was 'under no pressure from our investors' to
float. But he added that the four-year gap mentioned at the time of the
buy-out 'is longer than I would anticipate'.
Strong cashflow enabled the group, which employs 47,000 worldwide, to cut
its senior debt from Pounds 200m to Pounds 163m.
Forte, the hotels group, has been criticised for disposing of two cash
generative businesses in Gardner Merchant and Alpha Airports, the airport
caterer. Shares in Alpha, floated in January at 140p, closed last night at
170p. However, Forte has retained a 25 per cent stake in both businesses.
Yesterday also saw the Pounds 55.3m sale of Solartron, the instruments group
bought by the management from Schlumberger, the oilfield services company,
for Pounds 35m in November. Solartron has been acquired by Roxboro, the
recently floated maker of specialist electronic and electrical products.

FT  22 APR 94 / IBM beats profit forecasts

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines reported higher than expected first quarter
earnings on slightly increased revenues as costs declined more quickly than
anticipated.
First quarter net earnings were Dollars 392m (Pounds 263m), or 64 cents per
share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 399m, or 70 cents, in the first
quarter of 1993. Revenues rose 2 per cent to Dollars 13.4bn.
IBM's shares were trading at Dollars 57 1/8 in mid-session yesterday, up
from Dollars 52 1/4 .
The first-quarter results represent IBM's second consecutive quarterly
profit after three years of heavy losses. Revenues increased for the first
time since the third quarter of 1992.
'Our first-quarter results were encouraging,' said Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman
and chief executive. 'Revenues grew in all major regions of the world.
Expenses declined significantly. However, the results from one quarter do
not guarantee sustained, long-term success. We've improved in many areas,
but we still have a long way to go.'
This year's first quarter results included an after-tax gain of Dollars
248m, or 43 cents per share, from the recent sale of Federal Systems
business. Operational results of this unit were excluded from the 1994
results.
The company also took an after-tax write-down of Dollars 192m for a change
in software amortisation periods from six years to four years. The
accounting change reflected more rapid advances in software technology and a
shorter period over which to recover costs, the company said.
Excluding these special items, IBM revenues for the quarter grew 6 per cent
and net earnings were Dollars 336m, or 54 cents a share. Analysts had been
projecting earnings of about 8 cents per share.
Gross margins remained stable at 39.2 per cent, excluding the effect of the
software write-down.
Total expenses fell 23 per cent in the first quarter, mainly because of
continuing cuts in personnel and operations. IBM reduced its workforce by
13,000, including 10,000 going with the Federal Systems business, 'We are
targeting a further reduction of 28,000 by the end of the year,' said Mr
Jerry York, chief financial officer.
Revenues from mainframe computers continued to decline, said Mr York, but
the rate of decline slowed to about 12 per cent, from more than 30 per cent
per quarter in 1993. Sales of personal computers grew strongly, but profit
margins were lower than those of competitors, Mr York acknowledged.
First-quarter revenues in the US were Dollars 5.3bn, up 6 per cent,
excluding the results of the Federal Systems business. European revenues
rose 3 per cent to Dollars 4.7bn.

FT  22 APR 94 / Investigators raid Schneider to hunt for evidence of fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Criminal investigators launched raids across Germany yesterday in a hunt for
evidence to support suspicions of fraud after last week's collapse of Mr
Jurgen Schneider's private property empire.
The search covered Schneider offices in Frankfurt, Munich and Konigstein,
and the homes and other properties of family members and their tax advisers,
officials said.
A private inquiry has been opened at Deutsche Bank, which is owed DM1.2bn
(Pounds 475m) by the Schneider group, and which has become the centre of a
storm of political and popular outrage over the affair.
According to Mr Hilmar Kopper, the bank's chairman, any 'mistakes' uncovered
by independent auditors - who are due to report to him in three weeks -
would lead to 'consequences' for those responsible, including main board
members.
Mr Kopper, who is expected to face the press at a briefing next Monday,
admitted there may have been 'mistakes' after reports that Deutsche Bank had
advanced excessive credits on properties which contained less lettable space
than Mr Schneider claimed.
These revelations led to speculation that employees at Deutsche and other
creditor banks may have been involved in the suspected fraud.
The Hesse prosecutors' office said 'in clarification' yesterday it was not
investigating any bank employees.
This followed a statement from the office's spokesman on Wednesday that such
a probe could not be ruled out.
The property group's bankruptcy, with debts of more than DM5bn, has stirred
up further popular antagonism against a banking community already under fire
for allegedly failing to pass on lower interest rates to customers and being
reluctant to invest in eastern German industry.
Deutsche Bank has also been heavily criticised for its part in the recent
near-collapse of the Metallgesellschaft group, prevented only by a DM3.4bn
rescue package.
The Schneider affair, in which most of the banks' loans are secured against
valuable properties, has now prompted accusations that their lax lending
practices have led indirectly to heavy financial and job losses among
contractors, architects and other Schneider suppliers.

FT  22 APR 94 / Vauxhall falls 17% as continental exports suffer: GM arm
still most profitable carmaker in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, suffered a 17.3 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits last year to Pounds 185.1m (Pounds 223.7m), but
remained the most profitable carmaker in Britain.
Mr Charles Golden, chairman and managing director, said profits would
recover this year helped by higher sales, increased productivity and further
cost reductions.
Profits were depressed last year by an 18.7 per cent decline in production
of cars and car-derived vans to 245,313, the company said.
Vehicle output fell after a steep decline in exports, which dropped 58 per
cent to 46,964 because of weak demand for new cars in continental Europe.
Vauxhall's two vehicle assembly plants at Luton, Bedfordshire, and at
Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, worked at only 78 per cent capacity last year
compared with 96 per cent in 1992, said Mr Golden.
Vauxhall captured a record 17.1 per cent share of the UK new car market last
year, where it is in second place behind Ford, compared with 16.7 per cent
in 1992. Its UK car sales jumped 14.2 per cent to 303,926 in an overall
market that rose 11.6 per cent to 1.78m. Operating profits fell 23 per cent
to Pounds 191.8m, while turnover rose 3.4 per cent to Pounds 3.1bn.
Mr Golden said that the decline in exports - down by 66,000 vehicles - had
reduced profits by Pounds 71m, while the cut in production had cost another
Pounds 18m. The Luton plant was hit by short-time working and forced to halt
production of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra for nearly 13 weeks in 1993.
These factors had been offset by cost-savings, which improved profitability
by Pounds 36m, and by increased domestic sales which contributed an extra
Pounds 10m.
Mr Golden said Vauxhall had improved its productivity by 88 per cent in the
past six years, from 24 to 45 cars per employee.
The workforce was reduced by 6.7 per cent during the year to 10,222, and it
had been cut to fewer than 10,000 by February this year.
Vauxhall was planning to invest more than Pounds 100m to modernise and
automate its Luton assembly plant in the next two years in preparation for
the launch of the new generation Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra in late 1995.
Mr Golden was cautious about the outlook for UK new car sales and forecast a
rise of 6-7 per cent for the year to 1.9m. He said Vauxhall expected to
increase its market share further, helped by the launch of the new Omega
executive car, the Monterey four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicle, and the
Tigra small coupe in the autumn.
The Avis Europe group of car rental companies, in which GM holds a 26.5 per
cent interest through Vauxhall, made a net loss of Pounds 74.2m last year.

FT  22 APR 94 / Babcock issue to raise Pounds 79m amid shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Babcock International, the engi-neering contractor and materials handling
group, yesterday announced a four-for-seven rights issue to raise Pounds
78.6m and the restructuring of its heavily loss-making energy division.
The shake-up will lead to 450 job cuts at Babcock's manufacturing plant at
Renfrew, Scotland, and a Pounds 25m exceptional charge in the year ended
March 31. The group estimated its pre-tax loss at Pounds 41.2m for 1993-94,
against a profit of Pounds 21.1m a year earlier. It is passing its final
dividend.
Both the rights issue and the charges were larger than some analysts had
expected, but Babcock shares rose from 33 1/4 p to 37p as the City reacted
warmly to the long-awaited announcement of future strategy, following the
arrival in October of a new management team.
Mr John Parker, chief executive, said: 'We have put in place a plan to
enable Babcock to be more competitive in the international marketplace. The
overall objective is to establish sustainable profit and dividend growth.'
Babcock has suffered a succession of troubles in its contracting businesses.
The biggest was the discovery of serious technical problems on its Pounds
400m-plus flue gas desulphurisation contract at National Power's Drax power
station in North Yorkshire.
Now Mr Parker plans to move Babcock's energy division away from large
construction activities to become more focused on technology, engineering
and project management. 'We have a certain size, and we must not bet the
balance sheet on a particular contract,' he said.
The division, he said, would concentrate marketing towards higher growth
markets, particularly China and the Pacific Rim. It has signed a partnership
agreement with the Wuhan Boiler Works, China's fourth largest boilermaker.
At the same time, Mr Parker will continue to expand Babcock's materials
handling and process divisions.
Babcock has also negotiated replacement banking facilities totalling Pounds
60m, extending over two years. These are conditional on the rights issue
proceeding and without them, the group would have been in breach of its
banking covenants on publication of the audited accounts for the year ended
March 31.
Lord King will retire as chairman in July. Mr Parker will succeed him and Mr
Nick Salmon, managing director, will become chief executive.

FT  22 APR 94 / Child Support Agency Pounds 100m short of target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Child Support Agency is more than Pounds 100m short of its overall
target of making benefit savings of Pounds 530m for 1993-94, forcing the
government to alter its business plan and targets for the following year.
The shortfall in savings will hit the performance-related pay bonus of Ms
Ros Hepplewhite, the agency's chief executive.
Whitehall officials stressed that it would be wrong to blame Ms Hepplewhite
for the agency's failure to meet its targets.
Ministers put the agency's disappointing financial performance down to
changes forced by the Commons social security committee and a refusal by
some fathers to pay maintenance.
The Department of Social Security responded to Commons criticism of the
agency by amending the formula for absent parents' maintenance payments in
February.
The changes also allowed fathers facing big bills to pay in stages during an
18-month period.
Officials fear the shortfall in benefit savings could be significantly
higher than Pounds 100m if the figures for April, the last in the agency's
financial year, fail to meet the original target.
In 1992-93, the CSA's forerunner, the Child Support Unit, made benefit
savings of Pounds 313m, while in 1991-92 the Benefit Agency recovered Pounds
283m.
The department has already decided to scale back the agency's business plan
and targets for 1994-95 and subsequent years. 'We do not have a Stalinist
five-year plan,' said one official.
'The subsequent targets will be set in the light of what has been achieved
and is achievable in the future.'
The Commons social security committee will launch a 'thorough review' of the
agency's workings when it receives the CSA's annual report, expected in
July.
Ministers had hoped that any subsequent review of the agency would take
place later in the year. Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman, was yesterday
adamant, however, that the review would take place immediately on receipt by
the committee of the CSA's report
The social security committee expects to publish its second report on the
agency in the autumn.
After receiving 2,000 letters, Mr Field says he believes the anger expressed
by the public necessitates a new inquiry to decide whether the formula,
which determines how much parents should pay, should be changed.
The review will also consider setting up an appeals tribunal with discretion
on how the formula should be implemented.
'This is the biggest change in the welfare state since its inception in
1945,' said Mr Field. 'If the agency is to be strengthened, it demands a
major review of its workings.'

FT  22 APR 94 / Euro-MPs to vote on terms for EU's new entrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European parliament leaders yesterday decided to go ahead with ratification
of EU entry terms for Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway on May 4, raising
hopes that the newcomers can join the Union in January.
The leaders' decision, which had been in doubt this week, came after the
parliament made headway in its demands for equal status with the European
Commission, ahead of the EU constitutional review in 1996.
Leaders of the multinational political groups at the Strasbourg assembly
yesterday felt confident they could muster the overall majority of 260 out
of 518 MEPs to get the vote through in two weeks' time.
Intensive lobbying by Scandinavian and Austrian government and party
leaders, and by the European Commission and Council of Ministers, has
mollified many Euro-MPs angry at last month's compromise deal on EU voting
rights between the UK and its European partners.
As the price of its decision to keep enlargement on the January 1
fast-track, the parliament has demanded equal status with the Commission in
the 1996 constitutional review, when national voting weights in the Council
of Ministers will be reviewed.
In another show of muscle-flexing, MEPs are demanding the right to hold US
Senate-style confirmation hearings to vet the member states' nominees to the
new Commission, due to take office in January.
Parliament must be consulted on a successor to Commission President Jacques
Delors, expected to be named at the EU summit in Corfu on June 24-25. But it
can only approve or reject the president and his fellow commissioners in
their entirety.
Senior parliament officials say that, just as the threat to delay
enlargement was used to frustrate Britain on voting rights, Strasbourg will
refuse to put approval of the new Commission on the agenda unless its
members appear individually before the parliament's committees.
Despite the parliament's attempts to expand its influence, on Wednesday
night it botched its first attempt to veto a measure by the Council of
Ministers. The MEPs were set to overturn the member states' decision to ban
motorcycle engines above 100 brake horse power, but too few attended the
vote.
Senior officials played down the risk that parliament could be inquorate for
May's enlargement vote. 'For a vote like this we have an entirely different
way of operating; we pull out all the stops,' insisted Mr Julian Priestley,
secretary-general of the 198-strong Socialist Group, Strasbourg's largest
bloc.

FT  22 APR 94 / Clothes retailers hit as Brussels imposes limits on silk
imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The imported silk shirt could soon disappear from the British chain store.
Clothes retailers say that harsh import restrictions levelled against
Chinese textiles by the European Commission have left them with millions of
pounds' worth of silk clothing sitting in Asian ports, paid for, but now
unlikely to be delivered.
Until last month there were no limits on silk clothing imports into the UK,
and the market was thriving. The silk shirt, once an expensive specialist
purchase, was on the racks of all the big clothing chains thanks to cheaper
imports from China.
However, Brussels introduced a Europe-wide system of quotas on Chinese
imports not covered under its bilateral trade arrangements, and British
importers say they have already filled this year's European silk quota of
20,000 tonnes.
Trade officials at the Chinese embassy in London protested yesterday that
the quota was introduced without consultation. The low ceiling was set as
the Commission began preparing for wide-ranging market-opening negotiations
with Beijing.
Apparently unaware of the axe that was about to fall, retailers such as
Marks and Spencer, Burtons, C&amp;A, BHS and Sock Shop ordered shirts on which
irrevocable letters of credit were issued.
'It is not just that these items were paid for and now can't be got into the
country, but the level of the quotas is so low that it represents a
scandalous interruption to the flow of trade,' Mr Hugh Clark, the director
of trading policy at the British Retail Consortium, said yesterday.
The Department of Trade and Industry confirmed that licences issued for
Chinese silk imports into the UK had already reached the limit.
In 1992, before the silk boom, European imports were 12,000 tonnes,
according to the Commission, but UK retailers say their imports more than
trebled last year.
'We will be OK for about two months, but then that's it,' said TEL Europe,
silk supplier to the Burton Group and BhS, among others. 'There will
certainly be no silk shirts for the pre-Christmas shopper. And we are
looking at a fall in our business to a third of last year's level.'
The DTI is lobbying hard for an increase to the quotas. But Brussels is
adamant that not only will it not alter this year's quotas, but that the
quotas will stand, subject to negotiations with China.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Monthly retail sales figures often shed more light on weather patterns than
consumer spending trends. The CSO's figures showing a marked improvement in
retail sales in March may well have been blown around a bit. The numbers
were certainly in marked contrast with the earlier CBI distributive trades
survey, which suggested consumers were running scared of looming tax rises.
Yet any number of shopkeepers - including Etam yesterday - will testify to
the unpredictability of demand.
The longer term trend in retail sales, though, is still strong. The CSO's
annual value comparisons may be distorted by Easter being such a moveable
feast. But the strong rise in the value of household goods sales over the
past three months must be reflecting the pick up in housing transactions.
The predicted rise in house prices may also tickle up consumer spending,
especially in south east England.
Tax rises will progressively squeeze spending over the coming months
although that may be offset by a fall in the savings ratio. Yet, if base
rates rise next year then savings ratios may follow, dampening consumer
demand. That may not worry the government unduly. Consumers have done their
bit. Other sectors of the economy must take up the running.

FT  22 APR 94 / The Lex Column: SmithKline Beecham
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
First quarter figures from SmithKline Beecham demonstrate why the
pharmaceuticals sector has been so thoroughly de-rated. Earnings growth
looks healthy enough, but underlying sales growth in pharmaceuticals slowed
to only 1 per cent. There are special factors at work, such as healthcare
reform in Italy. But such set-backs are becoming an increasingly regular
feature of results in this sector. The expiry next month of the US patent
protecting Tagamet, SB's ulcer treatment, is another reason for caution.
Having underperformed the equity market by 10 per cent since mid-March, SB's
shares now stand on a multiple of around 11 times this year's forecast
earnings, against a market average of 14 times. Such a rating is consistent
with the valuations applied to Glaxo, Wellcome and US pharmaceutical stocks.
Even on such lowly multiples, though, it is difficult to argue that the
sector is cheap.
Profit margins are being eroded by competition from cheap generic drugs and
the tough attitude of healthcare buyers, including governments. Until
investors have a better idea of where margins might settle, the sector will
remain vulnerable. At least SB is taking its medicine early. By this time
next year the impact on margins of Tagamet's patent expiry should be easier
to judge. If SB can drive its new drugs forward in the meantime, it could be
among the first to bounce.

FT  22 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Ford Motor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not taken long for British-born Mr Alex Trotman to make his mark as
Ford's chairman. Mr Trotman, who ran each of Ford's Asia-Pacific, European
and North American operations in succession before assuming his current role
at the start of the year, is now sweeping those regional baronies away. The
geographical structure made sense when long-distance communication was hard
but is a hindrance in today's global village. Developing different models
for different regions is wasteful, while fuzzy lines of authority make
co-operation cumbersome.
The reorganisation on product lines follows Ford's previous faltering
attempts to create a global car. Plans in the early 1980s to create a single
world Escort did not materialise because of squabbling between fiefdoms and,
though Ford has managed to create a global car with the Mondeo, it cost
Dollars 6bn and took six years. The new structure will allow the same to be
done for Ford's whole range but more swiftly and at lower cost.
While the upheaval should put Ford in a better position to serve the global
market than its main US rivals, it still has a fight on its hands. The
anticipated annual Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn savings by 2000 are not huge when
set alongside the group's near Dollars 100bn costs. Moreover, Ford lacks an
effective strategy for the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region, where its
market share is only 2 per cent. Japanese rivals such as Toyota, which have
always produced one car for all markets, have a better global reach.

FT  22 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Pitman's long hand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Suddenly the anxiety melted away. Lloyds Bank has not only found a sensible
home for its surplus capital; it is buying a building society which is a
sound strategic fit and offers the prospect of organic growth, so
conspicuously lacking in recent years. As an added bonus, the field of
candidates to succeed Mr Brian Pitman on his eventual retirement has been
strengthened with the arrival of Mr Andrew Long-hurst, Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester's chief executive. Small wonder Lloyds' shares rose 9 per cent on
the day.
Since C&amp;G is willing to be bought, Lloyds is spared the need to pay a heavy
bid premium. Moreover C&amp;G's mutual structure makes its market value
difficult to ascertain. Lloyds has to offer enough to convince its members
to vote in favour of the deal. It has been splashing its money around in a
way that must seem impressive to individual savers. It appears to have
struck a good deal just the same.
The historic multiple of 13.6 which Lloyds is paying is hardly expensive
when set against that of 15 on which Abbey National trades, even though
C&amp;G's narrower focus makes it more exposed to mortgage margin pressure than
Abbey. By the time C&amp;G's future retained earnings are factored in, Lloyds
will be paying well under twice book value for an acquisition that should
immediately enhance earnings.
The combination of C&amp;G's low processing costs with cheap funding from Lloyds
promises to create a formidable force in the mortgage market. The chances
are that this will speed up the process of rationalisation of the building
society sector. But that may not make life easier for banks like Abbey
National and TSB which have been wondering about wading in. C&amp;G wanted to be
bought, its management is being allowed to retain control of the business
and no branch closures are planned. Such a fortunate combination of
circumstances is rare and hostile bids for building societies remain as
difficult as ever.

FT  22 APR 94 / Tomorrow, the world: Kevin Done examines the restructuring
which underpins Ford's ambitions to become a global car company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, the world's second-largest vehicle maker, yesterday threw down the
gauntlet to its rivals in the auto industry.
For the first time in its history it is seeking to become a global
corporation, breaking down the national and regional barriers that have
blocked its drive to create common vehicles for the world market.
'This is a worldwide business that requires the broadest thinking and
execution,' Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said
yesterday.
In a bold move aimed at freeing it from the shackles of its corporate
history, Ford is planning to move to a single set of processes and systems
throughout its product development, manufacturing, supply and sales
activities.
If it succeeds, Ford will set new benchmarks that will be hard for most of
its competitors to match.
All the world's carmakers face the same challenge of trying to increase the
efficiency of their enormous investment programmes, while at the same time
producing a greater diversity of products.
They must increase the speed at which they can bring products to the market
while jumping into emerging markets, be it for multi-purpose vehicles,
sport-utility vehicles or micro cars. They must squeeze their massive
materials purchasing bills by moving to global sourcing for parts and
systems.
What they can no longer afford in a world of overcapacity and shrinking
margins is the luxury of duplication. It is too wasteful, for instance, to
develop an Escort-sized car for Europe, and in parallel to develop a similar
but yet entirely different vehicle for North America.
With its deeply entrenched traditions of independent regional fiefdoms that
is exactly what Ford has been doing, but now it is calling a halt.
Ford's problem - and one that it has in common with General Motors, its arch
domestic rival and the world's biggest vehicle maker - is that it carries a
much heavier burden from its history than its more agile Japanese rivals.
The big Japanese players, Toyota, Nissan and Honda, have only been moving
into world markets in a significant way in the past 20 years. With the
benefits of modern communications, their organisations have been more
streamlined. Essentially the same car has been sold in all markets around
the world. A Toyota Corolla is little different whether it is sold in North
America, Europe or Japan. In its main features it is designed and engineered
only once, even though it is assembled in four continents.
By contrast, Ford of Europe and General Motors Europe have developed as
fully fledged independent vehicle makers. For many years most of their
products have been designed, developed and engineered solely for the
European market, perhaps with some exports to the rest of the world. They
have duplicated rather than complemented their parent organisations in North
America.
In its corporate revolution Ford plans to create Ford Automotive Operations,
which will effectively merge its European and North American operations as
well as its automotive components group into a single operating unit.
In place of its largely independent regional companies, Ford is reorganising
itself along global product lines through five vehicle programme centres
(VPCs), four in North America and one in Europe.
The European VPC, with its research and engineering centres split as now
between the UK and Germany, is to become responsible for small and medium
frontwheel drive cars. This will be a worldwide responsibility and will
include the manufacturing plants around the world building such vehicles,
whether in the US, Mexico or Europe. It will cover the development of
Fiesta, Escort and Mondeo-sized cars in Europe and in North America.
Headquartered in the US at Ford's research and engineering centre in
Dearborn, near Detroit, Michigan, will be the other four vehicle programme
centres:
for large frontwheel drive cars, such as the Ford Taurus,
for rearwheel drive cars such as the Ford Crown Victoria, but ultimately,
too, the Jaguar range, though Jaguar will maintain resources in the UK,
for personal-use trucks, such as the Ford Windstar multi-purpose vehicle,
and
for commercial trucks. This VPC in North America, for example, would take
over responsibility for the development of the highly successful Ford
Transit van from Europe.
'By integrating all our automotive processes and eliminating duplication of
effort, we will use our creative and technical resources most effectively,'
said Mr Trotman yesterday.
He claimed that Ford's new way of doing business would provide customers
with a broader array of vehicles in most markets and would ensure that the
group was fully competitive in quality and value against the best in the
world.
At the same time the simplification of engineering, purchasing and other
processes would 'substantially reduce the cost of operating the automotive
business'. Ford estimated the potential cost-saving from the reorganisation
of at least Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn a year by the end of the decade.
The group has been feeling its way for more than a decade towards ways of
increasing the global punch of its organisation. Its top management has long
been tantalised by the holy grail of the so-called world car, and by the
savings that should be achieved by developing a product once for both
manufacture and sale in different continents.
It tried in the late 1970s with a common programme for Ford Escorts in
Europe and in North America, but the cars launched at the beginning of the
1980s ended up with little more in common than the name and the blue FORD
oval badge on the bonnet.
Ford has come closer in the past few years with the Mondeo world car
programme, a Dollars 6bn attempt to develop a largely common car to replace
both the Sierra in Europe and the Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz in North America.
This car, launched in Europe early last year and this year in North America,
is the biggest roll of the dice in Ford's history in terms of the financial
resources it has consumed. The six-year Mondeo programme was the most
ambitious and costly programme undertaken by the US vehicle maker.
Ford had to reform its engineering and manufacturing infrastructure in
America and Europe to break down entrenched barriers between the two in
order to develop in Europe a mainstream car acceptable in both markets. The
Mondeo/Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique is being assembled at Ford's Genk plant
in Belgium, at Kansas City in the US, and in Mexico.
The same family of four-cylinder engines is being made at plants in Bridgend
in the UK and at Cologne in Germany for Europe, and at Chihuahua in Mexico
for North America. A top-of-the-range aluminium V6 engine is being made at
Cleveland, Ohio, for both the US and European-produced cars.
Manual transmissions are being made in Europe at Halewood, Merseyside, in
the UK, and at Cologne, while an electronically controlled, four-speed
automatic gearbox is being made in the US. After a global search, common
component producers have been chosen to supply both the European and North
American assembly plants.
Mondeo was the one-off programme that began to show the way forward for
Ford. Now the lessons are to be institutionalised throughout its
organisation.
Product development in North America and Europe will become fully integrated
with the five vehicle programme centres. They will have specific worldwide
responsibilities and will report to one product development executive.
Supporting the changes in the product development process, Ford's
manufacturing, purchasing and marketing and sales operations will each
become integrated worldwide. An automotive strategy office will co-ordinate
strategic planning.
These are huge steps and will take several years to complete, but they are
still only the first steps. Looming on the Ford agenda are the issues of how
it should integrate Mazda into this new organisation, its loss-making 25 per
cent-owned affiliate in Japan. And how it should tackle the integration of
its Latin American operations, where the group owns 49 per cent of
Autolatina, with Volkswagen of Germany controlling 51 per cent.
In both cases it must take into account the sensitivities of its partners,
and they must wait for tomorrow. The merger of Ford Europe and North America
is more than enough for today.

Sir Percy Cradock, the foreign affairs adviser to two prime ministers who
now spends his days advising merchant bankers Kleinwort Benson, has a nice
line in one-liners. He particularly relishes exercising the talent at the
expense of Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor.
In pursuing confrontation with China over Hong Kong's political development,
Patten has 'taken Hong Kong over the edge', while the Legislative Council
has embarked on a 'legislative Charge of the Light Brigade', in approving
Patten's plans.
When asked if the legislature might not have the right at least to give
democracy a try, Cradock intoned: 'You assert the universal right of
legislatures to commit suicide . . . an interesting proposition.'

How far is ex-Australian premier Bob Hawke prepared to go in his bid to
supplement his parliamentary pension? Quite a long way it seems, if recent
comments by Conrad Black, the Canadian newspaper magnate, are to be
believed.
Black yesterday told an Australian senate committee hearing into foreign
ownership of Australia's print media that Hawke had offered to act as his
organisation's 'eyes and ears' in Canberra in return for a Dollars 50,000
fee.
The offer was turned down because 'we didn't think that he was the best
person to tell us what Mr Keating was thinking', said Black, in an apparent
reference to the bitter Labour party leadership battle between the two
former friends.
So much for Hawke's chances of getting a seat with the rest of the great and
the good on Black's Daily Telegraph board.

Lloyds Bank's bid for the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society is very
neat. Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman, perhaps the ablest clearing
banker of his generation, started out in the C&amp;G's mortgage accounts
department and has now capped his career by agreeing to take over his old
firm.
If Pitman had stuck with the C&amp;G, he might have made an even bigger success
of it than did Andrew Longhurst. Listening to them both yesterday, they
sounded remarkably similar animals. Indeed, there must be a suspicion that
one of the reasons for the deal was to line up a pushy successor to Brian
Pitman, who at 62 is well past Lloyds' normal retirement.
Since Michael Hepher, Lloyds Abbey Life's 50-year-old whizz-kid, defected to
British Telecom two and a half years ago, there has been no obvious
successor to Pitman. But Longhurst will be nearly 56 by the time the deal is
done - which makes him a bit long in the tooth. Even so, he's an ambitious
sort and it's hard to see him drifting into retirement contentedly running a
clearing bank subsidiary.
Pitman has proved that the over-60s can still run rings round the
40-somethings now running Barclays and NatWest. While they have been
earnestly reorganising their management structures, Lloyds has been doing
the deals that count.
Yesterday's announcement is unlikely to be Pitman's last move - or
Longhurst's for that matter.

Wednesday's public sector borrowing requirement figures had to be corrected

Never mind; the numbers were only Pounds 100m adrift.

Popular he may be. But Brian Lara - the West Indies' record-breaking
cricketer - might not be the favourite pin-up of trade unions in his home
land.
The reason is simple. Lara returns to Trinidad and Tobago today, a moment in
the calendar which the country's perennially truculent trade unions had
designated - along with three successive days - as 'days of resistance'.
They called a general strike in protest at government plans to sack hundreds
of workers from state-owned enterprises. But in a stroke of Machiavellian
brilliance, the government has now determined that today shall be nationally
recognised as a 'day of achievement'.
Cresting the Lara-mania tidal wave now engulfing the country's 1.2m people,
the government has clean-bowled the unions; schools are closed for half-day
holidays and various civic jamborees are planned. How can you stage a strike
when no one would have been working anyway?

FT  22 APR 94 / Dark horse sets the pace: The carmaker's UK-born chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is less than six months since Mr Alex Trotman, an Englishman originally
from Middlesex but raised in Scotland, became the first chairman of the
world's second-largest carmaker to be born outside the US.
As of yesterday, Mr Trotman, who will be 61 in July, will be remembered in
the US for much more than his origins.
He has set Ford on the road towards a radically new future faster than the
latest Mustang which young Americans are falling over themselves to buy -
and to whom Mr Trotman has become something of a hero for saving the Mustang
from the chopping block of Ford's product planners.
The imagery is apt. In terms of Ford's hierarchy, Mr Trotman himself might
be described as the dark horse who became the favourite with almost
bewildering speed.
He surprised many in the European industry by becoming chairman of Ford of
Europe in the mid-1980s. His unassuming manner and faintly diffident air -
contrasting oddly with his clipped moustache and the outward appearance of a
military man - gave few clues that he might be earmarked for the top.
His performance at the opening of the New York motor show two weeks ago
might have made him an almost unrecognisable figure to former European
colleagues - poking fun at his own expense about past 'boring' speeches and
handling the ranks of hard-bitten US media men like a music-hall
professional.
But Mr Trotman has earned his success the hard way in his 38 years with
Ford. He started as a 'progress chaser' - expediting supplies - in the
purchasing department at its Dagenham plant. He worked his way through jobs
which other potential candidates for the top post - the urbane Mr Allan
Gilmour, a vice-chairman who had spent most of his career in finance, for
instance - might have found unenviable.
'My three years in purchasing was a boot camp,' Mr Trotman recalls. 'But I
can think of no better place to learn the auto business. It was immediate
and challenging and one of the toughest jobs I ever had. Often I'd wind up
driving all night, with my old car filled with a thousand parts to get to
the plant in time for start-up.'
He joined Ford of Britain's newly created product planning group in 1959 at
a time when 'most thought of product planning as a place where guys sat
around sipping tea and reading magazines'.
However, it was the first step down a career path which has led inexorably
to the restructuring plan announced yesterday, which has new product
programmes, and their costs and organisation, at its very core. Almost
certainly, his product planning experience was the crucial factor in Mr
Trotman pipping Mr Gilmour to the chairman's post.
He became chief product analyst on project 'Archbishop' - to become the
Cortina when it arrived in showrooms. The kudos accruing to Mr Trotman from
one of Europe's most successful saloon cars subsequently carried him into
the product planning chief's role for Ford of Europe.
Since then he has become the only Ford executive to have run all three of
its geographical sectors of operation - Asia-Pacific (in 1983-84), Europe
(in 1984-89) and North America, where he was head of US operations before
leapfrogging into the chairmanship.
Most colleagues admire his no-nonsense approach to the business, although
his scrapping of executive privileges, such as separate dining rooms, at
first rankled with a few.
Mr Trotman is happy to meet critics head on. 'I don't mind punch-ups,' he
maintains, 'as long as they're out in the open. I won't tolerate cliques or
intrigues.'

FT  22 APR 94 / Leading Article: The good news from the IMF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be foolish to judge the International Monetary Fund's World
Economic Outlook by its forecasts, which are virtually bound to be wrong. So
a sensible reader would ignore the soothsaying and concentrate on the IMF's
underlying story instead.
This is not to say that the IMF's recent forecasting record has been all
bad. A year ago it thought world output would expand by 2.2 per cent in
1993; in the event, it expanded by 2.3 per cent. But this excellent forecast
did, as might have been expected, reflect offsetting errors. While world
output may grow at 3 per cent in 1994 and 3.7 per cent in 1995, as the IMF
foretells, there will almost certainly be a larger dispersion among
individual performances than it suggests.
The IMF's story is still the interesting part. A central element of it is
the end of the recession of the early 1990s in industrial countries. The
economies of the US, UK and Canada are all growing strongly. Those of Japan,
Germany, Italy and France are bottoming out. The IMF argues that further
reductions in short-term interest rates would help support recovery in Japan
and the European continent 'without jeopardising reasonable price
stability'. It also believes that interest rates are likely to fall in
Europe. It is right on the first point and deserves to be proved right on
the second.
Sorely needed
Encouragingly, inflation in industrial countries is at 'levels not seen for
almost three decades'. The Uruguay Round has been completed, so setting the
stage for further integration of the world economy via expanded world trade.
In addition, there have been significant efforts at fiscal consolidation in
a number of industrial countries. As a result, says the IMF, 'structural
budget positions are projected to improve during the next few years'. Such
efforts were sorely needed, given the earlier deteriorations in the fiscal
positions of the US, Germany, France and the UK, and the dire position in
Italy.
Further afield, the positive feature of the world economy that stands out is
the dynamic growth of Asian developing countries. Both in 1992 and 1993 the
region's economic growth was over 8 per cent, led by the 13 per cent
achieved by China in both years. This growth has become self-sustaining.
Short of a depression or fierce protection, what happens in the industrial
countries no longer determines the fate of many developing countries. One
reason for this is the increase in the proportion of exports from developing
countries going to one another, up from 30 per cent in the early 1980s to
almost 40 per cent today.
African decline
Between 1984 and 1993, those developing countries with incomes per head that
grew faster than the average for industrial countries saw their income per
head rise at 5.7 per cent a year. These countries, which included China and
India, also possess 68 per cent of the population of developing countries.
Needless to say, the IMF would not be the IMF and the world would not be the
world if there was no reason to worry. About 16.5 per cent of the population
of developing countries lived in countries, many of them African, which
suffered average annual declines in income per head of 1.2 per cent between
1984 and 1993. Again, a few former communist countries in transition are
beginning to pull their economies round, but almost all the members of the
former Soviet Union have chosen neither shock reform nor gradual reform, but
no reform at all, with predictably dire results.
Back in the industrial countries, European structural unemployment is
frighteningly high, while effective policy to reduce it is hardly on the
horizon. Yet what is needed is obvious, as two telling statistics show. The
youth unemployment rate in France is 22 per cent. In Germany it is 4 per
cent. France has high minimum wages for young workers and underdeveloped
training programmes, while Germany has no minimum wage for young workers and
an extensive apprenticeship system.
Naturally, things never go well everywhere. But what has been going right
should at least make it easier to deal with what has been going wrong.
Policymakers must not be complacent, but they can at least take credit for
things that have worked out.

FT  22 APR 94 / Leading Article: Lloyds' capital deployed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea that banks might have too much capital for their own good or for
the good of the banking system appears entirely counter-intuitive. Capital
is, after all, the banks' ultimate cushion against loss. Yet banking history
is littered with cases where excess capital has had a corrosive effect on
prudential discipline and encouraged managers to over-expand loan books or
engage in injudicious takeovers. The banking authorities have thus had good
reason to worry about the growing possibility that the UK clearing banks
might become over-capitalised. And they can probably take comfort from the
fact that Lloyds, the most prolific generator of retained profits, has found
a way of disposing of capital that does not appear to pose any obvious
systemic threat.
One of the Bank of England's concerns has been that clearing banks have been
slow to drop their hurdle rates of return in a period of relatively low
inflation. High nominal returns against a disinflationary background can
only be achieved by taking exceptional risks, assuming that the banks are
already exploiting existing profit opportunities in the less competitive
areas of their business to the full. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's return on
equity last year was around 16.5 per cent. With Lloyds paying 2.1 times book
value for the society, that return will shrink to a little over 8 per cent.
Goodwill element
This is a long way short of the target rates of return Lloyds was widely
assumed to be looking for. And while the return will be enhanced by a
further year's earnings by the time Lloyds comes to lay out the money in the
second quarter of 1995 if the deal goes ahead, the regulators can feel that
the balance of risk and reward looks sensible. The Pounds 936m goodwill
element of the Pounds 1.8bn purchase price looks high, at first sight, in
relation to Lloyds shareholders' funds of Pounds 3.1bn. But it will probably
more than halve on the basis of current year retained earnings alone.
Compared with most other potential investments available to a clearing bank,
the acquisition looks good from both Lloyds' and the authorities' points of
view.
Whether it is an appropriate way to dispose of assets held in mutual
ownership is more controversial. A reduction in building society numbers
through takeovers by outsiders is unobjec-tionable. With a 68 per cent home
ownership rate in Britain, the building society movement's mission is
substantially fulfilled. Nor will there be any great change in the shape of
Britain's high streets. The two parties to the deal have largely
complementary operations; and since Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's cost-income
ratio is little more than half the industry average, the scope for
rationalisation is unlikely to be very great. Yet the price being offered to
building society members - a price earnings multiple substantially below
Abbey National's current rating - looks far lower than could have been
achieved for a comparable transaction in an open capital market.
Arbitrage opportunity
In effect Lloyds is exploiting an arbitrage opportunity between different
forms of ownership. The minimal accountability that goes with mutuality
entrenches the position of management, at the expense of the owner. The cost
to the owners is the shortfall of the bank's offer against what the society
would fetch if it operated in a proper market for corporate control.
Yet it seems a little unlikely that society investors and borrowers, who
have been pleasantly surprised to be promised an average of Pounds 1,700 and
Pounds 500 respectively, will make a big fuss about exit price earnings
ratios - though it is worth noting that Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is noted for
having courted financially sophisticated customers.
There is little reason to worry about a takeover on competition grounds. The
resulting joint share of the mortgage market, at 7 per cent, scarcely looks
worrying. Yet the fact that a society has had to contemplate changing
ownership to obtain a lower cost of funds should give the Treasury pause for
thought in its current review of building society legislation. Easier access
to wholesale funds and a less cumbersome process for outside takeovers for
building societies looks desirable in an increasingly integrated financial
services market.

FT  22 APR 94 / Power to the poor relation: The European Parliament's
new-found strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union's Awkward Squad, up to now represented by the French with
their misgivings over free trade, by the British and their obsession with
sovereignty and Euro-social policy, and by Spaniards demanding more EU
money, has acquired a new member: the European Parliament.
The directly elected, 518-member, trans-European assembly is beginning to
flex its muscles and to use the significant powers it gets under the
Maastricht treaty. With Maastricht in force since last November, and with a
substantial change of membership expected after June's European elections,
Strasbourg is enjoying being the new kid on the Euro-block.
The parliament has long suffered derision: as the mother-in-law of
parliaments; a talking shop for political has-beens and no-hopers; a gravy
train for gilded gypsies who hold their plenaries in Strasbourg, their
committee meetings in Brussels, assisted by their staff in Luxembourg, while
clocking up the generous expenses needed to fuel this perpetual motion.
But this poor relation to the European Commission (which proposes EU
measures) and the Council of Ministers (which decides whether to put these
into law) is now coming into its own. Neither Brussels nor the member states
can afford to ignore it.
The clearest example of this new-found strength is Strasbourg's brinkmanship
over the treaty to bring Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway into the Union
next year, which parliament must approve by 260 out of 518 votes next month
if the plan is not to unravel.
During last month's bitter row between Britain and its partners over voting
rights in the Council, the Euro-MPs made clear that, if the UK won its
demand that a small minority of countries could continue to block decisions
when the 12 become 16, it would not allow enlargement to go ahead.
This attitude constrained member states to make only cosmetic concessions to
the UK. Even that, however, annoyed MEPs across party lines. This week's
plenary session in Strasbourg was therefore lobbied intensively, by
Scandinavian and Austrian government and party leaders, by Commission
president Jacques Delors, and by the current Greek presidency of the
Council. As a result, the accession treaty will be put to a vote on May 4.
But it looks certain that there will be a price. When the 12 members and the
Commission review the Maastricht treaty in 1996, parliament may not get a
seat at the top table but its views will have to be treated seriously. It
could even get more powers, which it says are needed to hold to account both
Brussels and national ministers meeting behind closed doors in the Council.
It is easy to overlook the fact that parliament, even before Maastricht,
already wielded considerable law-making powers. The Single European Act,
making possible the single market, conferred on disgruntled MEPs what seemed
only consultative power. But the act's move to more majority-voting in
Council gave unforeseen influence to parliament.
Mr Richard Corbett, the leading constitutional specialist at the parliament,
says that between July 1987 and September 1991, 208 Euro-laws were passed to
Strasbourg, which made 2,734 amendments. Of these, 1,410 passed into EU and
therefore national law.
After Maastricht, parliament has 'co-decision' power with the Council,
including the rights to veto most measures member states pass by qualified
majority voting and to vet the new Commission which takes office next year.
In the handful of cases so far concluded, parliament forced the Council to
raise R&amp;D spending by Ecu400m (Pounds 315m) over the next five years. But on
Wednesday, not untypically, the first ever veto on a Council decision - to
ban motorcycle engines above 100-brake horsepower - failed to occur, because
not enough MEPs turned up to vote. 'We often stray into cock-up territory,
that is true,' acknowledges one parliament official.
The parliament is erratic, but is getting less so. Recent attempts by
Euro-MPs to set up a Euro-observatory for Unidentified Flying Objects, or
this week's call for a so-called 'urgency debate' on the end of the second
world war, are no doubt hilarious. But it is a sign of the times that
neither request got on the agenda.
Socialist-inspired reforms of procedure to root out frivolous motions and
amendments, and the emergence of new driving forces, may at last give
Strasbourg what it has lacked: a sense of priorities. 'We are concentrating
on what is achievable and do-able,' says Mr Julian Priestley,
secretary-general of the Socialist group, the largest bloc in Strasbourg.
The apparats of cross-border groups like the Socialists and the Christian
Democrats, the growing expertise of rapporteurs appointed to steer
legislation, a core of experienced parliamentary vice-presidents, and the
increasing importance of committee secretariat work, now set parliament's
agenda. And with some agility.
Parliament, for instance, must be consulted on Mr Delors' successor, but can
only object to him or his fellow commissioners by rejecting the entire team.
However, officials say they will not put the issue on parliament's agenda
unless it can hold US Senate-style confirmation hearings with each
candidate.
The inferiority complex MEPs had in relation to the other EU institutions or
their national MPs 'is a thing of the past', Mr Priestley argues. 'You do
get the impression of a parliament coming of age.'
Nevertheless, the popular backlash against the undemocratic way in which
Europe's great leap forward was decided switched the spotlight back on to
national parliaments as the true fount of democratic legitimacy. Did
Strasbourg lose out?
Links between Strasbourg and national assemblies are tightening, raising
MPs' Euro-literacy and MEPs' sensitivity to national concerns. But the
effect is strongest on MEPs, undermining transnational group cohesion in
Strasbourg.
Ms Maryon McDonald, an anthropologist studying the parliament, observes that
'all (MEPs') more powerful emotive symbols still come from the nation
state'. Unlike the true believers at the Commission, many MEPs have trouble
psyching themselves into the politically correct Euro-discourse of those who
would construct Europe.
But the trend is in parliament's favour. At the nitty-gritty level, where
Euro-law is decided by majority vote in Council, it is the European
Parliament, not a national parliament which may have been in the defeated
minority, that is best placed to exercise control. And it has given notice
that it is willing to play rough.

FT  22 APR 94 / History frittered away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's argument over D-day should be ephemeral, a puffball floated on
currents of momentary outrage. Yet the heated debate over how to mark the
50th anniversary of the Normandy landings of June 6 1944 is instructive.
There are two lessons to be learned. First, it is evident that the
government's luck has not yet begun to turn. Second, Britain still fails to
comprehend the significance of its own recent history. Its politicians are
dimly aware of how fundamentally the world has changed over the past
half-century, but they are not courageous enough to convey their fuzzy
understanding to the electorate.
These are separate issues, to be addressed in turn. Sighing, we must start
with the little matter of the government's persistent ill-fortune. For a
Conservative administration to find itself at odds with the country's most
revered old soldiers is yet another sign that the Furies have turned against
it. To pick a squabble with the police, as the Tories did a few months ago,
is careless. To follow that by contriving to upset Dame Vera Lynn is
suicidal. Dame Vera, a singer, rose to fame during the second world war as a
popular entertainer of the troops. She has since become a symbol of
Britain's mid-century glory. She never fails to give us her heroic song. We
know we'll never meet again some sunny day, but we like to hear her promise,
in pure Doris Day overlaid with a fine English intonation, that we will.
Her position is clear. If her 'boys' - the veterans' associations - want her
to sing, in Hyde Park or elsewhere, she will. If not, not. This complicates
matters. Somewhat late in the proceedings, the veterans have expressed
displeasure at the tackier elements of the programme of civilian events
scheduled between June 4 and 6. They do not take issue with the military
ceremonies arranged by the Ministry of Defence. Those are formal, solemn
commemorations. Their distaste is understandable. Many lives were lost on
the Normandy beaches. The survivors want respectful remembrance, not street
happenings. Some of the possibilities for the latter (sand castle contests;
eating 'Spam fritters') have been derided in newspapers that originally
supported the notion of a festival. This media-augmented turn in the
national mood had the predictable result: the government panicked.
The minister in the firing line is Mr Peter Brooke, the secretary for
national heritage. A schoolboy in 1944, he remem-bers clambering over tanks
on the great day. Others of his age recall swarms of aircraft, buzzing like
bees, heading south and south-east. Yet others swear there was dancing in
the streets. For civilians the exciting prospect of potential victory may
have outweighed intimations of the casualties to come. Mr Brooke's programme
was originally intended to express the incipient home-front optimism of
D-day. His department, which is responsible for tourism, chose to
co-ordinate the many local events and, imprudently, to appoint Sir Tim Bell,
a public relations consultant whose name is associated with his work for
Lady Thatcher in the 1980s.
Mr Brooke, or his civil servants, should have known better. Nothing could be
further from the collectivist, communitarian egalitarianism of the 1940s
than the spirit of the 1980s. Sir Tim and his firm were, however, hired to
do a job. The heritage department must take responsibility for what was
proposed. It is up to the head of that department to answer for the ensuing
row. To patch it up, Mr Brooke has to bring off an acceptable deal with the
old soldiers and, by extension, Dame Vera. No fool, he is perfectly capable
of doing so. Yesterday he kept an eye on his undersecretary and negotiator,
Mr Iain Sproat, as the latter sought to ap-pease the vets. We may be sure
that whatever is neces-sary will be done.
The government's immediate loss is any political advantage that might have
been gained from the celebrations, which take place a few days before the
elections to the European Parliament. Tough. The nation's loss is the chance
of debating the contemporary significance of the events of summer 1944. That
was the season in which, under General Eisenhower's supreme command,
thousands of American, British, Canadian and other soldiers died to help rid
Europe of the Nazis. Their courageous sacrifice had enormous consequences.
The war ended with the Soviet empire enlarged, and the stage set for the
retreat from empire of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and, later,
Portugal. The Normandy landings may be said to have marked the beginning of
the end of European rule over large tracts of the planet. They also
established the predominant global power of the US for the ensuing
half-century.
That power is now in abeyance. The self-sacrifice with which the Allies
tackled Nazi Germany has been absent from their response, generations later,
to Serbian expansionism in former Yugoslavia. This is explicable, if not
excusable. Serbia is not poised to attack France, or Britain, or the US.
Britain and France have sent low numbers of troops, some of whom have been
killed; the US has sent none.
The recent dissolution of the Soviet empire changed the world again, as
surely as did the defeat of Nazi Germany nearly 50 previously. It reawakened
America's isolationist spirit. Thus President Bill Clinton will attend the
D-day commemorations as an unlikely successor to President Roosevelt and
Ike, a living symbol of a United States that chooses to be impotent.
The Queen will be there, representing her father's war. She will need no
reminding of the declining influence of Britain since those great days. The
television screens will be full of speeches, prayers, military bands,
fly-pasts, marches, and pictures of the heads of state and government of
what might then have been called the greater Atlantic co-prosperity sphere,
but is now the disunited states of confusion.
The world is no longer as dangerous as in 1944. At least the vileness of the
Nazi threat has gone, for which we must be grateful. But in Britain, one of
the continent's medium-sized component parts, we have not begun to
comprehend where we are going. The receding generation of 'leaders' is
leaving no road-maps. We have no Churchill, no Bevin to take a
world-historical view of events. D-day was a bloody epic battle, led by
giants. It will be commemorated by pygmies.

FT  22 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Much safer in Channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord MACKAY OF ARDBRECKNISH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Kevin Shilleto (Letters, April 19) is concerned about shipping
traffic control in the Channel and the risk of collision. The Channel
Navigation Information Service (CNIS) is based at Dover and was introduced
in 1972 and provides a 24-hour radar watch and radio safety service for all
shipping in the Dover Strait and adjacent waters. Navigational safety
information is provided to all safety agencies, both in the UK and on the
Continent, on a reciprocal basis.
The CNIS is operated by HM Coastguard to help ensure the safety of
navigation in the busiest part of the Channel. Coverage extends some 110
nautical miles from the Greenwich Meridian through the Dover Strait in a
north-easterly direction.
Regular broadcasts give warnings of navigational difficulties, including
defective navigational aids and the presence of hampered vessels and reports
on unfavourable weather conditions, adverse visibility or exceptional tides.
Ships using the ship movement reporting scheme (MAREP) are tracked as well
as those contravening the International Collision Regulations. Their
position, course and speed are broadcast to all ships in the immediate area.
Offenders are identified by using Coastguard aerial patrols or other ships,
and follow-up action is taken by the Marine Safety Agency through respective
flag states and shipowners.
In the last two decades, shipping in the Channel has become safer; the
average number of annual collisions has fallen from 30 to fewer than five,
despite more traffic. Mackay of Ardbrecknish,

FT  22 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: CBI must flex muscles on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK CORNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So, we have come to the moment of truth. Can the UK's flexible labour
market maintain downward pressure on the rate of increase in average
earnings when underlying inflation is low, output is growing and the demand
for labour rising?
The upward revision of January's figure for average earnings to 3.5 per cent
and news of a similar level for the 12 months to February ('Wages data spark
fears', April 21) caused the Confederation of British Industry to state the
obvious - 'we need to keep a firm hold on pay'. But the CBI must ask itself
one simple question: are individual firms strong enough - by themselves in
the context of a flexible labour market - to keep increases in average
earnings at internationally competitive levels?
Although the recession has led to widespread dispersion in pay settlements,
the current data suggest that it will not be long before sustained recovery
feeds into a 'going rate' for pay. Fifteen years of labour market
flexibility have not destroyed the 'going rate': nor will another 15.
In fact, the time has come for the CBI - and the very largest companies in
this country - to flex their muscles and co-ordinate their pay settlements.
In so doing, they can maintain their own international competitiveness
during the recovery, and the international competitiveness of the UK economy
as a whole, as well.

FT  22 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Crazy' comparison with Manchester's
debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM STRINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In its pre-election desperation, the government is playing a new
financial fiddle. So it is important for voters to recognise the tune.
Government spokespeople, and their supporters in the popular national
newspapers, have been declaring that such cities as Birmingham and
Manchester have debts greater than some developing countries, the inference
being that we have run up irresponsible 'bar bills' and must be called to
account.
What a crazy comparison to make, even for a government with an all-time
record for financial incompetence. Many developing countries would love to
have the assets of Britain's big cities and to be able to afford to invest
in themselves.
We are able to invest in our great cities because we create assets more
valuable than the sums we pay for them and because we can afford to pay our
debts - although this government, which seems to be trying to convert our
cities into third-world economies, is making our task harder by forcing us
to pay off debts in segments of one twenty-fifth instead of spreading them
over the usual 60 years.
The financial facts are that Manchester has a Pounds 1.28bn debt, but that
this represents borrowing stretching back 60 years and essential to such
functions as housing and education. Almost 64 per cent of our debt relates
to the construction of nearly 90,000 homes to meet the demands of slum
clearance and of home refurbishment work, while much of the remainder
relates to Manchester Airport (we borrow on its behalf).
This puts us in the same position as people who take out mortgages on
property in the knowledge that they will gain something of value both during
and after the loan period, which is sound investment theory. Manchester's
gain has been housing stock which must be worth more than Pounds 4bn. Add
the value of a large slice of Europe's fastest-growing airport, 18 secondary
schools, 101 primary schools, parks, leisure centres, libraries and much
other council-owned property and our debt fades into perspective.
In the past, all governments have approved and praised our spending as vital
to local welfare and progress. This wild attempt to switch it into the debit
column comes ill from a government which this year alone will borrow Pounds
50bn, not to build assets for the nation but simply to pay off the deficit
caused by its mismanagement of the economy.

policy of replenishing the core repertory of the company is beginning to
come across to our audiences.
In particular, the packed houses for La Boheme, Lohengrin, Rosenkavalier and

FT  22 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Energy bill merits support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CYNOG DAFIS MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If anything shows the total bankruptcy of the government it is its
systematic attempt to sabotage the energy conservation bill on Friday by
tabling 216 amendments and seven new clauses, thus ensuring that it will run
out of time. This will prevent it from significantly mitigating the effect
of 17.5 per cent domestic fuel VAT on the elderly and poor, and helping
itself achieve CO emission reduction targets by the year 2000. It will mean
flying in the face of the views of the majority of MPs, including many
Tories, and the huge consensus of organisations and local authorities
supporting the bill.
Why should the government choose to shoot itself in the foot in this way? Is
it suicidal, or is it so foolish as to fear that a proper programme of
energy conservation would make more difficult the sale of its 40 per cent
stake in Powergen and National Power? In fact, reduced demand would obviate
the need for substantial investment in new generating capacity and thus
enhance the profitability of those two companies.
Let us hope that Conservative backbenchers recognise the political as well
as the environmental, economic and social benefits of the bill, and the
severe corresponding costs of blocking its passage.

FT  22 APR 94 / Arts: A 'Hamlet' a la Fellini - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a glass pedestal a silver trunk of the sort used by music-hall magicians
revolves slowly to the sound of crashing surf. A magician indeed appears,
top-hatted and caped, with his assistant, a red-plumed showgirl. A bluesy
trumpet plays.
Out of the trunk a young man is winched in harness to dangle over the stage.
Another figure emerges, a child in topcoat and stove-pipe hat, the Artful
Dodger impression countered by his air of innocence and the white flower in
his buttonhole. This is Horatio.
The ghost is a ventriloquist's doll carried round the stage by the magician.
Hamlet (yes) is winched down. Lights, a blast of circus music, and in troops
the court of Elsinore. What does that jaunty minor-key strut evoke? Why is
that faintly sleazy glitter, that sinister invitation to fun, familiar? Of
course: Federico Fellini. If the late Italian movie director had filmed
Hamlet it would have come out as something like Julia Bardsley's adaptation
at the Young Vic.
Bardsley's short regime has had a rough ride. I suspect this Shakespearian
extravaganza will suffer from the downward roll. A shame, since the
production is brave, bizarre, imaginative, hallucinatory, sometimes
irritating, often poetic. As one who has appraised more great Danes than a
judge at Crufts, I was kept alert and intrigued throughout.
They give us variations on the theme, perhaps, rather than the play itself.
But what production has ever given us every aspect of Hamlet? The text has
been cut and shuffled (the most annoying detail being Hamlet's substitution
of 'prayers' for 'orisons' as if that would puzzle us more than the rest of
these goings-on), and characters are omitted, with much fascinating
double-casting.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are played by one man carrying a life-size
dummy, initially both sporting identical orange bowlers and Groucho Marx
spectacles. Natasha Pope plays Ophelia and Gertrude. She lacks the vocal
weight for the faintly floozy queen (red bouffant, vivid lipstick); but the
image of Ophelia's mad scene evokes a blend of punk and pre-war Berlin
cabaret, as she belts 'How should I your true love know?' into a mike. She
cuts a vaguely expressionistic figure, a frowsy version of Wedekind's Lulu
perhaps, in her clinging fur-hemmed frock and clown's blue and white banded
knee-socks.
Claudius' bottle-green suit, glasses and crown sustain the circus motif.
Boyd Clack's disconcerting facial mixture of David Mellor and the Chancellor
of the Exchequer adds conviction to this homme moyen sensuel's dabbling in
political waters too deep for him. And of course one actor plays Polonius
and Laertes, father (pink coat and fez) and son (purple coat).
The production's emphasis on the individual's duality, internal and external
character (which offers after all an explanation of Hamlet's anguished
dithering), prompts two set pieces: the play scene when lust and murder are
enacted by dolls, then taken over by their human counterparts as a rock
score pounds and a red-nosed Hamlet leaps around, ape-like, urging them on
and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, now pig-faced, fondle each other.
More moving is the prince's address to the players, here a pile of dolls,
and the actor he begs a speech from: the doll is a beautifully-made
miniature of Hamlet himself who obliges (with his master's voice) not with
Hecuba but 'To be or not to be'. This leads straight on to Hamlet in propria
persona bursting out with 'Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave'. Here the
levels of artifice blur: what or who is he reacting to? Come to that, who is
the master puppeteer-ringmaster magician-ventriloquist behind each
character? The old enigma of Hamlet's determinism is still unsolved.
Rory Edwards prowls, haggard, through the title role, a neurotic wreck from
the start (pullover with ape-length arms, bare feet), within an inch of
genuine madness. Unless, as in The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari, the whole
court is an asylum. The final duel is almost perfunctory, slow motion
lunging over the central pedestal, the lines sounding flatter as if a
clockwork mechanism were running down.
The manipulative magician (shades of Lulu's Ringmaster) and his assistant
(in fact Bardsley and her designer Aldona Cunningham) pay the play the
compliment of refusing to treat it as a museum piece but something alive and
resilient to bounce ideas off. Nothing is taken for granted; surprises
continue to the very end when, in response to 'The rest is silence' as
Hamlet wanders off, the child Horatio delivers the last lines in deaf and
dumb language. Cheek.

FT  22 APR 94 / Arts: Evans of the Ashmolean - Gerald Cadogan pays tribute
to the remarkable man who brought the Minoan civilisation to light
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arthur Evans, excavator of Knossos, is a Victorian hero who did not die
until 1941, soon after hearing that the Germans had captured Crete and
installed themselves in the Villa Ariadne, his house at Knossos.
Evans is important not only for uncovering the sophisticated early
civilisation of Crete and working out by 1906 a history of the Minoans that
still holds today, but also for the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford which,
without him, would not be the elegant, erudite museum it is such a pleasure
to visit today.
Arthur Evans: His Life and Times, at the Ashmolean until August 21, is the
right tribute in the right place to a remarkable man and a delightful
vignette of Victorian and Edwardian England.
An eternally curious man, he was an able numismatist - being shortsighted
was a help - and his archaeology covered Europe and the Mediterranean. One
speciality was the Yugoslav coast and Bosnia, where he had reported for the
Manchester Guardian, as an uncompromising Gladstonian champion of the
locals, on the fight for freedom from the Ottomans and the Austrians. He
lived for a while in Dubrovnik, where he was imprisoned by the Austrians.
The ethnic/religious map of Slav territories he prepared in 1913 for the
Balkan Committee is still sadly apposite.
In Oxford he 're-founded' the Ashmolean. The exhibition comes 110 years
after he became its Keeper (and a century after he first visited Crete to
try to discover its early scripts, little imagining that the task he started
six years later would be to uncover a civilisation). Evans had the luck to
be born into a clever, rich family. His father, Sir John Evans, was himself
a distinguished archaeologist (as his younger sister Dame Joan Evans also
became), who knew Charles Darwin and Augustus Henry Lane Fox (later Pitt
Rivers), and who applied evolution to the development of human technology.
It was a heady, intellectually exciting world, helped - as so often in the
period - by some money. His mother was a Dickinson of the family that made
paper at Nash Mills in Hertfordshire.
As Keeper of the Ashmolean his triumph was to bring the old museum
collections (in the building that is now the Museum of the History of
Science) over to the splendid University Galleries of Charles Cockerell, to
be primarily a teaching and research collection of art and archaeology, of
which a library was an essential part. Not that Benjamin Jowett,
Vice-Chancellor of the University and Master of Balliol, thought it a good
idea. Evans had a mighty battle with him, which he won with the help of a
major backer. CDE Fortnum, of the grocers in Piccadilly, produced
collections (of majolica, bronzes and rings) and funding.
A decade later Evans's single-minded determination was again essential to
buy the site of Knossos from a multitude of peasants, and drive the dig of a
large, complicated site which the prehistoric Cretans had occupied for more
than 2000 years.
Today the Ashmolean is a great museum with many marvellous pieces, such as
its Old Master drawings and its Athenian pottery. Its Cretan collection is
the best outside Crete, and its library is envied across the world. And I
have found over the years that its staff are singularly helpful, and ready
to share their knowledge - which art historians and archaeologists know is a
great compliment.
But, as Evans knew, continuous improvements need space and funds. Behind
Cockerell's facade and main galleries the building is a rabbit warren. Much
of the ancient pottery lurks in a 'Sunken Court' in the middle of the
building which is closed to the public. It is the only space in the building
that is left to develop, by contrast with the British Museum which is about
to gain a windfall when the British Library leaves the vast Reading Room.
The director, Professor Christopher White, plans to instal four floors in
the Sunken Court. In this basement, Cockerell made an impressive undercroft
with Doric columns. Now used as a workshop, it will become a restaurant
(much needed), with a new lecture theatre and space for the growing
education service. The ground floor will have a new entrance to the museum
and a new shop (with displays kept low to preserve Cockerell's design), and
will lead into the Randolph Gallery. Refurbishment has made this hall of
sculptures a 19th-century joy, where the steam-cleaned statues stand out
against raspberry walls. At the end of the gallery the main staircase has
also been redone as a handsome approach to the first-floor picture galleries
of Western Art.
The most obvious change will be outside, where the patches of grass will
make way for a piazza of York stone, with the steps from the street slightly
set back and Cockerell's original balustrade reinstated. The architects are
Stanton Williams. A still anonymous donor is funding the cost of about
Pounds 4.5m.
As part of the Campaign for Oxford, the appeal for the Ashmolean has raised
Pounds 8.67m in gifts or promises to date. Already, 12 galleries and the
stairs have been redone. Dietrich and Joyce von Bothmer are paying for two
antiquities floors in the Sunken Court. The Clore Foundation has endowed the
Education Officer.
Sir Arthur would approve. A hundred years ago after he returned from the
first visit to Crete that changed his life, the objects were moved from the
old Ashmolean to where they are now. It took from August to November. The
most precious pieces went in hand-carts.
The exhibition continues until August 21. The Ashmolean has just published
Before Knossos . . . Arthur Evans's Travels in the Balkans and Crete by Ann
Brown (Pounds 12.95, Pounds 7.95 pb, 85 pages)

FT  22 APR 94 / Arts: More myth and power from Weir - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over and over a bird sings 'Far away and long ago' at the start of Blond
Eckbert. Like another woodbird in Wagner, she is introducing a tale of
murder and incest from the romantic world of German folk stories, where
huntsmen rove the forests and everybody fights through a dense undergrowth
of Freudian subtext - though there the similarities end.
It is a coincidence that there are two new operas concerned with the power
of myth in London at the moment. At Covent Garden Harrison Birtwistle's
Gawain is an epic on a monumental scale. Blond Eckbert by Judith Weir, given
its premiere by English National Opera on Wednesday, is shorter and sharper,
an evening that says what it wants to say and no more. Weir, after all, did
start with a 15-minute opera with a cast of one. She is not a composer who
likes to waste one's time.
On the face of it the plot is simplicity itself. (Weir has made her own
libretto from the original short story by the 19th-century Ludwig Tieck.)
Eckbert and Berthe, following on from the similarly-named Siegmund and
Sieglinde before them, are not only husband and wife, but brother and
sister. The climax of the tale is the revelation of this truth, but
tantalising shafts of light are shone into the characters' psyches along the
way.
Like the Birtwistle, Blond Eckbert is a story of self-discovery. Where
Gawain goes out into the world to explore who he is through a ritual series
of trials, Eckbert retreats within himself. He traces the roots of his
personality back to his childhood and what he finds is rejection
(definitely), child abuse (possibly) and a life of utter, inconsolable
loneliness.
This must sound awfully gloomy, yet the opera is anything but. Weir is a
quick-witted story-teller, who recounts events with a wry smile creeping
across her face. The music never takes two minutes to describe what it could
in one, sketching the characters deftly, painting the mood with a flick of
the brush, a few glinting colours enough to suggest the danger lurking in
the fairy-tale forest before the murder. The lightness of touch is
reminiscent of Stravinsky's Le Rossignol.
Perhaps one would like to feel a bit more for poor Eckbert. No matter how
much he suffers, the music refuses to get involved, leaving Nicholas Folwell
no channel through which to broadcast his feelings. He and Berthe, taken by
Anne-Marie Owens, remain the playthings of Weir's detached observations.
Three subsidiary characters were well taken by Christopher Ventris. Nerys
Jones's bird flew with more poise than she sang. All seemed reasonably
confident under Sian Edwards's musical direction.
The lesson that Weir has learnt from Britten among others is that the most
probing operas are often the simplest on the surface. Unfortunately Tim
Hopkins (producer) and Nigel Lowery (designer) seem to have set out asking,
'How shall we show that nothing you see in this opera is what it seems?'
'How about some film or some shadow puppets?' 'Or funny walks for the
characters?' 'Or zany drop-curtains and plenty of them?' 'No - it might be
boring. We'd better give them the whole lot'. And so they do.
When Blond Eckbert circulates, as it surely will (Santa Fe already has it
booked for this summer) it asks for a production with the same sleight of
hand as its composer's. Next time I would like to see the opera in a smaller
theatre, where every word can be heard, every nuance savoured. For those who
want to feast on new opera, Gawain is the main course, Blond Eckbert a
sorbet to cleanse the palette. Weir herself is well on course for an
operatic rosette.

Have I Got News For You (10.00 BBC2) returns: the satirical news quiz in
which, unforgettably, Paul Merton nominated a tub of lard to be his team
mate when Roy Hattersley withdrew at the last minute. Harry Thompson, the
programme's producer, has said that it is almost impossible to persuade
anyone in the government to take part. Oh, dear, what can the matter be?
Guests joining Paul Merton and Ian Hislop in the new series will include - I
hope - Alan Clark, he of the diaries and the actualite.
A new series of May to December (8.30 BBC1) begins with the shocking news
that Hilary, dishy-dizzy secretary to solicitors Callender and Callender,
has left her job 'to spend more time with my Derek' on the Isle of Wight.
(Derek's present address is Parkhurst.) Hilary will be much missed by
viewers not always charmed to the bone by this wholesome saga of
second-time-around Alec and his much younger Zoe.
Doctor Finlay's Casebook (9.00 ITV) is awash with a wedding at Tannochbrae -
and Delia Smith's Summer Collection (BBC2 7.15) assures us that 'All the
world loves an ice-cream'.

FT  22 APR 94 / Management: Time has come for a revolution in style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The redoubtable Percy Barnevik has achieved many feats in his six years at
the helm of ABB, the Swedish-Swiss engineering multinational. He has shown
how an organisation of more than 200,000 employees can be run - 'steered'
would be a better word - by a head office of only 150 people, and with
remarkably few management layers.
He has demonstrated that 'matrix management' - in which people report to two
or more different bosses - can be made to work in spite of having suffered
20 years of abuse. And he has been lionised as a model of how to lead
change.
But never before has he been held up as evidence that one of the most
fundamental organisational theories of the 20th century is at best
inadequate and at worst redundant, and that a new 'managerial theory of the
firm' is required in its place.
At business schools, the established theory goes by the name of the
'M-form'. Formulated in 1962 by Harvard's Alfred Chandler, the father of
modern strategy and organisation studies, it argued that most large
companies could manage their strategies effectively only if they adopted a
multi-divisional organisation structure - the so-called M-form.
This was not only because of the structure itself, but also because of the
management doctrine that went with it: it defined a new set of roles which
emphasised the decentralisation of responsibility to operating divisions
whose activities were planned, co-ordinated and controlled by a strong
corporate management.
The top management also made what Chandler called the company's
'entrepreneurial decisions' about resource allocation.
Then in 1970, Joseph Bower, also from Harvard, published a study of business
planning and investment decision-making, which combined Chandler's focus on
strategy and structure with a study of managerial behaviour.
It gave more credit than Chandler had to the roles of front line and
especially middle managers. Bower concluded that it was the middle, rather
than the top, which managed not only the organisation's information flow,
but also most of its business planning and resource allocation.
Bower's study was a big step forward from Chandler's work. But both men saw
the allocation of physical and financial resources as the main task of
management.
Which is where Barnevik and ABB come in.
ABB is one of 19 companies around the world whose changing organisational
and managerial styles have been studied over the past five years by two
business school professors, Christopher Bartlett of Harvard and Sumantra
Ghoshal of Insead. The other companies include AT&amp;T, Intel, Nike and 3M in
the US, Bodyshop, Cartier, Ikea and Shell in Europe, and Canon, Kao, Komatsu
and Toyota in Japan.
The first of several papers based on this work, using ABB as its main
illustration, is about to appear in Strategic Management Journal under the
title of 'Beyond the Mother-Form'*.
As with much practical management literature today - in contrast with many
academic studies - the paper concentrates on informal management styles,
patterns and procedures, rather than on the formal organisation. In formal
terms, ABB is not too different from Chandler's model. But in most other
respects it is poles apart, as are many of Bartlett and Ghoshal's other
study companies.
For a start, most of them consider the development of specialised knowledge
and expertise and their dissemination across the company as far more
significant in competitive terms today than the issue which preoccupied
people in the 1960s and 1970s: the allocation of financial resources.
But knowledge is far harder to handle. If a large company is to manage it
effectively, it must develop what the duo terms a 'horizontal integration
process' which changes considerably the role of management at every level.
In particular, it transforms the role of - drastically slimmed - middle and
senior management at ABB and elsewhere from power-broking, control and
information-processing up and down the organisation, to a cross-company one
of coaching and technology and skill-transfer. The middle manager becomes a
leading agent in the process of continuous 'organisational learning'.
This change of role is reinforced at ABB by all sorts of mechanisms. These
include the division of the company into 1,300 units which are too small to
have a full range of specialist skills, and therefore have to borrow and
learn from each other.
Meanwhile, top management's role changes from the allocator of resources and
resolver of conflicts to what Bartlett and Ghoshal call 'creator of purpose
and challenger of the status quo'. This includes stimulating a process of
continuous corporate renewal.
These concepts are brought to life in the paper by an analysis of the roles
and relationships of particular managers at each level in ABB's electrical
relays business.
This approach should help clear Bartlett and Ghoshal from potential
criticism that they are, in essence, providing an academic formulation of
what business people already recognise as the new realities of management.
Barnevik and his ABB colleagues may be among the pioneers, but most managers
are still stuck with an outdated view of the nature of organisations, and of
their own roles within them.
As Bartlett and Ghoshal put it in a previous paper, first-generation
managers are trying in second-generation organisations to operate
third-generation strategies. The mismatch is obvious.

Richard Guy, 45, executive chairman of USM-listed financial software company
Sherwood Computer Services, has precipitately departed following the
company's last annual figures revealing a Pounds 2m pre-tax loss after the
previous year's Pounds 3m profit. The company is expecting to find a
replacement for him but 'that will take perhaps six months', said a
spokesman.
Guy had been with Sherwood 17 years, becoming chief executive in 1988. He is
replaced with immediate effect, and in a non-executive capacity, by David
O'Brien, a non-executive director and currently chief executive of the
National and Provincial building society. George Matthews, 39, has been
chief executive since 1992.
Sherwood's recent poor performance is linked by the company to the recent
troubles on the Lloyd's insurance market, where it has a significant portion
of its business.

FT  22 APR 94 / People: Armstrong leaves Leigh Interests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Armstrong has quit as managing director of the waste services company
Leigh Interests. His departure is believed to be the direct result of the
appointment of Shaun Bowden as chief executive last November, a post for
which Armstrong had been considered a strong candidate.
Arthur Kent, finance director, rejected suggestions that Armstrong's
departure had been acrimonious. 'The board just got a little top-heavy,' he
said. 'After discussions it was agreed he would pursue other interests.'
Armstrong had been central to Leigh's efforts to improve the group's quality
standards, Kent said.
Armstrong had been with Leigh for 15 years, working his way through the
ranks of the environmental division. Four years ago he was promoted to the
main board when Malcolm Wood, the then-chief executive, assumed the
additional role of chairman. Wood died last year, after nominating Bowden to

FT  22 APR 94 / People: Moulton joins Apax Partners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jon Moulton, founder and managing partner at Schroder Ventures until he
resigned in February, is to join Apax Partners as a director.
Moulton left Schroder Ventures after a disagreement over strategy; Schroders
had tried to impose tighter controls over the venture capital
group.
The high-profile Moulton developed a reputation for doing large management
buy-out transactions at Schroders, among them Parker Pen Group and RJB
Mining.
Though this is an area in which Apax has had limited experience, it has set
out its stall as a venture capital group that hires industry experts who
bring market knowledge to the boards of the companies in which the group
invests.
It also says it has a very hands-on approach to its investments - an
approach many venture capitalists have not taken when investing in large
buy-outs.
Apax says that Moulton, on the other hand, shares its hands-on investment
philosophy. His appointment would strengthen Apax in an area the group had
been thinking of expanding into for some time.
Before founding Schroders, Moulton was with Citicorp Venture Capital in
London and New York.
Moulton will be one of 11 directors at Apax.

FT  22 APR 94 / Management: Unilever in a lather - The urgency behind the
soap powder maker's launch of a new concentrate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the next few weeks, shoppers across Europe will be subjected to a barrage
of publicity on the topic of washing powder. Well-known brands, such as
Persil in the UK, Omo in the Netherlands and Via in Sweden, will suddenly
appear in a plastic container instead of the familiar box. The pack will be
smaller, but will cost about the same. Advertising will make familiar
claims: that the new version washes whiter, works at lower temperatures, is
kinder to the environment and so forth.
For the owner of these brands, Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever, the hype will
have more than the usual urgency. The launch is the culmination of 10 years'
work and Pounds 100m of capital investment. It claims to represent the first
real breakthrough in detergent technology for 15 years. Above all, it aims
to make up ground lost by Unilever to its deadly rival, Procter &amp; Gamble of
the US, across Europe in the past five years; and if it is to succeed, speed
is of the essence.
At the root of the battle is a shift in the market from conventional washing
powders to concentrated powders. From a standing start in 1989, concentrates
now have half the European market, with sales worth almost Pounds 3bn.
As Unilever candidly admits, the shift caught it wrong-footed. 'What took us
by surprise', says John Taylor, European production manager, 'was the rate
the market grew at, and our inability to tool up to meet demand'.
Procter &amp; Gamble made no such mistake. As a result, its concentrates now
outsell Unilever's by a factor of two in the UK, and by a handsome margin
elsewhere in Europe. All the while, supermarkets are making inroads with
own-label concentrates, and have grabbed 15 per cent of the UK market.
In struggling to address this, Unilever also had to modernise its internal
organisation. Five years ago, it had some 18 operating companies around
Europe, each with its own factories and products. Procter &amp; Gamble, by
contrast, was a late arrival in Europe in the early 1980s, and tackled the
market on a pan-European basis from the outset. Its production was
concentrated in fewer plants. The product was harmonised across countries
and sold under a single brand name, Ariel.
As a result, says Niall Fitzgerald, head of Unilever detergents worldwide,
'their cost structure was several percentage points below ours. On a
business worth Pounds 1.4bn to us, that's a lot of money.'
At the start of the 1990s, Unilever set out to close the gap. In a period of
traumatic upheaval, its detergents operations throughout Europe were merged
into a single business. Factories were closed and jobs were axed. Unilever
is now in a position to push a new product much faster through its new
pan-European organisation: provided, of course, that it has the product.
Hence the new super-concentrated detergent. It has two chief
characteristics: effectiveness at lower temperatures and less bulk.
According to Unilever executives, 100g of the new Persil equals 125g of the
old, or 155g of the equivalent version of Ariel.
The key is a combination of chemistry and process technology. Traditionally,
powdered detergents are made by mixing the ingredients with water, then
drying the result in an enormous tower some 130ft high. This uses large
amounts of energy and involves evaporating up to 30 tons of water an hour,
producing a huge emission of steam mixed with volatile chemicals.
Unilever's new method involves no water, relying instead on a chemical
reaction between the ingredients to drive the process. This, says Unilever,
saves around 80 per cent of the energy cost, besides being more flexible and
much less pollutive.
The new technology is being employed at just three sites around Europe: at
Warrington in the UK, Mannheim in Germany and Casale in Italy. No other
detergents producer is yet copying it. But Unilever does not expect to keep
it to itself, since it is neither patented nor specific to the detergents
industry.
The real technological edge, Unilever says, lies elsewhere: in a new
catalyst, which accelerates the chemical reaction of the detergent and lets
it work at lower temperatures. The catalyst hunts out the stain, then
attracts the bleach in the detergent to it. Having set the bleach to work,
it moves on to the next stain. It is protected by 34 patents: and, say
Unilever executives, patent searches suggest that no one else is close to
imitating it.
Switching to the new product is a formidable exercise, since it involves
replacing old-style concentrate sales worth some Pounds 500m across Europe.
The result is not lower costs, since the savings in non-tower production
will be offset by more expensive ingredients. But if nothing else, the
product should have environmental appeal.
A machine-load of washing uses large quantities of energy, water and highly
reactive chemicals to remove a few grams of dirt and release a lot of
pollution. Since the new product uses less heat, fewer chemicals and less
packaging, it can be promoted as ecologically virtuous.
Meanwhile, the new formulation will for the first time copy the Procter &amp;
Gamble approach in being physically identical across Europe. But if the
powder is the same, the brands will remain separate. Unilever is slightly
defensive about this. The sunk cost in brands like Persil and Omo, it says,
far outweighs the marginal savings that would be gained from unified
advertising.
The chief priority, though, is to roll the new formulation out as fast as
possible. By the end of the month it will be in the UK, the Netherlands and
Switzerland. Next month it will be across Scandinavia. 'This is an industry
with several formidable competitors,' Fitzgerald says. 'Technological change
is short-lived. The premium comes from exploiting it very rapidly. In
Europe, we need to whip it through the structure at great speed.'
If this sounds alarmist, Unilever can remind itself how quickly it fell
behind the last time. Another of its senior executives puts it bluntly: 'The
old high-suds powders for hand washing had a lifetime of 60 or 70 years. The
low-suds powders which arrived in the 1960s had a life of 20 years.
Detergent liquids lasted seven years. The first phase of concentrates has
lasted five years. This is the next phase.'

FT  22 APR 94 / People: Three heads picked for Roscos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The names of three key people involved in the privatisation of British Rail
were announced yesterday in the shape of the managing directors of the
companies which will lease rolling stock to the train operators.
The three rolling stock leasing companies or Roscos will acquire a mix of BR
locomotives, carriages and wagons and lease them to the operating companies.
If the train operators want to renew their fleets they would probably lease
them through one of the roscos.
Management buy-out teams and other potential bidders for BR franchises have
been waiting for details of the Roscos for several months. The April 1
launch date for BR privatisation came and went without any further
information emerging.
Questions on the likely cost of leasing to the train operating companies
have still to be answered but the announcement of managing directors marks
an important step forward.
Tony Roche, 50, a railman with 30 years' experience and a former deputy
managing director of Network SouthEast, has been appointed managing director
of the Eversholt Train Leasing Company, which is based in London. Roche, who
has worked on the mechanical engineering side of BR, has played a key role
in creating the Roscos.
His two fellow mds both have a background in the equipment rental and
leasing sectors. Brian Hassell, chief executive for the past two years of
Motability Finance, which leases cars to the disabled, assumes command at
London-based Angel Train Contracts in June. Hassell is a past chairman of
the Finance and Leasing Association.
Sandy Anderson, managing director of TIP Trailer Rental for the past six
years, takes over at Sheffield-based Porterbrook Leasing Company in July.
Before joining TIP 12 years ago he was a terminal manager for Freightliner,
BR's container handling subsidiary.

FT  22 APR 94 / Property: Schneider's list of building woes - The
developer's failure does not herald a general market collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frankfurt's futuristic Zeilgalerie complex has acquired a special importance
since the collapse last week of the Jurgen Schneider property group with
debts of more than DM5bn.
The Zeilgalerie was one of Mr Schneider's most audacious developments and is
at the heart of Deutsche Bank's allegations of fraud against the failed
developer, who has vanished leaving behind the ruins of Germany's most
spec-tacular property crash since 1945.
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank and also the largest single creditor
to the failed property empire with an exposure of DM1.2bn, said last week
that Mr Schneider falsified documents and data when making an application
for the financing of Zeilgalerie.
These disclosures by Deutsche Bank have put the bank on the defensive.
Critics say Mr Schneider's ability to falsify documents successfully
highlights weaknesses in Deutsche Bank's lending practice and points to how
the crisis arose in the first place. The main elements of the Deutsche Bank
disclosures are:
Deutsche Bank loaned Schneider a total of DM415m against the Zeilgalerie
project; according to property consultants, the complex has a current market
value of DM160m, less than the DM200m Mr Schneider originally invested in
the venture.
The bank claimed it was misled over Zeilgalerie's total lettable space.
Deutsche Bank released the latest DM45m tranche of the loan on the premise
that the complex contained 20,000 square metres of lettable space. In the
event, the property contains only 9,000 sq m of lettable space.
The bank agreed to the loan on the basis of a rental projection for the
centre of at least DM57m a year; the true figure turned out to be about
DM8m.
These discrepancies have provoked dismay and ridicule in Germany's banking
and property circles. 'I find it amazing,' said one leading German property
analyst. 'The controls in the German banking industry are normally so tight
that something like this just can't happen,' he added.
'The mistakes that have been made here are inexcusable,' said a senior
Frankfurt investment banker. 'The Zeil (the street where Zeilgalerie is
located) is less than half a mile from the Deutsche Bank headquarters. It
(the bank) lent twice the market value and now it sheepishly says that it
lent against 20,000 sq m (of lettable space) when there are really only
9,000 sq m. Were they asleep?'
These charges of irresponsibility are rejected by Mr George Krupp, the
Deutsche Bank board director now responsible for the bank's exposure to
Schneider. 'We have no evidence of serious mistakes at this bank,' he said.
Mr Krupp told German newspapers that the bank has launched an enquiry into
its credit procedures in the light of the Schneider collapse.
The revelations have proved an embarrassment for Deutsche Bank. But they
have also prompted other German banks to take a much tougher line on
outstanding requests for property finance. Analysts suggest that the
worst-hit banks from the Schneider fall-out are unlikely to sanction new
property development loans until their own enquiries on internal credit
procedures are under way.
This tightening of credit to smaller developers may prove to be one of the
most significant repercussions of the Schneider affair on the rest of the
property market. Other lasting effects on the market may be changes in the
bankruptcy laws to offer more protection to smaller creditors, and increased
pressure on German valuers to raise standards.
The broader question about the impact of the Schneider collapse on the
property investment market remains unclear.
The German market is undoubtedly going through a tough time. Recession,
which took hold in mid-1992, has led to a sharp fall in office rents. The
office market has been hit particularly hard because the economic slowdown
has coincided with a wave of new office schemes coming on to the market.
Jones Lang Wootton, property advisers, said that the take-up of office space
fell by 7.5 per cent in 1993, pushing up vacancy rates in excess of 7 per
cent of the total office stock. Rising vacancy rates and weak tenant demand
have pushed office rents down by between 10 per cent and 25 per cent in
larger German cities.
The combination of rising vacancy rates and falling rents is familiar to
many other property markets around the world. However, the German property
downturn differs in important respects from its international counter-parts.
The main difference is that investors' demand for property in Germany
remains relatively strong. Although the worsening outlook for rental growth
dampened demand in 1992 and much of 1993, prices stabilised half way through
last year; this was largely the result of a reduction in interest rates and
an upturn in demand from investors.
The most prominent domestic investors have been 'open-ended' property funds,
which operate in a similar manner to unit trusts. DTZ Zadelhoff, property
advisers, believes that the 'open-ended funds' currently have about D14bn
available for investment.
This strong domestic demand for property is likely to limit the fall-out
from the Schneider affair, say property brokers. 'The impact on the market
will be extremely limited,' said Mr Oscar Kienzle, head of Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley's German operations.
Schneider's creditor banks would face a total estimated loss of
DM1.5bn-DM2bn if they disposed of the failed group's properties, as they
stand. However, the banks have said that they will hold back from rapid
sales. The majority of the Schneider properties are development or
refurbishment projects, which will be completed and let before they are
sold.
The banks are unlikely to experience any difficulty in finding buyers for
most of the Schneider portfolio, which include some of Germany's most
prestigious commercial developments.
Ultimately the investment market's resilience may depend on whether the
Schneider case has a knock-on effect. The banking and property industries
insist that Schneider is a one-off collapse, caused by fraud and the
excessive prices the company paid for its properties.
When the scale of the losses first became apparent, Schneider's creditor
banks declared that the failed group's difficulties were not representative
of those of the domestic market as a whole.
Mr John Morgan of DTZ Zadelhoff said that the Schneider case did not herald
a more general collapse in the market. 'Mr Schneider is to a large extent a
single case. He did not mix with other developers and institutions. He very
much played his own game,' he said.
'If the rumours are correct, this is merely a matter of fraud and not
weakness in the property market,' he said.

FT  22 APR 94 / Technology: The chance to shine - The therapeutic benefits
of using a 'sophisticated' toothpaste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An old-fashioned scouring agent which has cleaned up in the American
personal care market is making a comeback in Europe as the latest
high-technology ingredient in toothpaste.
Toothpaste containing bicarbonate of soda, or baking soda, accounts for 25
per cent of the US toothpaste market. Now European consumers are being given
a chance to go back to basics and sample the delights of scrubbing with
baking soda, the crystals which conventionally have been used to ensure that
boiled cabbage stays green or to deodorise refrigerators.
US brand leader Arm &amp; Hammer, whose parent company Church &amp; Dwight of
Princeton promotes itself as the baking soda company, making everything from
industrial cleaners to cooking ingredients out of the crystals, entered the
UK market in January this year.
Following the brand's 'Wow]' television advertising campaign, which began
last month and concentrates on the taste sensation produced by brushing with
a baking soda paste, demand has been phenomenal. 'We reached three-quarters
of the month's forecast sales in a week,' reports Melinda Bowles, marketing
assistant at Foodbrokers of Portsmouth, which distributes Arm &amp; Hammer
toothpaste. 'We sold a third of our month's total in a single day.'
Arm &amp; Hammer is not being allowed a free run in Europe, however. Elida Gibbs
launched its Mentadent bicarbonate of soda brand in Italy in November and it
will be on sale in the UK from this month. In the US, Colgate, Crest (from
Procter &amp; Gamble) and Aim (a Unilever brand) have also introduced baking
soda 'dental pastes', as toothpaste is known in the trade.
'Baking soda toothpaste could be worth 10 per cent by value of the UK
toothpaste market,' predicts Steve McNicol, category manager for Elida
Gibbs, which manufactures the Mentadent brand. He does not believe its
popularity will reach the same heights as in the US, however, where baking
soda toothpaste has strong historical connotations and is even rumoured to
have helped the Yankees win the American civil war. Nevertheless, Elida
Gibbs is planning to spend Pounds 3.2m on promoting its new toothpaste this
year.
Baking soda toothpaste is the latest in a rush of new toothpaste brands to
hit chemists' shelves over the past two years, each claiming to be
technologically more advanced at preventing tooth decay and controlling
plaque.
The launches have followed the realisation by the pharmaceuticals companies
that although the market for toothpaste by volume is static - consumers
still brush only twice a day - the growth in awareness of dental hygiene has
meant that people are prepared to pay a premium price for a technically
superior toothpaste.
'Consumers are now looking for more therapeutic benefits and so are trading
upwards,' says McNicol. The result is that though volume sales remain
steady, in terms of value the toothpaste market is growing by 7 per cent a
year overall. As a result, the UK toothpaste market is expected to be worth
Pounds 215m in 1994.
The demand for advanced protection - the latest night action, tartar control
and baking soda pastes - is growing even more quickly and is predicted to
grow by 21 per cent this year.
The therapeutic benefit of bicarbonate of soda claimed by toothpaste makers
is that it helps to neutralise the acids produced by the growth of plaque,
the complex microbiological community which builds up on the tooth surface.
Neutralising the acid prevents it attacking the tooth surface and causing
decay.
A further advantage of the ingredient, says McNicol, is that it produces
fresh breath. 'It's therapeutic in that it balances the acid and it's
cosmetic in that it fulfils the need for a strong taste. So it's addressing
both the primary and secondary needs of the consumer.'
Not everyone will find the powerful salty flavour of baking soda toothpaste
to their liking. 'It's difficult to use in the morning for the first few
times, particularly after a heavy night,' admits Bowles. But, she says,
consumers who persevere soon refuse to use anything else.
Perhaps surprisingly, in spite of its gritty taste, baking soda is the
mildest ingredient in toothpaste except water.
Arm &amp; Hammer has two strengths of paste, a green minty gel which contains 29
per cent bicarbonate of soda, and a white opaque paste which contains 65 per
cent. The Mentadent brand contains 10 per cent bicarbonate of soda, and the
manufacturer has added a strong minty flavour to try to mask the salty
taste.
Both brands contain fluoride, which toughens teeth against decay and which
is a general ingredient in toothpastes. The Mentadent paste also contains
triclosan, an anti-bacterial agent which reduces bacterial growth and
inhibits the metabolism of plaque.
If baking soda toothpaste is the European flavour for 1994, 1993 saw the
launch of several high-tech toothpastes designed to persuade the consumer to
trade upwards. There were pastes which combined cleansing agents with
mouthwash and others which claimed to work all night, inhibiting plaque
formation and so reducing decay, by working long after the consumer has
stopped brushing.
Mentadent Night Action Toothpaste, for example, which took more than 18
months to develop, is formulated with a base of calcium carbonate rather
than the traditional silica. As well as acting as a physical cleaning agent
the calcium carbonate also helps to neutralise the plaque acids because the
chalky substance is retained in the plaque and so reduces further attacks.
At night the flow of saliva is halted so the active ingredients delivered by
the toothpaste in the late night brushing are not washed away, aiding the
process.
According to McNicol, the real acid test of whether such developments work
is whether the consumers are convinced. 'If consumers weren't believers then
I don't think they'd buy the products.'

Apple growing is a competitive business. English growers, facing tough
foreign competition, need to be sure that storing fruit does not harm its
quality, Andrew Fisher writes.
To improve storage of fresh produce, Eastern Electricity, the UK power
company, is pioneering a technique which uses nitrogen to help establish the
right atmosphere. It will work with Domnick Hunter, the water and gas filter
specialist, to produce generators for this market.
The portable nitrogen generator was designed by Eastern Electricity and
developed at the Industrial Energy Efficiency Centre, partly funded by the
company. In the controlled atmosphere of a refrigerated warehouse, fruit
continues to ripen if the building is less than air tight; if it has to be
opened, the sudden rise in oxygen content accelerates deterioration. The
nitrogen prevents this.

<TEXT>
The lamprey, delicacy of medieval monarchs and among the most primitive of
fish, is the model for an ambitious computer simulation project funded by
the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and headed by
Thelma Williams at St George's Hospital Medical School, London. The idea is
to simulate the detailed interaction between nerves and muscles, the rest of
lamprey's body and water, which produces its characteristic eel-like
swimming motion.
The lamprey's anatomy and nervous system are simple and well understood
compared with more advanced animals. Nerve cells in its spinal cord generate
rhythmic neural patterns, which activate muscles to contract alternately on
opposite sides of the fish, without commands from the brain.
The ultimate aim is to provide more general information about the way
animals move. This would help to underpin medical progress in treating
locomotive disorders.

FT  22 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Robot-selected gene colonies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international Human Genome Project - aimed at mapping and identifying
the estimated 100,000 human genes - is stimulating rapid advances in
laboratory automation. The latest comes from a collaboration between the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund, a London-based charity, and two UK companies:
Linear Drives of Rayleigh, Essex, and Genetix of Christchurch, Dorset.
The three partners have developed a robotic system to help scientists
produce the huge numbers of cloned cells required for genetics research.
The system locates clone colonies growing on culture plates with a CCD
camera. It then 'picks' healthy-looking colonies with a block of 96
spring-loaded pins and moves the cells to dishes for further growth and
analysis.

FT  22 APR 94 / Technology: Doing away with the dentist's drill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The whirring sound of the dentist's drill may soon be little more than an
echo from the past for millions if a dentistry technique being promoted by
the World Health Organisation catches on.
Its novel approach to cavities, or dental caries as they are known to
dentists, involves cleaning them with simple hand-held instruments and then
filling them with an adhesive material. The material used is glassionomer,
which sticks to the teeth and releases fluorides to help protect against
future cavities.
Glassionomer has been used in the industrialised world for small cavities in
front teeth for about a decade. The WHO now believes that the substance
could form the basis of improved dental care for millions in the developing
countries, thanks to advances in its durability, adhesion
and ability to release
fluoride.
The substance has been tested in Zimbabwe and in rural parts of Thailand
where, after three years, 86 per cent of the glassionomer fillings were
still in place.
The technique, known as atraumatic restorative treatment, has further
advantages in the developing countries as it requires neither water nor
electricity.
The few instruments needed can be stuffed into a satchel, enabling the
dentist to carry out the procedure in the field.
The restorative treatment was tested and evaluated by Taco Pilot, a
professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. He and his team
believe the process could be also used for those with dental problems in
underprivileged urban groups and refugee situations as well as the
developing countries.
Although widespread water fluoridation has reduced the incidence of tooth
decay in industrialised countries over the past 20 years, there are still
high-risk populations, according to data published by WHO. In the US, for
instance, black children have 65 per cent more untreated tooth decay than
the average, while among American Indians it is 265 per cent.
More than half of housebound elderly people in the US had not seen a dentist
in 10 years, according to the survey.

FT  22 APR 94 / PIA may register individuals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Personal Investment Authority said yesterday that it would consider
whether a system of registering individuals as well as the firms they work
for would be practical.
The move by the new watchdog seems to be an attempt to pre-empt a likely
recommendation from the Commons Treasury committee, which is examining
financial regulation.
Individual registration would enable the authority to discipline specific
sales agents as well as their companies.
While the statement may reassure the committee - which holds its second
session with Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, and Ms Colette Bowe, its chief
executive, next week - it is likely to cause dismay in the industry.
There will be concern over the possible costs of individually registering
all the direct sales forces of life companies.
More immediately, some of the PIA's 6,000 potential members, who have not
yet decided to join, will be worried that the new regulator's goalposts may
be moving when there are already uncertainties about how it will approach
its task.
The regulators which the authority is due to succeed in July differ in
registration practice. Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for
independent financial advisers, does register individual members but Lautro,
for the life insurance industry, does not. Mr Kit Jebens, Lautro's chief
executive who will be in charge of the PIA's relations with its members,
this week said Lautro had found it better not to undermine companies'
responsibility for their employees.

FT  22 APR 94 / Output of cars for export up 4.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car production for export rose by nearly 5 per cent in March, reversing six
months of decline and providing another sign that continental Europe's worst
new-vehicle sales slump since the second world war is over.
Statistics issued jointly yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers
and Traders and the Central Statistical Office also showed both car and
commercial-vehicle production in this year's first quarter to be higher than
a year ago.
The trend was described by the SMMT as 'encouraging', particularly for the
commercial-vehicle industry. The UK truck and van market's recovery from
recession has been slower and weaker than that for cars. It was badly
affected by last year's slump on the Continent, in which commercial-vehicle
sales were almost halved compared with 1992.
The statistics showed car output in March of 147,656, a 2.32 per cent rise
on the previous March. Export output at 57,607 was up 4.76 per cent compared
with the previous March. Last month's rises lifted total first-quarter car
output to 362,536, only 0.54 per cent below the previous quarter. Yet the
March increase was not enough to prevent first-quarter output for export, at
138,547, remaining 10.32 per cent below the previous quarter.

FT  22 APR 94 / Strong retail sales growth at odds with expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong retail sales growth in March appeared yesterday to contradict earlier
indications that consumers had been tightening their belts before this
month's tax increases.
A survey from the Confederation of British Industry, and a Gallup poll of
consumer confidence, had both hinted that sales growth might be sluggish in
March. But figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that sales
were 0.8 per cent higher than in February.
Analysts suggested that the March figures might have been distorted by the
Easter holidays, which make seasonal adjustment difficult because the
holidays move around the calendar. The effect of Easter on sales is clear
from the value figures, which are not seasonally adjusted. The value of
retail sales in March was 6.5 per cent higher than a year earlier, compared
with a 4.4 per cent annual increase in February.
The annual rate of volume growth jumped from 2.8 per cent in February to 3.8
per cent in March. However Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg
Securities, pointed out that the three-monthly trend was more smooth.
Volumes were 3.5 per cent higher in the three months to March than in the
same period a year earlier; in February, on the same basis, the increase was
3.4 per cent.
The strongest growth came from the household goods sector, where sales
volumes were 8.1 per cent higher in the first quarter of 1994, compared with
a year earlier. Volumes in clothing and footwear stores and mixed-retail
businesses were also up strongly. The only sector to show a fall was 'other
non-food', which consists of a wide range of shops from tobacconists to
florists.

FT  22 APR 94 / Old failings cloud brighter economic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the BBC presenter Martyn Lewis were to produce one of his 'good news'
bulletins on the UK economy, he would have plenty of items.
Unemployment is falling, inflation and interest rates are at their lowest
for more than 20 years, retail sales are growing and companies' investment
intentions are on the increase. Figures for gross domestic product in the
first quarter of this year are certain to show further growth, which will
mean that the recovery has lasted eight quarters, longer than the recession
which preceded it.
But the average British television audience might find such an optimistic
picture hard to believe. Consumer confidence is close to a record low,
according to a Gallup poll published earlier this week.
This discrepancy between headline statistics and the public mood is not too
hard to explain. For a start, consumers are well aware of the impact of this
month's tax increases on their pay packets.
Second, the fall in unemployment still leaves some 2.72m people out of work,
even if one does not believe Labour's claim that the 'real' figure is 5m.
Furthermore, jobs created in the recovery have tended to be part-time or in
small businesses.
The official forecast is for 2.5 per cent growth in GDP this year, following
1.9 per cent in 1993. The problem for the government is that this growth is
not sufficient to create a feel-good factor among the population. During the
'Lawson boom' of the mid-1980s, GDP grew at 4 per cent or more for four
successive years, including a heady 5 per cent in 1988.
Of course the Lawson boom did not turn out well - the current account
deficit widened to Pounds 22.5bn in 1989 and headline inflation accelerated
to double figures during 1990. The authorities, and in particular Mr Eddie
George, the governor of the Bank of England, are anxious to prevent a
recurrence.
But old habits die hard. Britain has continued to run a current account
deficit throughout the recession. In spite of the devaluation in September
1992, the deficit seems to be widening - exporters have exploited the lower
pound by increasing prices rather than sales, while continental European
companies, faced with sluggish domestic economies, are exporting to UK
consumers.
Another traditional UK problem is inflation. Here the news is rather better;
annual underlying inflation fell to 2.4 per cent in March, in the lower half
of the government's target range. Many commentators believe that the UK
economy is still operating well below capacity; this so-called 'output gap'
means that GDP can continue to grow for some time without inflationary
pressures emerging.
However, the government is handicapped by past policy failures. After the
ignominy of sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism
in September 1992, the government has had to work hard to restore its
credibility in the financial markets, necessitating a much more prominent
role for the Bank.
Experience has made financial markets reluctant to believe that Britain can
control inflation. An adverse reaction to the last base rate cut, in
February, may have made the Bank even more cautious about future reductions,
especially while it is possible to find some indicators, such as this week's
average earnings figures, which point to inflationary pressures.
To avoid Britain's old trade and inflationary problems, a sustained recovery
may require a shift from personal consumption, at present at a record high
as a proportion of GDP, towards investment. Unfortunately for the
government, cutting consumption, through taxes or low wage growth, is
unlikely to create a feel-good factor among voters.

FT  22 APR 94 / South-west sees improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies in south-west England are reporting a rise in sales and orders and
improved profitability.
About 70 per cent of companies saw higher turnover in the first quarter of
this year, says the latest survey by Bristol Chamber of Commerce and
Initiative. Only 10 per cent said turnover had fallen. Slightly more than
half said profitability had improved.
'This is a very positive report,' the chamber said.
Its survey, covering 337 companies in the south-west, found businesses in
the manufacturing and service sectors had seen improvements in the domestic
market.
In the export market, nearly half of manufacturers had higher sales and
orders, with only about one in five registering a fall.
Nearly a third of manufacturers and service businesses were increasing their
investment plans, although 70 per cent of companies were operating at below
full capacity.
Companies employing more than 500 people continue to shed staff. Smaller
companies expected employment to remain stable, or in some cases to expand,
in the next quarter.
About a third of companies said cashflow was deteriorating, with smaller
companies suffering most.

FT  22 APR 94 / Plastic card spending surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer credit and debit card spending on leisure activities grew strongly
before April's tax rises but retail spending growth slowed, figures
published yesterday show.
The Credit Card Research Group said consumers spent a total of Pounds
12.67bn using credit and debit cards in the first three months of this year.
That was 9 per cent lower than the amount spent in the previous three months
 -mainly because of seasonal factors - but 16 per cent higher than the same
period last year.
Spending on credit cards was Pounds 7.90bn, 10 per cent higher than in the
same quarter last year, while the amount spent on debit cards rose by 25 per
cent to Pounds 4.77bn.
Total credit and debit card spending on entertainment such as restaurants
and cinemas was Pounds 731m in the first quarter, a rise of 23 per cent on a
year ago, and spending on hotels was 16 per cent higher.
In contrast, spending growth in the retail sector was much weaker. Total
spending in department stores, catalogues and mail order businesses grew by
3 per cent in the first quarter over the year before.
The CCRG, which is financed by the credit card industry, said growth in
total spending in March was slower than in the previous two months, possibly
reflecting caution before April's tax rises.

FT  22 APR 94 / Campaign Diary: Birmingham tantalises victory-starved Tories
 -Paul Cheeseright finds strong indications that Labour will fail to repeat
its success of four years ago and will lose control of the city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birmingham is a beacon for the Conservatives. It winks tantalisingly across
the sea of their national political misfortune.
The electoral figures look so encouraging. Just another push from the gains
of 1992 and they would have control of the UK's largest metropolitan
authority. Even if the Liberal Democrats gain ground from Labour, that would
help the Tories - Labour only has to lose four seats and it has lost overall
political control.
Labour holds 62 seats, three of which are vacant, the Conservatives hold 42,
of which one is vacant, and the Liberal Democrats hold 13.
On May 5, 40 seats will be contested - one in each of Birmingham's 39 wards,
plus one by-election. Labour is defending 29.
The reason for Conservative hope is that 28 of the Labour seats were won in
1990, a year when Conservatives did exceptionally badly over issues such as
the poll tax, and Labour did exceptionally well.
Even Mrs Theresa Stewart, Labour leader since last year, conceded that it
would be a 'remarkable achievement' to hold all those 1990 gains,
demonstrating that both parties, for their own reasons, move into the
election campaign defensively.
In Birmingham, as elsewhere, Conservatives carry the baggage of the national
government's unpopularity: tax increases, value added tax on fuel and the
rest.
When the government trumpeted another fall in national unemployment on
Wednesday, local newspaper headlines were about the Moulinex Swan kettle
factory closure.
Labour difficulties are local. The party has controlled Birmingham City
Council for 10 years and has at times fallen prey to the arrogance
associated with long periods of power.
Its provision of local services has been caught between continued financial
stringency set off by government policy, and rising demand for services
triggered by recession. Its record, inevitably, is patchy.
The result on May 5 will depend on the way the parties can rise above their
disadvantages.
For Labour it is important that the elections are seen as a national vote of
no-confidence in Mr John Major's government.
For the Conservatives the task is to concentrate minds on local issues,
lifting the voters' horizons above the next fuel bill.
The political slanging reflects this. Labour leaflets evoke the possibility
of Conservative cuts in services and ask: 'Would you trust a Conservative
council working hand-in-glove with John Major's disastrous government?'
The Conservative approach is a series of darting attacks on the Labour
council's spending policies and management of its business: the standard
assault on what it calls the loony left.
Enthusiasts on both sides are canvassing. But the absence so far of posters
and window displays has deprived Birmingham of any sense of electoral
excitement. As the political players do their bit the electorate is left to
watch the sallies in the local press.
But there is disappointment even in that. Vigorous correspondence concerned
with the policies and attributes of Mr Bernard Zissman, the Conservative
leader, yesterday lost some potency when it was acknowledged that the
attacks on Mr Zissman had been hoax letters from bogus addresses.
Yet this jockeying for position hides what may be a fundamental change in
the nature of Birmingham politics.
Since the 1970s, both Labour and the Conservatives have shared the same
vision of city development. This is manifest most clearly in the growth of
the National Exhibition Centre and the development of the International
Convention Centre and the National Indoor Arena.
These developments, now loosely called prestige projects, reflected a shared
belief that the public sector should help the private sector diversify into
services and relieve the local economic dependence on manufacturing.
But, as local political personalities have changed and as the projects have
been completed, the political argument has moved away from bickering about
efficiency of management, about means rather than ends.
There is now a left-right ideological squabble between Mrs Stewart and her
belief in public action for private benefit, and Mr Zissman who emphasises
efficiency in the council being the catalyst for, rather than cause of,
change.
Neither will win decisively: the citadels of support for Labour in
inner-city wards and for Conservatives in the suburbs make sweeping shifts
of support unlikely. Wading through local political analysis to project a
result produces the prediction of a hung council.

FT  22 APR 94 / Campaign Diary: Tebbit turns on party colleagues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative party chairman, took the unprecedented
step of using the leftwing Tribune magazine to criticise government and
opposition 'machine politicians' who want a European single currency.
The leading opponent of the Maastricht treaty on European union overshadowed
his own party's attempts to set its agenda in the local and European
elections with an attack on federalists in all parties.
He said: 'Politics today makes for strange bedfellows. We liberals of the
right stand alongside socialists such as Tony Benn, conviction politicians
all.
'While machine politicians huddle together in an irreconcilable conflict of
interests between their responsibilities to the sovereign people and
parliament of this nation and their obligation to the European Union.'
A cabinet minister said Lord Tebbit should 'know better than attack his own
party during an election campaign'. He described Lord Tebbit's article 'as
dangerous nonsense'.

FT  22 APR 94 / Receivers at Lancer Boss announce more job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers for Lancer Boss yesterday announced another 50 redundancies at the
lift-truck maker's Leighton Buzzard plant in Bedfordshire, reducing the
workforce to about 700.
The cuts follow 19 made on April 10, two days after Mr Allan Griffiths and
Mr Scott Barnes of Grant Thornton were appointed administrative receivers of
Lancer Boss's UK operations.
Mr Griffiths also announced that he had reached agreement with the
management of Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck maker, on a
continuing trading relationship between Lancer Boss and Steinbock Boss.
Steinbock Boss is Lancer's former German unit, which Jungheinrich acquired
from the German receiver last Thursday. Lancer Boss and Steinbock Boss are
closely related and a trading relationship is crucial to Mr Griffiths'
attempts to sell Lancer Boss as a going concern.
Mr Griffiths said the trading relationship between the two companies was
'essentially unaltered'.
'Since that trading relationship has traditionally accounted for
approximately 50 per cent of Lancer Boss sales, I am confident that this
will offer substantial comfort to customers, suppliers and potential buyers
of the business,' he said.
He said he planned to begin negotiations to sell the business as a going
concern once prospective purchasers had researched the business and assessed
its value.
On Wednesday, Mr Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich in the UK, said the
German company expected to be ready to make a bid for Lancer Boss by the
middle of next week. 'We will be looking seriously at acquiring it - that is
our intention,' he said.
Mr Griffiths said yesterday's redundancies followed a comprehensive
assessment, in consultation with the existing management team, of the likely
demand in the marketplace.
Those made redundant were from a cross-section of the workforce.

FT  22 APR 94 / Council tax rules to be changed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to alter rules that threatened thousands of householders
with backdated demands for higher council tax.
Increasing activity in the housing market has uncovered mistakes in valuing
homes for council-tax purposes, leading to demands for the higher tax
backdated to April 1993.
Changes to the council tax regulations announced last night mean that the
higher tax will apply only from the date of revaluation. However, where the
value of a property is decreased, the householder will still be able to
claim back the extra tax paid since April 1993.

FT  22 APR 94 / Labour to exploit concern on hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday moved to exploit the government's growing
discomfort over its plans for large-scale closures of London hospitals.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, has chosen the programme to merge or shut
some of the capital's leading teaching hospitals as the subject of a
full-scale Commons debate next Thursday. The aim is to maximise the growing
political backlash against the plans on the eve of the May 5 local
elections.
The debate follows the establishment of an all-party group of backbench MPs
to oppose the decision by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, to
shut departments at Guy's hospital through a merger with St Thomas's.
Mr Roger Sims, Conservative MP for Chislehurst in Kent, has joined a
campaign launched by Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP for
Bermondsey, to raise Pounds 1m to oppose the effective closure of Guy's.
Labour is also opposing the plan.
Growing concern on the Tory back benches about the wisdom of the decision
has been fuelled by new figures undermining Mrs Bottomley's case for
rationalisation.
Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former health minister, and Mr Matthew Carrington, MP
for Fulham, are among Tory MPs calling for a reassessment.

FT  22 APR 94 / Town halls accused of bid rigging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some councils appear to be rigging the bidding for refuse-collection
contracts to ensure they are won by their own direct-service organisations,
says a survey to be published next week.
The survey presents evidence that some councils are encouraging their
direct-service organisations to win contracts by submitting low bids that
would involve making a loss. Additional payments are made after the contract
has been awarded so that the organisation meets its statutory target of a 5
per cent return on capital.
The result is that average savings are greater with a private contractor
than with the direct-service organisation. Average expenditure has fallen by
22.7 per cent where private companies win contracts, compared with 17.3 per
cent for contracts won by in-house teams.
The survey, by Professor Stefan Szymanski of Imperial College, London,
analyses costs of refuse collection for 280 of the 365 English local
authorities involved, using data collected by the Department of the
Environment. Two-thirds of council refuse-collection contracts have been won
by direct-service organisations.
The survey shows that compulsory competitive tendering has cut
refuse-collection costs in England by about 20 per cent, saving roughly
Pounds 100m a year. These savings are higher than the 12.4 per cent quoted
by the environment department.
The average cost of refuse collection per household in successful contracts
is the same for both private contractors and direct-service organisations.
But the amount actually paid with a direct-service organisation once the
contract is in operation is higher than with private companies.
This could be explained by additional payments made to direct-service
organisations to help them earn the required rate of return, says Prof
Szymanski.
A 'politically-motivated local authority' might boost the income of the
direct-service organisation by 'additional exceptional payments or rewriting
elements of the contract, all of which could be justified legally', he says.

FT  22 APR 94 / Campaign Diary: BCCI ghost returns to haunt islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International is being blamed
for the end of a long tradition of independent politics in the Western
Isles. All 30 Independent members of the Western Isles Council are up for
re-election on May 5, and, for the first time in living memory, Labour is
putting up five candidates.
Calum MacDonald, the islands' Labour MP, says the council needs firmer
direction following the loss of Pounds 24m in the BCCI crash.
But cynical local activists say BCCI is being used to help shore up
MacDonald's shaky majority of 1,703 over the SNP.
The dissidents say the party decided against fielding a full slate of
candidates because of fears that its image would suffer if it had to deal
with the aftermath of the BCCI fiasco. The hope is that five councillors
will be enough to raise the party's profile between parliamentary elections,
without risking too much fall-out from unpopular decisions.
Labour-controlled Bristol City Council is being tackled hard by fans of
Bristol Rovers, which has to play its Division 2 matches at Bath because of
the lack of a stadium in the city. Aggrieved supporters have formed a
Bristol party which is fielding 10 candidates, all in Labour-held wards.
Its chairman Tony Locke, 53, says the party has picked up widespread support
from people who want better leisure and transport. Jim Williams, a former
Labour lord mayor of the city, has dropped plans to stand for the party, but
Graham Robertson, the Labour council leader, is being challenged in his own
ward. Labour, which has a majority of 12, dismisses the Bristol party as
'one of those irritants'.
                           *      *      *
Bill Cash, the Tory arch-Euro-sceptic, will be the main British participant
in a motley gathering of anti-Maastricht campaigners in Paris today, called
to campaign for a 'Europe of nation states'.
Others at the plush George V hotel rally include businessman Sir James
Goldsmith, Lord Rees Mogg, former editor of The Times, Charles de Gaulle, a
conservative (small c) Euro MP who is the grandson of the late French
president, and Manfred Brunner, head of the German anti-Maastricht party.
Somewhat grandiosely, the participants have set themselves the task of
'breaking the monopoly of the Euro-federalists'. Shouldn't be hard to do,
since the latter category seems to contain ever fewer people.
                           *      *      *
Most Conservative Euro candidates have a more pressing problem - how to get
out the vote on June 9.
One go-ahead candidate, aware that Tory workers are less than keen to
support John Major on the doorsteps, has subcontracted his election campaign
to cut out the voluntary middleman. Campaign literature is to be stuffed
into envelopes by a direct-mail marketing company and delivered by
contractors for the local free-sheet newspaper.
Canvassing and 'knocking-up' on the big day is to be done from a telephone
bank instead of on foot. The candidate has not gone completely high-tech,
though. He says he will make at least one personal appearance during the
campaign.
                           *      *      *
Robert Guy, chairman of the London gold fixing and the City's bullion market
association, is campaigning for the Conservatives in a more traditional way
for the Labour-held London West Euro seat. Guy, 50, a non-executive director
of NM Rothschild, has deserted the plush parlours of the City to tour
pensioners' clubs in his rambling constit-uency.
He says voters are less Euro-sceptical than many imagine. 'Most people
understand it would be economic suicide to consider leaving the European
Union. But they are very jealous of their British rights and their national
sense of identity.'
                           *      *      *
So bad is the Conservative party's position in the European elections that
the possibility of a Canadian-style wipeout is becoming a campaign cliche.
Don't expect to hear the Canadian parallel from the lips of politically
aware Labour supporters, though. Canada's socialist New Democrats ended up
with only eight seats, hardly better than the two won by the Progressive
Conservatives.
The winners were the Liberals, now in government, and regional parties like
the Bloc Quebecois and the (western) Reform party. Step forward Plaid Cymru
and the Scottish National party . . .
                           *      *      *
The suggestion that the nation marks the 50th anniversary of D-day by frying
Spam fritters may cost the Conservatives thousands of veterans' votes. But
it has gone down quite well with George A. Hormel &amp; Co, which makes the
chopped pork delicacy in Austin, Minnesota.
Hormel's Alan Krejci, says Spam jokes (the most famous is the Monty Python
'Spam with everything' sketch) have helped make the stuff 'a modern food
icon'. Hormel sells 110m cans a year in the US - 3.8 cans are eaten every
second.
'We have lived with the wartime image for 50 years; it doesn't seem to be
doing us any harm,' says Krejci.
Maybe the PR whizz-kid who thought up the idea was on to something after
all.

FT  22 APR 94 / EU works council costs put at Pounds 1m: Large companies
will be hit hard, EEF warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Britain's largest employer organisations yesterclaimed that European
works councils would cost UK multinationals at least Pounds 1m each a year.
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, further
polarised the issue by accusing employers' bodies of 'betraying the
long-term interests of British business' by backing the government on
de-regulation and European social policy.
According to Mr Graham Mackenzie, acting director-general of the Engineering
Employers Federation, there are no caps on works council costs which will
cost 'in excess of Pounds 1m' a year.
The federation calculates that at least 30 of its larger members will be hit
by the legislation on works councils, which is expected to become law by
1997. Overall, about 100 UK multinationals will be affected.
'This is an enormous cost burden that companies in Europe will have to bear
and that companies elsewhere will not have to bear,' said Mr Mackenzie.
Companies will have to cover the cost of travel, accommodation and
interpreters for at least one and perhaps several meetings a year.
Mr Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, head of Unice, the European employers' body, said
disruption to business decision-making caused by works councils would be
more important than their costs.
'Works councils will slow down decision-making by at least three months,' he
told a meeting of the Involvement and Participation Association in London.
He said European employers could not stop the legislation but were involved
in a 'damage-limitation' exercise over the details.
Meanwhile, Mr Monks suspended his campaign to establish a less overtly
political trade unionism with a bitter attack on both the government and the
Confederation of British Industry.
He told the Scottish TUC he was 'disturbed' by recent comments from the CBI
describing European employment initiatives as 'risible and irrelevant' and
said that the CBI was not speaking for industry - 'only for the bosses'.
'A right to information and consultation would not have been irrelevant to
the workers at Rover who found out about the BMW takeover after the event
while representatives of the German workers were consulted beforehand,' he
said.

FT  22 APR 94 / Campaign Diary: Check-off drive boosts union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The GMB general union has increased its membership for the first time since
1990. The union attributes this to the success of its 'check-off' campaign.
The campaign was devised in response to the government's requirement that
all employees re-authorise their agreement for check-off of union dues from
salaries by the end of August.
Some unions feared they would lose many members as a result, but the GMB
says its membership has increased by 9,470 to 834,571.
Several other unions, including the AEEU craft union, say they are also
consolidating their membership in areas where they are already organised.
The RMT transport union, however, says it lost nearly 15,000 members when
British Rail decided it would no longer provide the check-off facility.
It now has about 48,000 paid-up members in BR.

FT  22 APR 94 / Campaign Diary: Wales is ruled out of move to curb cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, has decided that the Department of the
Environment's latest planning guidance, aimed at curbing the growing use of
cars, should not apply in Wales.
It is believed he is concerned that the guidelines could hinder economic
regeneration in the country and that the rural nature of much of Wales
should be taken into account. He has asked the Welsh Office to draw up its
own guide-lines.
The DoE issued the guidelines, PPG13, to local authorities last month as
part of its policy to discourage out-of-town development which depends upon
car use.

FT  22 APR 94 / Police abandon hunt for pub bombers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West Midlands police have abandoned the search for the IRA members whose
bombs, placed in Birmingham pubs on November 21 1974, killed 21 people and
wounded 162 others in the worst UK mainland terrorist incident.
Investigations into the bombing, re-opened in March 1991, have failed to
find enough evidence to start criminal proceedings.
'The file, so far as we are concerned, is closed unless further evidence
comes forward,' said Mr Ron Hadfield, the West Midlands chief constable,
yesterday. 'There are no more lines of inquiry.'
Mr Hadfield's declaration follows an investigation which cost Pounds 1.7m
and occupied up to 40 police officers.
The results of their work are contained in eight interim reports and one
final report to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who decided there was
insufficient evidence to charge anybody with the bombings. The contents of
the reports have not been disclosed.
This latest investigation was initiated by the release of the Birmingham Six
on a Court of Appeal judgment. The six - Mr Hugh Callaghan, Mr Patrick Hill,
Mr Robert Hunter, Mr Noel McIlkenny, Mr William Power and Mr John Walker -
were arrested within 24 hours of the pub bombings and subsequently sentenced
to life imprisonment. The six were asked if they wished to help the
investigation, but Mr Hadfield would not say whether they did or not.
With the perpetrators of the bombing still at large, Mr Hadfield said: 'My
officers have done everything they possibly could have done over the past
three years.'
He said he would not offer any opinion on the evidence which had been
gathered during the latest inquiry for fear of compromising the
confidentiality or personal safety of witnesses involved.
None of the officers in the 1990s investigation took part in the 1970s
investigation, the conduct of which was later subject to a police inquiry.
Meanwhile in Belfast yesterday, Mr Paul Hill, one of the four wrongfully
convicted of the 1974 Guildford and Woolwich pub bombings, won his appeal
against conviction for the murder in 1974 of former soldier Mr Brian Shaw.
The overturning of his conviction clears the way for him to receive the full
interim award of compensation already paid to other members of the Guildford
Four. Part of Mr Hill's interim award had been withheld pending the outcome
of the appeal in this case.
Full compensation for the four men is still being assessed by the
independent assessor Sir David Calcutt QC. He must calculate their
entitlement to special damages based on such factors as loss of earnings and
loss of job prospects.

FT  22 APR 94 / Major bows to D-day pounding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday moved to defuse the row over this summer's D-day
anniversary by bowing to the demands of veterans for a bigger say in the
events marking the Normandy landings in June 1944.
As ministers admitted that the government's approach had become a public
relations fiasco, Mr Major sought to assure MPs that the government's
planning would emphasise the commemorative rather than celebratory nature of
the events.
His comments followed an urgent meeting between Mr Peter Brooke, the
heritage secretary, and representatives of the Normandy Veterans Association
and the Royal British Legion.
Mr Brooke, whose department has been employing public relations consultants
Lowe Bell to co-ordinate nationwide activities to mark the invasion, assured
the veterans that the government would not trivialise the anniversary.
In particular, the veterans would be given an important role in the
organisation of a planned jamboree in London's Hyde Park.
The veterans had threatened a boycott but have now agreed to reconsider and
draw up their own suggested programme for the day.
After discussing the debacle at yesterday's cabinet meeting, other ministers
accused Mr Brooke's department of mishandling the anniversary. They said the
government should distance itself from some of the 'frivolous events'
suggested by Lowe Bell.
Under pressure in the Commons from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, over
ignoring the sensitivities of those who took part in the landings, Mr Major
said the main focus of the programme would be one of solemn commemoration.
He cited an open-air ceremony of remembrance which will be conducted by the
archbishop of Canterbury, religious services in the British cemetery in
Normandy and a march past by veterans.
But the prime minister said the government also wanted to involve the rest
of the country: 'As well as commemorating the bravery and sacrifice of those
who took part in the Normandy campaign, we also wish to remember the immense
effort made by the whole civilian population leading up to D-day and beyond.
That is why we want the commemorations to involve all generations, including
our children.'

FT  22 APR 94 / Bank faces Pounds 4m extra damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank, was yesterday ordered by the Commercial
Court to pay a further Pounds 4m in damages to the creditors of British &amp;
Commonwealth Holdings, the collapsed financial services group.
The judgment by Mr Justice Gatehouse closes the book on the first stage of
one of the longest and most complex pieces of litigation in City history.
The damages bring the merchant bank's total liability in the case to Pounds
176m - it paid Pounds 172m into court in October after an earlier judgment.
Quadrex Holdings, a Delaware corporation owned by Mr Gary Klesch, which had
employed Samuel Montagu, was ordered to pay Pounds 2m on top of the Pounds
10m it was ordered to pay last year. The court found the bank and Quadrex
jointly and severally liable for Pounds 176m. This made Quadrex's liability
more than Pounds 188m.
Samuel Montagu and Quadrex were ordered to pay the estimated Pounds 10m
costs of the action, which began more than five years ago.
Samuel Montagu, a subsidiary of Midland Bank and Hongkong Shanghai Banking
Corporation, confirmed yesterday that it would appeal against the finding of
liability and the size of damages. An appeal date has been set for January
next year.
The dispute arose over B&amp;C's 1987 takeover of Mercantile House Holdings. The
acquisition relied on an agreement that Quadrex would buy Mercantile's
wholesale broking division. After the bid, Quadrex did not have the money
and that ultimately helped drive B&amp;C into administration in 1990 with debts
of Pounds 1bn.
B&amp;C sued Quadrex for damages for breach of contract and also sued Samuel
Montagu for negligent mis-statement over assurances given to B&amp;C by Mr Ian
McIntosh, the bank's managing director, now deputy chairman.
The judge ruled last October that Mr McIntosh knowingly and negligently took
a risk in assuring B&amp;C that Quadrex had the funds.
Mr Peter Phillips of accountants Buchler Phillips, joint administrators of
B&amp;C, said the award, if upheld on appeal, would represent 11p to 16p in the
pound for B&amp;C's creditors.
He said the Pounds 172m award that the bank had paid into court was earning
interest at 6 per cent. Quadrex had yet to pay any of its Pounds 12m and the
administrators would be writing to the company to request payment, he added.

FT  22 APR 94 / DTI urged to take over training role: Department of
Employment's future bleak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons trade and industry committee is to recommend the transfer of
responsibility for training from the Department of Employment to the
Department of Trade and Industry. The move will fuel speculation about the
employment department's future.
In a report on UK competitiveness to be published next week, the committee
will single out the short-term culture of the City as one of a number of
structural weaknesses that are damaging Britain's prospects.
However, in conclusions reached as the government puts the finishing touches
to its own competitiveness white paper, the MPs will argue that the decline
in UK manufacturing can still be arrested.
The white paper, which the DTI plans to publish before May 19 - the official
start of the European election campaign - is expected to act as a mid-term
manifesto, pulling together a range of government policies on education,
training and manufacturing.
It should enable Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to
maintain a high political profile in advance of elections that could have a
critical bearing on the future Tory leadership.
It is generally accepted that a poor Conservative performance would deal a
devastating blow to Mr John Major's premiership.
Next week's report - prepared by a committee with a Conservative majority -
will suggest that the taxation system should be used to try to change the
short-term culture of the City.
It calls for consideration to be given to an adjustment of taxes to make
executive share options less attractive.
The MPs believe these options can be damaging because they give managers an
incentive to keep their company's share price high and discourage them from
cutting dividends, even when this would be in the company's long-term
interest.
They also believe that ministers should consider using tax incentives to
encourage investors to adopt a longer-term approach to investing in small
companies.
The MPs believe that shifting primary responsibility for training to the DTI
is one of a number of measures that could be taken to improve the
effectiveness of government programmes. Such a step would lift the DTI's
annual budget by up to Pounds 2.3bn.
Senior Tory officials have been floating the idea of scrapping the
employment department this summer as part of the expected cabinet reshuffle.
Details of the report emerged as Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief
Treasury secretary, used a speech in London to set out his own agenda for
improving competitiveness.
Pledging to resist pressure for Britain to sign up to the social chapter of
the Maastricht treaty, Mr Portillo said the government had put in place a
framework in which business could flourish.
Britain had stabilised its share of world trade in manufactured goods after
decades of decline, he said. Further improvement depended on 'investment,
education, training and infrastructure'.

FT  22 APR 94 / Le cut-price ticket 'by invitation only'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel yesterday unveiled plans for a limited 'by invitation only'
service through the Channel tunnel during the summer months until a full
freight and passenger timetable can be run from October.
The announcement was made as the company unveiled its preliminary annual
report for 1993.
Shareholders, business contacts, long-term supporters of the tunnel, the
travel trade and the press will be offered reduced fares under Eurotunnel's
'overture service'.
The reduced-fare services will start after the official opening on May 6.
The company hopes that 50,000 cars will have gone through the tunnel 'to
create more positive awareness' before full-price tickets go on sale in
October.
However, delays in getting rolling stock into service will mean that the
full programme of four passenger shuttle trains an hour will not be possible
until spring next year.
Eurotunnel is currently carrying out a seven-day series of full-scale tests
running trains through the tunnel.
The company said yesterday that it had negotiated rates with nearly 900
freight customers which account for 80 per cent of the market for
driver-accompanied trucks crossing the Channel. It plans to start its
limited freight shuttle by invitation in May. Invitation passenger shuttles
are due to start in July.
Eurotunnel expects to announce revised projections of traffic levels and
revenues at the time of its rights issue prospectus, due between May 17 and
the end of June. It plans to raise at least Pounds 1.1bn. Equity will
account for less than half the total, but the final figure will depend on
the debt equity mix and sum needed to cover additional interest payments.
Much of Eurotunnel's debt - 60 per cent of sterling debt and 21 per cent of
French debt - was at fixed rates at the end of 1993. The aim is have 75 per
cent of both currencies fixed for four to six years.
Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, yesterday said the
explanation for delays in opening the tunnel included the need for 4,000
contractors' staff to work alongside Eurotunnel staff after the official
handover in December.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The GMB general union has increased its membership for the first time since
1990. The union attributes this to the success of its 'check-off' campaign.
The campaign was devised in response to the government's requirement that
all employees re-authorise their agreement for check-off of union dues from
salaries by the end of August.
Some unions feared they would lose many members as a result, but the GMB
says its membership has increased by 9,470 to 834,571.
Several other unions, including the AEEU engineering union, say they are
also consolidating their membership in areas where they are already
organised.

The proposal by the Baltic Exchange for an open register of British
shipping, aimed at attracting international shipowners to base their
operations in London, was shelved by Mr John MacGregor, the transport
secretary, last night.
Announcing his decision not to proceed 'for the present', he told the
Commons that he was concerned about the impact the new register would have
on the existing UK shipping register.
Mr MacGregor maintained that it would be better to assess the effectiveness
of the new freer regime that had been introduced for the existing register
over a reasonable period of time before deciding whether to go further.

FT  22 APR 94 / E Anglia power plant in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An independent power company appears to have shelved plans to build an
electricity plant in East Anglia following the decision by Offer, the
industry regulator, to put a limit on prices in the electricity wholesale
pool, Michael Smith writes.
Independent Power Generators, a consortium involving French companies, has
terminated a contract with National Grid to take power from a proposed 730MW
station in Sutton Bridge, East Anglia. The company was not available for
comment last night.
It said recently it was deferring non-essential development at Sutton Bridge
'due to continuing downward regulatory pressure of the wholesale price of
electricity and over-capacity in the UK market'.
It added that the National Grid's estimates showed that the excess of
generating capacity over peak demand could reach 42.6 per cent by 2000.
Regional power companies estimated demand for electricity would grow by 1.3
per cent annually to the end of the decade, the company said. A year ago
that estimate had been 1.6 per cent.

FT  22 APR 94 / Southern lines in latest round of BR sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail's South London and Sussex Coast routes are among the latest
franchises to be put up for sale under the government's privatisation plans.
The seven routes announced yesterday are the second round of sell-offs and
also include the Anglia route network, Cardiff valleys, Merseyrail, Midland
main line, South and West Wales and the West Coast main line.
At the same time, a private-sector consortium planning a bid for a
loss-making part of BR's freight operations said it had recruited a third
member.
The Port of Felixstowe has joined P&amp;O Distribution, part of the P&amp;O shipping
group, and Russell Davies, a privately owned transport group, in their bid
for Freightliner, which handles container traffic.
With six passenger routes due to be sold in 1995, the franchises unveiled
yesterday would allow the government to reach its target of privatising at
least half of the BR network by April 1996.
Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director, said it was a 'challenging
timetable'.
These routes have been chosen because they are self-contained and are not
likely to see passenger and revenue projections upset by big construction
projects such as the Channel tunnel rail link.
One factor influencing the order in which routes are privatised is the speed
with which managers prepare their own sets of accounts and demonstrate their
ability to adapt to the contractual arrangements.
Mr Salmon is still working out the terms under which he would offer
franchises and the extent to which management teams would assume a degree of
risk. 'I want a clear proposition which I can put to serious buyers,' he
said. 'The main issue is how we split the risk.'
Yesterday's announcement leaves 12 franchises to be sold, probably during
1997.
The bid for Freightliner, which made a loss of Pounds 38m on turnover of
Pounds 70m, is expected to involve tough negotiations on the level of
track-access charges to be paid, as well on the purchase price. Freightliner
is thought to pay between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m a year in track charges
to BR at present.
The bidding consortium believes it can make considerable efficiency savings
as well as marketing the container service more effectively. But it also
expects the government to compromise on the level of track charges.

FT  22 APR 94 / Weapons go AWOL in army accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Audit Office has found serious accounting deficiencies in the
rundown of the British army in Germany. Missing items in the withdrawal
included sub-machine guns, rifles, other automatic weapons, 60 pounds of
plastic explosive and 110 detonators. Some vehicles were also unaccounted
for.
A small test audit showed that 10 per cent of equipment could not be
located. In the case of one large store, the audit office found a virtual
loss of accounting control during closure.
After internal inquiries the Ministry of Defence has concluded that no
weapons have been physically lost. Instead, the problem is blamed on a
failure to complete the correct documentation. The weapons were traced, and
the explosives had apparently been used in training but had been listed on
the accounts as missing for nearly three years.
Repatriating service personnel and equipment to Britain is acknowledged by
the audit office to be a complex logistical task. But it has also found that
a backlog of uncompleted accounts is building up and could get even worse.

FT  22 APR 94 / Stock Exchange approves order matching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange yesterday cleared the way for a trading system
that will automatically match orders to buy and sell shares.
Approval for the system, known as Seaquence, had been opposed by some of the
exchange's largest members. The system is due to run in parallel with and
compete against the existing market-making system.
Yesterday's vote by the exchange board reverses a controversial decision
last year and authorises funding to build the system. The move is in
response to rising competition from new exchanges.
The order-matching system will automatically pair buy and sell orders for a
share at the same price. Order matching has been used with great success by
Nasdaq, the US-based electronic exchange.
The move to order matching is likely to anger market-makers, most of whom
are among the largest and most wealthy members of the exchange.
Market-makers make firm offers to buy and sell shares at a set price in all
market conditions and earn profits on the difference.
Last June market-makers on the exchange's board had refused to approve plans
to replace the ageing Seaq share-dealing system with one which could
incorporate order matching. The plan was only approved after the exchange
agreed to cut costs and eliminate the order-matching capacity in the new
system - a decision reversed yesterday.
The exchange said yesterday: 'The exchange is 100 per cent behind a
quote-driven (market-making) system'.
The exchange's new chairman, Mr John Kemp-Welch, said he had become
particularly concerned about a new dealing mechanism, Tradepoint, which will
have order matching and market-making capacity, and by threats from venture
capitalists to develop a new exchange to handle dealing in small-company
shares.
Many stock exchange members believe that market-making has failed to produce
the necessary liquidity in small-company shares and that only an
order-matching system will meet investors' needs.
Mr Kemp-Welch said the exchange would not be able to head off the threat of
a small-companies' exchange unless it too offered investors an
order-matching system.
Several weeks ago Mr Michael Lawrence, the newly-appointed chief executive
of the exchange, wrote to exchange members saying that if board members
failed to approve funds to build order matching into Seaquence now, it would
be far more expensive to do so later.
Yesterday's approval applied only to building the software for the system.
A decision about whether to proceed with plans to build hardware will be
made towards the end of next year, the exchange said.

FT  22 APR 94 / MMC fears on house valuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is set to publish a report detailing a
number of concerns about mortgage lenders' control over the valuation
profession.
While the MMC broadly accepts the lenders' argument that they must retain
control over valuations in order to protect themselves from fraud, the
report says independent surveyors are suffering.
With few exceptions, lenders select or nominate the valuer, giving borrowers
no choice in the matter. This frequently forces borrowers to pay for more
than one survey.
According to an MMC draft obtained by the Economist magazine, the report
says it has become more difficult for independent surveyors to be appointed
to the panels of valuers approved by lenders. More than 80 per cent of
applications by valuers to join their panels were rejected by the main
lenders in 1992.
The increasing difficulty in being appointed to lenders' panels is partly a
result of a downturn in market demand and the need to contain the costs of
panel management. Also, more valuation work is going to the lenders'
in-house valuers and subsidiary companies, partly as a result of the wave of
acquisitions of estate agents by building societies in the second half of
the 1980s.
The MMC report notes that many valuers are required to introduce mortgage
business to lenders as a condition of being appointed to their panel. A
survey commissioned by the MMC found that about a quarter of valuers
introduced new business to lenders.
This practice has provoked concern from valuers' professional associations
which believe that it unfairly discriminates against valuers who are unable
to introduce business because, for example, they are not associated with
estate agencies or intermediaries.
The MMC report also highlights the valuation fees charged by valuers
associated with lenders. In 1993 an average of 60 per cent of the fees of
independent valuers were lower than those levied by the lender. It also
found that a number of large lenders, which together account for more than
25 per cent of the market, did not identify their administration charge in
their marketing literature.
The report says there is an element of cross-subsidy between different
borrowers. Valuation charges are greater for properties in regions with
higher-than-average house prices, such as south-east England, although the
workload for the valuer is the same.

<TEXT>
The setting-up of an Irish peace forum, involving political parties from the
Republic and Northern Ireland, has been temporarily ruled out by Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister.
The idea was floated in the Downing Street declaration as a way to bring
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, into the peace process following
an IRA ceasefire.
Opposition parties in the Republic, however, have been pressing the
government to establish the forum regardless of the Sinn Fein response to
the declaration.
During a meeting yesterday between Mr Reynolds and the leaders of the three
main opposition parties, Mr Reynolds avoided making any commitment to the
creation of the forum without participation from Sinn Fein.
However, opposition leaders were satisfied that Mr Reynolds had agreed to
more regular consultations with the opposition on the government's Ulster
policy.
Mr John Bruton, leader of Fine Gael, the main opposition party, said he
hoped the government was seeking an 'early agreement on concrete issues'.

FT  22 APR 94 / Putting a spin on London news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Yorkshire tumble-dryer millionaire plans to launch a free evening
newspaper for London within the next few months.
The newspaper - to be called Tonight - will be the first competition for the
Evening Standard since 1987 when Lord Rothermere closed the Evening News for
the second time. It had been temporarily revived to spoil the launch of
Robert Maxwell's London Daily News.
The man behind the newspaper, which is to be published Monday to Friday, is
Mr Derek Clee who took over tumble-dryer manufacture at a Halifax factory
formerly owned by Philips, the electronics group.
The newspaper is to be edited by Mr Peter Grimsditch, the Oxford classics
graduate who used to edit Mr David Sullivan's Daily Sport, best known for
its pictures of naked women. Mr Grimsditch, who has also edited the Daily
Star, got his new job after answering a small advertisement in The Guardian
for a newspaper editor.
Tonight will be distributed at main London underground and railway stations.
Mr Clee has signed a five-year agreement with the PA news agency for news,
sport, pictures and graphics. The newspaper is taking Pace, the new PA
service for evening newspapers.
Distribution will be handled by Mr Jim Basford, who has been circulation
director of the Evening Standard for 20 years.
Mr Grimsditch said last night that the Evening Standard had become too
elitist. Tonight would be 'a modernised Evening News' aimed at the middle
market. He plans to hire about 15 journalists, while relying heavily on
material from the PA.
'Some people at least buy the Standard because there is nothing else to
buy,' he argued. 'I am trying to meld national newspaper professionalism
with regional content.'
The newspaper will aim for a distribution of about 150,000 copies a day
within a week of its launch. Eventual distribution will cover the whole area
within the M25.
Last night Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers,
publisher of the Evening Standard, said: 'I regard all daily newspapers as
competition.'
But he warned that the new newspaper was planning to launch at a time when
newsprint prices were rising and classified advertising had not fully
recovered from recession.
The launch of Tonight will be a departure for London, which has not had a
free newspaper. Robert Maxwell talked about launching a free newspaper for
the capital called The Londoner while he was setting up the London Daily
News. But nothing ever came of it.
Reed International launched the Daily News as a free title in Birmingham,
but it was not a financial success and is now a weekly.

FT  22 APR 94 / World Trade News: Technology is S Korea's price - The terms
of GEC Alsthom's high-speed rail deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gruelling eight-month negotiations by GEC Alsthom with South Korea to
supply the Train a Grande Vitesse for the country's high-speed railway is
evidence that foreign companies have to pay a high price for entering one of
Asia's most protected markets.
South Korea is demanding extensive technology transfers from foreign
companies hoping to win orders in industries ranging from telecommunications
to defence equipment. This reflects Korean concerns that it is falling
behind in technical development because it has concentrated on increasing
its production capability at the expense of industrial research.
GEC Alsthom's willingness to meet Korea's technology requests and offer
price and financing terms favourable to Seoul is considered the key reason
it was selected for the prestigious Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn) high-speed
rail contract.
The TGV defeated the newer and more technologically advanced Inter-city
Express offered by Siemens and Mitsubishi's older Shinkansen train.
The agreement, concluded on Monday, will enable Korea to make the TGV on its
own once it acquires full rights to the transferred technology in 2002 and
sell it to other countries.
GEC Alsthom had to weigh the advantages of gaining its first beachhead in
the potentially lucrative Asian market against allowing its consortium of
Korean subcontractors - Hyundai, Daewoo and Hanjin - to become an eventual
competitive rival.
'It's how the game is played,' said Mr Philippe Jarrosson, deputy director
of GEC Alsthom TGV project in Korea.
GEC Alsthom at first resisted the extent of Korea's technology transfer
demands, citing patent and intellectual property rights.
But the Anglo-French group in the end agreed to provide design and
manufacturing technology to enable the Korean subcontractors to produce key
components valued at more than half the contract and provide them with the
ability to upgrade the TGV system in the future.
Koreans' share of production is bigger than the 45 per cent share granted to
Spain for its version of the TGV. Thirty-four of the 46 TGV trains will be
manufactured in Korea.
The eagerness of Korean manufacturers to gain access to the technology
provoked a dispute that threatened to wreck GEC Alsthom's contract
negotiations with the government.
GEC Alsthom's selection of Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry as head of the
Korean consortium provoked a protest by Daewoo Heavy Industries, which
feared that it would be denied full access to the transferred technology if
it remained a junior partner. Both companies will produce the TGV engines,
while Hanjin will make the carriages.
Daewoo tried to stop negotiations last winter by filing a suit, claiming it
had the right to be consortium leader since it was GEC Alsthom's original
partner during the two-year bidding process against Siemens and Mitsubishi.
Daewoo agreed to join the consortium last month after the suit was dismissed
and GEC Alsthom promised it would have equal access to the technology.
GEC Alsthom has also been forced to reduce substantially its bid for the TGV
order from its initial offer of Dollars 3.6bn in 1991 to the agreed price of
Dollars 2.1bn, which is Dollars 270m below its final bid last year.
Korea was able to obtain the last-minute price cut by adopting a
'stripped-down' train interior that is less comfortable than those on the
European TGV trains, according to negotiators.
Mr Jarrosson denied that that was the case, but explained that cost savings
were the result of Korea declining to accept 'the optimum range of features'
that GEC Alsthom offered in its final bid price.
The TGV is due to go into full service in 2002 and link the country's
capital of Seoul with Pusan, the country's second-largest city and its
biggest port.

<TEXT>
Nissan, the Japanese car maker, and Samsung, one of South Korea's largest
industrial groups, are in talks about a possible tie-up which would provide
Samsung Heavy Industries with Nissan's technology in manufacturing cars.
Nissan said that it had been approached by Samsung about the possibility of
transferring car manufacturing technology and that the two sides were still
at the negotiating table.
An alliance with Samsung would give Nissan a promising entry into the South
Korean passenger car market, where the company has not been particularly
active.
The company already provides Samsung with truck manufacturing technology and
will start volume production of left-hand-drive trucks from the middle of
this year.
Nissan has also had a tie-up since 1986 with Daewoo, through which it
provides the Korean truck maker with technology for its commercial van, the
Vannette. However, that tie-up will expire at the end of this year.
South Korea now ranks as the world's sixth largest carmaker, after the
United States, Japan, Germany, France and Canada.
Negotiations with Samsung, which is making a bid to enter the passenger car
market in South Korea, hinge on passenger cars.

FT  22 APR 94 / World Trade News: Water boost to green exports -
Co-operation by US and Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Export-Import Bank and Mexico's national development bank have
announced a programme to finance up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 336m) for waste
water treatment in Mexico over the next five years.
The agreement is one of a series announced this week as part of the Clinton
administration's mobilisation of government resources to expand trade in
environmental technology.
The Eximbank, which had its annual conference yesterday, is pushing
environmental trade fervently. With Banobras, Mexico's development bank, it
has produced a plan to fund cleansing of rivers, lakes and streams, using a
combination of users' fees, commercial loans and government guarantees.
Under this arrangement, cities will select private companies to build,
operate and maintain waste water treatment facilities, which would
eventually be transferred to the city. Users' fees will pay for the water
treatment services.
Banobras will guarantee repayment to commercial lenders in case of user fees
being inadequate.
Eximbank also announced a plan to have the 45,000 companies in the US
environmental industry expand exports. Its aim is to support Dollars 800m in
fiscal year 1994, a doubling of the total last year.
It offers the following inducements: financing for 15 per cent of costs
incurred locally in addition to the financing of US equipment and services;
deferment on construction loans until project is completed; the longest
repayment terms allowed by multilateral rules.
An environmental insurance package in the US will provide 95 per cent
commercial coverage and 100 per cent political coverage. Environmental
exporters will be exempt from the ordinary requirement that they pay a share
of the first loss claimed under the policy.

FT  22 APR 94 / World Trade News: Amec to set up joint venture with China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amec, the UK construction group, has agreed to set up a joint venture which
will build petrochemical, oil and gas production facilities in China.
The company's process engineering subsidiary yesterday signed an exclusive
memorandum of understanding with Chinese Offshore Industrial Corporation, a
state-owned shipbuilding group. The two companies are finalising
joint-venture terms.
The agreement covers construction of on-shore petrochemical plants as well
as off-shore oil and gas production facilities for use in China.
The deal will also enable the joint venture to build advanced deep-water
floating production vessels in China for sale worldwide.
Amec will contribute half the venture's costs. In return for enhancing its
strategic position in the Chinese market, Amec will transfer technology for
management of projects and engineering design.
Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, said: 'Although technology transfer was an
issue, it was clear that many key skills and abilities already exist in our
partner's organisation.'
The venture will develop a joint facility at Huang Pu shipyard in Guangzhou
province in southern China, capable of building modules of up to 5,000
tonnes each. COIC also has the ability to build large floating production
platforms at a 300,000-tonne dry dock in north-east China.
Amec is already building accommodation modules in partnership with COIC for
Phillips Petroleum platforms in the South China Sea.
Amec is one of Britain's biggest manufacturers and service providers for the
UK oil and gas industries. Demand for North Sea off-shore platforms for has
fallen sharply in the past 18 months. Amec has been seeking to use its
technology to expand abroad.

FT  22 APR 94 / Gore offers greenhouse warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Global climate change is more dangerous to the US than the British navy was
to the American colonists in their war of independence, Vice-President Al
Gore warned yesterday in a call for more action to tackle greenhouse gas
emissions.
'Our enemy is more subtle than the British fleet. Climate change is the most
serious problem our civilisation faces,' Mr Gore told government and
business officials working on climate change issues, who he described as
'the Paul Reveres of the environmental movement'.
But as Mr Gore issued his warning, scientists were questioning whether the
US was doing enough to reduce its own emissions of greenhouse gases such as
carbon dioxide, which are widely believed to contribute to global warming.
The US, like other signatories of the Global Climate Treaty agreed in Rio de
Janeiro two years ago, is committed to bringing emissions of greenhouse
gases down to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The US produces around one fifth
of the world's greenhouse gases.

FT  22 APR 94 / New crime bill passed by House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US House of Representatives yesterday passed a sweeping crime bill that
would provide money for 50,000 new police officers and impose a mandatory
life sentence on anyone convicted of a third violent felony.
The legislation passed by a margin of 285 to 141 after a week of often
rancorous debate that had alienated some left-wing Democrats by toughening
the bill's measures, but not enough to win the support of the more
right-wing members of the Republican party.
Congressional leaders will now have to reconcile the House legislation with
a similar bill passed by the Senate last year.
In all, the House version would cost around Dollars 28bn (Pounds 19.1bn),
against Dollars 22bn for the Senate bill, largely because it provides more
money to help states build prisons. It also contains a measure allowing
defendants to use statistics in an effort to prove racial discrimination in
the application of the death penalty against them.

FT  22 APR 94 / IMF to consider new stand-by credits for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund, which this week provided a controversial
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) loan for Russia, is preparing to discuss
further financing later this year.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF's managing director, said yesterday the Fund
expects to begin negotiations to provide Russia with a new stand-by credit
after the government in Mos-cow has put forward the main elements of its
1995 budget.
In the immediate future, Russia will begin negotiations with western
creditor countries in the Paris Club to reschedule its official debt. Russia
has borrowings of Dollars 84bn of which 75 per cent is owed to official
creditors.
Mr Camdessus said a Paris Club agreement, combined with the Dollars 1.5bn
IMF loan for Russia that was released this week and loans to be provided by
the World Bank, will complete Russia's external financing needs for this
year.
According to a senior US Treasury official, negotiations on the new IMF
stand-by facility could start early in the autumn, while the World Bank
should provide more than Dollars 1bn in the 'next couple of months' to
finance projects in Russia's energy and financial sectors.
At a press conference in Washington yesterday, Mr Camdessus strongly
defended the IMF's decision on Wednesday to approve the Dollars 1.5bn loan
in support of the Russian government's economic reform and stabilisation
programme.
He said the Fund had been able to approve the loan because Russia had
produced a pragmatic programme it would be able to implement effectively. In
particular, there had been a 'spectacular change' in the Russian monetary
policy since last July.
He said that a few months ago, the IMF had the impression that Russia had no
monetary policy, no such thing as a budget and that it was going down the
'dangerous slope' of protectionism.
However, Russia now had a 'very tough' monetary policy with very high real
interest rates. The central bank had ceased distributing subsidised credits.
Institutions were in place to push down inflation, he said.
Russia's budget deficit, although still too high, was being cut, Mr
Camdessus said. It is expected to fall to 6.5 per cent of gross domestic
product this year from 8 per cent in 1993.
The impact of derivatives trading on pushing up long-term interest rates
will be discussed by finance ministers and central bank governors from the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries on Sunday, a senior US Treasury
official said yesterday.

FT  22 APR 94 / Bentsen to press Japan to boost its economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US yesterday renewed demands for Japan to boost domestic demand in an
effort to get its economy moving and bring down its trade surplus.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, warned he would be pressing
Japan to do more about its trade surplus at Sunday's meeting in Washington
of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven
leading industrialised nations.
'Maybe the US economy is doing well now despite the drag from that surplus,
but it's essential, over the long run, for Japan to help lead global
recovery rather than to impede it,' Mr Bentsen said yesterday.
'You saw the February trade numbers. Japan cannot rely on the US market, nor
any other foreign market, to boost its economy. It must have its own
sustainable, demand-led recovery,' he added.
But Mr Bentsen said the US would not seek to bring the value of the dollar
down against the yen as a means of improving the competitiveness of US
exports to Japan. 'We're not going to try to devalue ourselves into their
markets. We are in no way managing the dollar in that regard,' he said.
He added that he saw room for further interest rate cuts in continental
Europe.
US officials said even for Japan, exports only made up a small proportion of
output, so domestic demand remained much more important for overall economic
growth.
The US will also press for more efforts to ease access of foreign goods to
Japanese markets as an accompaniment to the boost to demand it seeks.
'Macroeconomic stimulus is much more likely to be effective in reducing the
current account deficit if foreign products are freely available,' a senior
treasury official said.

Global climate change is more dangerous to the US than the British navy was

emissions.
'Our enemy is more subtle than the British fleet. Climate change is the most

The US, like other signatories of the Global Climate Treaty agreed in Rio de
Janeiro two years ago, is committed to bringing emissions of greenhouse
gases down to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
For the US, which produces around one fifth of the world's greenhouse gases,
that means a return to annual emissions of 1.24bn tons of carbon dioxide,
from a level that reached 1.37bn tons last year and is still climbing.
A study issued yesterday by the Union of Concerned Scientists argued current
climate change plans are likely to achieve a reduction in emissions of only
about 34m tons over seven years, roughly a third of what is needed.
After the Clinton administration failed to pass a significant increase in
energy taxes, which would have cut fuel consumption and thus emissions, it
has focused largely on voluntary efforts with industry.
The Energy Department this week signed an agreement with five large
electrical industry associations to promote more energy-efficient commercial
technologies, to invest in forest management and tree-planting, to develop
the market for geothermal heat pumps and to promote electrical vehicles.
Mr Gore yesterday ridiculed those who argue the threat of global warming was
not yet scientifically proven, comparing them to the tobacco industry
executives who claim that there is no firm proof that smoking causes lung
cancer.

FT  22 APR 94 / Pledge over female mutilation: World Bank and IMF win
commitment by Burkina Faso
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In an unusual broadening of their role into social and cultural issues, the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund have won a commitment from the
government of Burkina Faso to take steps to combat female genital
mutilation.
The commitment is included in Burkina Faso's policy framework paper, a set
of medium-term economic policy priorities negotiated with the international
financial institutions as the basis for receiving assistance loans.
The practice of female genital mutilation, sometimes referred to as female
circumcision, is widespread in many countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Besides
ritually reinforcing the subordination of women, the mutilation brings
severe risks of infection and starkly increases health risks in later life.
World Health Organisation officials estimate that genital mutilation doubles
the risk of death at childbirth and increases the risk of still-birth by
three or four times.
Besides the WHO, donor countries such as the US and France have sought to
discourage the practice. The United Nations Human Rights Commission last
month agreed to a special investigation into violence against women, but
referred only obliquely to genital mutilation as 'the harmful effects of
certain traditional or cultural practices.'
Burkina Faso is in the middle of a radical economic adjustment programme
begun in 1991 but intensified this year by the 50 per cent devaluation of
the CFA franc agreed by members of the currency zone in January.
The IMF last month agreed to lend the Burkina Faso government Dollars 25m
(Pounds 17m) from its enhanced structural adjustment facility, which
provides subsidised loans for very poor countries.
The adjustment programme contains a number of measures designed to alleviate
the impact of the devaluation on some of Burkina Faso's most vulnerable
population groups. They included steps to spread price increases for
essential consumer goods such as kerosene and generic drugs over a six- to
12-month period, and an expansion of primary health and basic education
services.

<TEXT>
Mr Guido di Tella, Argentina's foreign minister, has announced that the
Falkland Islands government has accepted his proposals to clear some 30,000
mines laid by Argentine troops during the 1982 conflict with Britain.
Mr di Tella said: 'We have received communication from the islanders that
they welcome our offer. This is the first time the islanders have welcomed
anything from Argentina (since 1982).' He added that he would walk on the
minefields after they were cleared to show they were safe.
Argentina first proposed in January to pay a third party to remove mines,
since Argentines are banned from the islands. Mr di Tella said he has now
asked US army engineers to carry out the project, for which Argentina would
seek World Bank financing.
However, the Falkland Islands government said they have not reached a firm
agreement with Argentina over mine clearance.
Mr Graham Bound of the Falklands government office in London said 'no final
proposal has been put forward saying what will be done, in what time frame,
or by whom.'
A foreign office official said yesterday London has only reached a
'qualified acceptance' with Argentina.

'Noire et blanche', a photographic print by Man Ray depicting Kiki of
Montparnasse fondling an African mask, sold for Dollars 354,500 (Pounds
239,527), double its top estimate and a record for the artist, at Christie's
in New York on Wednesday night. It was the second highest price paid at
auction for a photograph. Alfred Stieglitz's image of the hands of his wife,
the artist Georgia O'Keefe, made Dollars 398,500 at Christie's last year.
The Man Ray photograph was part of a sale of just 81 lots of works by the
leading photographers. It totalled Dollars 2m and was an attempt by
Christie's to market photographs by modern masters in the same way as top
rank Impressionist and Modern paintings.
The best items went well above forecast; the less interesting failed to
sell. There were auction records for Edward Weston, Lewis Hine, Eugene Atget
and Henri Cartier-Bresson.
'Clouds', an image captured by Weston in Mexico in 1926, sold for Dollars
156,500. It was de-commissioned from the Getty Museum of Malibu, California,
to raise funds for more purchases of photographs: the Getty has another copy
of the print. A portrait by Stieglitz of the nude torso of Georgia O'Keefe
went for Dollars 145,000, and 'Mechanic and Steam Pump' by Hine for Dollars
90,500.

FT  22 APR 94 / Anti-trust move on US teller network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Justice Department yesterday cracked its anti-trust whip against the
largest regional network of bank teller machines in US, in a move that could
herald actions against other such networks.
Ms Janet Reno, attorney general, announced her department had filed a
proposal in federal court settling charges against Electronic Payment
Services, which operates the MAC teller network mostly in the north-eastern
US.
The Justice Department said MAC had required member banks to use its
computer processing services and used its control over the processing system
to prevent member banks from joining up with competing networks.
'The MAC network has prevented more than 1,000 banks in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Delaware and elsewhere from joining other ATM (automatic teller
machines) networks in addition to MAC, the dominant network. This illegal
practice affects one seventh of the population of this country,' Ms Reno
said.
ATM networks play a particularly important role in the US financial system
because US banking laws prevent a bank from simply opening up a branch
outside its home state, although in certain controlled circumstances they
may operate in another state through a subsidiary.
MAC is the largest regional network, with around 14,000 ATMs and 107,000
point-of-sale terminals serving around 28m card-holders in 26 states.
Justice Department officials said its exclusion practices did not appear to
be copied by other networks. Nevertheless, at a recent meeting of
independent bankers Ms Reno invited complaints against other networks.
MAC had already settled a suit brought against it by New York Switch, which
operates the rival NYCE network, by agreeing to phase out its ban on
allowing outside data processors to handle transactions over its network.
Ms Reno said the settlement would increase consumer choice by allowing bank
customers to take their cards to machines belonging to a range of competing
networks.

FT  22 APR 94 / Minister rejects IMF's gloomy growth forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Juro Saito, Japan's deputy finance minister, yesterday rejected
International Monetary Fund forecasts that his country's economy would
register the lowest growth rate of any of the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations.
The IMF announced this week that it expected Japan's economy would grow only
0.7 per cent during 1994. But Mr Saito insisted the government's target of
2.4 per cent during the fiscal year ending March 31 was attainable.
'The economy has become brighter and is unlikely to fall further,' he said.
His claims follow meetings with regional finance bureau chiefs who said
there were signs of recovery throughout Japan. The country has been
suffering the longest and deepest recession since the Second World War.
However, Mr Saito's comments were made as data cast doubt on a consumer-led
recovery. Japan's household spending for February registered its first fall
in four months, according to the Management and Co-ordination Agency.
Mr Peter Morgan, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Japan, said the 0.5 per
cent year-on-year fall in household spending, while weaker than expected,
followed an unexpectedly strong January when it increased 2.7 per cent.
'Consumer spending remains, on average, on an upward curve, and the first
quarter this year will have been stronger than the last quarter during
1993,' he said.
However, Mr Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, said yesterday that the Japanese economy remained in the doldrums.
He warned that continuing political uncertainty, increases in public utility
rates, and the yen's appreciation against the dollar all threatened a
recovery.
Mr Morgan agreed: 'The major risk to the economy is a renewed rise of the
yen.'
The chances of a manufacturing-led recovery remain bleak. Mr Yutaka Kume,
chairman of Nissan, the automotive group, and outgoing chairman of the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association, said yesterday that domestic vehicle
sales were unlikely to recover from the current slump until next year.

FT  22 APR 94 / Australian securities suit filed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian Securities Commission yesterday filed a suit against Mr John
Spalvins, who built up the Adelaide Steamship group in the 1980s, as well as
four other former directors of the company and Deloitte Haskins &amp;
Sells/Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu, the former auditors of the group.
The ASC, acting on behalf of the Adsteam group, is demanding that ADollars
340m (Pounds 163.4m) be repaid to the company - an amount which it claims is
equivalent to 'improperly paid dividends and interest'. The suit is a civil
action, and while claiming that the defendants breached their fiduciary
duties or were negligent, does not allege any criminal behaviour.
In the action, filed in the Federal Court in Adelaide, the ASC maintained
that the former directors and auditors caused Adsteam's profit for 1990 to
be overstated by at least ADollars 518m in the accounts.
The accounts, to year-end of June 1990, and certified in the following
October as 'true and fair' by the directors and auditors, said that the
company had 'achieved its 14th consecutive record profit for ADollars
220.3m, notwithstanding high interest rates and the difficult economic
climate in Australia'. Yet, as the ASC notes, a month later the company's
share price had dropped to 35 cents - compared with ADollars 3.53 when the
results were announced - and Adsteam entered into an arrangement with its
bankers.

FT  22 APR 94 / Japanese coalition ends policy dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's fractious coalition parties last night reached a compromise over a
joint policy platform aimed at preventing a break-up of the government and
opening the way for them to nominate foreign minister Tsutomu Hata as prime
minister.
Coalition leaders said Mr Hata would be proposed at a meeting today as their
candidate for the premiership being vacated by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa. Mr
Hosokawa announced his resignation two weeks ago over allegations of
financial impropriety. A parliamentary vote is now likely next week.
The Social Democratic party, the largest member of the ruling coalition, had
threatened to leave the government because it could not accept binding
commitments to increase consumption tax and to prepare for possible economic
sanctions against North Korea. The threat was later withdrawn,
A rise in sales tax is seen as essential by the powerful Finance Ministry to
compensate for a decline in income tax revenue as the proportion of retired
people increases sharply over the next decade. Agreement on this would
enable the government to produce a permanent cut in income tax, as sought by
the US to increase demand for imports.
Coalition partners were also seeking ways to allow Japan to take part in
potential United Nations sanctions against North Korea without offending the
socialists' literal interpretation of Japan's pacifist constitution.
Discussion turned on whether or not Japan should consult China before
considering sanctions, as demanded by the socialists in an attempt to head
off the risk of Tokyo being drawn into any sanctions demanded by the US
outside the aegis of the UN. The state television network NHK reported that
the parties agreed that any new tax should 'have the understanding of the
people' and, on North Korea, that Japan should consult as needed with other
Asian countries.
Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party is seeking an accord on basic policies before
the new government takes office, an attempt to avoid the chaos of the
previous administration.
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, joint leader of the JRP and the government's backroom
strategist, has pushed hard for a clear set of common policies, giving the
public a rare taste of public debate on national issues. He is also believed
to be keen to split the far left away from the SDP and attract more
defectors to the coalition from the opposition Liberal Democratic party.
Last night Mr Hata compared the drawn-out, closed-door policy dispute to a
difficult childbirth. 'Although it's hard labour, the result is worth it,'
he was quoted as saying.

FT  22 APR 94 / UK-China act to contain HK property prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and China have acted to cool Hong Kong's overheated property market
by increasing the annual allocation of new land for residential and
commercial development, in a move which might presage the resumption of
Sino-British co-operation over the territory.
At a meeting of the Sino-British Land Commission, a bilateral body which
governs government land sales, the two agreed on a 35 per cent increase to
31.4 hectares in land for residential, commercial and industrial
development.
Rising property prices have been a main political issue in Hong Kong this
year. Chinese government officials and the Hong Kong government have seized
on it to underline their concern for the public's welfare.
Although few expect a dramatic improvement in Sino-British ties, the swift,
businesslike meeting of the Land Commission suggested a more positive tone
to bilateral discussions, something which has been visible in other contacts
as well.
This improvement comes at a time of heightened speculation that Mr Lu Ping,
Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs, is about to pay his first visit
to the colony since January 1992.
Property analysts said the announcement of the increased land allocation may
have the effect of restraining price rises in the short term, but they
doubted that it was sufficient to solve the supply problem in Hong Kong.
Governor Chris Patten said late last month that the steep rises in Hong Kong
property values, especially house prices, demanded 'exceptional' measures.
Action has been promised by July.
Over the past year the price of a 600 sq ft flat on the south side of Hong
Kong island has risen about 40 per cent to HKDollars 3.5m (Pounds 299,145)
from around HKDollars 2.5m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Governor Chris Patten, under increasing pressure to set up a human rights
commission in Hong Kong, maintained in the Legislative Council yesterday
that similar bodies elsewhere in the world were 'pretty toothless creatures'
but promised a decision by the end of June.
Mr Patten came under intense questioning about allegations of telephone
tapping. Last week a senior official who was dismissed from the Independent
Commission Against Corruption, Hong Kong's anti-corruption authority,
alleged that the commission had bugged telephones for political purposes. Mr
Patten denied these allegations.
Earlier in the day Amnesty International urged the government to set up a
body to receive complaints.
Mr Chris Avery, an Amnesty consultant, said: 'The report shows that people
in Hong Kong who feel their rights have been violated have nowhere to go.
There is no simple affordable complaints system in Hong Kong.'
The report follows a House of Commons select committee report on
Sino-British relations which advocated the formation of a human rights
commission. Last month Ms Anna Wu introduced a bill based on Australian
legislation.

Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation drew close to completing a
long-delayed agreement on Palestinian self-rule yesterday, but disputes over
Palestinian jurisdiction and economic relations continued to dog the peace
talks.
'We are at the beginning of the end, and we are trying to find a way how to
complete this great historic voyage of the Palestinian people and the
Israeli people,' Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said after
holding talks in the Romanian capital Bucharest with Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO
chairman.
Mr Arafat, while saying he 'hoped' the peace process was irreversible,
added: 'We are seeing the talks being protracted . . . Mr Peres has the
upper hand. He is the occupier. He has to decide if he is going to withdraw
or not. We hope he is going to implement what he agreed upon.'
When asked how soon agreement could be reached Mr Arafat said: 'We hope that
we can reach agreement in the next two to three weeks . . . we hope to
achieve concrete results when the talks in Cairo resume next week.'
Mr Peres said the main oustanding issue was agreeing the terms of the
'parallel' withdrawal of Israeli troops and the installation of the
Palestininian authorities. He said talks would continue in Washington as
well as Cairo. He again stressed Israel's commitment to achieving peace.
'Our government has decided to conclude negotiations and to respect the
Palestinian position.'
In Jerusalem, meanwhile, there was hope for progress on another front after
the Israeli prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, said he would be willing to
dismantle Jewish settlements in the Golan Heights for the sake of peace with
Syria.
Mr Rabin's remarks came a week before a trip to the region by the US
secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, who was expected to visit
Damascus and Jerusalem in an attempt to move talks forward on the Golan
issue. Syria has insisted on a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which
Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war, before any peace treaty is
signed.
In Cairo, both PLO and Israeli negotiators said they were on the brink of a
solution to the issue of the extent of jurisdiction Palestinian courts would
have over Israelis and foreigners in the self-rule areas.
Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, and General Amnon Shahak, his Israeli
counterpart, said the two sides could finish their work by the end of next
week's round of talks after months of slow-moving negotiations and delays.
'The big possibility is that we will finish next week and this will allow
for the agreement to be signed in the following week directly,' Mr Shaath
said.
In Paris, however, Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance minister, said talks
on economic relations between Israel and the future Palestinian economy had
run into 'serious problems'.
Mr Shochat said the PLO had raised new demands unacceptable to Israel on
imports and a Palestinian currency which had torpedoed hopes for the signing
of an economic agreement this week. The minister said the PLO had asked to
double the list of products which could enter the Palestinian economy at
customs duties lower than those levied by Israel.
A PLO negotiator accused Israel of preaching the economic philosophy of open
borders but insisting on rigid restrictions on the movement of labour and
agricultural products.
Before the final signing Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat are expected to negotiate
for two to three days to agree some sensitive political issues which touch
on Palestinian demands for attributes of statehood. These include passports,
postage stamps and possibly PLO demands for a separate currency.
In Bucharest, Mr Peres said he had spent much time calming Mr Arafat's fears
about many aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. He added that he
and Mr Arafat might join negotiators in Cairo next week to help push along
the last stage of negotiations.

<TEXT>
South Africa's right-wing Conservative party last night announced that it
would maintain its poll boycott, dashing hopes that all mainstream parties
might participate next week in the first all-race elections, write Michael
Holman and Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, CP leader, said that his party would not take part in
the elections as he had been unable to get satisfactory guarantees from the
African National Congress, which is expected to dominate the new government,
and the long-ruling National party on the creation of an Afrikaner
volkstaat.
He said that without solid constitutional guarantees, the CP had no option
but to follow an unspecified 'route of resistance'.
Meanwhile, the demise of the black 'homelands' continued yesterday as Mr
Nelson Ramadike, chief minister of Lebowa, was stripped of his powers by the
governing Transitional Executive Council and was removed from his position
on the African National Congress's official list of candidates for the
election.
The homeland administrations are scheduled to come under the administration
of the newly elected government at the end of the month but uncertainties
about salary and pension arrangements after April have provoked widespread
strikes, bringing many services to a standstill.

<TEXT>
'Nationalise the mines,' says the election manifesto. 'Take the country's
wealth out of minority hands and give it to the people.' The slogans may
have a contemporary ring in South Africa, but they come from a 1948 pamphlet
published by the National party in the year it came to power. Big business
panicked, realised the need for Afrikaner stakeholders in the private
sector, and rapidly sold off big chunks of the economy to Afrikaner
interests.
The process, which culminated in the purchase of General Mining, later
Gencor, one of the big gold mining houses, by an Afrikaner consortium proved
successful and the new government decided not to follow through with its
threats.
Now, with South Africa's first black government expected after elections
next week, the same slogans are being bandied around by the African National
Congress, and big business is trying to shape a similar response.
In the past year, the country's giant conglomerates have sold off The
Sowetan, the country's biggest daily newspaper, Metropolitan Life and
African Life, two life assurers, and Prima, a merchant bank now renamed
Miba, to black investors, all on favourable terms and often with generous
financing.
Now, to put the icing on the growing black corporate cake, Anglo American,
the country's most powerful corporation, has announced plans to sell control
of most of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, another of the big mining
houses, to black investors.
But while this profusion of deals testifies to the growing visibility of
black businessmen (there are few women), it is also symptomatic of their
continued weakness. Organisations such as the Black Management Forum, a
group helping identify and develop black managers for the private sector,
are expanding rapidly, but the pool of qualified, and wealthy, black people
who can be tapped for such initiatives remains small. Blacks still own fewer
than 5 per cent of shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and black
directors make up only 2 per cent of the total - although this compares with
  1/4 per cent five years ago.
Reflecting this, blue chip directorships tend to go to individuals with
relatively little direct business experience but good political contacts or
a high profile. Some, such as Mr Enos Mabuza, a former 'homeland' leader
with close ties to the ANC, are in the enviable position of being forced to
turn down board positions such has been the proliferation of offers.
The exact mechanism of the JCI transfer has yet to be announced. It is
estimated that black savings societies, companies and union pension funds
could raise at most R3bn (Pounds 560m) to finance the transaction, short of
a purchase price in the region of R5bn.
Even among unlisted businesses, black dominated sectors are few and largely
restricted to the black customer market, such as the minibus taxi sector or
black hair-care products. Such companies are also hampered by a lingering
suspicion about black managerial ability - even within the black community
itself.
'The main problem is that people don't want to buy shares in a black company
because they think it will go under,' says Mr Sam Mkhwanazi, a shareholder
in Methold, parent company of Metropolitan Life, South Africa's first
black-owned and black-run insurance company.
Gone are the days when owning shares was viewed as ideologically unsound by
blacks, under the influence of radical unions allied to the South African
Communist party. Still, says Dr Nthato Motlana, Methold chairman, 'the sale
of shares to black South Africans has never been easy' - and it is not easy
now.
'There is still a basic lack of trust in black skills and this will only
wear off with time,' says Mr Thami Mazwai, editor of Enterprise, a black
business magazine.
These perceptions are reinforced by recent media allegations of
mismanagement at companies such as National Sorghum Breweries, the country's
largest black-owned and black-run corporation.
Impressive recent growth of the National African Federated Chamber of
Commerce, the country's premier black business organisation, has brought its
membership to 150,000, but the majority of these are essentially one-man
shows such as taxis and shopkeepers.
Mr Archie Nkonyeni, Nafcoc president, estimates that, including the informal
sector, black-run enterprises account for only some R20bn in an economy with
a GDP of about R400bn, although they make up 75 per cent of the population.
One route being explored is joint ventures or franchising schemes with
foreign companies. Both the US government's Overseas Private Investment
Corporation and Nafcoc are seeking out American parents for black South
African business.
Already, companies such as Nike, Pepsi and Sun Microsystems have selected
black partners for their return to South Africa. Inevitably, however, most
of these schemes tend to enrich the same small group of prominent
businessmen as the only available blacks with the expertise.
'There is tremendous potential for black entrepreneurship,' asserts Prof
Wiseman Nkuhlu, President of the BMF. However, A recent World Bank study
notes that inadequate technical, administrative and managerial skills and
lack of access to financing are severely hampering further growth of
black-owned enterprises.
Aware of these constraints, the ANC has said that nurturing black business
is now one of its 'central economic strategies'. As a result, the new
government will be expected to redirect both small business development aid
and state contracts to black companies.
Indeed, the precedent of successful National party patronage for Afrikaner
business is widely recognised. Says Mr Nkonyeni: 'State assistance can be
very useful in empowering the black community - and there is still a very
long way to go before blacks are properly represented in the economy.'
For apartheid had a double impact: not only did it impede blacks from
entering the corporate world, it undermined their ability to succeed once
they got there. And worst of all, its legacy is likely to live on into the
new South Africa: prejudice against black companies will not disappear until
blacks prove that they can compete in what will remain a predominantly white
corporate world.

FT  22 APR 94 / Return of Portugal's capitalist families: The restoration of
the businesses that fell in the 'revolution of the carnations' 20 years ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty years ago men like Mr Ricardo Salgado Esprito Santo were depicted in
graffiti on the walls of Lisbon wearing top hats, smoking fat cigars and
clutching fistfuls of dollars. A large boot was usually drawn behind them
showing what the young army captains who seized power on April 25 1974
planned to do with the capitalists who had prospered under 48 years of
right-wing dictatorship.
The boot landed in 1975. Like other business leaders, the Esprito Santos,
the second largest of seven family groups that accounted for almost
three-quarters of Portugal's gross domestic product under the dictatorship
of Salazar and latterly Caetano, lost 95 per cent of their assets through
nationalisation. Long-haired commandos marched their patriarchs into jail.
Others fled into exile.
Two decades later, Mr Esprito Santo now appears on the glossy covers of
Portuguese business magazines and is respectfully interviewed on television.
Back as president of the bank wrested from his family for 17 years, he is
admired by a society that unashamedly prizes business success despite all
the efforts made during the 'revolution of the carnations' to bury
capitalist values.
Families such the Esprito Santos, the Mellos and the Champalimauds lost
almost everything, started afresh abroad and returned after making enough
money to buy back the companies that had been taken from them.
They have been welcomed back with open arms - but virtually no financial
compensation - by a government eager to stimulate private enterprise to help
Portugal compete in the single European market. Even the 'angry young
captains' who led the 1974 coup show little resentment.
'Personally, I would have liked to have seen Portugal evolve into a less
markedly capitalist society,' says Lt Col Vasco Lourenco, a hero of the
revolution. 'The patronage of the old regime enabled these businessmen to
flourish. But no stigma should be attached to them today because they are
competing on the same terms as everyone else.'
Mr Esprito Santo believes he has earned the endorsement. 'What most pleases
me about our return to Portugal is that we have proved we are true
entrepreneurs who can survive in a competitive international market without
the government protection we enjoyed before the revolution.'
The Salazar regime promoted a handful of powerful business families by
regulating which companies could operate in which sectors and closing the
country off to foreign investment. This oligarchy sheltered business groups
from competition but also prevented them from developing entrepreneurial
skills and a free-market mentality.
'It was only when we were forced to start again from scratch outside the
country that we learned what it takes to survive in an open market,' said Mr
Esprito Santo.
The centre-right government of Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, is
reversing the post-revolutionary nationalisations with a re-privatisation
programme that has already turned most of the financial sector over to
private owners and is now focusing on industrial companies.
'The alternatives to capitalism we put forward have clearly failed,' said
Col Lourenco, acknowledging the financial ruin that has beset many
nationalised companies.
Mr Lus Mira Amaral, industry minister, said: 'Portugal deeply wronged the
businessmen whose companies were taken over by the state. The right policy
would have been to allow the survival of the fittest by liberalising the
economy. We are happy they are returning. We need all the successful
businesses we can get.'
But there have been no special privileges. Mr Jose Manuel de Mello complains
that the prices of re-privatised companies are far in excess of what their
former owners were paid in compensation. They were awarded 28-year bonds,
widely described as 'wallpaper', paying 2.5 per cent interest when inflation
was running at 30 per cent. One former owner estimated the compensation
represented 2 per cent of the market value of his shares and many are still
fighting in the courts for what they consider just compensation.
Mr de Mello's family owned Companhia Uniao Fabril, an industrial
conglomerate of more than 100 companies that was broken up and largely
nationalised after the revolution. His survival raft was Lisnave, a
ship-repair yard that escaped state takeover. He is now lining up a Esc100bn
(Pounds 387m) bid for control of Banco Totta e Acores, a bank formerly owned
by his family but controlled by Banesto, the Spanish bank, since its
re-privatisation in 1989.
When soldiers with machine guns burst into a board meeting of Banco Esprito
Santo (BES) to arrest the directors on March 11 1975, the family owned the
bank, the insurance company Tranquilidade, shareholdings in many of
Portugal's leading companies and extensive coffee, sugar and cotton
plantations in Angola and Mozambique, then Portuguese colonies.
'We were left only with a few art objects and our homes, which we sold at
very low prices because they were threatened with occupation,' said Mr
Esprito Santo.
Mr Manuel Esprito Santo Silva, his cousin and then president of the group,
spent five months in jail, crammed in a cell with 14 others. He was
summarily tried for economic sabotage, acquitted and released. He died in
London, aged 57, before his family regained control of its bank and
insurance company.
The group's six senior partners went into exile, regrouping in Luxembourg
where they mustered Dollars 20,000 to set up Esprito Santo International
Holding. They founded a small bank in Brazil and raised capital on the
international bond market.
In 1986, Mr Mario Soares, Portugal's Socialist prime minister who is now
president, asked them back. Mr Soares said this spirit of forgiving, also
extended to the Pide, the political police of the former regime, had been
essential to Portugal's successful transition to democracy.
The Esprito Santos began again in Portugal by opening a small merchant bank
in partnership with France's Credit Agricole. They bought control of
Tranquilidade when it was re-privatised in 1989 and of BES in 1991,
re-establishing themselves as the country's leading financial family.
'The employees wanted us back and turned down the offer of a Spanish bank to
finance a management buy-out,' said Mr Esprito Santo. 'Our dedication is now
to our work, not to remembering the past.'

FT  22 APR 94 / Spanish PM tries to limit the damage
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
High-level corruption and financial misdemeanours appear set to keep the
centre-stage in Spanish politics. New parliamentary committees are being set
up to investigate party funding and the financial affairs of Mr Mariano
Rubio, the former governor of the Bank of Spain.
Facing acute embarrassment and pressure for heads to roll over the latest
controversies, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister, has tried to limit the
damage to the minority socialist government's reputation through a series of
new anti-corruption measures. These include establishment of a special
prosecutor's office, tougher penalties for offenders, and increased powers
for the audit tribunal, which monitors public sector accounts.
The scope of rules obliging senior officials to declare their personal
interests will also be widened.
At the end of an angry two-day state-of-the-nation debate on Wednesday, the
government narrowly avoided a special parliamentary investigation into the
so-called Filesa affair, involving alleged illegal contributions to party
funds through a group of companies in the late 1980s.
Instead, a parliamentary committee will investigate the funding of all
parties since 1979, when the first elections were held under Spain's current
democratic constitution.
A separate committee will look into the business dealings of Mr Mariano
Rubio, Bank of Spain governor from 1984 to 1992. He was interviewed by
prosecutors earlier this week about allegations that he channelled profits
from stock investments into a secret account hidden from the tax
authorities. Mr Rubio has said he was 'not aware' of holding a secret
account or cheating the taxman.
Another committee is already investigating Mr Lus Roldan, former head of the
paramilitary Civil Guard, in a controversy involving alleged commissions on
building contracts and payments from so-called 'reserved' funds. Parliament
voted on Wednesday to bring these reserved funds under its own control
rather than that of ministers.
The series of allegations and the government's belated response in proposing
a crackdown on corruption has put Mr Gonzalez clearly on the defensive. A
poll commissioned by El Mundo, the investigative anti-government daily which
published the latest allegations in the Rubio affair, showed yesterday that
almost 57 per cent of respondents considered him responsible and 46 per cent
thought he should resign.
A majority of almost 60 per cent, including a large proportion of Socialist
voters, sought the resignation of Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister at
the time Mr Rubio held office and now the leader of the Socialist
parliamentary group.

FT  22 APR 94 / Key French interest rate is trimmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France is showing signs of non-inflationary growth based on healthy economic
fundamentals, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said
yesterday.
However, he stressed that the government must stick to its policy of
reducing the public sector deficit. 'It is essential that the effort which
has been decided be effectively put in place year after year,' he said,
referring to the government's five-year plan to curb its deficit.
Mr Trichet was speaking after the central bank announced a reduction in the
intervention rate, the key short-term interest rate, by one-tenth of a
percentage point to 5.8 per cent. The 5-to-10 day borrowing rate was also
cut from 7 per cent to 6.75 per cent.
The moves were in line with the bank's strategy of gradually reducing
interest rates in tandem with falling German borrowing costs. On Wednesday
the Bundesbank cut its repo rate by 12 basis points to 5.58 per cent.
Investors and economists in Paris said that yesterday's cuts were the
minimum expected. But Mr Trichet warned against too rapid a reduction in
short term rates. 'A brutal reduction in short-term interest rates could
damage the economy,' he said. According to Mr Trichet, an excessive cut in
short-term rates would undermine the bank's objective of internal and
external monetary stability, putting upward pressure on longer term interest
rates. This would jeopardise investment and housing expenditure, both of
which were crucial for economic recovery, he said.
The modest cut disappointed some investors. The CAC-40 index of leading
shares on the Paris stock market slipped by 0.5 per cent to close at 2,091.
But some welcomed the move. 'It was not a big cut, but it shows that
exchange rate considerations have not been put above the needs of the real
economy,' said one currency economist.
The French franc, which this week fell below FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark, its
previous narrow band floor rate in the European exchange rate mechanism,
firmed after the announcement, closing at FFr3.4270 in London.
Mr Trichet emphasised that the level of the franc remained a central
consideration. 'The monetary policy committee (of the Bank of France) is
extremely attentive to the stability of the franc,' he said.
According to Mr Trichet, the economy's strong fundamentals are evident in
the inflation rate and the trade balance. Figures released yesterday by
Insee, the national economics statistics institute, confirmed that inflation
fell in March to an annual rate of 1.5 per cent. The trade balance
registered a surplus of FFr89bn (Pounds 10.42bn) last year which, Mr Trichet
said, reflected industry's competitiveness.
To ensure recovery, however, Mr Trichet said that efforts to curb government
spending must be maintained. He noted that France's public sector debt rose
to 44.2 per cent of gross domestic product in 1993, compared with 39.5 per
cent in 1992. 'This ratio is one of the lowest in Europe, but it is rising,'
he said.

FT  22 APR 94 / Nato faces air strike dilemma in Bosnia: Political and moral
pressure is mounting for western forces to bomb Serbs for defying UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, BRUCE CLARK and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Nato diplomats prepare to meet in Brussels to consider the latest
proposals from military experts and President Bill Clinton on air strikes in
Bosnia, they face a minefield of national and institutional sensitivities.
These sensitivities have to be balanced against revulsion over the Serb
attack on Gorazde and political pressure for concrete military action.
Among European countries such as Britain and France, who have contributed
ground forces to the UN effort in Bosnia, there is lingering nervousness
about Washington's intentions.
Any suggestion of a broad air attack on the Serbs, which dropped all
pretence of neutrality in the conflict, will be viewed with deep alarm by
Washington's European allies.
Greece and Canada have always had considerable reservations about air
strikes and these are to some extent shared by Germany, which is conscious
of the danger of alienating Russia.
However, there was relief among European governments on Wednesday night when
President Clinton's televised statement on Bosnia focused heavily on
existing mandates, notably the UN security council's resolution 836.
That resolution, approved last June, cleared the way for the use of force,
including air power, to protect six 'safe areas' of Bosnia: Sarajevo,
Gorazde, Srebrenica, Zepa, Tuzla and Bihac.
Technically, the air strikes carried out near Gorazde 10 days ago were
intended to protect UN personnel, as opposed to shoring up the safe haven.
Neither purpose was achieved.
Mr Clinton says he wants to extend to the other five areas the 'Sarajevo
approach' - a combination of threats and diplomacy that was used in February
to bring a truce to the Bosnian capital.
In Srebrenica, and more recently Gorazde, the Serbs have established such a
tight stranglehold that the term 'safe haven' has become meaningless.
Establishing those places as fully-fledged havens would mean extracting a
huge concession from the Serbs, whose will to fight and anti-aircraft
capacity has been underestimated by the west.
However, the main western governments seem to agree that the political and
moral pressure for an escalation of air strikes is now unstoppable, and they
 -as well Nato's secretariat - are determined that in military terms, any
operations should be carried out professionally.
In practice, this means giving Nato some flexibility in deciding which
weaponry constitutes a threat to the safe areas and therefore in selecting
targets.
'The UN will have to determine the overall mandate, but we in Nato will
determine how we will do it militarily,' commented one official in Brussels.
Nato has not always acted as a mere executor of UN instructions, as
diplomats point out. In February, the 10-day deadline for the removal of
heavy weapons from Sarajevo was determined by the alliance, not the UN.
There is resistance in Brussels to the idea of taking detailed instructions
from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, or other
'bureaucrats' in New York.
However, Britain and France will both insist on close co-ordination with UN
military commanders on the ground.
One Nato diplomat said: 'There needs to be unity of command and control
between the UN ground forces and Nato.
'The procedure must be better than in the past. That does not mean we want
to control the whole thing.
'But there must be more flexibility as far as our objectives are concerned,
and they must not be limited to what Mr Boutros Ghali is asking us to do.'
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said yesterday that more air
strikes made little sense unless they were part of a political plan.
'However determined we are to use air power there is no lasting solution
unless it is political,' Mr Juppe said. 'An air strike only makes sense if
its is carried out as part of a political plan, as in Sarajevo. We must
pursue the diplomatic route and accelerate it.'
Other members of the French government are thought to harbour even greater
reservations than Mr Juppe about the use of air power, and there is an
instinctive suspicion in Paris at the idea of handing too much power to
Nato's military structure.
France is also stressing the need to keep US, European and Russian policy in
as close harmony as possible.

The L2,000bn (Pounds 833m) grain and property empire of Mr Pasquale Casillo
was yesterday seized by magistrates after the Foggia-based businessman was
arrested on charges of links with organised crime and defrauding the
European Union.
Mr Casillo, chairman of Foggia football club, is alleged to have cheated the
EU of some L300bn. This is believed to be the biggest single charge brought
against an individual for such an offence. His arrest apparently followed
information supplied by members of the Camorra, the Naples Mafia, which
earlier this week led to the arrest of the former head of the Naples police
and other senior policemen.

Greece yesterday expelled a second Albanian diplomat after a meeting of
public order ministry officials failed to resolve increasing tensions
between the two countries. The officials had met to discuss last week's
cross-border raid on a military camp in southern Albania, in which two
Albanian soldiers were killed. The Albanian officials claimed that Greek
commandos were responsible; their Greek counterparts denied the charge and
accused Tirane of stepping up human rights abuses against the ethnic Greek
minority in southern Albania. The official Athens News Agency said three
senior members of the ethnic Greek political movement Omonia had been
arrested and charged with 'anti-constitutional activity.'
The Greek and Albanian foreign ministers, Mr Karolos Papoulias and Mr Alfred
Serreqi, have agreed to meet on May 3 in Zurich to try to improve relations.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The committee of ministers of the Council of Europe, the 32-nation forum for
human rights and democracy, voted in Strasbourg yesterday to create a new
permanent Court of Human Rights. The present two-tier system of a European
Commission of Human Rights and a 17-judge Court has been heavily criticised
as cumbersome and inefficient. Individuals have first to satisfy the
Commission they have an arguable case before being allowed access to the
Court.
In future all individuals will have direct access to the new court which
will normally sit in chambers of seven judges. Only in exceptional cases
will the court sit as a grand chamber of 17 judges. Clearly unfounded cases
will be dealt with by committees of three judges. The committee of ministers
will retain its role of ensuring that governments comply with the Court's
judgments. The change should speed up the handling of cases; under the
present system few are resolved in less than five years.

Turkey is negotiating with the International Monetary Fund for a standby
facility to help underpin its recently unveiled austerity programme, a
senior Turkish official confirmed in London yesterday. Mr Emre Gonensay,
senior adviser to President Suleyman Demirel, said Ankara's financing
request from the Fund 'was of the order of Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 820m).' He
also confirmed that Turkey is talking to several US banks about a possible
club loan.
A senior treasury official said that, following an IMF mission expected in
Ankara next week, a letter of intent could be signed by the end of May
paving the way for Turkey to return to the commercial debt markets. The
country needs Dollars 4.5bn just to repay maturing debt in 1994. Total debt
now stands at Dollars 66bn. Turkey borrowed around Pounds 4bn in 1993, all
of it in the bond markets. Officials yesterday ruled out an early return to
the bond markets until the IMF facility was in place.

All the main political parties in the German parliament yesterday agreed on
the need for tougher restrictions on the import of British beef, including
if necessary a unilateral import ban, in order to curb the spread of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The ban demanded by a meeting of
agricultural and health experts in the governing Christian Democratic Union
would affect any animals more than three years old.
Mr Peter Hintze, CDU secretary-general, said Germany would be calling for
such a ban at the EU farm ministers' meeting in Brussels next week. If there
was no agreement, 'in an emergency an import ban will have to be put into
effect by Germany unilaterally'. Mr Horst Seehofer, health minister, said he
had already ordered further measures to prevent any human exposure to BSE,
including a ban on the use of any cattle parts or beef from the UK in
children's food products, and the registration of any cattle imported from
the UK since 1986.

FT  22 APR 94 / Eurocorps aims outside region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurocorps, the newly-formed army group with divisions from France, Germany
and Belgium, will provide rapid reaction forces for Europe even beyond EU
boundaries. Lieutenant General Helmut Willmann, its commander, said
yesterday it would provide rapid deployment forces outside the central
European area once German constitutional difficulties had been resolved.
This would be in addition to its role of defending continental Europe.
Eurocorps currently has 650 main battle tanks and 50,000 troops. At present
it would have to use transport aircraft such as the Hercules for its rapid
deployment forces. However, it is, thought keen to use the Future Large
Aircraft (FLA), a bigger military transport being designed by a European
consortium. The endorsement will come as a boost to the consortium, which is
facing an uphill battle in Britain. The Royal Air Force has to choose
between ordering the new generation of Hercules C-130J aircraft, and
refurbishing its existing fleet while waiting for the FLA. British
Aerospace, part of the FLA consortium, argues that Britain will lose its
position as sole wing manufacturer for such European projects if the RAF
chooses the US Hercules.

Italian gross domestic product rose by 0.3 per cent year-on-year in the
fourth quarter of 1993, the first rise for more than a year, the Istat
national statistics institute said yesterday. Industrial sales rose 5.7 per
cent year-on-year in December. The figures 'point to a technical end to
recession,' said Mr Giuseppe Abbotto, economist with Fimat Futures in Milan.
The IMF this week predicted Italy's economy would grow by 1.1 per cent this
year and 2.5 per cent in 1995, after a 0.7 per cent decline last year.
Dutch unemployment in the first quarter surged to 520,000, a nine-year high
and 33 per cent above a year earlier.
France's consumer price index rose 0.2% in March after a 0.3% rise in
February, the National Statistics Institute, Insee, said yesterday.
Annual inflation in the European Union was 3.2 per cent in March, down
slightly from 3.3 per cent in February, according to figures released today
by Eurostat, the EU statistical office.
House building in France continued to pick up in the first quarter to 81,900
housing starts, up 18.7 per cent on the same period in 1993, the French
Housing Ministry said yesterday.

Members of a Norwegian medical unit left Sarajevo airport yesterday as part
of a United Nations convoy of 100 troops and 40 medical staff heading for
the besieged Bosnian Moslem enclave around Gorazde, only to be blocked by a
crowd of Serb women demonstrators. In Gorazde itself Serb forces continued
to shell the town, including a makeshift hospital, where about 20 people
were killed, Our Foreign Staff reports.
In Washington, the US yesterday proclaimed its 'strategic interest' in
containing the Bosnian war. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state,
said the US wanted to stop conflict from reigniting in Croatia or starting
in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. 'We have a strategic interest
in preventing that war from spreading,' he told Congress, voicing confidence
that European allies would back escalating air strikes when they confer in
Brussels.
In Gorazde 450 people have been killed and 1,500 injured since last month
when Serb forces began their assault.
Bosnia's prime minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, said the town's Moslem
defenders faced Serb demands that they abandon their remaining pockets of
resistance on the right bank of the town, where the hospital is located. But
local radio stations said the defenders would not surrender.
There were reports last night of hand-to-hand fighting in the town.
UN officials yesterday feared for the fate of 13 UN and humanitarian workers
trapped in Gorazde.

<TEXT>
Mr Oleg Soskovets, Russian deputy prime minister, yesterday floated the idea
of forcing banks to invest a fixed percentage of their profits in the
country's investment-starved industry. He told a banking conference that one
idea was to compel banks to sell 50 per cent of their profits from
'speculative' hard currency operations to the state. He gave no details,
although this would only generate a profit if the banks were not paid the
full market rate or were not paid on time.
The proposal, which was dismissed by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, central bank
chairman, as unlikely to work, provided the latest evidence of the
government's mixed instincts on market reform. Until now, it has talked of
the need for tax incentives and lower inflation to encourage capital
investment. At the same time, it has been discouraging investment through
frequent tax increases and changes in legislation.

The US yesterday proclaimed its 'strategic interest' in containing the
Bosnian war as a fresh attack on the hospital in the enclave of Gorazde
killed about 20 people.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, told Congress that the
United States wanted to stop conflict from reigniting in Croatia or starting
in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
'We have a strategic interest in preventing that war from spreading,' he
told Congress, voicing confidence that European allies would back the idea
of escalating air strikes when they confer in Brussels.
In the past, US officials have expressed conflicting views on whether their
country's vital interests are at stake in the Bosnian conflict.
For the second day running, Serb shells crashed into a makeshift hospital
building. A local team for Medecins Sans Frontieres put the death toll at
20, including some local doctors. However Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime
minister, said the town's Moslem defenders faced Serb demands that they
abandon their remaining pockets of resistance on the right bank of the town,
where the hospital is located. But local radio stations said the defenders
would not surrender.
UN officials yesterday feared for 13 UN and humanitarian workers trapped in
Gorazde. 'They are unarmed civilians there on behalf of the international
community,' said Miss Lyndall Sachs, of the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees.
Angry Serb women blocked a convoy of 100 UN soldiers and 40 medical
personnel which yesterday left Sarajevo for Gorazde, where 450 people have
been killed and 1,500 injured since last month when Serb forces began their
assault.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday reiterated claims that
the city was mostly Serb.

FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds Pounds 1.8bn bid for C&amp;G may cut home loan costs:
Bank's shares rise sharply - Building society members set to gain at least
Pounds 500 each
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Bank yesterday made a Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society in a move that could spark sharply increased
competition to sell mortgages in the UK, and lead to a restructuring of the
financial services industry.
The bid, the first attempt by the UK's fourth largest bank to make an
acquisition since the failure of its attempt to take over Midland Bank two
years ago, would reward the society's 1.4m members with a minimum cash
payment of Pounds 500 each.
Lloyds' shares rose sharply after it disclosed the offer, closing 48p up at
585p. Shares of Abbey National, the biggest mortgage lender last year,
dropped by 17.5p to 446.5p on the prospect of fiercer competition.
The bid would create the fourth largest mortgage lender in the UK, supplying
7 per cent of the home mortgage market, if it is approved by the society's
members. Lloyds would pay the cash to them in the second quarter of next
year.
The bid will have to be tested in the High Court because the Building
Societies Commission, regulator of the UK's 84 societies, has issued
guidance casting doubt on whether a third party can make payments to a
society's members, and whether relatively new members are entitled to a
share of the cash.
A Lloyds acquisition of C&amp;G, which is the sixth largest society with assets
of Pounds 17.7bn, would provide the biggest shake-up in the mortgage lending
industry since the public flotation of Abbey National in 1988.
It follows the failed attempt to merge Leeds Permanent and National &amp;
Provincial Building Society last year, which was prompted by consolidation
of the retail financial services industry amid flat mortgage demand.
In an effort to preclude a rival bid, Lloyds has agreed with C&amp;G that the
board will not put any other offer to its members for an undisclosed period.
The full terms will be disclosed in a transfer statement this October.
The bid follows prolonged speculation in the banking industry over whether
Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, who is due to retire next year,
would use the bank's growing capital to finance an acquisition.
Mr Pitman said Lloyds would not be able to make a further cash bid of a
similar size, but he did not rule out using shares to make another
acquisition.
He said demand for loans was likely to remain subdued and banks and
societies would compete strongly.
Under the proposed deal, C&amp;G will retain its own board and act as a separate
subsidiary of Lloyds. It will sell its own mortgages, and design mortgages
for Lloyds to sell in its own name.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G's chief executive, will join Lloyds' board, along
with the society's chairman Mr John Bays. Lloyds will nominate two
non-executive directors to C&amp;G's board but will not exert executive control.
C&amp;G approached Lloyds in late October through its adviser, the US bank JP
Morgan, which it had hired 15 months ago to work on options including
flotation. Among other banks which expressed interest was Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Other large building societies said the deal made sense from the point of
view of both organisations, but some executives were sceptical about the
commitment not to close any branches or lose any jobs.
The cash payments to C&amp;G's members will include even those who are unable to
vote, and will give the greatest rewards to those with the largest
investments, subject to a maximum of Pounds 10,000 for any one account.

FT  22 APR 94 / Strong retail sales dash hopes of early reduction in rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong growth in UK retail sales in March was yesterday seen as further
evidence of a buoyant economic recovery, reducing the chance of an early cut
in base rates.
The volume of retail sales grew by 0.8 per cent between February and March,
compared with market expectations of a 0.3 per cent rise. February's monthly
fall in sales was revised to 0.3 per cent, from the 0.5 per cent reported
earlier. The changes mean retail sales in March were 3.8 per cent higher
than a year earlier, against a revised figure of 2.8 per cent for February.
The figures follow the decline in unemployment, announced on Wednesday, and
an upbeat survey from the British Chambers of Commerce. Mr John Major, the
prime minister, told parliament that 'we are poised for a long period of
sustained, non-inflationary growth'.
However, the strength of the economy appeared to make it less likely that Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, would agree to a further cut in base rates.
'Combined with the other recent signs of robust recovery - manufacturing
output, unemployment, business surveys - and the upward revision to average
earnings growth in January and February, these figures mean that an early
base rate cut is effectively ruled out,' said Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist
at James Capel.
The figures came as something of a surprise after the Confederation of
British Industry published a downbeat survey of the distributive trades
sector earlier this week. This indicated annual retail sales growth in March
was slow, as it had been in February.
Analysts said that Easter, which straddled March and April this year, may
have distorted the seasonal adjustment of the official figures. This may
mean that sales will fall back this month when, in addition, the tax
increases take effect.
Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium,
said: 'The CSO results confirmed our views that March was an excellent month
for retail sales. Trading was better than might have been expected in the
light of pending tax increases.'

FT  22 APR 94 / Ford plans biggest shake-up in its history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford of the US, the world's second largest vehicle maker, unveiled plans
yesterday for a sweeping restructuring of its global organisation.
It is planning to merge its European and North American automotive
operations and its automotive components group into a single operating unit,
Ford Automotive Operations (FAO).
In a radical attempt to break down traditional national and regional
barriers, it is setting up five vehicle programme centres (VPCs), one in
Europe and four in the US, in an attempt to regain a competitive edge over
its rivals.
Each will have worldwide responsibility for the design, development and
engineering of particular vehicle ranges - in the case of Europe for small
and medium-sized front-wheel-drive cars.
Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive, said Ford would move to a
single set of worldwide processes and systems in its product development,
manufacturing, purchasing and sales and marketing activities. According to
Mr Robert Transou, who is to become group vice-president for manufacturing,
part of the reason for the restructuring, the most radical in Ford's 91-year
history, was that 'GM was outperforming Ford in Europe; Chrysler was
outperforming us in North America - that's simply unacceptable'.
Mr Trotman said the simplification of engineering, purchasing, and technical
and other processes would 'substantially reduce the cost of operating the
automotive business', and could lead to cost savings of at least Dollars
2bn-Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.3bn-Pounds 2bn) a year by the end of the decade.
Ford is seeking to eliminate the costly duplication of effort and the waste
of resources that have allowed it in the past to develop similar cars,
engines and transmissions in parallel in North America and in Europe.
It is seeking to capture the economies of scale enjoyed by powerful rivals
such as Toyota, the Japanese carmaker, which essentially design and engineer
a car such as the Toyota Corolla once for the world market.
Mr Trotman said that for the time being Ford's Asia Pacific and Latin
American operations would remain separate. In both regions, it has complex
relations with other carmakers, with Mazda in Asia and with Volkswagen in
Latin America. 'Integrating North America, Europe and the components group
is a big enough task,' Ford said. 'We thought we should complete this first
phase before moving to Latin America and Asia.
The single Ford Automotive Operations unit is to become operational on
January 1, but there would be 'a continuing integration over the next few
years'.
Ford's Europe-based engineering operation has been assigned responsibility
for small and medium-sized front-wheel-drive cars in the size of the Fiesta,
Escort and Mondeo models together with any future derivatives, such as a
smaller minicar.
Based in the US, the other four vehicle programme centres will be
responsible worldwide for large front wheel drive cars, for rear-wheel-drive
cars including Jaguar, for personal use trucks and for commercial trucks.
Jaguar now would be better able to draw on US expertise in large cars, said
Ford, but Jaguar's Coventry development centre would be unaffected in the
'short to medium term'.
Jaguar and Aston Martin would remain corporate entities.
Mr Trotman refused to be drawn on where job losses might occur, except to
acknowledge that there would almost certainly be cuts in Ford's central
support staffs.
Mr Ed Hagenlocker, who has been heading North American automotive
operations, becomes president of Ford Automotive Operations, reporting
directly to Mr Trotman.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Electrolux sells US associate
for Dollars 114m

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Electrolux, the Swedish electrical appliance maker, has sold its US-based
asphalt machinery-making associate Blaw Knox Construction Equipment Corp to
Clark Equipment Corp for about Dollars 114m, agencies report from Stockholm.
The sale generated a capital gain of Dollars 94m for Electrolux, but
write-offs of goodwill of SKr820m (Dollars 104m) mean that it will take a
net charge of SKr80m for the sale in its 1994 accounts.
'The divestment of Blaw Knox will strengthen the group's financial position
and is in line with our strategy of streamlining the group's operations and
concentrating resources in our core areas,' said Mr Leif Johansson, the
chief executive.
Leif Hoegh, a Norwegian shipowner, reported a sharp decline in first-quarter
net profit to NKr67m (Dollars 9m) from NKr117m in the same period last year,
and forecast a weaker result for the year as a whole, writes Karen Fossli in
Oslo.
The shipowner said the results were not directly comparable, as Bona
Shipping, a unit in which the shipowner holds a 42 per cent stake, is no
longer consolidated into accounts while Cool Carriers, in which it holds a
37.5 per cent stake, is.
Hoegh suffered weaker markets in several of its shipping segments, reduced
its car carrier fleet and experienced routine drydocking of liner vessels.
Freight revenue rose to NKr1.01bn from NKr608m, while operating profit
plunged to NKr47m from NKr101m. Pre-tax profit fell to NKr93m from NKr163.
The shipowner forecast 1994 profit, after financial items, of NKr300m
against NKr385m in 1993.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Pirelli cuts loss to L96bn and
sees profit for 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group, yesterday reported that its net
losses narrowed in 1993 to L96bn (Dollars 57m), compared with L154bn of
losses in 1992, and reinforced its earlier forecasts of a return to net
profit in 1994.
The more positive attitude at Pirelli follows three years of net losses, and
more than two years of painful restructuring. In 1992-93, Pirelli set aside
L550bn to pay for rationalisation, including 10,000 redundancies and the
shedding of one of its three divisions.
Yesterday's statement said the return to profit would still depend on the
level of recovery in the company's principal market, but the group reported
that it was making profits at operating level - L32bn in 1993, compared with
a loss of L93bn in 1992. Group sales in 1993 rose 12 per cent to L9,210bn
compared with L8,252bn.
The group was pushed into net loss last year by extraordinary charges of
L128bn. That included the extraordinary profit on last April's sale of
Pirelli's 33.4 per cent stake in Continental, its German rival, which was
not enough to offset restructuring provisions. At the time, the profit on
the Continental sale was estimated at L140bn, but Pirelli did not break down
the extraordinary items into individual gains and losses yesterday. The
group expects provisions over the last two years to cover all foreseeable
restructuring.
Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli's managing director, first expressed
his optimism about a profitable 1994 at the end of March when the company
announced plans to raise L1,000bn for expansion, through a convertible
debenture loan.
Shareholders will vote on those plans at their annual meeting on May 25.

FT  21 APR 94 / Taylor takes Barclays into the reform club: Revolution at UK
banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief executive, yesterday stamped his
presence on the UK's largest bank by breaking up its divisional structure
and replacing it with a set of management groups reporting directly to him.
His reforms, including the creation of a group offering services to large
companies, reduce the influence of Mr Alastair Robinson, head of the former
banking division, who was a leading contender to be chief executive.
Mr Taylor said Mr Robinson's role was 'being nibbled away in the sense that
the job he is doing ceases to exist.' His skills would be used in other
ways.
The reforms, which Mr Taylor described as a first step, created groups
covering big companies and European retail banking. The new group for UK
retail banking will report to Mr Taylor for the first time. He hopes to
spend more time observing operating businesses, and less on tasks such as
supervising 'a zillion central departments' and chairing executive committee
meetings at Barclays' head office.
Although Mr Taylor played down the significance of his decision to 'move
marbles from one jar to another', Barclays' reorganisation contributes to a
gradual but revolutionary change in the industry.
Since the last century and the regional bank mergers that culminated in the
'big four', Barclays, National Westminster, Lloyds and Midland have been
hard to tell apart. They have been run by bankers who worked their way up
through the lending hierarchy, emerging from the same mould.
As a result, the banks have tended to adopt similar lending policies; they
have made a poor job of managing investment banking arms; and they moved in
a herd into new markets without analysing them well.
Mr Brian Pitman's emphasis at Lloyds on judging all operations by the
yardstick of return on equity has now gained universal acceptance among UK
banks.
Mr Taylor's proposed reforms address two other issues with which the
clearing banks have struggled. The first is how to respond to the growing
tendency of large and medium-sized businesses to raise money on capital
markets; the second is the need to improve the standard of management.
Yesterday's move mainly dealt with the first point, but was intended to
allow him to see more clearly how to achieve the second. He ended the split
between the two large divisions covering investment banking and commercial
banking, creating a new group covering all services to large companies.
He explained this as 'trying to use all the organisational string and
plaster I can' to make sure that lending bankers co-operate with those
offering services such as securities custody, cash handling and equity
underwriting.
Each of the big four now has a different approach to this conundrum. NatWest
put corporate lending within investment banking; Midland divided the two
after trying to combine them three years ago in a similar group to that
proposed at Barclays; Lloyds does not have an investment banking arm.
Mr Keith Whitson, Midland's chief executive says that HSBC abolished the
Midland Montagu group, which combined lending to large companies with
broking, because it was hard to combine the cultures. Lending bankers wanted
to develop relationships, while brokers were driven by single transactions.
Mr Whitson says Midland preserves the divide between the functions but
brings teams of specialists together. It also emphasises that it will not
tolerate disputes. 'Debates on how to divide the fees may arise
occasionally, but we hit them on the head very hard,' he says.
NatWest placed corporate banking within its investment bank NatWest Markets
18 months ago. This was part of changes by its new management, which
included creating a new group head office to which its four divisions
report.
Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest chief executive, argues that the split between the
head office and operating arms - which Mr Taylor says he may implement at
Barclays - is vital in imposing discipline. It also encourages managers at
the centre to plan strategy and allocate capital among operations better.
'There was always a view before that the headquarters was essentially part
of the clearing bank, which was going to struggle to understand other parts
of the business,' he says. Mr Wanless says it was important to recruit some
executives from outside banking.
Mr Taylor expressed similar thoughts yesterday: 'It may well be that at some
stage we will need to refresh the group by bringing in people at the
centre.' Such refreshment is likely to reinforce the process by which the
big four are slowly becoming easier to distinguish.

FT  21 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: City Site deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glasgow-based property group City Site Estates rose 10 to 80p after UK
Active Fund, the investment group which recently led the successful
refinancing of Greycoat, took a near 10 per cent stake.
The 1.5m shares were part of the 2.229m - 14.5 per cent of the shares - sold
by Scottish Provident, the remainder being placed with institutions by James
Capel, City Site's broker, which crossed the bulk of the shares at 62p.
Capel is forecasting a rise in the group's net asset value from 32p to
approaching 100p this year. In January, City Site reported a return to
profits for the first time since 1989.
There were some big casualties in the composite insurance sector. Dealers
fretted about the impact on big financial institutions of the retreat by
international bond and equity markets since the US Federal Reserve embarked
on its tightening of monetary policy in February.
The whole of the sector was hit yesterday but the keenest action in the
market was in General Accident, whose shares dropped to 594p before settling
a net 23 off at 599p. The slide came after what was described as a split
selling order - when a broker's simultaneous dealings with a number of
marketmakers was seen as a bearish signal. Turnover was a relatively heavy
1.2m shares. Elsewhere, Commercial Union lost 11 to 590p, Royals 10 to 264p
and Sun Alliance 12 to 323p.
Merchant banks also suffered from similar concerns. SG Warburg, one of the
biggest and most influential bond traders in London, and badly affected on
Tuesday by a BZW downgrade, were hammered again after talk of a broker sell
recommendation. Warburg shares slumped 48 to 690p. Hambros lost 13 to 365p
and Schroders 10 to 1215p. Kleinwort Benson eased 7 to 465p.
In the clearing banks Barclays slipped 6 to 516p and HSBC 12 to 745p while
Lloyds edged up 2 to 537p after UBS recommended switching into the last
named. There was also talk that James Capel had taken HSBC, its parent, off
its global buy list.
There was speculation that HSBC was about to launch a 240p a share bid for
Hogg Group, the insurance broker where it recently built up a 7.3 per cent
stake; Hogg rose 2 to 224p.
Favourable US comment on Merck, the leading pharmaceuticals group, hit
Zeneca whose shares fell 15 to 687p, the first time they have been below
700p since last August. The comment focused on Merck's heart drug and led to
some competition concerns for Zeneca's hypertension treatment, Zestril.
Zeneca also suffered in line with weak international stocks which all
slipped in response to a weak Wall Street.
Wellcome lost 13 to 514p, in spite of the potential boost from a series of
company presentations to Scottish investors. But Glaxo held steady at 564p,
although some dealers suggested the threat to its anti-ulcer treatment,
Zantac, from Ciba Geigy would not go away. Hoare Govett, a former supporter
of the company, now believes that sales of the headline product will
experience a 40 per cent annual decline in the US once it comes off patent
at then end of next year.
The overseas effect also overhung Reed International whose shares shrugged
off the effect of a positive annual meeting to shed 5 at 833p.
Pearson held steady at 654p ahead of its seminar on Monday, while Reuters
Holdings added 3 1/2 to 489p ahead of its presentation to analysts in Geneva
early next week.
Some speculation moved in the market that Eurotunnel will make a surprise
launch of its rights issue today in tandem with the company's annual
announcement.
The middle of May has been widely tipped as the date for the rights issue
and one transport analyst was quick to discount the idea that Eurotunnel
will move any earlier as 'extremely unlikely'. The shares lost 20 to 476p.
Bryant Group, the upmarket housebuilding company, was the pick of the
construction stocks, the shares racing up 6 to 164p, following upgrades from
two of the leading broking houses, Kleinwort Benson and NatWest Securities.
Vodafone closed 4 higher at 500p after NatWest said the stock had been
oversold.
Allied Lyons steadied in a weak drinks sector, off a penny at 576p, as
Kleinwort Benson reiterated its positive stance.
There was continued bid speculation around Laura Ashley, the shares buoyed
up 6 to 86p. The two names being linked with the upmarket women's clothes
and furnishings group, Next and Sears, slipped 2 to 236p and a half to 124p,
respectively. Cash-rich Great Universal Stores, off a penny at 603p, was
another potential bidder being mooted.
Continued strength in Dorling Kindersley, the publisher, reflected gathering
bid speculation over the company which came to the market almost two years
ago. Analysts said the group might appear expensive but the recent hefty
premium paid for Software Toolworks of the US had redefined the appetite for
groups with a multi-media tag. The shares closed 2 up at 280p.
Fears that next month's results from USAir will disappoint helped to drag
down the shares of British Airways, which has a large stake in the US
airline. The price tumbled 10 to 406p in turnover of 2.6m.

FT  21 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo rises on bid hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTINE BUCKLEY, CHRIS PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil share sector, one of the market's best performers in recent weeks as
the oil price has topped Dollars 15 a barrel, remained the centre of
attention as dealers picked up hints that a bid for Lasmo may be in the
offing. Elf, the French oil group, was once again identified as a potential
bidder.
Lasmo shares performed well, against the market trend, throughout the
session, but suddenly moved sharply higher in mid-afternoon following a big
buy out of the money May 154 call options, said to have been carried out by
one of the big French-owned stockbrokers in the City.
News of the option market trade saw Lasmo shares spurt from 141p to 146p
within seconds. Subsequent profit-taking caused the shares to drift off to
close a net 5 higher at 141p. The 'new' nil-paid shares jumped to 38p before
settling 6 higher at 37p. Significantly, turnover in Lasmo 'old' and 'new'
shares expanded as the takeover stories did the rounds. Lasmo old traded
9.3m shares and the new 4.3m. turnover in the options market was the
equivalent of 2.3m shares.
Dealers noted strong transatlantic buying of Lasmo shares last week as the
stock traded ex the Pounds 219m rights issue.

FT  21 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nervousness again pervaded stock index futures which dragged down the cash
market as the June contract dipped below the psychologically important 3,100
level, writes Christine Buckley.
Although the June contract on the FT-SE 100 began trading firmly and climbed
to its intraday high of 3,156 early in the session, sentiment proved weak
for the rest of the day.
One derivatives specialist blamed a high level of proprietary trading and
panic selling for the volatility which is seeming to defy reason.
Curiously, selling of the contract set in shortly after the small cut in the
German repo rate was announced. Then the higher than expected rise in
average earnings sent June heading south fast to fall below 3,100.
'It is almost as though people have given up thinking,' said the specialist.
June struggled with the 3,100 mark throughout the session, constantly
slipping beneath it. Its lowest point was 3,092 and it closed at 3,094 with
a pick-up in turnover on recent sessions to reach 16,378 contracts.
Options were steady with 36,948 lots traded.
In a fast market, which has affected futures trading recently, all
operations of Liffe - including the clearing house system - operate as
usual, except screen prices are not firm.

FT  21 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hopes for base rate cut upset by
earnings data - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in the bond market, following news of a sharp rise in average
earnings in the UK, cast fresh clouds over base rate hopes and helped drive
the UK stock market down below the FT-SE 3,100 mark yesterday. A rally in
mid-afternoon was reversed when Wall Street came in lower behind a nervous
Federal bond market.
Share prices opened firmly and made further ground in early trading after
the news that rates had been trimmed by 12 basis points at the Bundesbank
repo tender. Even at that stage, confidence was checked by the refusal of
bond markets across Europe to respond favourably to the German move.
But London share prices tumbled when gilt-edged securities fell on the
release of the lastest statistics on average earnings, unit wage costs and
unemployment. The underlying rise of 3.5 per cent in average earnings in
February, together with a 1.8 per cent gain in unit wage costs for the three
months to February, dealt a further blow to hopes for the cut in UK base
rates still sought by many analysts.
Share prices quickly fell away behind the June stock index future but,
although the future contract briefly pierced the 3,100 mark, the underlying
market rallied just above this support level.
The respite lasted over the lunchtime pause but selling resumed when New
York opened on the downswing to show a fall of 14 Dow points in UK trading
hours. Traders said that the more significant pressure on sentiment came
from the absence of a recovery in US Federal Bonds. Markets remain nervous
of a further tightening of credit policy by the Federal Reserve, perhaps
after next week's meeting of G7 ministers.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,098.3, with a net loss on the day
of 29.7 points. Equity chartists now see little support before the 3,060
area unless there is a move on base rates. Analysts expressed some
nervousness ahead of this morning's announcement of domestic retail sales
for March, which will flesh out the report from the Confederation of British
Industries this week that retail sales appeared to be slowing down. At the
time, this was seen as encouraging for a hopes of a base rate cut but, in
the light of yesterday's average earnings data, might now be received less
favourably.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 23.3 to 3,782.6 as profit-takers moved in on
the cyclical stocks which have been among the better favoured equities over
the past month.
Seaq volume was slow to develop, with most of the institutions confining
their attentions to special situations; bid speculation was heard in the oil
sector but across the range of equities, activity was restrained by renewed
reports of heavy losses in UK bonds.
The day's Seaq total of 675.5m shares compared with 769.5m on Tuesday, when
retail or customer business was worth Pounds 1.43bn. Around 54 per cent of
yesterday's business was in non-Footsie stocks.
The biggest losses came among the banks and similar financial stocks, which
have been strong in recent weeks as interest rate activity has boosted
activity in the securities markets where these companies hold and trade
their assets. But analysts agreed that it was the uncertainty in European
and US bond markets, reflected in highly erratic performances by UK
government bonds, which is unsettling UK equities.

FT  21 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slips over concern about
interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks retreated yesterday amid concern that the uptrend in interest
rates could harm corporate profits, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 21.11 lower at 3,598.71, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 2.17 at 441.96. Declining
issues led advances, 1,405 to 811, in heavy volume of 362m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite dropped 3.50 to 427.60,
and the Nasdaq composite lost 7.33 to 705.52.
The volatility of prices during the session again revealed an underlying
ambivalence among investors about the economic outlook. At the opening
shares surged by more 20 points ahead of news of a strong rebound in the
housing sector last month.
The Commerce Department said that housing starts in March had jumped 12.1
per cent, after an 8 per cent fall the previous month. The data suggested
the industry recovered well from February's weather-induced contraction.
The US Treasury market reacted calmly to the news. Bond prices improved
steadily during the day.
By contrast, the equitymarkets had a sudden shift in mood. Investors
appeared to be concerned that the surge in interest rates over the lasttwo
months would soon begin to harm corporate profitability, despite a strong
first quarter.
Caterpillar plunged Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 103 7/8 even though its
first-quarter performance was outstanding. It posted net income of Dollars
1.89 a share, against 34 cents a year ago.
For the second day, Chrysler was punished for failing to outperform
expectations for the quarter. It lost Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 46 after
shedding Dollars 2 3/8 the previous session.
Fears of an economic slowdown also hurt Ford, which dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 54 1/8 .
Some companies were rewarded after showing improvement. Compaq surged nearly
Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 101 7/8 after announcing a 95 per cent increase in
earnings. Bell Atlantic gained Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 53 3/4 as results
came in slightly ahead of forecasts.
Canada
Share prices fell slightly in moderate trading, extending the Toronto
market's losing streak to four straight sessions. The TSE 300 composite
index was off 9.14 points, or 0.22 per cent, at 4,105.93, with declines
leading advances 440 to 294.
Volume fell to 60.83m shares from 75.26m shares yesterday and trading value
declined to CDollars 712.7m from CDollars 850.5m.
Mexico
The stock market's key IPC index finished down 107.44 points, or 5.2 per
cent, at 1,957.33 - the third largest decline this year.
The dramatic fall was triggered by a surprisingly sharp rise earlier in
domestic short-term interest rates, traders said. The 28-day Cete rate was
raised by 342 basis points to 18 per cent.
The Ministry of Finance, meanwhile, said foreign institutions - including
banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies - would be allowed to begin
operating in Mexico in the second half of 1994.

FT  21 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.5% as
region's performance steadies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With investors worried that weak US stock and bond prices will lead to a
lower dollar and a higher yen, the Nikkei index surrendered 1.5 per cent,
falling below 20,000 for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 average lost 310.16 to 19,882.18 after a high of 20,222.64 and a low
of 19,850.37, reflecting heavy Topix-linked arbitrage selling and the
liquidation of large portfolios by corporations.
Traders said that dealers were squaring their positions ahead of the 'Golden
Week' holidays starting at the end of next week. Foreign investors' buy
orders failed to offset the selling.
Volume totalled 340m shares against 338m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 23.58 to 1,613.43 and the Nikkei 300 index lost 4.71 to
294.84. Declines led advances by 807 to 248 with 122 unchanged. In London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.80 to 1,315.86.
Some market participants were apprehensive about the next few weeks, fearing
that there could have been a precedent last year when the Nikkei rose during
the first quarter but lost ground later as hopes of an economic recovery
faded in May.
However, Salomon Brothers in Tokyo said in a recent report that the
differences were greater than the similarities.
Fiscal and monetary policies were more stimulative, it said, and the
improvement in economic indicators, which turned down last May in spite of
the earlier rise, was more broadly-based and sustainable.
Large capital steels were mainly lower on corporate selling. Although Kobe
Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y1 to Y288, Nippon Steel fell
Y8 to Y349 and Kawasaki Steel by Y11 to Y366.
Banks, heavily weighted in the Topix index, lost ground. Industrial Bank of
Japan declined Y110 to Y3,170, Mitsubishi Bank Y60 to Y2,790 and Sumitomo
Bank Y50 to Y2,170.
Shipping stocks, previously picked up as laggards, fell on profit-taking.
Mitsui OSK Lines retreated Y10 to Y379 and Navix Line by Y12 to Y360.
Japan Airlines rose Y4 to Y713. The company announced an early retirement
plan for employees in their 30s, an unprecedented move among blue chip
companies. They expect younger workers will have larger opportunities in
finding new jobs than middle aged workers.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 246.41 to 22,223.94 in volume of 16.8m
shares.
Roundup
The region put in a steadier performance after Tuesday's falls. Bombay was
closed for a Hindu festival.
TAIWAN finished higher, but well off the day's highs after waves of late
profit-taking in industrials, which have been in demand recently as
investors focus on the outlook for profits. The weighted index closed 16.57
ahead at 5,692.32, after an intra-session high of 5,760.72. Turnover surged
to TDollars 70.49bn, the highest since March 7, from Tuesday's TDollars
58.9bn.
AUSTRALIA, still nervous after Tuesday's fall, lost further ground, dragged
down by falls in futures, a sharp drop in gold prices and volatility in
overseas markets. The All Ordinaries index fell 14.8 to 2,046.6, unnerved
during the afternoon by a sell-off on the futures market. The gold index
fell 50 or 2.2 per cent, to 2,197.7 after bullion in the US dropped by
Dollars 5.05 an ounce overnight.
SEOUL was lower for the third consecutive session in very thin trading as
some investors switched attention to the public auction of the state-funded
Korea Telecom. The composite stock index lost 5.01 to 880.84.
MANILA was helped higher by better-than-expected corporate earning results
in the first quarter, but profit-taking in the last 30 minutes of trade
pared gains. The composite index rose 20.89 to 2,846.82 as volume climbed to
1.2bn shares from Tuesday's 838.2m.
HONG KONG was weaker after a featureless day's trade as concern grew ahead
of a meeting tomorrow of local banks on the outlook for local interest
rates. The Hang Seng index slid 82.90 to 9,221.01, turnover falling to an
indicated HKDollars 3.33bn from Tuesday's final HKDollars 4.59bn.
KUALA LUMPUR moved higher as buyers returned in the afternoon after a quiet
morning session, but interest was selective. The composite index closed up
3.62 at 1,039.66.
JAKARTA fell back on local nervous selling following riots in the
north-western city of Medan. The official index fell 7.08 to 458.68.
SINGAPORE firmed late in the session amid brisk demand for property and
technology stocks. The Straits Times Industrials index rose 8.66 to
2,229.66.
BANGKOK had a volatile session as buying was undercut by profit-taking and
the SET index finished 8.36 higher at 1,282.38 in moderate turnover of
Bt7.6bn
NEW ZEALAND steadied after Tuesday's 37 point fall, the NZSE 40 Capital
index rising 2.65 to 2,107.35.

FT  21 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets correct in first
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emerging markets in general suffered sharp corrections in the first quarter,
according to research published this week by Kleiman International.
The US-based independent group, which analyses emerging banking and
securities markets, comments that most of the markets fell back on
profit-taking and as a consequence of interest rate and equity market
turbulence in the developed world.
'Of the 62 markets tracked from January to March 1994, global interest rate
and equity turbulence affected the more mature emerging markets, while
double digit advances remained the norm on lesser known exchanges, notably
in central Europe, the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa.'
The picture was not altogether negative on the larger exchanges - Colombia,
Zimbabwe, Brazil and Portugal all picked up gains in dollar terms of between
46 to 18 per cent. But some of the strongest rises came from the more exotic
markets, such as Morocco, up 17.5 per cent, and Tunisia, up 18 per cent in
local currency terms, while the Cyprus over-the-counter market, according to
Kleiman's, climbed 13.7 per cent.
Baring Securities remarks that the flow of funds into emerging markets
totalled Dollars 52m in 1993, some 15 times greater than the 1986 level. US
buyers remained the heaviest purchasers, taking 40 per cent of the total.

FT  21 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses soured by bond
markets, US influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were soured by bond markets, and lifted temporarily by early gains
on Wall Street; late closers weakened again as the Dow subsided, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS dipped beneath the 2,100 level just before the close, before finding a
fresh burst of energy which was enough to push the CAC-40 index to a close
of 2,102.71, a day's fall of 33.27 or 1.5 per cent.
Bonds weakened on heavy US selling. Traders were looking to the Bank of
France to cut interest rates today.
Turnover was FFr4bn.
Weakness was particularly marked in the financial sector, with Societe
Generale and Bancaire both falling to year-lows during the session, of
FFr598 and FFr537 respectively, before recovering slightly to close down
Fr16 and FFr27 at FFr600 and FFr540.
There was one positive move on the day as Christian Dior improved FFr7 to
FFr407 after noting that it expected a rise in 1994 net profit, following a
sharp rise in turnover during February.
Peugeot lost FFr9 to FFr914 ahead of today's results which are expected to
show a 1993 loss of between FFr1.5bn and FFr2bn. However, analysts see a
pick-up in demand for automotive shares this year.
Pechiney International continued its downtrend following Tuesday's
disappointing figures, the shares hitting a year's low of FFr170.30 during
the session, before closing off FFr7 at FFr173.
MADRID blamed Wall Street, bond markets and a lack of liquidity as the
general index closed 3.87, or 1.2 per cent down at a new 1994 low of 309.73.
Turnover was low to moderate at Pta28.26bn.
Banesto dropped by Pta50, or 6.2 per cent to Pta750 ahead of the bids for
the company from Argentaria, BBV and Santander.
FRANKFURT, once again, was happier in the afternoon than it was earlier.
During the session equities were depressed by a fall in bund futures, in
spite of a cut of 12 basis points in the German repo rate; the Dax index
closed the official trading period at 2,182.64, 11.25 down from its
post-bourse level on Tuesday.
Turnover rose from DM11.2bn to DM11.6bn. In the afternoon, bund and index
futures recovered but an Ibis-indicated close of 2,194.09 left the index
almost exactly where it was on Tuesday evening.
The switch from financials to cyclicals continued but the contrast between
Deutsche Bank, virtually flat on the day, and Volkswagen, up DM16.40 to
DM546 and DM4 higher again in the afternoon, reflected more than that, said
Mr Klaus Ropke at James Capel.
Deutsche's image had suffered not only from the Schneider affair, but also
from the Metallgesellschaft debacle and recent experience in the new issue
market. On VW, Capel switched recently from sell to a buy recommendation,
and there was talk of a big US order for the stock.
AMSTERDAM was bruised by bonds, Wall Street and a weakening of the dollar,
the AEX index losing 1.61 at 414.84.
One of the biggest falls on the session was recorded by Royal Dutch, down Fl
2.90 at Fl 204.20, but off a day's low of Fl 203.80, attributed to
profit-taking after the stock's recently strong performance.
Hoogovens, the steel producer, went against the trend, rising Fl 1.40 to Fl
63.10 after raising its profit forecast for 1994.
An early gain for Fokker was eroded by the close, the shares ending
unchanged at Fl 17, having risen earlier to Fl 17.70, on reports from
Deutsche Aerospace, the parent group, that the aircraft manufacturer would
break-even by 1995.
MILAN moved 1.6 per cent higher although domestic funds waited for lower
prices. Foreign investors, who had helped to fuel the market's recent surge,
were reported to be taking profits selectively. The Comit index rose 12.41
to 777.59.
Fiat put on L183 or 2.9 per cent to L6,490 amid rumours that it will soon
report a 13 per cent rise in 1993 turnover and net losses at the lower end
of expectations.
The positive tone spilled over to other industrials. Pirelli added L141 or
4.8 per cent ahead of results while Montedison rose L41 to or 2.8 per cent
to L1,491 and its parent, Ferruzzi, rose L121 or 4.9 per cent to L2,565.
Benetton fell L240 to L25,389 ahead of 1993 results today at which the group
is expected to announce profits up about 12 per cent to L205bn-L210bn.
ZURICH picked up from early lows, the recovery aided by some short covering
and Wall Street's early performance. The SMI index finished down 18.4 at
2,818.7 after a day's low of 2,810.6.
Financials were out of favour with UBS bearers losing SFr19 to SFr1,193, and
SBC down SFr8 at SFr412 ahead of its forecast that business would remain
satisfactory this year as a result of lower provisioning requirements and
cost cutting measures.
Against the trend, Georg Fischer bearers put on SFr45 to SFr1,400, with the
rise attributed to recent positive comment from UBS.
Roche certificates slipped below the SFr7,000 level, ending down SFr30 at
SFr6,900.
HELSINKI overcame early losses after Nokia shares jumped 6.3 per cent in
response to the announcement of a mobile telephone deal with AT&amp;T. The Hex
index rose 6.7 to 1,799.7 as Nokia ordinary put on FM25 to FM422.

FT  21 APR 94 / Markets Report: Rate cut helps D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark remained well supported yesterday despite a larger than expected
12 basis point cut in the repo rate by the Bundesbank, writes Philip Gawith.
The German currency was helped by the perception that higher US interest
rates will curb the decline in German rates. It also benefited from its safe
haven status as uncertainty in other European markets caused investors to
seek refuge in the D-Mark.
Casualties of D-Mark strength included the dollar and the French franc. The
US currency finished in London at DM1.694 from DM1.701. The French franc
finished at its lowest level in over four months, closing at FFr3.435 from
FFr3.429.
Belgium followed the German example and cut its central lending rate, to 5.7
per cent from 5.8 per cent. The markets rewarded the move with the Belgian
franc finishing slightly firmer in London at BFr20.60 from BFr20.59.
In the UK, the sterling index finished at 80.1, up from 79.8. Strong
economic data persuaded the market that prospects of an interest rate cut
had diminished.
The lowest bid accepted at the weekly securities repurchase auction in
Germany was 5.58 per cent, down from 5.70 per cent. Although larger than
anticipated, the cut was not sufficient to offset fears that higher US
rates, and signs of an economic upturn in Germany, will slow the pace of
monetary easing in Germany.
This was reflected in the fall in euromark futures prices. The June contract
finished unchanged at 94.69, but the December future fell to 94.86 from
94.93.
German call money, on the other hand, was quoted slightly easier at
5.50/5.55 per cent, from 5.50/5.60 per cent, after the announcement of the
repo rate.
The lower rate had little impact on the D-Mark which was broadly stronger in
Europe. It closed at Pta81.88 against the Spanish peseta from Pta81.86.
Attention today will focus on the Bank of France council meeting. The
central bank finds itself in a dilemma. On the one hand, it is widely
perceived as wanting to lower rates to foster economic recovery. On the
other, the franc is currently weak, having fallen below FFr3.4305 against
the D-Mark, its floor within the old narrow band ERM.
A number of reasons are cited for the franc's weakness. These include the
strong D-Mark, selling of French bonds, concern that economic growth is
lagging Germany's, and the waning political fortunes of Mr Edouard Balladur,
the prime minister.
Economists are split as to whether the franc will be bought or sold if the
intervention rate is cut. Some argue that lower rates will hasten a
sell-off, but others believe the market will reward pro-growth policies.
Mr Brendan Brown, head of research at Mitsubishi Finance International,
predicts a compromise, with the BOF cutting rates, but by less than in
Germany.
He believes that the franc will probably fall to FFr3.48 in the next few
weeks. Mr Brown said investors might become concerned about pressures within
the Gaullist party for monetary policy to be more pro-growth and less a
satellite of the Bundesbank.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), argues
that 'the fate of the franc is very much in the hands of the D-Mark.' He
said there was a strong perception in the market that higher Fed funds in
the US would put a dampener on the rate at which German, and hence European,
interest rates were allowed to fall.
'The only way the franc can escape is to delink itself from the D-Mark,'
said Mr Persaud.
Although the BOF has rebuilt its reserves since the currency crisis last
summer, analysts do not anticipate that it will try to defend the franc at
current levels. Mr Brown says it is the market, rather than the BOF, which
has put the currency back within its narrow band limits.
Sterling resisted the advance of the D-Mark yesterday to close in London at
DM2.5170 from DM2.5144. It was also higher against the dollar, finishing at
Dollars 1.4858 from Dollars 1.4782.
The UK currency was helped by a batch of economic data which dampened hopes
of an interest rate cut. February average earnings rose by 3.5 per cent,
more than expected. Unemployment was below expectations, with the jobless
rate slipping to 9.7 per cent from 9.8 per cent.
The market interpreted these buoyant data as reducing the chance of lower
rates. Accordingly, in the futures market, the June short sterling contract
closed twelve basis points lower at 94.63. The December contract was
seventeen basis points lower at 93.89.
This picture could change today with the release of retail sales figures for
March. Most economists still favour another 25 basis point cut in UK
interest rates.
In the money markets the Bank of England provided Pounds 450m of late
assistance. Earlier it had injected Pounds 874m into the market to clear a
Pounds 1.3bn shortage.

FT  21 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: London coffee futures squeezed
higher - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shortage of supplies available for nearby delivery pushed COFFEE prices
back towards last week's highs at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday.
The prompt May futures position surged Dollars 99 to Dollars 1,592 a tonne,
dragging the July contract to Dollars 1,484, up Dollars 53. High internal
demand has squeezed export availability in Brazil, traders explained.
The London GOLD price fell Dollars 1 to a fresh 4 1/2 -month low of Dollars
371.80 a troy ounce as the market continued to digest the consequences of a
tighter US policy on short-term interest rates, which would tend to benefit
the bond market.
At the London Metal Exchange most base metals turned lower by the close as
technical indicators continued to turn bearish, although COPPER ended
slightly higher.
ALUMINIUM eased back to test support under Dollars 1,290 a tonne for
delivery in three months, despite the fall in March IPAI production.

FT  21 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Moment of truth approaches for
PNG mining - Financing of the Lihir project will provide a test of bankers'
faith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Holzberger, exploration manager for Highlands Gold, stands on a remote
drill-site, high above the Frieda River in the north-western Papua New
Guinea. 'If this was anywhere else in the world, we wouldn't be here,' he
says.
The phrasing may be curious, but the implication is clear: in any other
country some form of commercial mining would be under way on the identified
gold-copper deposit. As it is, despite the continuing drilling programme and
some optimistic noises from Highlands, analysts remain to be convinced that
the prospect is economically viable.
It is easy to see why. For hundreds of kilometres, there is little besides
rain-forest and clouds. The site is so remote that access to any mine
development would have be up a couple of rivers, and then via some
newly-constructed road link. A facility for copper production would have to
be built into the steeply-sloping hillsides and power brought to the site.
In the meantime, there would be the problem of establishing land rights and
negotiating landowner compensation. Already, despite the apparent obscurity
of the location, locals are paying attention.
All of which explains why PNG represents the ultimate mining conundrum -
extre-mely rich from a geological perspective, but devoid of basic
infrastructure, subject to aggressive land claims and overshadowed by a
volatile political climate. According to a recent survey of two dozen
Australian mining and petroleum companies by Mining Monthly magazine, the
country has the highest perceived international investment risk, easily
surpassing the likes of Russia, China and Brazil.
The extent of this 'PNG factor' has been brought home to the investment
community on a number of occasions, causing sentiment towards the country to
ebb and flow in recent years. The most dramatic loss of confidence came in
1989, when the Panguna copper mine on Bougainville closed after bitter
clashes with local landowners and the island's secessionists. Not only did
this shatter PNG's international reputation, but it also wrought major
damage to the domestic economy.
More recently, investment attitudes have been more equivocal. Sentiment took
another knock in early-1993, when tensions developed between the PNG
government and corporate investors over the rich Porgera gold mine. But with
that matter resolved and financing for the next big project - the ADollars
1.5bn Lihir goldmine - getting under way, there are some tentative signs of
a more positive mood.
For the PNG pessimists, the Porgera affair was all too inevitable. The
ADollars 1bn (USDollars 720m) project, located in the Enga province, began
production in 1990 and was originally owned jointly by Placer Pacific,
Renison Goldfields, and Highlands Gold with 30 per cent apiece. The PNG
government held the residual 10 per cent.
But when 1992's production rolled in at a stunning 1.46m ounces, the PNG
government claimed that it had been duped about the richness of the mine and
demanded a larger stake in the project. After lengthy negotiations, it was
agreed that the three corporate partners should each surrender a 5 per cent
interest, reducing their stakes to 25 per cent apiece. The PNG government
would pay K138.75m (USDollars 146m) to raise its holding to the same level.
Despite the fact that the government's additional ownership interest was
bought rather than confiscated, PNG-related stocks suffered badly.
Highlands, in which Queensland's MIM has a majority stake, more than halved
from about ADollars 1.60 in early-1992 to ADollars 0.75 a year later.
Nuigini Mining, whose controlling shareholder is Canada's Battle Mountain,
fell from ADollars 3.25 to under ADollars 2 over the same period.
But almost 12 months later, there are indications that the dust is settling.
Those same 'PNG' stocks, for example, have regained all or much of the lost
ground - although, as one analyst puts it, 'things could hardly get worse'.
Meanwhile, the BHP-controlled Ok Tedi copper mine, to the north of the
country, revealed earlier this year that it had signed a three-year
USDollars 140m revolving credit facility without the bankers demanding any
political risk insurance. It was the first time that this precaution had
been omitted for a PNG project.
BHP Minerals attributes the show of confidence to two factors. First, it
points out that Ok Tedi has become an established project, operating for
over a decade. But secondly, it perceives some shift in the international
bankers' attitudes towards PNG, suggesting that a familiarity with country
is beginning to build up.
Bank of America, one of the lead banks in the Ok Tedi transaction, concurs -
although it admits that opinions in the financial community are still
sharply divided. 'There's been a dramatic improvement from
post-Bougainville,' says Mr Simon Dodd, in the Melbourne office. 'The banks
in there (the Ok Tedi syndicate) are ones who've come to know the people,
the companies, the real issues.'
But, he admits: 'There was a second group of banks who veered away and
wouldn't have anything to do with the loan'.
The test of this new-found faith will come over the large Lihir project. The
potential mine is located on one of the islands within the New Ireland
province and is a joint venture between Britain's RTZ and Nuigini Mining,
with the PNG government also involved. Financing for the development is due
to be completed this year, and the original plan was to split this between a
share issue, raising perhaps ADollars 400m, and a debt facility of about
ADollars 300m.
Unfortunately, in the way of PNG, politics have already caused the initial
timetable to slip and the structure of the project has - in the words of one
observer - 'headed into the twilight zone'. For what were viewed as domestic
reasons, Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, announced a government
reshuffle over Christmas. Mr Masket Iangalio, the former mining minister,
moved to finance and Mr John Kaputin took over the resources portfolio. In
the wake of these upheavals, the supposedly-imminent special mining lease
for the Lihir development did not materialise.
In part, the problem is thought to centre on whether PNG sticks to a
provisional agreement to involve Malaysia's state-owned Malaysia Mining
Corporation at an early stage, in return for assistance in funding of the
government's interest, or whether it adheres to the stock market plan, which
would see the partners' stakes diluted by the float and MMC entitled to pick
up shares at this stage. This decision, in turn, has broader foreign policy
implications, given Mr Wingti's 'Look North' policy, which is aimed at
securing greater ties between PNG and Asia. Mr Kaputin is making a
submission on the Lihir project to PNG's National Executive Council this
week.
Back in the banking parlours of Melbourne, the Lihir exercise, and the
smoothness with which it is conducted, will be 'interesting to watch', says
one, slightly sceptical, observer.
But it is not just the international sentiment which will be tested by the
Lihir financing; domestic aspirations are also involved. On the one hand,
there is an acute need to bring on new resources projects to maintain the
country's economic growth. A report published this week by the Asia-Pacific
Economics Group suggested that GDP would be flat, or even decline in 1994,
after the 14.4 per cent growth last year. 'Substantial growth' might then
resume in 1995, provided construction on the Lihir and South East Gobe
oilfield projects was getting under way.
The PNG government has also advocated a local stockmarket, which - at least
in theory - could facilitate the realisation of its own holdings in domestic
ventures and the retention of PNG assets in PNG hands.
Discussions have been held with the Australian Stock Exchange on the
technicalities, and with a number of Australian brokers over market-making.
Given the high-level political commitment, most observers believe the
project stands a good chance of becoming a reality - although Mr Iangalio
recently played down the prospect of a July opening, preferring an end-1994
target date.
But the level of business conducted on the new market is more debatable.
Landowner compensation coupled with the build-up of local institutional
funds and a large expatriate community means that there is no shortage of
investable money in PNG. A ready supply of quality companies is more
questionable, especially outside the core resources sector. 'The key,' says
Bruce Parncutt, head of McIntosh Securities, the only Australian firm to
maintain a small PNG office, 'will be the quality of the companies'. Lihir
could prove a valuable boost.

Output from all South African mines was falling because of the first
all-party elections, Mr Gary Maude, chairman of Gengold, the country's
third-largest gold producer, said yesterday. Another Gengold official
estimated that gold production was down by as much as 5 per cent in the
first quarter.
'This is not a conscious go-slow,' said Mr Maude. 'But there is an expectant
atmosphere and people are not working with their usual concentration.' There
had also been a unusual rash of wildcat strikes about industry issues over
which mine managers had no influence.
All Gengold mines will shut on April 26, the first election day. Mr Maude
said there might be increased militancy after the elections but he felt sure
that the new government would want to ensure a continued flow of revenues
from gold.

FT  21 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Freeport rescues Indonesian
smelter plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Freeport McMoRan of the US has stepped in to salvage Indonesia's USDollars
500m copper smelter project that was threatened by the financial collapse of
Metallgesellschaft of Germany. Freeport said it would take over the lead
role to build a 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes smelter at Gresik, near the
industrial port of Surabaya.
Freeport said that Nippon Mining, which was previously involved, was still
interested in joining the project, as were a number of other companies.
It pointed out that the Indonesian smelter, which could come into operation
during 1998, would be guaranteed a long-term supply of concentrate (an
intermediate material) from Freeport Indonesia, which by 1996 would be
producing at an annual rate of 499,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate and
1.5m troy ounces of gold.
Freeport is also to spend Dollars 215m to expand annual capacity at its
recently-acquired Huelva smelter in Spain from 150,000 to 270,000 tonnes by
early 1996.
It said that if, as planned, Freeport Indonesia supplied half the
concentrates required by the two smelters, that would represent about 50 per
cent of its output from 1996 onwards.

FT  21 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium output falls as cuts
bite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clear evidence that the international agreement which aims to cut global
annual aluminium output by about 10 per cent is taking hold emerged as
delegates from some of the world's major producer countries prepared for
their meeting in Brussels today.
Aluminium output in the western world dropped by 632 tonnes a day,
equivalent to 231,000 tonnes a year, between the end of February and March
31, according to the International Primary Aluminium Institute, whose
statistics cover more than 90 per cent of western production.
This is the second-largest monthly fall since IPAI records began, said Mr
Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett. 'This is good, fundamental news for the
aluminium market, ' he said. 'It shows that the efforts the industry is
making (to cut annual global output by 1.5m to 2m tonnes) is having an
impact. And that impact should be even more pronounced next month.'
Western producers have so far announced annual cuts totalling more than
900,000 tonnes. Elkem of Norway joined the list yesterday when it said it
would reduce annual output by 10,000 tonnes - not quite 5 per cent of its
200,000-tonnes production - from September and hold that level until the end
of 1995.
Trade delegates from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway, Russia
and the US meet in Brussels today to compare notes on the progress made
since they reached an understanding about the cuts in January.

FT  21 APR 94 / Government Bonds: German cut in repo rate fails to lift the
gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds lost further ground yesterday, falling between
half a point and a full point as markets remained in a jittery mood
following this week's rise in US short-term interest rates, and in spite of
a bigger than expected cut in the German repo rate.
The Bundesbank announced that its securities repurchase rate had fallen to
5.58 per cent this week, from 5.70 per cent last week.
The 12 basis point cut in the rate exceeded market expectations, but while
the German government bond market had traded higher ahead of the
announcement on hopes of a substantial reduction, the actual announcement
prompted heavy selling of bunds and profit-taking by traders.
Market analysts were astonished by the bund market's response.
The Liffe bund futures contact, which had opened at 95.15 and had reached
high of 95.19 ahead of the repo, sold off and fell to a low of 94.16 on the
repo news.
Bund prices rallied in the afternoon, but then slipped back and the Liffe
futures contract was trading at around 94.25 by late afternoon.
Traders said that sentiment was not helped by the combination of poor demand
for new supply from the Bundespost, and comments by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the
economics minister, who said that German gross domestic product would grow
by 1.5 per cent in 1994 - a figure at the top end of the government forecast
range.
French government bonds fell by nearly a point on the day as the weakness of
the French franc continued to upset the bond market.
With the French currency trading outside its former ERM bands, some bond
analysts believe the Bank of France may be less likely to cut its
intervention rate at today's Monetary Policy Council meeting, despite the
Bundesbank's repo rate cut yesterday and cuts in the discount and Lombard
rates last week.
The notional bond futures contract traded on the Matif futures exchange fell
from its opening of 121.14 to a low of 119.90 before settling at 120.10.
The French-German 10-year yield spread widened further to 31 basis points
yesterday from 25 basis points the previous day.
UK government bonds took fright following the release of new economic data
which pointed to a continuation of the economic recovery. The figures were
interpreted as reducing the chances of a base rate cut in the immediate
future.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment in the UK fell by 30,300 in March to 2.72m,
a bigger decline than the 25,000 fall which had been expected, and this was
seen as reducing the need for a cut in interest rates.
More worrying for the gilt market, however, was data on growth in earnings
for the year to February, which fuelled fears that inflation could tick up
again. Underlying earnings in the whole economy rose by 3.5 per cent, while
the rise for the year to January was revised upwards to 3.5 per cent from
3.25 per cent.
Economists pointed out that in such thin trading, the initial decline in
gilt prices was exaggerated, and that the market was determined to focus on
the worst possible interpretation.
'I don't think there is anything to worry about in the average earnings
figures and there is no sign of wage settlements taking off, which is a more
important sign,' said one analyst.
US Treasury bonds moved moderately higher yesterday as traders shrugged off
strong economic news and focused on a slump in commodity prices.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/8 better at 87
7/32 , with the yield easing to 7.307 per cent. At the short end of the
maturity spectrum, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 1/32 , to yield
5.662 per cent.
The morning brought bad news to a market wary of developments which may
bring forward the next increase in the interest rates by the Federal
Reserve.
Since February, the central bank has been tightening monetary policy in an
effort to slow the economy's rate of growth.
The Commerce Department said housing starts in March had jumped 12.1 per
cent, after an 8 per cent fall in the previous month. The data was evidence
that the economy made a strong recovery from February's weather-related
cooling.
Bonds immediately dipped on the announcement but soon steadied amid
'short-covering' by traders who had to replace securities they had borrowed
and resold on a bet that prices would slide.
Activity was light, but the market continued to improve during the
afternoon. Sentiment was lifted by a drop in a closely watched barometer of
inflationary trends. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 products
fell below 220 for the first time since December.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Bonds: Greece to tap DM FRN sector directly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece is expected to tap the international capital markets directly for the
first time next week with a DM1bn offering of floating-rate notes (FRNs). In
the past, the Bank of Greece has acted as the issuer on behalf of the
republic.
The offering, which will be jointly lead-managed by CS First Boston and
Deutsche Bank, will have a maturity of five or seven years. The notes are
likely to be priced to yield between 100 and 110 basis points over Libor.
Some syndicate managers were surprised that Greece had decided to launch its
first deal under its new name of the Hellenic Republic in the D-Mark FRN
sector which has a lower profile than the much larger Eurodollar FRN market.
The last sovereign borrower to tap the D-Mark FRN sector was the Kingdom of
Spain with a DM2bn issue in June 1992, though there have been several deals
for domestic issuers.
It is believed that Greece plumped for D-Marks because it was shown better
execution than in floating-rate dollars, for which it would have had to pay
120 basis points over Libor.
KfW, the German government agency for redevelopment, is thought to be
watching the market with a view to raising DM1.5bn through an offering of
10-year Eurobonds. JP Morgan and WestLB are arranging the issue.
Another deal which could be launched in the near future is a FFr5bn
fixed-rate offering for Belgium. The favoured maturity is said to be eight
years and price talk is 20 to 25 basis points over the French government
bond yield curve. Several banks are thought to be bidding for the mandate.
Among yesterday's events, L-Bank's DM2bn offering of five-year global bonds
was priced to yield 36 basis points over the five-year Treuhand bonds due
October 1999.
When freed to trade, the yield spread widened out to as far as 42 basis
points, reflecting volatile market conditions and the emergence of some
loose bonds. However, joint lead manager JP Morgan said that the bonds
closed at 99.05, down from a re-offer price of 99.20, to give a yield spread
of 39 basis points.
Abbey National and Halifax Building Society issued structured bonds to raise
funds in Italian lire and sterling respectively. Abbey raised L150bn with
10-year Eurobonds callable after two years and annually thereafter at par.
The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate lire and will be used to fund
Abbey's growing Italian mortgage book. Lead manager Credito Italiano said
the coupon of 9 5/8 per cent on the bonds appealed in particular to domestic
retail investors.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: SEC relaxes rules for foreign
issuers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Securities and Exchange Commission has agreed on new rules that
should make it easier for foreign companies to issue securities on the US
market.
The rules will allow more companies to use a shorter form of the SEC's
standard documentation, helping to reduce the initial cost of obtaining a US
listing.
The SEC estimates that the change in rules will increase by as much as
one-third the number of foreign companies allowed to use the short F-3
filing form, which usually runs to about 20 pages, rather than the full F-1
form of 60 pages or more.
Companies with a public float of Dollars 75m will now qualify, instead of
Dollars 300m previously. The SEC will also require a reporting history of
only 12 months, instead of 36 months, so long as the company has at least
one annual report.
'As our experience with foreign issuers grows, we will continue to discover
ways to assist them with the transition to our disclosure system, and
therefore our markets, while not compromising in any way our mandate to
protect the American investor,' said Mr Arthur Levitt, the SEC chairman.
Although more than 600 foreign companies are now registered with the SEC,
many find US reporting requirements burdensome and costly.
Mr Kevin Cramer, a partner in the Washington office of lawyers Jones, Day,
Reavis &amp; Pogue, said use of the F-3 form would not only reduce the amount of
paper a company had to file, but also cut the time the SEC staff would take
to review it.
'A UK issuer that wanted to take advantage of market conditions could have a
higher degree of confidence that they could get into the market when they
want to,' Mr Cramer said.
Among other measures included in the package, the SEC voted to allow foreign
companies to use the same unallocated shelf registration process already
available to US issuers.
Under this process, a company can file a single registration statement,
without specifying in advance whether it will issue shares, bonds or some
other form of security.
Another important measure described by Mr Levitt as a 'landmark step' would
allow foreign companies to present cashflow statements prepared in
accordance with International Accounting Standard Number 7, rather than US
accounting standards as currently required.

Henderson Land Development Company, one of Hong Kong's biggest property

(USDollars 298m) for the six months to December 31, up from HKDollars 2bn

The group, which has a land bank in Hong Kong of some 18.5m sq ft in
attributable floor area plus agricultural land holdings, reaped the benefit
of rising property prices and rentals which many analysts believe are close
to the peak.
Mr William Wong, company secretary, said property transactions had started
to slow in recent weeks following the government's announcement that it
would increase land supply for residential use and bring in measures to curb
price rises. Further tightening by mortgage lenders, introduced in February,
had taken its toll.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Bankers Trust sees cut in use of
financial derivatives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Many companies are in the process of cutting their use of financial
derivatives following the upheaval in financial markets of the past two
months, a senior executive of Bankers Trust, the US bank, said yesterday.
There was likely to be 'some slowdown (in the use of derivatives) as
policies and procedures are tightened up among corporate users,' said Mr Tim
Yates, the bank's chief financial officer. 'That in itself may be a good
thing,' he added, and predicted that the use of derivatives to manage
financial risk would continue to grow in the long term.
Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank which has been one of the most active
banks in selling derivative instruments to help companies manage risk, has
been threatened with legal action by two companies in the past 10 days which
have lost money on rate swaps.
Proctor &amp; Gamble last week put its losses at Dollars 102m, while Gibson
Greetings, a US greetings card company, said on Tuesday that it faces a
paper loss of Dollars 19.7m.
These and other losses have led many companies to review the risks they may
be running through their corporate treasury activities.
Mr Yates added, though, that companies that had lost money on derivatives
like swaps 'are in the great minority'. An internal review of the trades
with Proctor &amp; Gamble and Gibson had shown them to be 'correct and proper in
every way'.
Bankers Trust also provided more details yesterday of its trading results in
the first quarter, which were well below 1993 levels. The bank said it lost
Dollars 49m on trading for its own account, an activity which had Dollars
594m in the whole of 1993.
Bankers Trust lost money on holdings of bonds issued by most of the
developed nations, as well as emerging market securities, Mr Yates said. It
had previously believed that not all financial markets would move down
together, and was now reassessing its risk management models to reflect the
experience of recent weeks, he added.
The review 'might lead eventually to higher levels of capital (to back
trading positions), or lower positions,' Mr Yates said.

Woolworth
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Woolworth, the US retailer, yesterday appointed an outsider to the post of
interim chief financial officer.
The move prompted speculation that the present incumbent, who stepped aside
at the beginning of this month, will not be coming back.
The new appointee is Mr Andrew Hines, who previously worked at Pentland, the
UK sports clothing group, and Adidas, the US sports shoe company that
Pentland tried to buy in 1992. Woolworth has also made him an interim senior
vice-president.
Mr Hines's predecessor, Mr Charles Young, and Woolworth's chairman and chief
executive, Mr William Lavin, both stepped aside three weeks ago after it was
discovered that Woolworth had misreported losses as profits in the first two
quarters of last year.
Mr Lavin has been temporarily replaced by Mr John Adams, an outside director
of the Woolworth board since 1991.
The Woolworth board last week restated its 1993 results to correct the
mistakes in the quarterly figures, and said it was continuing to investigate
the events leading up to the errors.
Mr Lavin and Mr Young have denied any wrong-doing.

after charge

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy abnormal charges and a ADollars 19.3m (USDollars 13.8m) foreign
exchange loss related to its Canadian holding company caused MIM Holdings,
the Queensland-based metals group, to post a ADollars 61.4m loss after tax
in the first nine months of the current financial year.
The loss compared with a ADollars 70.8m profit in the same period of
1992-93. In the first six months of 1993-94, MIM had reported a net loss of
ADollars 18.5m.
At the operating level, MIM made a ADollars 60.2m profit, with sales
standing at ADollars 1.7bn. The profits figure was well below the ADollars
140m recorded in the previous year, and MIM said average base metal prices
for the 40-week period remained 'significantly lower' than a year ago, in
spite of a pick-up in the third quarter.
According to MIM, the average copper price, in Australian dollars, was down
19 per cent, lead down 12 per cent, and zinc down 13 per cent. Gold was up
by 11 per cent, and silver by 31 per cent.
Coal prices in the first 40 weeks were 9 per cent lower than in the
comparable period of 1992-93.
The damage to the third quarter results came from a ADollars 42.2m abnormal
charge. This was made up of a ADollars 25m general provision for the loss in
the value of investments, a ADollars 2.3m net loss on the partial disposal
of Canadian and German investments, and the previously-announced ADollars
17.8m loss of the German joint venture smelting operations.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese banks plan merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three Japanese regional banks are to merge in January 1995.
The move comes as Japanese financial authorities are trying to encourage
mergers among smaller regional banks to streamline operations and achieve
economies of scale in the face of rising costs and growing problem loans.
Tokuyo City Bank, Kita-Nippon Bank and Shokusan Bank, three second-tier
regional banks based in northern Japan, will become Heisei Bank, the
fifth-biggest second-tier regional bank in terms of assets, with deposits of
Y2,190bn (Dollars 21bn).
Ten shares of the merged bank will be exchanged for 10 shares of Shokusan,
or 10 shares of Kita-Nippon, or eight shares of Tokuyo City.
They currently offer banking services in three prefectures through a total
of 225 branches. The merged bank will have separate headquarters in each of
the three prefectures.
The three banks have combined outstanding deposits of Y2,270bn with combined
outstanding loans totalling Y1,710bn yen, they said.
The move is the latest in a string of mergers among regional banks. In 1991,
San-in Godo Bank in western Japan merged with another regional bank, while
Kumamoto Bank merged with Higo Family Bank based in Kyushu, southern Japan.
Last year, Hokuto Bank in Akita, in north-east Japan, was created by a
merger of two regional banks.
Most of Japan's regional banks remain relatively healthy catering to
businesses in the provinces, but many among the smaller second-tier regional
banks have been troubled in the wake of the burst of the economic bubble due
to imprudent lending in the 1980s.
The regional banks are also facing increasing competition from the larger
commercial banks, which are looking for business opportunities in the
provinces.
Tokuyo City posted a Y7.6bn pre-tax loss for the year ending March 1992 and
a Y1bn pre-tax loss for the business year to March last year due to
unrealised losses on stock holdings.
The Bank of Japan and ministry of finance are trying to resolve the
situation by merging healthier regional banks with those with deteriorating
balance sheets.
The finance ministry yesterday welcomed the move as 'forward looking',
adding that it hoped the merger will would improve customer service and
contribute to the regional economy. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister,
said that more such cases were likely to emerge in the future.

Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday upgraded its
senior debt rating for TNT, the Australian transportation group, from B to
B+, writes Nikki Tait.
S&amp;P, which had indicated such a move was being considered, said that 'as a
result of management's financial restructuring, the overall debt burden was
now more manageable, with improving discretionary cashflow and liquid
balances expected to meet debt maturities'. It made the move after TNT
completed a USDollars 100m senior debt offering.
TNT, which has been bedevilled by a heavy debt burden and boardroom upheaval
last year, has also raised funds by a converting preference share issue and
the sale of various 'non-core' assets.

Comalco, the Australian integrated aluminium producer in which CRA holds a
majority interest, said yesterday that it broke even in the first quarter of
1994, with a January loss followed by profits in February and March, writes
Nikki Tait.
However, Comalco's chairman, Mr John Ralph, warned shareholders that the
immediate outlook for the aluminium industry was bleak, with oversupply and
high inventories continuing.
Most of Comalco's business, he said, was 'still operating in difficult
market conditions'. The medium to longer-term outlook was more positive, 'as
fundamental demand remains strong with sound growth expected in end-uses
such as automobiles and packaging, and increased per capita consumption in
Asia'.
Mr Ralph later added that the company was considering equity-raising
possibilities, but that no decisions had been taken. 'We are looking at all
funding alternatives and that includes the possibility of equity,' he said.

Some details of the Indian government's plan to sell up to 40 per cent of
Air India, the state-run international airline, and its plan to tap global
markets for part of the Dollars 2bn needed to expand the carrier's fleet are
expected to be announced soon, Reuter reports from Bombay.
Mr Durga Mathur, the airline's new managing director, said: 'We are keenly
awaiting the government's decision on the percentage of disinvestment. I
think it will be around 35 to 40 per cent.'
He expected the partial privatisation to be carried out over four to five
years.
Mr Mathur said Air India would opt for both a Euroissue and domestic issue
for the cash, to be raised to fund the Dollars 2bn expansion and
modernisation of its fleet.

Henderson Land Development Company, one of Hong Kong's biggest property
developers, reported a 15 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 2.3bn
(USDollars 298m) for the six months to December 31, up from HKDollars 2bn
the previous year.
The group, which has a land bank in Hong Kong of some 18.5m sq ft in
attributable floor area plus agricultural land holdings, reaped the benefit
of rising property prices and rentals which many analysts believe are close
to the peak.
Mr William Wong, company secretary, said property transactions had started
to slow in recent weeks following the government's announcement that it
would increase land supply for residential use and bring in measures to curb
price rises.
Further tightening by mortgage lenders, introduced in February, had taken
its toll, he said.
Associated companies turned in healthy performances - namely Hong Kong and
China Gas Company, Hong Kong Ferry and Miramar Hotel and Investment Company,
which was snatched from under the nose of Mr Li Ka-shing, the property
tycoon, in a contested takeover battle last June. The hotel group reported a
41 per cent rise in profits.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Casualties of a currency crisis
 -Turkey's banks seem ill-prepared for the storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's currency crisis has thrown up its first bank casualties. The
Treasury stepped in last week to close down the small Istanbul-based Turkish
Tourism and Investment bank TYT, and the Istanbul stock exchange yesterday
suspended trading in Marbank, a small trade finance bank.
With a growing likelihood of mergers and consolidations - if not
liquidations - of some private banks, the sole consolation is that the
crisis may well result in a long overdue shake-out of Turkey's banking
industry.
The moves raise questions about the durability of the Turkish financial
system and the country's 70 banks, in the wake of what has been the worst
financial crisis in more than a decade.
The sector appears ill-prepared to weather the storm. Turkish banks are
under-capitalised, although some improvements have been made in recent years
to meet international standards on capital adequacy.
More important, Turkey's recent economic development has been highly
leveraged. With a real interest differential as high as 20 per cent, many
banks have been funding their lira loan book through foreign borrowings.
However, with the lira slipping by more than 50 per cent against the dollar
since the start of the year, many banks face heavy foreign exchange losses
when they come to collect on their loans.
Interbank rates touched 1,000 per cent in March, although rates had
yesterday slipped back to 150 per cent. With this sort of volatility many
banks suffer a mismatch between the interest paid on short-term deposits,
and the income earned on long-term Treasury bills, which they are obliged to
hold to meet central bank reserve requirements. As the economy heads towards
recession, there are deeper worries about asset quality with reports that
even for blue chip companies, banks are having to recapitalise their loans
and roll over interest.
Banks such as the Sabanci group's Akbank, which have a strong deposit base
and are less dependent on foreign funding, are likely to be best off. It is
among the smaller, non-deposit taking banks that the losses are likely to be
most acute.
There are particular reasons for the troubles at TYT and its parent company
Lapis Holding. Last July, the group agreed a Dollars 213m takeover of an 89
per cent stake in Disbank, a small trade finance bank for Dollars 213m,
Isbank, the semi-autonomous state bank. This was Turkey's largest bank
takeover. Isbank was paid one installment of Dollars 75m, but took
promissory notes from Lapis for the remainder, secured by Disbank shares. In
the wake of TYT's troubles, Isbank confirmed this week it had re-acquired
Disbank.
The broader issue concerns the quality of official bank supervision. Why,
for example, was Lapis, better known as a gold trader and tour operator,
given Treasury permission to take over Disbank, a reputable trade finance
bank?
If TYT's demise is to foreshadow a series of bank failures, the government
is presented with a much larger headache. Until now, insolvent private banks
were always bailed out by the state. Given the government's cash
constraints, a similar course seems unlikely today. However, bankers point
out that Turkey's rudimentary insurance scheme will cover barely a fraction
of the amounts due to depositors and correspondent banks.
Mr Aykon Dogan, the economy minister, recently gave the banking sector a
clean bill of health. Among officials in Ankara, concern at bank failures is
tempered by anxiety not to be seen to rush in to bail out the shareholders.
'You make money. You can lose money too. That's a fact of life,' said a
Treasury official.
Foreign exchange losses are one area of concern. The recent currency
turbulence will have hit profitability as banks seek to close their open
foreign exchange positions - the difference between foreign exchange
liabilities and Turkish lira assets. At the end of 1993 the total open
position of the banking sector stood at Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn.
According to an unofficial estimate, over the last few weeks, bank foreign
exchange losses have totalled more three times what they made in profits on
their open positions in the whole of 1993.
These problems may pale beside the possible losses from non-performing
loans. During the first quarter, bankers were able to collect on interest
payments. But with many industries standing down labour and slowing
production, the second quarter could be much more difficult. Liquidity is
particularly tight for companies dependent on government contracts.
'The problem is that at this time you should have zero credits, zero T-bills
and a surplus of dollars - and who's in that position?' said Mr Haluk
Dayigil of Korfezbank.

quarter

An unsettled labour force in the run-up to South Africa's first all-race
elections was responsible for a 5.2 per cent drop in production for the
March quarter at Gengold, the gold mining division of South Africa's Gencor
group.
However, a higher gold price meant that after-tax profit declined only 3 per
cent to R106m (Dollars 20m), compared with R110.5m in the preceding three
months, and was still sharply up on the R75.3m for the same period last
year.
Due to reduced capital expenditure, distributable income rose from R78.2m to
R82.3m in the quarter, but total gold output declined to 15.87 tonnes from
16.7 tonnes in the December quarter as the effect of short strikes at a
number of the group's mines affected output. Overall gold yield remained
unchanged at 5.9 grammes/tonne.
The average gold price received was R39,663 a kg, well up on the previous
quarter's R37,992 but still short of the spot price as a result of the
group's hedging operations. However, Mr Tom Dale, general manager for
finance, said that no further hedging arrangements would be undertaken at
this stage and all forward sale contracts would be completed by May.
Of the group's big mines, Beatrix, Kinross and Winkelhaak mines all turned
in satisfactory performances, with Winkelhaak boosting after-tax income to
R12.9m from R9.3m.
The poorest results came from Buffelsfontein, which was affected by five
fires, three seismic events and a brief illegal strike. Production dropped
to 3,080 tonnes from 3,500 tonnes in the December quarter.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rapid volume growth in the developing world and an improvement in gross
margins helped Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, report a 6
per cent increase in first-quarter net income to Dollars 149.6m, excluding
the effect of last year's accounting changes.
Turnover rose to Dollars 1.77bn from Dollars 1.7bn and earnings per share,
driven up by a stock repurchasing programme that removed 8 per cent of the
issued equity, rose by 15 per cent to 98 cents.
Colgate-Palmolive's shareholders are used to seeing the fastest growth
coming from the company's markets in Latin America, Asia and Africa, because
its older markets in North America and Europe are mature.
Yesterday, it appeared the trend might have reversed when the company
reported an unusually large unit volume growth of 4 per cent in its North
American market, attributing the gain to new products like Irish Spring
liquid soap and Palmolive Ultra dishwashing powder.
However, Colgate-Palmolive said the value of sales in North America had
declined because of continuing pressure on prices in the highly competitive
US market.
In the developing world, Colgate-Asia/Africa saw a 23 per cent increase in
net volume, with 'outstanding' performances from Malaysia, Hong Kong, China
and South Africa. Colgate-Latin America saw a broad-based 9 per cent
increase in volume growth. Colgate-Europe increased volume by 1 per cent.

WMX Technologies, the US waste management and environmental group, yesterday
reported a decline in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 162.6m, or 34 cents
a share, from Dollars 199.2m, or 41 cents, in the same 1993 quarter.
Sales were little changed at Dollars 2.3bn, against Dollars 2.1bn a year
ago. The group continued to suffer from the negative effects of weakness in
the hazardous waste disposal industry, the company said.
WMX is the parent company of Chemical Waste Management, Rust International,
Wheelabrator Technologies and Waste Management International.
Chemical Waste Management saw first-quarter earnings drop substantially to
Dollars 9.8m, from Dollars 21.3m in the first quarter of 1993.
'Conditions in the hazardous waste industry remain difficult. However, the
company is on schedule with its restructuring programme and continues its
efforts to lower costs,' said Mr Dean Buntrock, WMX chairman.
He said first-quarter earnings in all subsidiaries were hit by severe winter
weather. However, Mr Buntrock was confident of better trading during the
rest of this year.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Unsettled outlook for Kidder
Peabody - The bank's position after the discovery of false trading profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be no basic change in the strategy,' insists Mr Michael
Carpenter, the British-born chairman of Kidder Peabody.
But for the US investment bank, wracked by the discovery that its top US
government bond trader falsified trading profits of Dollars 350m, the future
looks anything but settled.
One of the main sources of the bank's reported income of the past two years
turns out to have been faked. And an investigation under way into how the
alleged fraud arose could yet force big changes to the company's management
and operations.
Coming just as Kidder appeared to be on the rebound from a lacklustre
performance in the early 1990s, the news could hardly have been timed more
badly. On the surface, the Dollars 350m of falsified bond trading profits
over which Kidder sacked the trader, Mr Joseph Jett, appear to account for a
large part of the firm's reported income in recent periods. Last year, it
made pre-tax profits of Dollars 439m, up from Dollars 300m the year before
and Dollars 119m in 1991. In the four years before this, the bank made a
profit once, in 1988.
According to Mr Carpenter, though, Kidder's earnings power is stronger than
this picture suggests. Excluding the falsified profits reported last year,
he says, and before paying bonuses and building its reserves, the firm made
Dollars 750m.
Much of that came from the bank's powerful fixed-income securities
operations, the one area where it has established a clear lead over other
securities houses. Underwriting and trading mortgage-backed securities has
been the strongest element of this, with Kidder handling as much as a
quarter of all new mortgage-backed securities issues last year.
'It has been the clear leader,' says a mortgage-backed trader in another
bank. Mr Mike Vranos, head of this business, is reputed to have earned a
bonus considerably in excess of the Dollars 9m paid to Mr Jett for 1993.
Kidder has also established a strong position in the junk bond market, where
it underwrote over 10 per cent of new issues last year as the market for
sub-investment grade debt in the US sprang back to life.
These activities have pushed Kidder up the underwriting league tables, even
though it has made less headway in the mainstream equity and investment
grade bond markets.
In Europe, the story is much the same. Although Kidder was an early arrival
in London in 1957, it reached 20th position in the International Financing
Review's Eurobond league table last year, due largely to its strong presence
in the floating rate note sector, where its underwriting clout was exceeded
only by that of Merrill Lynch.
Its reliance on bond markets, and the mortgage-backed market in particular,
has not served Kidder well so far this year. After allowing for the faked
profits in the first quarter, Mr Carpenter puts Kidder's earnings at
'certainly above Dollars 100m, probably above Dollars 125m'  - at an
annualised rate, well below the Dollars 750m of last year.
Part of the problem has been the fall-off in issuance of mortgage-backed
securities. Also, Kidder has taken a loss of around Dollars 25m on margin
trades entered into with Askin Capital Management, a hedge fund group which
has been forced by trading losses to seek protection from its creditors.
'The Askin situation got out of control much more quickly than any of us
thought it could,' says Mr Carpenter. He denies, though, that this
demonstrated a failure of control similar to the failure which allowed Mr
Jett to report fictitious profits.
Kidder chose to take a bigger credit risk than normal with Askin, given the
profitability of the trading relationship and 'our assessment of the values
of the collateral and the kind of margin we needed to liquidate our position
in the event of difficulty,' Mr Carpenter says. In the event, Kidder was
caught out by the upheaval in the mortgage-backed markets as much as Askin
was.
Despite these factors, Mr Carpenter says: 'The earning power of the
franchise is still very strong, obviously depending on market conditions.'
Kidder has been building up its investment banking operations virtually from
the day in 1989 that Mr Carpenter was parachuted into Kidder by its parent,
General Electric. At that time, the firm was reeling from an insider trading
scandal and many of its top investment bankers were leaving. It has also
been trying to grow its equity operations, those these remain far weaker
than its fixed income business.
Two questions remain. Will the fallout from the Jett scandal throw Kidder
off-course? And will it lead parent GE to reconsider selling the firm?
Both Mr Jack Welch and Mr Carpenter say that the episode has not undermined
the relationship between parent and subsidiary. GE, though, has never felt
comfortable with Kidder, of which it bought 80 per cent in 1986 for Dollars
600m.
Persistent rumours of its intention to sell the bank swirled virtually from
the beginning, and have subsided in the past two years only as Kidder has
appeared to rebuild its profits. That a large part of the success was phoney
has already restarted tongues wagging on Wall Street.

<TEXT>
General Electric, which this week revealed that a phantom trading scheme at
its Kidder Peabody investment bank would depress first-quarter profits,
yesterday announced a 1.6 per cent dip in net earnings after taking a
Dollars 210m charge over the Kidder embarrassment.
The group reported earnings of Dollars 1.068bn, or Dollars 1.25 a share,
down from Dollars 1.085bn, or Dollars 1.27, in the same period of last year.
The non-cash Kidder charge worked through at 25 cents a share, of which 16
cents, or Dollars 139m, was related to trading activities in previous
quarters.
Excluding the charge, GE's figures were in line with Wall Street
expectations and were struck on revenues which rose 10 per cent to Dollars
14.2bn.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said nothing had changed the fundamental global
strengths of the business 'and with innovative new product introductions and
our increasing international market penetration, we remain committed to
deliver record earnings for the year'.
The group's operating margin rose in the quarter to 12.5 per cent from last
year's 12 per cent. GE said six businesses, including the NBC television
network, appliances, motors and electric distribution and control, had
improved their margin rates by more than a point.
GE Capital's reported earnings rose 20 per cent, led by retailer financing,
commercial real estate, auto leasing, financial guaranty insurance and
commercial equipment financing. However, the profits of GE's entire
financial services operations fell sharply to Dollars 330m because of the
charge.

<TEXT>
Great-West Life and Confederation Life, Canada's third and fourth-biggest
life assurers, are negotiating an alliance under which Great-West could end
up with a substantial stake in Confederation.
Confederation, hit in recent years by heavy losses on its mortgage
portfolio, said the talks were aimed at strengthening its capital base and
creating a 'strategic alliance'. No details have been disclosed.
The talks underline the upheaval in Canada's insurance sector, which has
been caused by competition from other financial institutions. Recent
regulatory reforms allow insurance companies to move into other sectors.
Great-West is 86 per cent owned by Power Financial, the Montreal-based
financial services group controlled by Mr Paul Desmarais. It posted a 72 per
cent rise in net income last year to CDollars 196m (USDollars 142m).
Great-West has assets of about CDollars 23bn. Confederation has assets of
about CDollars 20bn, but profits fell to CDollars 1.9m in 1992 from CDollars
105.7m in 1990.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: First-quarter rise at
BankAmerica due to cost cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BankAmerica, the second largest banking group in the US, yesterday reported
a modest increase in first-quarter earnings to Dollars 513m, or Dollars 1.27
a share. In the same quarter last year, the bank earned a profit of Dollars
484m, or Dollars 1.19.
The improvement in earnings, however, was due entirely to cost reductions
and lower loan loss provisions, which helped offset reductions in trading
and net interest income.
Like the rest of the industry, BankAmerica suffered in the latest quarter
from the sharp rise in US interest rates, which squeezed its net interest
margin, and from unfavourable conditions in the equities, bond and currency
markets, which cut into trading profits.
BankAmerica said that net interest income declined by 3 per cent to Dollars
1.79bn as the bank's net interest margin shrank by 27 basis points to 4.46
per cent. The total of loans outstanding in the quarter was little changed
compared with a year earlier, at Dollars 123.4bn.
Non-interest income fell 8 per cent to just over Dollars 1bn, a reflection
primarily of a drop in trading income to Dollars 74m from Dollars 164m a
year ago. Various fee and commission incomes, however, held steady.
Non-interest expenses fell almost 3 per cent in the quarter to Dollars
1.78bn, its lowest level since the 1992 merger with rival California bank,
Security Pacific.
Provisions for loan losses were Dollars 125m, almost half what they were in
the same quarter a year ago.
Yesterday's results had little impact on BankAmerica's share price, which
edged Dollars  1/2 higher to Dollars 42 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, yesterday said it would
oppose the partnership announced last week between Delta Air Lines of the US
and Virgin Atlantic of the UK. Nor did it believe the US government would
permit it.
The partnership would give Delta access to London's Heathrow airport by
allowing it to book blocks of seats on Virgin's flights in and out of the
airport and sell them as Delta flights, using Delta flight codes.
American Airlines has a strong interest in the proposal because it is one of
only two US carriers with the right to fly in and out of Heathrow. The other
is United Airlines.
Mr Michael Durham, American Airlines' chief financial officer, claimed
yesterday the US was unlikely to permit the arrangement without a
renegotiation of its aviation treaty with the UK. This was because Delta had
no authorisation for the routes or the Heathrow landing slots under the
existing treaty.
He was speaking as AMR, American Airlines' parent, reported first-quarter
net losses of Dollars 7m, or 30 cents a share, compared with net losses of
Dollars 22m, or 43 cents, last time. It blamed the losses on fare
discounting and bad winter weather.
The company had warned last month its first-quarter losses would be bigger
than the 24 cents a share analysts were then predicting.
Group revenues were Dollars 3.81bn in the quarter, virtually unchanged from
last time, but the airline's revenues were down by 2.2 per cent. Losses were
reduced because the airline cut capacity, and fuel costs were nearly 10 per
cent lower.
Mr Robert Crandall, AMR chairman, said the actions the airline was taking -
re-allocating and reducing capacity, refining yield management techniques,
focusing on the cargo business, and cutting costs - were working.
'In that sense, we are encouraged,' he said.
Mr Durham said the airline expected to be profitable this year. 'We do not
expect to be adequately profitable, in relation to our assets, but we do
expect to make money,' he said.

<TEXT>
Caterpillar, the Illinois-based manufacturer of engines and heavy equipment,
reported record sales and earnings in the first quarter, and said demand for
its products in Europe had begun to improve.
However, the results fell short of Wall Street expectations, and
Caterpillar's stock dropped by Dollars 4 1/2 to close at Dollars 103 7/8 on
the New York Stock Exchange.
Earnings jumped to Dollars 192m, or Dollars 1.89 a share, from Dollars 34m,
or 34 cents a share, in the 1993 first quarter.
Sales rose to Dollars 3.28bn, from Dollars 2.69bn a year earlier. Sales
within the US were up 21 per cent at Dollars 1.65bn, while sales outside the
US advanced by 23 per cent, to Dollars 1.52bn.
'Return on sales in the first quarter was almost 6 per cent, about double
the rate for all of last year,' said Mr Donald Fites, chairman.
'That's a significant improvement and we anticipate further improvements as
European economies, which have been depressed, pick up momentum.'
Analysts noted that much of the improvement in Caterpillar's sales outside
the US was the result of dealers building inventories during the quarter,
and positioning for anticipated demand. In last year's first quarter,
dealers were trimming inventories in response to weak demand.
Caterpillar said that at the end of the quarter its worldwide workforce
totalled 51,671, up 3 per cent from a year earlier. Two years after the
United Auto Workers union ended an acrimonious strike at Caterpillar's
factories, the union and the company still do not have a contract.
'Product and shipment volumes from UAW-represented facilities, however,
continue to meet or exceed plans. Quality levels continue to exceed
pre-strike levels,' the company said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inco, the world's biggest nickel producer, expects world supply and demand
for the metal to be roughly in balance by the second quarter of this year.
However, Mr Michael Sopko, chairman, indicated to the annual meeting in
Toronto yesterday that producers may have to cut output further to restore
equilibrium.
Mr Sopko singled out a continuing surge in exports from Russia, due mainly
to a collapse in domestic consumption, for over-supply in world markets.
However, he added: 'It is also up to the rest of us in the industry to take
responsible action to bring supply and demand into better balance.'
He insisted that Inco, which announced production cuts late last year, 'will
not shoulder the entire burden'. The company's priorities were 'to drive
down costs, improve our competitiveness and defend our market share'.
Inco suffered a first-quarter loss of USDollars 60.9m, or 53 cents a share,
up from Dollars 23.6m, or 22 cents, a year earlier. Revenues dropped to
Dollars 523.8m from Dollars 542.8m.
The latest losses reflect charges of Dollars 104m to cover the cost of staff
cuts and production shutdowns.
First-quarter nickel prices averaged Dollars 2.77 a pound, down from Dollars
2.95 a year earlier, but above the Dollars 2.42 realised in the final
quarter of 1993.
However, the market has weakened again recently in response to the rise in
North American interest rates and the collapse in Russian demand. London
Metal Exchange stocks have continued to rise. Nickel was trading yesterday
on the exchange at about Dollars 2.45.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cominco, the Canadian metals producer, returned to profit in the first
quarter, helped by lower costs at the Trail metallurgical complex in British
Columbia, higher output from the Red Dog zinc mine in Alaska, and a weaker
Canadian dollar.
Net earnings were CDollars 2.3m (USDollars 1.15m), or two cents a share,
compared with a loss of CDollars 36.8m, or 47 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues dipped to CDollars 261.5m from CDollars 290.7m, but the latest
figure includes a CDollars 25.3m gain from the sale of exploration
properties.
Red Dog's zinc concentrate production was 12 per cent higher than last year.
Following numerous technical and geological problems, the mine reached its
annualised design capacity in the first three months of this year.
Higher zinc and lead output also helped reduce costs at Trail. The company
said recent changes in water-rental rates paid to the provincial government
would save about CDollars 7m a year.

<TEXT>
Travelers, the diversified US financial services group formerly known as
Primerica, reported operating income of Dollars 342.6m in the first quarter.
This was broadly in line with earnings in the previous three months from
comparable operations.
However, operating earnings per share fell to 99 cents from Dollars 1.10 as
the company issued new shares to pay for its acquisition of the Travelers
Insurance company, completed at the end of the year.
After a Dollars 2.8m loss on investments, net income was Dollars 340m, or 98
cents a share.
Smith Barney Shearson, the group's brokerage arm, reported operating profits
of Dollars 144.3m in the quarter, similar to the previous period and
equivalent to a return on equity of 26.6 per cent.
Income from trading in financial markets was Dollars 239.4m.
Mr Sanford Weill, chairman, said he was 'very pleased' with Smith Barney's
results. But he said 'we fully expect that the months ahead could be
somewhat difficult, and are proceeding with caution.'
Life insurance businesses accounted for after-tax profits of Dollars 121.4m,
while property/ casualty insurance returned Dollars 384.7m.
These results are not comparable with earlier periods due to the completion
of the takeover of Travelers Insurance at the end of the year.
Mr Weill said: 'We are starting to see some benefits from our aggressive
cost reduction program (in the insurance businesses) and expect the savings
pace to pick up as the year progresses.'
Travelers' consumer finance business, the only part of the group unaffected
by the acquisitions of last year, recorded a 5 per cent increase in revenues
from a year before, to Dollars 299.6m, and a 5 per cent increase in net
income, to Dollars 48.3m.
In the final three months of 1993, the new Travelers group reported
operating earnings of Dollars 276.6m, with the old Travelers insurance
company making Dollars 61m.

Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, two big US drug groups, said yesterday that
good performances by their most important products had boosted profits and
revenues in the first quarter.
The results were the latest in a series of earnings reports suggesting
steady growth in the sector in early 1994.
Of the two companies reporting yesterday, Pfizer was the most impressive.
The company's shares jumped Dollars 2 to close at Dollars 57 3/4 in New York
after it revealed a 13 per cent increase in net income, to Dollars 370.7m,
against Dollars 329m in the first quarter of 1993. Earnings per share were
up 17 per cent at Dollars 1.18.
The results were slightly ahead of most Wall Street forecasts. Mr Jonathan
Gelles, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, expected earnings of Dollars 1.17 a
share. He said the result was particularly encouraging in view of a jump in
Pzifer's effective tax rate, to 30 per cent from 26 per cent last year.
Revenues were 6 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.98bn. Its four newest drugs, up
62 per cent, made a strong contribution. Procardia XL, a cardiovascular drug
which showed an 11 per cent decline in the fourth quarter, staged an
encouraging recovery. A sharp fall by Feldene, an arthritis treatment facing
generic competition, was an offsetting factor.
'The substantial increase in sales volume of our new products continues to
be the underlying strength of our company,' said Mr William Steere, chairman
and chief executive. He said revenue growth largely reflected higher
volumes, rather than price increases.
Bristol-Myers Squibb showed more modest gains, and Wall Street responded
accordingly.
The shares closed unchanged at Dollars 52 1/4 after the company posted net
income up 1 per cent at Dollars 580.9m, against Dollars 574.7m a year
earlier.
The scant improvement largely reflected higher taxes. At the pre-tax level,
earnings were 6 per cent better. The company said cost-cutting had helped to
lift margins.
Overall, revenues were up 3 per cent at Dollars 2.8bn. A 6 per cent advance
in pharmaceuticals sales was somewhat offset by a 9 per cent decline in
consumer products, which include Ban anti-perspirant and Excedrin
pain-reliever. Capoten, a cardiovascular drug which is the company's
best-seller, performed well, despite increased competition.

Mr Martin Davis, former chairman and chief executive of Paramount
Communications, has formed a new company, Wellspring Associates, AP-DJ
reports from New York.
He said Wellspring would specialise in investing in undervalued companies
that required restructuring.
Mr Davis stepped down as chairman and chief executive of Paramount last
month following the completion of the first step of the merger of Paramount
and Viacom. Paramount is now a majority-owned subsidiary of Viacom.
Mr Donald Oresman, who quit as executive vice-president, is joining Mr Davis

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Market turmoil hits trading
profits at Bankers Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The turmoil in international financial markets in February and March all but
wiped out reported trading profits at Bankers Trust, the US commercial bank
which has been one of the pioneers of the derivatives markets in recent
years.
The bank said trading income was Dollars 14m in the first quarter, down from
a record Dollars 449m in the previous three months and Dollars 346m in the
first quarter of 1993.
It said this did not represent a complete picture of overall trading
results. Some Dollars 177m, reported as net interest income, had been earned
on holdings of bonds. If this is added in, overall trading income was
Dollars 191m, compared with Dollars 463m last year.
The bank blamed the decline on 'sharply lower revenue from proprietary
trading and positioning activities'.
Trading in foreign exchange, government bonds and emerging market debt and
equity securities suffered the most, it said.
The fall in trading income was offset in part by higher income from selling
derivatives and other risk-management instruments, it added.
These activities are under a cloud following threatened legal action last
week by Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, which incurred
after-tax losses of Dollars 102m on two interest rate swaps contracts it
bought from Bankers Trust.
Mr Charles Sanford, Bankers Trust chairman and chief executive, told the
annual meeting: 'We will win if they (Procter &amp; Gamble) want to sue us.' He
declined to comment on the specifics of the case, other than to say Bankers
Trust has no legal liability.
Despite the deteriorating trading results, the bank limited the fall in its
after-tax profits to Dollars 164m, or Dollars 1.90 a share, from Dollars
230m, or Dollars 2.64 a share, a year ago (before accounting changes).
Bonuses paid to staff tumbled by Dollars 109m, to Dollars 162m. Other
sources of income, such as fund management fees and other fees and
commissions, rose by around Dollars 100m.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Inco cautions on nickel output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inco, the world's biggest nickel producer, expects world supply and demand
for the metal to be roughly in balance by the second quarter of this year.
However, Mr Michael Sopko, chairman, indicated to the annual meeting in
Toronto yesterday that producers may have to cut output further to restore
equilibrium.
Mr Sopko singled out a continuing surge in exports from Russia, due mainly
to a collapse in domestic consumption, for over-supply in world markets.
However, he added: 'It is also up to the rest of us in the industry to take
responsible action to bring supply and demand into better balance.'
He insisted that Inco, which announced production cuts late last year, 'will
not shoulder the entire burden'. The company's priorities were 'to drive
down costs, improve our competitiveness and defend our market share'.
Inco suffered a first-quarter loss of USDollars 60.9m, or 53 cents a share,
up from Dollars 23.6m, or 22 cents, a year earlier. Revenues dropped to
Dollars 523.8m from Dollars 542.8m.
The latest losses reflect charges of Dollars 104m to cover the cost of staff
cuts and production shutdowns.
First-quarter nickel prices averaged Dollars 2.77 a pound, down from Dollars
2.95 a year earlier, but above the Dollars 2.42 realised in the final
quarter of 1993.
However, the market has weakened again recently in response to the rise in
North American interest rates and the collapse in Russian demand. London
Metal Exchange stocks have continued to rise. Nickel was trading yesterday
on the exchange at about Dollars 2.45.
Inco projects a long-term annual growth rate of between 2 and 3 per cent in
nickel demand. However, Mr Sopko cautioned that 'there are bound to be ups
and downs along the way'.
In anticipation of a long-term improvement, the company plans to expand
output by about 20 per cent by the end of the decade. Half of this will come
from existing facilities. The biggest new project is likely to be a fourth
line at 58 per cent-owned PT Inco of Indonesia.
Mr Sopko promised 'an even leaner, more assertive Inco.

quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lockheed, the US defence group, reported a 21 per cent increase in
first-quarter net earnings.
It attributed the performance mainly to good results in its aeronautical
systems and electronic systems divisions.
The company made Dollars 92m, or Dollars 1.45 a share, compared with Dollars
76m, or Dollars 1.22, in the same period of last year. Revenues totalled
Dollars 3bn, up 21 per cent on last year's Dollars 2.5bn.
Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman, said the company had also produced 'significant
positive cashflow and continued the rapid improvement in our financial
position'.
It had generated net free cashflow after dividends of more than Dollars
240m. At the end of the period, its net debt-to-capital ratio was 38 per
cent, down from 48 per cent a year ago.
Programmes which had particularly strong first-quarter results included the
F-16 fighter, the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and the F-22, the
new-generation fighter under development.
The total backlog at the end of the quarter was Dollars 28.2bn, down from
Dollars 28.9bn at the end of December.
Business other than US defence contracts rose to 39 per cent of sales at the
end of the quarter, compared with 34 per cent a year ago.
This amount included the group's sales to foreign governments, which made up
16 per cent of total revenues, compared with 10 per cent a year ago.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: ITT lifted by better economic
conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate, reported a 28 per cent increase in first-quarter
net income, powered by higher income in its insurance, automotive parts and
hotels businesses.
The group made Dollars 219m, or Dollars 1.67 a fully diluted share, against
Dollars 175m, or Dollars 1.30, a year earlier. Sales and revenues from
ongoing businesses totalled Dollars 5.5bn, up 7 per cent.
Mr Rand Araskog, chairman, said the performance reflected 'improving US
economic fundamentals and the benefits of previous and continuing cost
improvement programmes'.
The financial and business services group made Dollars 237m, up from Dollars
231m, due to a jump in income to Dollars 190m from Dollars 156m at the
Hartford insurance subsidiary.
Hartford's rise came in spite of the the Los Angeles earthquake and the
severe US winter, which helped produce catastrophe losses in excess of
expectations at Dollars 40m after tax, or 31 cents a share. Hartford was the
primary contributor to group portfolio gains of Dollars 35m, or 27 cents.
The manufactured products group made Dollars 88m, up from Dollars 45m, with
income at the automotive business rising from Dollars 32m to Dollars 60m,
defence and electronics at Dollars 11m compared with break-even, and fluid
technology up from Dollars 13m to Dollars 17m. The automotive improvement
was attributed to higher sales, mainly in North America, and cost reduction
programmes.
The Sheraton hotels group had income of Dollars 29m, up from Dollars 16m.
Much of this was due to gaming operations at the Sheraton Desert Inn in Las
Vegas, which exceeded expectations in its first full quarter under Sheraton
control.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMR, parent of American Airlines, the second biggest US airline, yesterday
blamed fare discounting and bad winter weather for a net loss of Dollars 7m
in the first quarter, equivalent to 30 cents a share.
The figure represented an improvement from the previous year's net loss of
Dollars 22m, or 43 cents, but fell short of what analysts had hoped to see
in the light of growth in the US economy.
The shares shed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 53 1/8 in early trading.
Last month, American Airlines warned its first-quarter losses would be
bigger than the 24 cents a share analysts had then been predicting. This was
largely because it lost Dollars 46m in February after exceptionally severe
weather and low fares.
Group revenues were Dollars 3.81bn, virtually unchanged from last time.
However, the airline's revenues were down by 2.2 per cent. Losses were
reduced because the airline also achieved a 2.6 per cent cut in operating
expenses.

<TEXT>
Dean Witter Discover, the US brokerage firm spun off as an independent
company last year by the retailer Sears, Roebuck, reported record
first-quarter earnings of Dollars 209.5m, or Dollars 1.23 a share.
That was an increase of 54 per cent on last year's first-quarter earnings of
Dollars 136.4m, or per share income, on a pro-forma basis, of 80 cents.
First-quarter operating revenues were Dollars 1.27bn, up 17 per cent from
Dollars 1.08bn.
Dean Witter's Discover Card credit card operations outperformed its
securities business. The credit card division saw operating revenues rise 33
per cent to Dollars 542.4m, from Dollars 408.7m in last year's first
quarter.
Net operating revenues for Dean Witter's securities business edged up 8 per
cent in the first quarter, to Dollars 727.7m, from Dollars 672.9m a year
ago.
The company said that the assets it managed in its securities business grew
14 per cent in the quarter, to Dollars 70.9bn, and that managed loans
increased 15 per cent, to Dollars 20.5bn.
The company added 2.4m new Discover Card accounts in the quarter, bringing
the total to 29.6m.
In its securities business, Dean Witter added 536 account executives in the
first quarter, bringing its total sales force to 7,701 brokers.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, yesterday reported a 16.9 per cent
increase in first-quarter net income. It attributed the result to growth in
long-distance services and equipment manufacturing, as well as
cost-controls.
The largest US long-distance company produced net income of Dollars 1.09bn,
or 80 cents a share, compared with Dollars 936m, or 69 cents, in the same
period of last year, before special accounting charges.
The figures, struck on revenues which rose 5.3 per cent to Dollars 16.56bn,
were slightly ahead of the mean Wall Street forecast, which was for earnings
of 79 cents a share.
Mr Robert Allen, chairman, told the annual meeting he was 'particularly
encouraged by some of the underlying trends because I believe they bode well
for the rest of the year'. The meeting voted to change the group's name to
AT&amp;T from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
The group's core long-distance business, which is embroiled in a fierce
battle for market share, saw calling volume grow 7 per cent, while revenues
rose 3 per cent to Dollars 10.22bn.
Important factors behind this were the improving US economy and AT&amp;T's
aggressive new consumer marketing campaign, 'True Rewards'. Long-distance
margins were 38.8 per cent, up nearly 2 percentage points on the same period
of 1993.
In products and systems, revenues grew more than 14 per cent to Dollars
4.07bn. Communications products for consumers and businesses led the
improvement, with double digit growth.
'Sales of cellular, corded and cordless telephones, as well as private
telephone systems for small and medium-sized businesses and submarine cable
systems were particularly strong,' AT&amp;T said.
Sales of network equipment - bought mainly by telephone service companies -
rose 11 per cent to Dollars 1.95bn.
However, AT&amp;T's computer business - formerly known as NCR - reported a loss
of Dollars 57m, up from Dollars 14m a year ago. This was blamed on price
competition and the impact of a restructuring which began at the end of last
year. Product sales were up 5 per cent.
The group's revenues from financial services, spearheaded by its AT&amp;T credit
card, rose 21 per cent to Dollars 691m.
Mr Allen told the annual meeting cost-cutting had helped AT&amp;T achieve its
goal of at least 10 per cent earnings growth recently.

Christian Dior, the French fashion house that holds a large minority stake
in the LVMH luxury goods group, yesterday announced a 9 per cent increase in
net profits to FFr876m (Dollars 148m) last year from FFr803m in 1992.
Mr Bernard Arnault, whose holding companies control both LVMH and Dior, said
that the latter was on course for large profits growth in 1994 if it could
sustain the strong sales growth shown in the first quarter. The board
proposed raising the net dividend to FFr9.00 from FFr8.40.
Dior, like other high fashion houses, was badly affected in the early 1990s
by the downturn in the global luxury goods market.
The company's net profits peaked at FFr5.3bn in 1989, two years before it
went public on the Paris stock market, and then fell steadily until the
increase last year.
However, the pressures on the international luxury goods industry have eased
recently.
Dior saw sales rise by 10 per cent to FFr24.62bn in 1993 from FFr22.4bn in
1992. The rate of sales growth accelerated towards the end of last year with
the upward trend continuing during the opening months of 1994. Dior's sales
rose by 27 per cent in February against the same month in 1993.
The old Dior fashion house last year produced a net profit of FFr116m.
However, the bulk of the company's profits, about FFr760m, came from the 25
per cent stake in LVMH held through its 55 per cent tranche of its Jacques
Rober subsidiary. Dior is expected soon to stage a capital increase
following the complex deal negotiated earlier this year by Mr Arnault to
unravel LVMH's cross-shareholding agreement with Guinness, the UK drinks
group.

Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP), Portugal's largest quoted company,
registered a 5.8 per cent rise in net earnings during the first three months
of 1994, compared with the same period last year, to Es5.45bn (Dollars
31.3m).
Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, president, attributed the growth to an increase
in the margin between loan and deposits and a broadening of the bank's
retail customer base amid signs that the Portuguese economy was beginning to
recover from recession.
Net assets increased 17 per cent to Es1,889bn over the 12 months to March.
Total deposits rose 14.4 per cent to Es1,478bn and loans grew 15.2 per cent
to Es834bn. The bank more than doubled assets invested in unit trusts to
Es575bn. Earnings per share increased from Es47 to Es49.7.
Mr Jardim Goncalves said the first-quarter results were affected by the
setting aside of Es3bn in provisions against bad debt.

Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group, yesterday reported that its net
losses narrowed in 1993 to L96bn (Dollars 57m), compared with L154bn in
1992, and reinforced its earlier forecasts of a return to net profit in
1994.
The more positive attitude at Pirelli follows three years of net losses, and
more than two years of painful restructuring. In 1992-93, Pirelli set aside
L550bn to pay for rationalisation, including 10,000 redundancies and the
shedding of one of its three divisions.
Yesterday's statement said the return to profit would still depend on the
level of recovery in the company's principal market, but the group reported
that it was making profits at the operating level - L32bn in 1993, compared
with a loss of L93bn in 1992. Group sales in 1993 rose 12 per cent to
L9,210bn from L8,252bn.
The group was pushed into net loss last year by extraordinary charges of
L128bn. It expects provisions over the last two years to cover all
foreseeable restructuring.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Engineer outlines his Italian
renaissance - De Benedetti groups are riding post-election stock market
euphoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is little love lost between L'Ingegnere (The Engineer) and Il
Cavaliere (The Knight) - alias, respectively, Mr Carlo De Benedetti,
chairman of Olivetti, the Italian computer company, and Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, media magnate and prospective Italian prime minister.
However, Mr Berlusconi's victory in last month's election, at the head of
the right-wing Freedom Alliance, has brought mainly good news for Mr De
Benedetti. Within the last two weeks, on the back of post-election stock
market euphoria, Italian companies in which the De Benedetti family has an
interest have announced plans for large share and convertible bond issues.
At the same time, eight Italian and foreign banks have set up a stand-by
credit of Dollars 280m for Olivetti. In Paris, Cerus - Mr De Benedetti's
French holding company with interests in automotive components, financial
services and packaging - is seeking FFr858m (Dollars 145m) through a rights
issue.
The Italian industrialist, who last year suffered the indignity of a day in
jail during an investigation into kickbacks Olivetti paid to Italian
politicians, seems to be bouncing back.
The early 1990s have been difficult for all the principal De Benedetti
companies, both from a public relations and a financial point of view.
Olivetti, hit by the downturn in the computer market, lost L650bn (Dollars
384m) in 1992, although it succeeded in raising L903bn through a rights
issue last spring. Cerus, dragged down by its loss-making banking operation
Dumenil Leble, lost FFr1.55bn in 1992.
The impact was felt down to the roots of the De Benedetti family tree.
The two Italian holding companies - Cir, which has stakes in Olivetti and
Cerus, and Cofide, with its large holding in Cir - both announced net losses
for 1992. The De Benedettis, who own nearly 40 per cent of Cofide, were
forced to grin and bear it.
However, according to analysts, 1993 may have been the turning point. Both
Cofide and Cir have just announced net profits for last year. Olivetti and
Cerus expect to break even, respectively at operating profit and net profit
level, during 1994, and complete far-reaching rationalisation plans.
Just before the polls closed in last month's election, Italy's outgoing
technocratic government awarded the licence for the country's GSM mobile
telecommunications network to the Omnitel/Pronto Italia consortium led by
Olivetti. Victory was sweet for Mr De Benedetti, especially as the computer
group's principal opponent was a consortium headed by Mr Berlusconi's
Fininvest company.
That announcement triggered most of the fund-raising announced in the last
fortnight. Olivetti estimates that its one-third share in the consortium
will commit it to a L1,000bn investment in the mobile telecoms network over
the next two to three years, during which the new division will lose money.
The convertible bond issue announced at the beginning of the month could
raise L500bn to L600bn, and the stand-by credit will help cover the rest, if
necessary.
To maintain its stake in Olivetti and in Cerus after the share issues, Cir
has also asked shareholders for between L500bn and L600bn through a
convertible bond issue.
The surplus cash should cut borrowings built up when Cir subscribed to last
year's Olivetti rights issue. In the same way, Cofide has announced a
L154.2bn rights issue to cover its share of the Cir issue.
Cash is not only being poured from one De Benedetti bucket into another. Not
counting cross-subscription by the different groups to related companies'
share and bond issues, an estimated L1bn of new money could still be raised,
assuming shareholders approve the operations at meetings in the next few
weeks. That cash could be used to improve the holding companies' ability to
back organic growth or acquisitions by their subsidiaries as the Italian and
European economies begin to strengthen.
Mr Rodolfo De Benedetti, Carlo's son and the chief executive of Cir, says
one should not look at the recent operations as part of a grand De Benedetti
group strategy. 'We're a group in the sense that there's a common
shareholder between all these companies, but we are not a group in the sense
of a conglomerate,' he explains.
Nonetheless, analysts detect an opportunistic flair in the plans which they
say is one man's inspiration. 'Obviously these are decisions which come from
a precise industrial strategy devised by l'Ingegnere,' comments Mr Matteo
Ghilotti of Euromobiliare, the Milan merchant bank.
As for the potential for further jousts with Mr Berlusconi, Mr De
Benedetti's people are tactfully tight-lipped. But there seems little doubt
that if a new Italian government fails to create the conditions for De
Benedetti companies to pursue the first faint signs of recovery, the
engineer will be quick to criticise his erstwhile rival.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: USAir hit by low-fare rivals and
bad weather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USAir, the troubled US airline in which British Airways holds a 24.6 per
cent stake, yesterday reported net losses of Dollars 196.7m for the first
quarter. This compared with a loss of Dollars 61m for the same period in the
previous year before changes in accounting rules.
The group said it was seeking the agreement of its labour unions to an
Dollars 800m cost-cutting plan.
Early last month, USAir had warned it would report a loss of about Dollars
200m in the first quarter because of competition from low-cost rivals and
severe winter weather.
Yesterday, the company said about Dollars 50m of this year's first-quarter
loss resulted from weather-related flight delays and cancellations, implying
the rest was due to its inability to compete with low-fare rivals such as
Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines.
British Airways has made clear to USAir that it is not prepared to invest
more money in its US partner until it has an effective cost reduction plan
and its financial performance improves.
USAir is the most heavily loss-making of all US airlines. It is the least
efficient, with unit costs of 11.3 cents per available passenger mile, more
than 25 per cent higher than the average recorded by the other big US
carriers last year.
Mr Seth Schofield, USAir's chairman and chief executive, told analysts he
wanted to get unit costs down to 10 cents a mile so the airline could better
compete with its low-cost rivals. That would mean an Dollars 800m-a-year cut
in its operating costs.
Part of these are expected to be secured through more efficient use of the
company's assets and employees - for example, by achieving faster turnround
times at airports. But most will have to come through labour concessions.
It said one option could be to offer employees shares in the company in
return for concessions, as several other US airlines have done.

FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Dasa pushed to record deficit by
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring costs totalling DM1.1bn (Dollars 647m) pushed Deutsche
Aerospace (Dasa), the civil and military aerospace arm of Daimler-Benz, to a
record group net loss of DM694m last year, more than double the deficit for
1992.
Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chief executive, warned yesterday that 1994 would be
another difficult year, but he expected the group to be back in the black by
1995.
The most painful part of the group's programme of cost-cutting and capacity
reduction - involving at least 16,000 job losses by 1996 - had been set in
train, he said. The payroll was cut by 8,200 last year to 86,000. The
redundancies accounted for a large part of the one-off restructuring costs.
Although the sharp cut in Germany's defence spending was an important factor
behind a 10 per cent drop in turnover, down to DM18.6bn from DM20.65bn, Mr
Schrempp expressed optimism about the continuing importance of defence
technology to Dasa.
The military share of the group's turnover had been cut over the past four
years to just 27 per cent from more than 50 per cent, he said, but he was
confident German government spending on military research and development,
at 18 per cent of the budget, could be reduced no further.
Mr Schrempp trimmed his confidence about returning to the black by 1995 with
the proviso 'that the political-economic environment is not going from bad
to worse'.
Dasa's share in the profits of Airbus Industrie, in which it has a 37.9 per
cent stake, amounted to just DM160m in 1993, compared with DM411m in 1992.
This has to be set against three-figure losses in the other aerospace
subsidiaries - Dornier, Eurocopter, Fokker and MTU, its aero-engine
manufacturer.
Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer in which Dasa acquired a controlling
interest 12 months ago, will have a new capital injection in the course of
1994, according to Mr Manfred Bischoff, the group finance director. He said
in spite of heavy initial losses, 'there is no reason to panic'.
Mr Schrempp expected Fokker to break even by 1995, and produce profits from
1996. The company had drawn up 'a promising adjustment programme,' he said.
'We will show that Dutch-German co-operation can work excellently.'

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Simon pulled back from the brink - Maurice
Dixson's changes at the engineering company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Maurice Dixson has seized Simon Engineering by the scruff of the neck and
in eight action-packed months dragged it back from the brink of
receivership.
The speed of change at the group, best known for making access equipment
such as fire rescue gear, is likely to slow following the announcement just
before Easter of a Pounds 52.5m rights issue. Mr Dixson has described the
issue as 'the cornerstone that puts us on a sound financial footing'.
The issue was flagged earlier in March, when the group announced a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 160.3m for 1993. But Mr Dixson was determined not to go ahead
until protracted negotiations with the group's many lenders had been finally
untangled.
The talks were concluded on March 30, leaving Simon with new banking and
bonding facilities, from Lloyds and Barclays in the UK and from the Fifth
Third Bank in the US, on completion of the rights issue.
Since Mr Dixson became chief executive on September 1 last year his main
priority has been to drive down debt through a programme of tighter controls
and disposals. Shining through the flood of red ink in the 1993 results were
two signs of hope.
Debt had been reduced from Pounds 148m when Mr Dixson took over to Pounds
117.8m at the year end and the cash haemorrhage had been staunched, mainly
by getting working capital down.
In the first half the net cash outflow was Pounds 43.7m. In the second half
there was a net cash inflow of Pounds 13.1m.
The debt reduction has been achieved by disposals, mainly the sale in
January of its 50 per cent share in TR Oil Services for Pounds 6.2m and
February's sale of Unichem International to the Western Company of North
America for Dollars 19.8m (Pounds 13.5m). The two sales ended Simon's
involvement in chemical services.
Further disposals are likely, particularly Simon Petroleum Technology, which
incurred losses of Pounds 5.5m for 1993, compared with profits of Pounds
2.6m in 1992. This division includes Robertson, the oil exploration group
which accounted for almost half the Pounds 101.5m of goodwill written off
last year.
Market conditions have been behind the bad performance in this division, but
after the rights issue, Simon will be able to take its time with the
disposal. Mr Dixson thinks it is a good business with good people. It could
be sold this year but only 'if we can get the right deal'.
Mr Dixson's overall strategy is to concentrate on three core businesses  -
the access division, the storage division and Simon-Carves, the process
engineering contractor. He believes the three are complementary.
Of the three only storage reported an operating profit for the year, up from
Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 8.5m on turnover of Pounds 42.6m (Pounds 39.3m). Mr
Dixson sees this as a stable business with strong potential for growth and
assets that can be used as a hedge for Simon-Carves, where the assets are
people and technology.
In addition the division has the only deep water site on Humberside not
owned by Associated British Ports. The 200-acre site already has good road
and rail heads in place, and the group is seeking to unlock the value.
Access incurred a loss of Pounds 14.2m, including exceptional losses of
Pounds 10.3m, on turnover sharply ahead at Pounds 161.7m (Pounds 134.8m).
This compared with a profit of Pounds 2.2m in 1992.
However, Mr Dixson sees plenty of opportunity for this division to build on
its world market share of 15 per cent. The management has been replaced and
European production is being concentrated in Gloucester. Once the
restructuring is completed this summer, he sees no reason why the division
should not be returning 10 per cent.
Losses at Simon-Carves rose from Pounds 1m in 1992 to Pounds 3m last year on
turnover down from Pounds 89.2m to Pounds 51.3m. Mr Dixson says the division
completed its Pounds 260m contract to build an electronic factory at Yerevan
in Armenia at the end of 1992 with very little on its order books.
He believes, however, that the group is well poised to take advantage of an
upturn in demand. It will be further helped by new banking and bonding
facilities.
In order to carry through his plans Mr Dixson has reorganised the board. He
appointed Mr Tim Redburn, formerly of Lep, as finance director, in place of
Mr Alan Jarvis, and precipitated the resignation of Mr John Barker, who was
responsible for building Simon into the world's biggest producer of powered
access equipment.
Of the old guard, the sole survivor is Mr Peter Cook, aboard since 1977,
who, in January, was relieved of his responsibilities as managing director
of the industrial services division. He has been concentrating on the
disposal programme, and will be retiring at the end of the year.
Mr Ron Wheeler, who replaced Mr Barker at the head of access, has not been
given a seat on the board. Mr Dixson has also appointed Mr Guppy Dhariwal,
an old GEC colleague, as financial director of access.
Under the 5-for-9 rights issue the group is issuing 55.9m new shares at
100p. The issue, fully underwritten by Hill Samuel and SG Warburg, was
approved by shareholders last Friday. Pro forma gearing will be cut from 264
per cent to 51 per cent, with a further reduction expected by the end of the
year.
City analysts believe this year should see the completion of Simon's
restructuring, with benefits starting to flow through to shareholders in
1995. 'It's not a new era dawning,' said one. 'But they are in control.'
Mr Dixson is more positive, yesterday buying 22,223 ordinary shares at 115p.
After taking up his rights he will hold 100,000 shares.
'I am completely satisfied that we will be able to build a profitable
engineering group around the three core businesses. We're looking at a
company that really does have a tremendous future.'

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sherwood Computer shares rise despite loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sherwood Computer Services rose 17p to 94p after the financial
software company reported losses of Pounds 1.67m pre-tax for 1993, following
exceptional charges of Pounds 1.86m, against profits of Pounds 3.02m.
The rise more than made up for the fall to 60p in November after the
USM-quoted company issued its second profits warning in four months.
There were no further surprises yesterday with the company still blaming
problems in the local government and Lloyd's insurance markets for operating
losses of Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 2.22m profits). Exceptional costs related
to provisions on leases, redundancy costs and other provisions.
Sherwood has decided to exit from all peripheral activities and since the
year end has sold Venus for Pounds 110,000, concluded an agreement with
Capita to take over Threshold and Household and sold its 25 per cent
interest in Guardian Computer Services for Pounds 825,000.
Losses per share were 35.78p (34.1p earnings) and the final dividend is
passed, leaving the total at 1.75p (7p).

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Havelock Europa stages recovery with Pounds
2.28m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Havelock Europa, the store-fitting company, yesterday met expectations with
a turnround from losses of Pounds 3.07m to profits of Pounds 2.28m pre-tax
for 1993.
Turnover was up 7 per cent at Pounds 35.3m (Pounds 32.9m).
The improvement was attributed to measures taken to reduce the cost base and
raise productivity following the 1992 financial restructuring, as well as to
stronger demand as the economy recovers.
Net cash at the year end was Pounds 2.5m, compared with net debt of Pounds
2.2m.
The company, which last paid a dividend in 1991, is proposing a final of 2p,
payable from earnings of 8.4p (losses 15.4p) per share.
Mr Norman Lessels, chairman, said the payment was a good foundation on which
to base a progressive dividend policy, and reflected the fact that the
company would eventually be subject to a full tax charge.
Havelock, which operates from plants in Dalgety Bay, near Edinburgh, and in
Nottingham, designs, builds and installs commercial interiors. Most of its
turnover comes from retailers, led by Boots and Marks and Spencer, with
further work for Woolworths, Burton and House of Fraser.
It is, however, doing increasing work for the financial services sector
which accounted for 17 per cent of turnover in 1993, against 12 per cent in
1992. 'This will be the major area for our growth,' Mr Hew Balfour, chief
executive, said.
Havelock serves institutions such as National Westminster Bank and the
Co-operative Bank. In 1994 it has installed pre-fabricated installations for
First National Bank of Southern Africa in Johannesburg and for Yapikredit in
Istanbul. On both it worked with AT&amp;T Global Solutions, formerly NCR, which
supplied self-service banking equipment.
Mr Lessels said the order book was substantially ahead of last year's,
though there was marked resistance to price increases in traditional
business.

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Likely Pounds 70m tag for Healthcall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Healthcall, the UK's largest provider of out-of-hours doctors, is planning a
flotation next month via a placing and intermediaries offer which should
value the company at about Pounds 70m.
The Pounds 30m proceeds will pay off borrowings related to its Pounds 41.4m
management buy-out from Air Call in 1990.
The duty doctor service, started almost 30 years ago, provides general
practition-ers with the out-of-hours cover they are obliged to supply.
Four times the size of its nearest competitor - Nestor-BNA's doctor
deputising division - Healthcall has 8,300 subscribers out of the 20,000 GPs
who practice in urban areas. It uses 64 full-time doctors and a pool of
1,400 part-timers, most of whom are subscribers.
In the two years to 1993 the number of annual visits increased by 16 per
cent to 1.29m, helped by last year's flu epidemics, and the duty doctor
service generated 80 per cent of the group's turnover of Pounds 36m (Pounds
31.2m). Group operating profit was Pounds 6.05m, up from Pounds 4.06m in
1991.
The management team, headed by Mr Maurice Henchey, chief executive, believes
the group stands to benefit from many of the changes taking place in the
National Health Service.
'Healthcall is very well-placed to take advantage of the ageing population,
the focus on cost control and efficiency and the increasing emphasis on
providing healthcare through community-based services.'
In addition to the duty doctor operation and its long-established medical
telephone answering service, Healthcall has moved into the provision of eye
care for the elderly and disabled in residential homes. Last month it bought
a small homecare operation in Leicestershire.
The offer is being sponsored by Morgan Grenfell with James Capel as
stockbrokers.
Pricing is expected to be announced on May 5.

issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TR European Growth Trust, a specialist smaller companies investment trust,
is hoping to raise up to Pounds 60m with a conversion share issue.
There have been indications of interest for Pounds 25m of the new shares
during the placing stage.
This could be increased to Pounds 45m, leaving at least Pounds 15m to be
available through a public offer for subscription.
The trust had net assets of Pounds 64.5m at the end of March.
Several recent investment trust share issues have fallen far short of their
initial targets due to difficult market conditions.
However, TR European's shares are trading at a slight premium, which shows
that demand is relatively strong.
The public offer closes on May 13, and conversion should take place by the
end of August.

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Market debut to value Superscape at Pounds
10.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Superscape VR, a pioneer of desktop computer virtual reality software, is
coming to the market via a placing with institutional investors which values
the Aldermaston-based group at Pounds 10.5m.
The group, which was founded in 1983 by Mr Ian Andrew, chief executive, and
was previously known as Dimension International, is the third UK company
associated with advanced VR computer technology to float on the Stock
Exchange.
Bristol-based Division Group came to market in May last year and Virtuality
Group, which designs and manufactures VR computer games, was successfully
floated in October.
The Superscape flotation, sponsored by Henderson Crosthwaite, involves the
placing of 1.75m shares in the group, equivalent to 33 per cent of the
enlarged capital, with institutional investors at 198p each.
Trading is due to begin on April 28.
Some 92 per cent of the shares are being placed on behalf of the company.
The placing, together with a private subscription by ICVEN, an IBM
subsidiary, for 214,646 shares at 158.4p each, will raise about Pounds 3.2m
net of expenses for the group.
The funds will mainly be used to finance the increased cost of marketing
Superscape's software products on an international basis, particularly in
the large and fast growing US market.
Superscape reported a Pounds 73,000 pre-tax loss on turnover of Pounds
390,000 in the six months to January 31 and has forecast a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 450,000 for the year to the end of July, mainly reflecting the costs
of its overseas marketing push including establishing a US marketing
subsidiary.
The group currently exports approximately half of its software.
Its main product, Superscape VRT, is a 'shrink-wrapped' software application
design package which costs Pounds 3,450 and runs on later generations of
industry standard desktop computers.
The software enables customers, including people who are not professional
programmers, to design and develop computer applications which use virtual
reality techniques.

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Recs line up Kleinwort for Grid sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The regional electricity companies yesterday set in motion a potential
disposal worth more than Pounds 1bn when they appointed Kleinwort Benson to
advise on the future of the National Grid, the power transmission company
which they own.
Yesterday's announcement was seen in the City as the precursor to a sale
next year of at least 25 per cent of the National Grid, the monopoly
transmitter of high voltage electricity in England and Wales.
The likely route is through a flotation on the Stock Exchange, although
Kleinwort Benson will look at other possibilities.
These could include issuing shareholders in the regional companies with
equity in the National Grid.
The Grid, which is setting up a telecommunications company, Energis, and is
looking for opportunities to expand abroad, is likely to be valued at about
Pounds 5bn.
Some analysts expect the sale of a second tranche of shares to be sold nine
months to a year after the initial disposal.
Yesterday's announcement said only that directors had decided to 'put in
hand a study of their options in relation to the future of the National Grid
Company.
'(They) have therefore appointed Kleinwort Benson and Herbert Smith (the
legal firm) to advise them.'
One regional power company chairman said last night it was possible the
study would result in no changes. 'We really do want to look at all the
options,' he said.
Analysts believe, however, that it is highly unlikely the regional power
companies will want to remain in control of all the shares in National Grid
as the general election approaches. The Labour Party has said in previous
elections that it wants the state to take control of the Grid.
That would be more difficult to achieve if share ownership were more
diversified.
The timing of any disposal will be influenced by the government's sale of
its 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen, the power generation
companies.
This is expected early next year but could be as soon as this autumn.
Kleinwort Benson, in conjunction with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is advising
the government on the generator sales.

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sharp turnround to Pounds 1.6m at Dencora
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A general improvement in the value of commercial property helped Dencora,
the property and housebuilding group, to its first yearly increase in
profits since 1988.
Pre-tax profit in 1993 was Pounds 1.58m, compared with a loss of Pounds
984,000 in the previous year.
Total turnover - including rental income of Pounds 9.23m (Pounds 8.73m) -
was up by 44 per cent to Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 20.6m).
The group's investment property portfolio increased in value by 5 per cent,
allowing for additions and disposals.
Selling prices in the housing market stabilised after severe reductions in
previous years, but the improvement was not as high as anticipated. The
housebuilding subsidiaries sold 192 houses in the year, compared with 149 in
1992, an increase of 29 per cent.
Basic earnings per share were 3.7p, against losses of 7.4p. Fully diluted
earnings were 5p (losses of 3.3p).
A single distribution of 3.3p (3p) is proposed.
Mr John Bushell, chairman, said that for the year ahead the development
market for commercial property was becoming more active and the group was
'well placed to take advantage of improved market conditions'.
The group also expected an improvement in the housing market, in terms of
demand and selling prices. Most activity for Dencora is anticipated in the
second half of the year, because of the timing of its construction programme
on new sites.

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sales growth puts Bentalls back in the
black at Pounds 1.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bentalls, which operates seven department stores in the south-east of
England, returned to the black for the year to January 29 on the back of
good sales growth.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.75m, compared with losses of Pounds 986,000,
although the the latest figure contained non-recurring profits of Pounds
321,000, largely reflecting successful appeals against the uniform business
rate.
Turnover from continuing operations was 11.3 per cent higher at Pounds
78.9m. Turnover last time of Pounds 72.4m included Pounds 1.55m from
discontinued operations, mainly from the charge card business sold in
November 1992.
Mr John Ryan, finance and property director, said turnover had improved
because of an increased number of customers passing through the store at the
flagship Bentall Centre in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, and a good
performance at the store at Lakeside, Essex, acquired from receivers in 1991
for Pounds 1m. Christmas had seen the emergence of pent-up demand following
the November budget.
He said, however, that sales so far this year had improved by only 6.7 per
cent, reflecting consumer caution ahead of the April tax rises.
The group said that 86 per cent of space at the Bentall Centre, excluding
the department store, had been let. Under an agreement with Norwich Union,
its co-developer, Bentalls will receive a minimum income of Pounds 1.65m a
year from the centre, and does not expect this to be exceeded until 1996.
The high tax charge of Pounds 799,000 (Pounds 872,000 credit) reflected the
company's depreciation policy which is higher than allowed for by the Inland
Revenue. Net interest payable was Pounds 1.74m, compared with Pounds 1.11m
in 1992, when Pounds 1.62m of interest was capitalised.
Earnings per share were 2.25p, against losses of 0.28p. A final dividend of
1.4p is proposed, taking the total to 2p (1.9p).

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: UK Active Value buys 10% of City Site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK Active Value, the invest-ment group behind the restructuring of Greycoat,
the property group, has taken a significant stake in a second UK property
company by buying 10 per cent of City Site Estates.
The purchase coincided with Scottish Provident's sale of its 14.5 per cent
stake in the Glasgow-based property investment and development company,
whose shares closed 10p up at 80p.
UK Active Value is advised by Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger, the
South African corporate financiers who emerged as victors in the battle to
save Greycoat from the receivers. They control 19 per cent of Greycoat,
which owns London landmarks such as Embankment Place and Buckingham Place,
but was hit by rising interest rates and falling property values, putting it
in breach of gearing covenants.
City Site was similarly troubled, recording Pounds 18m losses in 1992, but
it survived without any greater hardship than having to stall on preference
share dividends because of insufficient distributable reserves.
Mr Treger said: 'It is very highly geared, but it is solvent, profitable and
it doesn't have any problems with its banking covenants.'
Scottish Provident has maintained its holding in City Site's 10 per cent
convertible preference shares, but has sold its remaining City Site shares.

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Templeton Emerging expands via conversion
placing and offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust has expanded by Pounds 121.5m as
a result of a placing and public offer of conversion shares.
Up to 140m C-shares were on offer at 100p.
Some Pounds 105m of the total raised came from a placing, with Pounds 16.5m
coming mainly from private investors through the public offer.
The fund was already the largest in the emerging markets sector, and the new
money will increase its assets by about one third. Steady strong demand for
shares in the fund has kept them trading fairly consistently at a premium to
net asset value - currently about 5 per cent - and has enabled Templeton to
make regular new issues.
A scrip issue is planned later in the year to improve liquidity in the
shares.
The C-shares will be converted into new ordinary shares, with new warrants
attached on a 1-for-5 basis, when at least 80 per cent of the new money is
invested - by mid-September at the latest.
Dealings in the C-shares start tomorrow.
The appointment of Mr Nicholas Brady, the former US secretary to the
treasury, as chairman has been confirmed.

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Diversification undermines picture of
health - Maggie Urry considers what the future holds for London
International as it tries to rebuild its finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The real surprise about London International Group, where losses in the year
to March are now expected almost to eliminate net assets of Pounds 120m,
must be that a company with an apparently decent branded business and strong
market positions could find itself in such a parlous state.
The past management, notably Mr Alan Woltz who became chief executive in
1979, adding the chairmanship in 1985, before splitting the roles in 1991,
cannot escape blame.
Many of the problems stem from an ambitious diversification programme in the
early 1980s, which was an attempt to compensate for an expected long-term
decline in the basic condom business.
In 1982 a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report said that LIG's 95 per
cent share of the UK condom market operated against the public interest and
the company was forced to submit to price controls.
Among other ideas, LIG had a flirtation with the fine china industry in the
mid-1980s, but was luckily prevented from going too far.
It was photoprocessing, however, which proved LIG's doom. In 1982 it started
on a trail of acquisitions and rationalisation which cost between Pounds 60m
and Pounds 70m in total resulting in a 30 per cent share of a now sharply
declining market.
The legacy of that diversification is sizeable trading losses, and an even
worse drain on cash, to the extent that if a sale is not tied up soon LIG
may be forced to close the business at even more expense.
No doubt any buyer will be aware of that in negotiating a price for taking
the business away.
While chasing these diversifications, LIG suddenly found that the onset of
the Aids epidemic in the mid-1980s gave new life to its condom and surgical
gloves businesses. But although sales of condoms surged in 1987, growth in
the world market for condoms is now only about 2 or 3 per cent a year.
And LIG does not appear to have managed its UK condom business as well as it
might. Margins are good, but despite price controls effectively deterring
competition, its market share has fallen to 75 per cent. The controls have
just been lifted and LIG aims to increase prices but may find margins weaken
as higher advertising costs will be needed to keep rivals at bay.
In addition, costly rationalisation of the activity has been needed. A
Pounds 10m charge was taken in 1989 with a Pounds 13.4m charge against
surgeon's gloves in 1991.
A Pounds 61.6m rights issue in 1991 was required to repay a convertible
bond, issued to finance the purchase of condom businesses in Italy and
Spain. Group profits in 1992 bore yet more exceptional charges totalling
Pounds 22.5m.
Despite rationalisation and raising new equity, the balance sheet
deteriorated. By March 1993 debt of Pounds 127.7m exceeded net assets. With
cash pouring out of the business, borrowings rose to Pounds 154m by
September last year.
The question now is whether the business which will be left after yet more
cuts and disposals has sufficient potential to persuade shareholders to
provide enough new equity to give it a chance of independent survival.
New management must convince investors that with a restructured balance
sheet, and a reshaped business, the company's core activity of condoms and
gloves has the potential to service its remaining debt and give a good
return.
Profits in the division which LIG plans to keep have been under pressure.
LIG is the leader in the worldwide branded condom sector, holding 22 per
cent of that market, but this accounts for less than half the total market.
And with the price of condoms low, LIG's sales of Pounds 105m in 1992-93 do
not make Durex a substantial global brand.
Surgeon's gloves are an even smaller market, with LIG's sales in 1993 at
Pounds 39.3m. While the group is widely regarded as a technical leader in
its field, it is not a very large field. With chunks of its sales going to
various health services, LIG could be vulnerable to penny-pinching and
supplier reductions.
With industrial gloves, domestic rubber gloves and a rump of the health and
beauty products business, LIG might have on-going sales of Pounds 250m which
could produce profits of Pounds 35m before interest charges, one analyst
estimates.
LIG then gets into the problem of how much debt it can support.
A smaller equity issue, of say Pounds 50m, would leave more debt, but result
in lower pre-tax profits and earnings per share. Reducing debt further,
through a larger equity issue, perhaps up to Pounds 100m, would mean greater
dilution to earnings per share.
One analyst reckons the shares, which closed yesterday at 114p, down 7p
after an 8p fall on Tuesday, are still overvalued. Without a bid, he thinks
the shares are worth between 40p and 50p, while a predator might be prepared
to pay about 75p.
Another calculates that it would take a Pounds 100m rights issue to reduce
gearing to 50 per cent by 1996. That would probably take a 2-for-3 issue,
substantially cutting earnings per share.
Whether the rights issue is Pounds 50m or Pounds 100m, shareholders will
have to think hard before throwing good money after bad.

FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Country Casuals static at Pounds 2.62m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Country Casuals Holdings, the women's wear group, yesterday reported flat
pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.62m following a year of unsteady demand and
rising start-up costs for new outlets.
Although profits rose marginally on the Pounds 2.58m reported last time, the
improvement was due wholly to increased interest receivable - up from Pounds
40,000 to Pounds 155,000 in the year to January 22.
Mr John Shannon, chairman, said the underlying business was held back by a
weak first half and disruption caused by the reorganisation of its Wild
Women chain and the restructuring of House of Lerose, the clothing supplier
acquired last year for Pounds 10.8m.
'There were operational difficulties at Wild Women and the name was too
extreme for a national chain,' he said. The outlets have since been
relaunched under the Koto banner.
The group, meanwhile, sold the Dutch printing subsidiary inherited from
Lerose and set about withdrawing from the wholesale business.
The reorganisation led to a Pounds 45,000 loss on new operations and
contributed to reduced operating profits of Pounds 2.51m (Pounds 2.58m).
The performance was also dented by 'pre-opening expenses' at Elvi, the new
chain of larger-size clothing outlets, which were written off against
profits.
Nevertheless, a second half upturn in the core Country Casuals business  -
representing 163 of its 205 outlets - helped lift turnover to Pounds 40.9m
(Pounds 34.8m), including Pounds 3.6m from new acquisitions.
Earnings per share fell from 10.64p to 9.57p.
An increased final dividend of 2.89p is proposed, making a 4.3p total for
the year, against a pro forma 4.05p.

FT  21 APR 94 / Revolution cracks the mould: How the big four's strategies
have diverged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Taylor was employing his rhetorical skills yesterday to play down
the significance of his decision to 'move marbles from one jar to another'
at Barclays. Yet the reorganisation of the largest UK bank contributes to a
gradual but revolutionary change taking place in the industry.
Since the last century and the regional bank mergers that culminated in the
'big four', Barclays, National Westminster, Lloyds and Midland have been
hard to tell apart. They have been run by bankers who worked their way up
through the lending hierarchy, emerging from the same mould.
This means banks have tended to adopt similar lending policies; they have
made a poor job of managing investment banking arms; and they moved in a
herd into new markets without analysing them well.
Mr Brian Pitman's emphasis at Lloyds on judging all operations by the
yardstick of return on equity has now gained universal acceptance among UK
banks. Indeed, Mr Taylor said yesterday that he would like to have more
internal competition at Barclays for the use of capital.
Mr Taylor's proposed reforms address two issues with which other clearing
banks have struggled. The first is how to respond to the growing tendency of
large and medium-sized business to raise money on capital markets; the
second is the need to improve the standard of management.
Yesterday's move mainly dealt with the first point, but was intended to
allow him to see more clearly how to achieve the second. He ended the split
between the two large divisions covering investment banking and commercial
banking, creating a new group covering all services to large companies.
He explained this as 'trying to use all the organisational string and
plaster I can' to make sure that lending bankers co-operate with those
offering services such as securities custody, cash handling and equity
underwriting.
Each of the big four now has a different approach to this conundrum. NatWest
put corporate lending within investment banking; Midland divided the two
after trying to combine them three years ago in a similar group to that
proposed at Barclays; Lloyds does not have an investment banking arm.
Mr Keith Whitson, Midland's chief executive says that HSBC abolished the
Midland Montagu group, which combined lending to large companies with
broking, because it was hard to combine the cultures. Lending bankers wanted
to develop relationships, while brokers were driven by single transactions.
Mr Whitson says Midland preserves the divide between the functions but
brings teams of specialists together. It also emphasises that it will not
tolerate disputes. 'Debates on how to divide the fees may arise
occasionally, but we hit them on the head very hard,' he says.
NatWest placed corporate banking within its investment bank NatWest Markets
18 months ago. This was part of changes by its new management, which
included creating a new group head office to which its four divisions
report. About 200 people - some of the most senior recruited from outside -
form this group.
Mr Derek Wanless, NatWest chief executive, argues that the split between the
head office and operating arms - which Mr Taylor says he may implement at
Barclays - is vital in imposing discipline. It also encourages managers at
the centre to plan strategy and allocate capital among operations better.
'There was always a view before that the headquarters was essentially part
of the clearing bank, which was going to struggle to understand other parts
of the business,' he says. Mr Wanless says it was important to recruit some
executives from outside banking to give the right mix of skills.
Mr Taylor expressed similar thoughts yesterday: 'It may well be that at some
stage we will need to refresh the group by bringing in people at the
centre.' Such refreshment is likely to reinforce the process by which the
big four are slowly becoming easier to distinguish.

FT  21 APR 94 / Compaq earnings leap 108%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Compaq Computer's first quarter earnings surpassed all analysts'
expectations, with a jump in gross profit margins and strong sales growth
worldwide.
Net income for the quarter reached a record Dollars 213m (Pounds 144m), an
increase of 108 per cent from Dollars 102m in last year's first quarter.
Earnings per share advanced to Dollars 2.39 from Dollars 1.23, up 94 per
cent.
Sales jumped 41 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn, from Dollars 1.6bn last year.
Analysts said Compaq appeared to be winning market share from all of its
competitors, including International Business Machines. North American
revenues surged 52 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 1.2bn. European sales
were up 26 per cent at Dollars 829m, while sales in other regions grew by 68
per cent to Dollars 239m.
The earnings performance was well above analyst's projections of about
Dollars 1.68 per share. Compaq's shares closed at Dollars 101 7/8 in New
York, up Dollars 3 1/8 .
Gross margins jumped by four percentage points to 27.1 per cent of revenues.
The increase reflected strong sales of Compaq's higher-margin network
servers, said Mr Andreas Barth, senior vice-president in charge of European
operations.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and chief executive officer, has set a goal
for Compaq to overtake IBM and Apple Computer to become the world's largest
PC manufacturer by 1996.
'With such tremendous momentum we have a really good chance of achieving
that goal,' said Mr Barth. 'In Europe we are already in second place, behind
IBM and we expect to achieve first place within the next two years.'
Compaq's biggest challenge is meeting demand. During the quarter, demand
outstripped supply in several product categories, the company said.
The company recently announced plans to expand manufacturing and
distribution operations in the US, Scotland and Singapore.
It also announced it would open its first Latin American manufacturing
facility in Brazil, and expected to begin production at a plant in Shenzhen,
China, by the end of the second quarter.
To finance growth, Compaq recently raised Dollars 300m with a debt offering.

FT  21 APR 94 / Taylor reforms Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief executive, yesterday stamped his
presence on the UK's largest bank by breaking up its divisional structure
and replacing it with a set of management groups reporting directly to him.
His reforms, including the creation of a group offering services to large
companies, reduce the influence of Mr Alastair Robinson, head of the former
banking division, who was a leading internal contender to be chief
executive.
The role of Mr Robinson was 'being nibbled away in the sense that the job he
is doing ceases to exist', but his skills would be used in other ways, said
Mr Taylor, who arrived from Courtaulds Textiles in January.
He said Mr Robinson was 'a very valuable colleague' but pointed out that he
would retire in three years' time. Mr Robinson's remit will include private
banking and retail banking in Africa and the Caribbean.
The reforms, which Mr Taylor described as a first step, created groups
covering big companies and European retail banking. The new group for UK
retail banking will report to Mr Taylor for the first time.
Mr Graham Pimlott, chief executive of merchant banking at the BZW investment
banking arm, is to head the group serving large companies.
The bank's former service businesses division - one of three with banking
and BZW - will be divided. Mr Joseph De Feo, its chief executive, will
retain charge of technology while custody switches to Mr Pimlott's control.
Mr Taylor said that he hoped to spend more time observing operating
businesses, and less on tasks such as supervising 'a zillion central
departments' and chairing executive committee meetings at Barclays' head
office in the City.
Mr Robinson, a vice-chairman of Barclays, will also deputise for Mr Taylor
in his absence. 'I want Alastair (Robinson) to help me by taking on a lot of
the central load here.' He said further reforms were likely to separate the
bank's group functions from its operating arms. Barclays had been divided
too heavily into different divisions and legal entities. 'This place is
statutory entity-mad. I wish I could find the person who does it and stop
him,' said Mr Taylor.

FT  21 APR 94 / Europe may echo US banks' troubles

<TEXT>
A spate of poor first-quarter trading profits by US banks, due to turmoil in
the financial markets, has sparked concern that similar declines may hit
European bank earnings.
'A few banks made huge amounts out of the markets last year, and that can't
be repeated,' warned Mr John Aitken, banks analyst at UBS. 'It is
overwhelmingly likely you will get a sharp reduction in trading profits.' He
added that the UK stock market did not appear to have taken account of
potentially weak trading earnings. Most European banks do not report
first-quarter earnings, so the first complete information on this year's
performance will not be available until July or August.
However, two Swiss banks indicated yesterday that their first-quarter
earnings were hurt by the sharp falls in world bond and stock markets. Swiss
Bank Corporation said in a quarterly statement that operating profits in
February and March were 'below expectations' and cited a drop in trading
revenues 'due to the sudden deterioration in international financial
markets'.
According to Ms Jennifer Oliver Martin, European banking analyst at Morgan
Stanley, the Swiss banks are 'very reliant on trading profits', with an
average of 35 per cent of income coming from trading, compared with 6 per
cent for German banks.
Mr Michael Lever, director of equity research at Nomura, said dealing
profits across the UK banking sector rose to 10 per cent of total income
last year, from 7 per cent in 1992. 'We have factored in a 25 per cent
reduction in dealing profits across the board.'
However, European banks are likely to be less vulnerable to declines in
trading income than their US counterparts. US banks tend to be more reliant
on proprietary trading - taking positions on market movements using their
own capital - which means earnings are likely to be more cyclical. Also, a
substantial portion of US bank losses came from emerging market debt
trading, where few European banks are leading participants.
Safra Republic, the Geneva- based private banking group, reported its
trading account swung from a Dollars 1.7m (Pounds 1.16m) profit in the first
quarter of 1993 to a Dollars 2.66m quarterly loss.

FT  21 APR 94 / Schneider investigation will look at the role of banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Frankfurt state prosecutor's office is examining the role of the banks
in the collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property group last week.
Mr Hans-Hermann Eckert, a spokesman for the prosecuting authorities of the
state of Hesse, said he could not rule out the possibility that banks would
be suspected of 'involvement in fraudulent activity' or 'abetment to
fraudulent activity' in the case. The group went bankrupt with debts of
DM5bn (Pounds 2bn).
Mr Eckert made it clear the role of the banks would be examined in the
investigation into the affairs of Mr Jurgen Schneider, the property
entrepreneur whose disappearance two weeks ago triggered the crisis at the
group which bears his name.
Deutsche Bank, the German bank which is the largest creditor to the
Schneider group with outstanding loans of DM1.2bn, said it welcomed the
state prosecutor's investigations as a means to clear up the Schneider fraud
case. It said it was confident the investigations would not yield any basis
for prosecution against the bank. The bank has already faced complaints from
prosecuting authorities that it withheld information after finding out about
Mr Schneider's departure on April 7, four days before the group's problems
were made public. This has been vigorously denied.
Separately yesterday, tenants of the prestigious Madler-Passage development
in the heart of the eastern German city of Leipzig, launched a legal action
against Mr Schneider.
The tenants, who rented from CIP, Mr Schneider's property agency, said they
had unknowingly made their monthly rental payments into an anonymous account
since 1992. An estimated DM3m was paid in each year, but none of the
payments can be traced, the tenants allege.
The claim follows Deutsche Bank's own legal action in which the bank alleged
that Mr Schneider had presented it with fraudulent information when making
an application for credit to finance the Zeilgalerie shopping development in
the Frankfurt city centre.
Mr Schneider's whereabouts were still unclear yesterday despite claims by
Die Welt newspaper that he was on a small island near Sarasota on the coast
of Florida.

FT  21 APR 94 / Bimec gives up struggle to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bimec Industries, once a stock market favourite for its focus on
environmental services, yesterday gave up the struggle for survival just
eight months after bankers agreed a Pounds 13m rescue.
Despite three restructurings in six years, and the abrupt departure of its
controversial entrepreneur and chairman, Mr Sam Smith, the water and waste
treatment engineer called in accountants Arthur Andersen as administrative
receiver.
Mr Roy Barber, the company doctor appointed in 1992 who had previously
failed to save Astra Holdings, the munitions group linked to the Iraqi
supergun affair, said Bimec was unable to generate enough cash to carry it
through the summer.
The group's cash resources were almost Pounds 4m below target due to several
unexpected difficulties, including a payment dispute with the UK government,
delays on a water treatment contract in Belize and a shortfall in disposal
proceeds.
Lloyds Bank said yesterday it had refused to increased facilities following
an investigation by Arthur Andersen, jointly commissioned from Bimec and the
bank. The report concluded Bimec would need at least a further Pounds 2m in
working capital, which it could not repay.
In August, Lloyds agreed a refinancing in which it wrote off Pounds 5m in
debt and converted a further Pounds 3.5m into an 8 per cent stake in Bimec.
The bank had also provided a Pounds 5m working capital facility, which was
increased to Pounds 7.5m this year.
Bimec's total exposure to Lloyds is about Pounds 10m, of which about Pounds
7m is secured. Trade creditors are estimated at a further Pounds 7m.
Two of the group's profitable subsidiaries, Three Star Engineering and Dewey
Water, are not in receivership. These companies will be sold.
The group's difficulties date back to Mr Smith's chairmanship, when the
company sought to build its environmental business through acquisition to
take advantage of the newly-privatised water industry.
However, last year Mr Barber reported losses of Pounds 27m, after a Pounds
10.9m write-off to cover the overstatement of past profits. Bimec had
launched proceedings to sue the former auditors Grant Thornton for
negligence. The receivers are expected to examine the case.

FT  21 APR 94 / New order nobleman, In ascent at summer's crest, By spring
was felled: William Dawkins on Morihiro Hosokawa's poetic finale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cherry blossoms of Shinjuku gardens, a hardy double-bloomed variety, are
among the last to fall in Tokyo.
It was poetically appropriate that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa put in an appearance
at the gardens yesterday for the final official display of his ephemeral
administration, the prime minister's annual blossom viewing party.
Mr Hosokawa and Shinjuku's fragrant pink blossoms will both fall in the next
few days, each marking the end of a different kind of spring. Will they both
fade into obscurity?
The parallel was not lost on the 7,000 or so members of Tokyo's elite who
yesterday morning joined Mr Hosokawa for a celebration tinged with
nostalgia.
The more literary of the politicians staged an informal competition for the
most apt haiku, a three-line unrhyming poem.
'A flower does not lament. It takes one day at a time,' proffered one member
of parliament.
Another part-time poet, Mr Satsuki Eda, minister for science and technology,
was also inspired by the brief life of the petals:
'Blossom falls without providing peace of mind.'
Mr Eda was doubtless thinking of his government colleagues who could not
join the party. They were locked in smoke-filled rooms for the 12th day of
negotiations about the next coalition.
By the evening, party officals were a fraction closer to agreement on
unpoetic things such as national security, North Korea and tax, indicating
that they might just make a decision before the last of Tokyo's blossoms
fall.
Mr Hosokawa, who has confessed recently to feeling like a caged bird that
has just been freed, looked relaxed.
He strolled amiably among the striped tents, barrels of sake and tables of
provisions, undismayed by the pressing crowds. The aristocratic prime
minister admitted he had no particular plans beyond taking things easy.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, his likely successor, did not join the haiku competition,
being more of a musician than a poet - he is reputedly one of the finest
karaoke singers in the Japanese parliament.
'I just came here quietly to enjoy the cherry blossom,' he told a television
interviewer.
It could, given the storminess of Mr Hosokawa's eight-month government, have
been Mr Hata's last opportunity for quiet enjoyment for some time.

FT  21 APR 94 / Buthelezi looks to poll slogan to achieve a miracle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ULUNDI, KWAZULU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'Go for the bottom.' With that catchy slogan, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi,
leader of the Inkatha Freedom party, yesterday launched an energetic, if
belated, campaign for next week's South African elections.
He meant the bottom of the ballot paper, the spot reserved for Inkatha as
the tardiest entrant to the election campaign. Chief Buthelezi explained
this to several thousand followers at his first campaign rally yesterday,
delivering an impromptu lecture on voter education - as well as an extended
eulogy of self-congratulation - to Zulu warriors brandishing spears and
firearms in the Inkatha tradition.
Carefully limiting all damage in advance, Chief Buthelezi told a patient
crowd at Ulundi, the capital of the KwaZulu 'homeland' which he heads, that
it would be 'a miracle' if Inkatha did well in the poll, given its late
entry to the race. But as a man who believes in miracles  - he has portrayed
the last-minute peace deal which brought Inkatha into the elections as a
divine intervention - the chief believes Inkatha will still achieve a
miraculous result.
If it does not, his officials made clear, Inkatha will simply reject the
result. 'The elections will not be free and fair if IFP does not win in
Natal,' said Mr Albert Mncwango, an Inkatha central committee member,
prompting nightmare visions of an Angolan-style violent rejection of the
poll outcome.
'We are going to vote, even if they shoot at us and kill us, we go, we go,
we go,' his supporters sang to the tune of a liberation song popularised by
the African National Congress. Indeed, Inkatha appeared to be borrowing
heavily from the rhetorical repertoire of the ANC: chants such as 'Amandla'
(power) could almost be patented by the ANC. The war song, 'We are soldiers
who never sleep', sung by the crowd, is almost the anthem of the ANC
military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation). Mr Mncwango insists
the ANC stole it from the IFP.
The crowd was large and obedient, a reflection of the disciplined Inkatha
party machine which is spewing out election posters by the thousands. One
popular placard said: 'When the time is right, vote IFP.' Chief Buthelezi
made clear yesterday the right time had come.
As always, Chief Buthelezi's message was both traditional and modern: men
wore robes of leopardskin with trainers; women dressed in bead skirts and
covered the bare breasts of tradition with brassieres. But mostly, in the
custom of leaders throughout Africa, Chief Buthelezi's aim was to celebrate
his own person.

FT  21 APR 94 / IMF seeks labour reform to cut Europe's jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp rise in unemployment in Europe during the past two decades can
only be reversed by comprehensive labour market reforms, the International
Monetary Fund warned yesterday in its World Economic Outlook.
Against the grim background of Fund projections of a jobless rate of 11.9
per cent in the European Union this year, it calls on Europe to push through
basic reforms of its unemployment insurance systems, minimum wage laws,
employment protection regulations and 'distortions' that hamper job
creation.
In a hard-hitting section, the IMF says most recent moves to increase labour
market flexibility in Europe 'attempt to correct distortions stemming from
labour market regulations rather than to change the regulations themselves'.
The IMF makes clear its support for more flexible labour markets on the US
pattern.
Stronger growth and higher levels of employment, as in the US, mean larger
income gains for the economy as a whole, it said. Worries about the 'working
poor' can be offset by the redistribution of income to help the low-paid
through the tax and benefit system.
The Fund doubts whether European labour market regulations reduce income
inequalities. Over-generous unemployment benefits can cause unemployment to
be concentrated in specific segments of society for a long time while high
minimum wages can increase job losses among the young and low skilled.
High payroll taxes, nationwide pay deals that hit companies in weaker
sectors and regions, and restrictions on laying off workers were blamed for
adding to the high level of unemployment in Europe. The IMF also identified
similar problems in Australia. It argues that the 'bulk' of such
unemployment, in Europe and Australia, is now structural, and that its
economic and social costs are 'enormous'.
Mr Flemming Larsen, an IMF economist, yesterday added that reducing
structural unemployment in Europe could generate income for cutting budget
deficits and raising living standards.
The IMF cites New Zealand, where the unemployment rate fell by 2 percentage
points between March 1992 and September 1993, as an example of the benefits
of thoroughgoing labour market reform. The reform of UK industrial relations
in the 1980s may also have contributed to the unusually early decline in
unemployment during the present recovery.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Lex Column: France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French were dragged deeper into recession by linking arms with their
sinking German neighbours. The worry now is they may not receive an equal
upwards tug as the German economy begins to rise. With the French inflation
rate falling to 1.5 per cent and the yield on 10-year OAT bonds rising to
almost 7 per cent, the economy will again be badly squeezed. The
Bundesbank's 12 basis-point cut in the money market repurchase rate provides
some leeway for the French to cut short term rates today. But a small cut
may not be sufficient to reinforce the nascent recovery.
These fears are reflected in the currency market where the franc is again
trading close to its old ERM floor. With the speculators having already fled
the scene, the selling is now coming from serious investors. The independent
Bank of France is exhibiting considerable sang-froid but will not want the
franc to fall too far. That could leave the government screaming for further
monetary easing. The government's habit of buying industrial peace with
state subsidies is jeopardising its budget deficit. It cannot count on
privatisation receipts if the stock market remains so volatile.
The risks escalate if German recovery causes interest rates there to stop
falling. That could leave the French dangling with high real interest rates.
The rise in long bond yields may already be dampening investment and could
rattle the housing market. With property and banking markets still fragile,
the outlook could turn ugly.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Barclays Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Martin Taylor's first management changes at Barclays Bank are gentler
than many had expected. He has not wielded the hatchet, which might have
damaged morale throughout the organisation. The new structure contains the
seeds of something radical just the same. One can quibble about the
uncomfortable position of the UK corporate business division suspended
between the clearing bank and BZW, and about the awkward dual reporting line
of its boss, Mr Graham Pimlott. But the new structure, which will eventually
be reflected in the segmental breakdown of the bank's accounts, will give
group management a better idea of how different parts of the group are
performing. It will also assist in the efficient allocation of capital to
the group's various activities. That will shed light on the overall capital
ratio that Barclays requires, a question which Mr Taylor re-opened soon
after his arrival. He is probably right to argue that more internal
competition for capital could be desirable in a market where slack loan
demand means banks' capital resources are not being stretched.
The more difficult decisions may come as the new structure beds down and the
group can discern which of its parts are delivering real value. Despite the
fanfare with which they were unveiled, Mr Taylor's changes only represent a
good start. More will be needed to keep up the momentum in Barclays' share
price which has out-performed the sector only modestly since his appointment
last August.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo's clean break with its previous chairman's ambition to form a
diversified holding group is welcome. The decision to dispose of interests
in BCP, the consumer products company, and Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical
group, and focus on the motor industry brings to an end a 20-year odyssey
that has included dabbling in crunchy cucumbers, North Sea oil and
stockbroking. The holding company strategy made little sense. Success in
automobiles requires focus. Though the earnings of a single-minded Volvo
will be more volatile, investors are quite capable of constructing
diversified portfolios for themselves.
That does not mean Volvo's new strategy will easily bear fruit. While its
truck operations are strong, it has few comparative advantages in cars. Even
its reputation for safety is being compromised by a marketing campaign
stressing Volvo's aggressive image. The big weakness remains the Swedish
company's insufficient size to earn a good return on investment in new model
development.
Volvo plans to overcome this weakness by forming ad hoc co-operative
ventures with other manufacturers. Such an approach may seem an attractive
way of maintaining independence following the Renault trauma. But it is
doubtful whether Volvo can cut costs and extend its market reach
sufficiently by a piecemeal strategy. With up to Skr40bn coming from the
non-core disposals, getting the cash to invest in cars will not be a
problem. The concern is rather that without effective collaboration that
cash will be frittered away.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the highest ever monthly deficit in March, the Treasury has kept the
1993-94 public sector borrowing requirement Pounds 3.9bn below its own
budget forecast. In normal circumstances, that might have cheered the
gilt-edged market. By beating its target - and changing the rules to count
gilts purchased by banks and building societies as funding - the government
has already tucked away some Pounds 10bn towards this year's borrowing
requirement. That leaves only Pounds 33bn gilts to be sold over the next 12
months, once redemptions and a modest contribution from National Savings are
taken into account. It is a measure of the market's current pessimism that
this seems such a tall order.
With the benefit of hindsight, the authorities might have over-funded by
more when the going was good, even if that meant living with uncomfortably
tight money markets. Selling Pounds 3bn gilts a month will require a deft
touch so long as bond markets remain nervous. Yesterday's rise in gilt
yields in response to higher than expected average earnings shows the
sensitivity. While other labour market indicators are weak, the modest rise
in earnings is unlikely to mark the start of an inflationary spiral. But
there are other reasons for caution: pay settlements are edging higher, the
scope for further interest rate cuts has been called into question,
political worries could again unsettle sterling.
While economic fundamentals were exceptionally benign for bond markets,
funding the PSBR had no discernable impact on gilt yields. Now that the
liquidity flows from the US have dried up, this year could be different.

FT  21 APR 94 / Leading Article: Hard cop, soft cop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, warned the
Bosnian Serbs 'not to test the patience of the world community'. The remark
is significant, since where Serbs are concerned Russia until now has been
easily the most patient member of the UN Security Council.
Mr Kozyrev did not go so far, however, as to accept the advice of his
special envoy Mr Vitaly Churkin, who said on Monday that he was now ready to
support the use of force against the Serbs. The considered view of the
Russian government, issued after a meeting chaired by President Boris
Yeltsin yesterday, is that 'the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the
conflict remains realistic'.
Meanwhile in Brussels, the North Atlantic Council gave a favourable but
cautious response to the request from the UN secretary general, Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, that Nato should make its air power available for the
protection of the UN-proclaimed 'safe areas' in Bosnia. So far Nato air
power has been used only to enforce the no-fly zone, and to defend UN
personnel under direct attack on the ground. But last February Nato used the
threat of air strikes to get the Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from
a 20km zone around Sarajevo, or place them under UN supervision. The plan
now put forward by Mr Boutros Ghali  - and emphatically backed by US
President Bill Clinton - proposes to use the same formula for Gorazde and
the other four 'safe areas'.
Nato ultimatum
This could be presented as even-handed in that, as in Sarajevo, the same
terms would be applied to heavy weapons in the hands of the the Bosnian
government. But the Serbs are bound to see the threat as directed primarily
against them, and after their successful defiance of the UN and Nato in the
last 10 days it cannot be taken for granted that they will comply with a new
ultimatum.
If Nato issues a new ultimatum, therefore, it may well have to act on it;
and since it would be doing so at the UN's request, this would bring both
organisations into direct confrontation with the Serbs. As last week's
events showed, it is no good imagining that in that event the Serbs would
respect the 'neutrality' of UN forces ('Unprofor') on the ground. A policy
of wider air strikes is therefore incompatible with the maintenance of
Unprofor in its present configuration. Either it would have to be regrouped,
reinforced and re-equipped as a combat force ready to fight the Serbs
(presumably in alliance with the Bosnian army); or it would have to be
withdrawn.
Unprofor withdrawal
It is not hard to guess which option the contributing governments would
prefer. None of them has even begun to prepare its domestic public for the
use of its national armed forces to intervene on one side in the Bosnian
war. If the US now expects the UN operation to be turned into such an
intervention, the least it should do is to contribute forces of its own.
Failing that, all concerned must accept that the inescapable corollary of a
wider use of air strikes is the withdrawal of Unprofor; and Nato should
insist that arrangements for withdrawing it as quickly and smoothly as
possible (it will not be easy) are included in Mr Boutros Ghali's plan.
At the same time the UN should lift its embargo on arms supplies to the
Bosnian government. The logic of this embargo, which prevents a member state
from exercising its fundamental right of self-defence, has never been easy
to follow. But once the UN itself has accepted the need to use force against
the Serbs, it would be absurd to continue denying that right to the very
people it is trying to help. Air power alone, it has been said often enough,
will not decide this war. To be effective, it would have to be co-ordinated
with the action of well-equipped Bosnian forces on the ground.
Although such a radical shift in the UN's position would not be easy for
Russia to accept, the remarks of Mr Churkin and Mr Kozyrev show that they
are close to understanding the need for it. They should be given one more
chance to play 'soft cop' to Nato's 'hard cop', as they did so effectively
in February. But that will only work if Nato is seen to be a real hard cop,
not the blundering Dogberry of last week. Moves to withdraw Unprofor, lift
the embargo and prepare for wider air strikes should begin now.

FT  21 APR 94 / Leading Article: Procter and guess what
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial news has acquired a distinctly gamey flavour of late. The
Granite group of hedge funds disappears with Dollars 600m of investors'
money; a top bond trader at US investment bank Kidder Peabody turns out to
have invented Dollars 350m of phantom profits to swell his profit-related
bonus; Bankers Trust sees its trading income collapse from Dollars 449m in
the final quarter of 1993 to a mere Dollars 14m in the first quarter of this
year and is under attack from Procter &amp; Gamble over advice on derivatives.
Is this par for the course, nowadays, in high finance and banking? Or is
something novel afoot?
Whatever the details of the particular stories, the principles involved are
not notably new. Granite owed its problems to a combination of excessive
borrowing and poor financial control over complex investment strategies.
Kidder Peabody has simply been the victim of old-fashioned fraud. As for
Bankers Trust, it is one of many banks where trading profits have been hit
by the fall in global bond markets.
From the point of view of banking supervision, the accelerating rate of
financial innovation may pose problems, but the nature of the risk involved
is entirely familiar. In the main, new instruments like derivatives are
designed to isolate or combine existing risks. In most cases that means
market risk, credit risk or something akin to the risk in insurance
underwriting. If there is a novel aspect in recent events, it may lie more
in a change in the structure of the banking industry itself.
Potential conflicts
Over the past decade or so the proprietary trading activities of wholesale
commercial and investment banks have come to account for a disproportionate
amount of their activity and profit. After a realistic allocation of costs
and provisions, it is in some cases a bigger contributor to profits than net
interest income. Financial intermediation - the task of taking deposits and
lending - has become less profitable and has been shrinking in importance.
Part of the dealing is conducted on behalf of clients, though some consists
of low-risk arbitrage. Yet while bankers tend to talk of their trading
activity as though it is largely to do with servicing their clients, it
appears increasingly to be about looking after themselves. The first-quarter
reports of the US money centre banks have demonstrated the importance of
proprietary trading. In effect, banks are becoming less like banks and more
like marketmakers. As a result, their income must be declining vastly in
quality.
One implication is that banks are involved in potential conflicts of
interest on a much greater scale than their clients have been used to. The
extent of the conflict has probably not always been fully appreciated by the
customers where, as in derivatives, the subject of the banks' advice is
highly complex. And the conflict can be heightened where company financial
executives are no match for much higher-paid, Harvard-educated whizz-kids
from the investment banking fraternity.
Better solution
In wholesale markets, caveat emptor provides a better solution to the
clients' problem than regulation. With derivatives, as with all financial
innovation, there is a learning curve. The bank supervisors' problem may be
another matter. For while the risks in derivatives may fall into familiar
categories, the language and techniques do not. The old men who run the
world's biggest banks do not understand vega and theta, kurtosis parameters
and volatility smiles.
Auditors cannot understand risk in over-the-counter instruments without a
degree of co-operation from traders that flies in the face of the
conventional arm's-length relationship with the audit client. The strength
of the intermediate balance sheets in global markets that connect large
numbers of parties to a given trade may not be known.
There may well be systemic shocks. And the growth of trading activity tends
to strengthen the case for dividing the banking system into a low-risk,
low-return sector covered by deposit insurance and an uninsured higher risk
sector for those who wish to deposit money with banks that have acquired a
penchant for gambling. Taxpayers should not be forced to underwrite the high
rollers of the banking system.

FT  21 APR 94 / Showdown in the last gasp saloon: Smokers and cigarette
makers in the US are facing unprecedented hostility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You've heard of no smoking offices, no smoking flights, no smoking zones and
no smoking days. Now meet the no smoking country - or something well on the
way to it.
Smokers in the US, and the cigarette makers they keep in business, have
never had it so bad. After two decades of relatively ineffectual opposition
from anti-smoking activists, they face an unprecedented outbreak of
hostility from politicians, government officials, business and the public.
In many settings, the expression 'Mind if I smoke?' now prompts the sort of
reaction that might once have been reserved for the suggestion: 'Mind if I
slay?' So reviled has the habit become that, if legislators and their
supporters succeed in their aims, smoking will be regarded as behaviour to
be indulged in furtively, if at all, in the privacy of the home, car, or a
special smoking chamber.
One example of the pressure is a bill before Congress that would ban smoking
in all buildings regularly entered by 10 or more people a week, except the
home. In effect, this would embrace all factories, offices, bars,
restaurants and night clubs - though specially designated smoking rooms
would be permitted if they were sealed off from the rest of the premises and
had separate outdoor ventilation.
That bill, sponsored by the anti-smoking Congressman Henry Waxman and backed
by the Clinton administration, is expected to go to a vote in a
congressional sub-committee in the next few days. Conceivably, it may fail.
But it is only slightly more restrictive than other measures under
consideration or already coming into force.
The US labour department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration is
seeking a federal ban on smoking in the workplace. Since bars, restaurants
and other places of entertainment are also places of work, they would be
included - though, as under the Waxman bill, sealed-off smoking rooms would
be allowed.
The Food and Drug Administration, another federal agency, has claimed it has
evidence that the tobacco industry is adding nicotine to cigarettes to keep
smokers addicted. It has asked Congress to rule whether it should start
controlling the sale of cigarettes as a drug or, alternatively, whether
nicotine in cigarettes should be banned.
The US defence department has banned smoking in all military workplaces,
ranging from military bases to tanks and battleships. The Clinton
administration has also banned smoking in school buildings and health
centres.
Hundreds of ordinances have been passed by states, cities or local
communities banning smoking in public areas. San Francisco, San Jose and
other Californian cities have banned smoking in nearly all indoor spaces
except private houses. New York's city council has unveiled plans to toughen
up existing restrictions on smoking in bars, restaurants and workplaces and
to extend them to outdoor areas such as parks, playgrounds and sports
stadiums.
McDonald's, the fast-food company, has followed examples set by the Taco
Bell and Jack in the Box chains by banning smoking in all 1,400 of its
company-owned (as opposed to franchised) restaurants in the US. Many stores,
shopping malls and sports stadiums are already smoke-free.
President Bill Clinton has proposed a 75-cent-per-packet increase in the
excise tax on 20 cigarettes to 99 cents per packet to help pay for reform of
the US healthcare system. Even this is not enough for some legislators, who
are pushing for a tax increase of up to Dollars 2 per packet.
These developments contrast sharply with earlier history of anti-smoking
activity in the US. Although 30 years have passed since the US surgeon
general, the country's chief medical officer, concluded that smoking could
cause lung cancer and other fatal diseases, until recently the anti-smoking
lobby had found itself outgunned by the tobacco industry.
In Congress, cigarette makers could automatically be assured of support from
representatives of the tobacco-growing states, such as Kentucky, North
Carolina and Virginia. But that was only part of the story. Because of the
millions of dollars the tobacco industry spent on lobbying and contributions
to lawmakers' election campaigns, its political influence extended much
further.
As a result, the US tobacco industry largely escaped stringent anti-smoking
measures. Although health warnings started to appear on cigarette packets in
1966 and cigarette advertising was banned on radio and television in 1969,
almost the only federally imposed restriction on smoking was the ban
applying to domestic flights lasting fewer than six hours, introduced in
1990; and the federal excise tax, though increased several times, is still
only 24 cents a packet.
At the beginning of last year, however, two things happened that changed the
climate. One was a report from the US Environmental Protection Agency that
classified tobacco smoke as a class-A carcinogen and blamed passive smoking
for an estimated 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year. The other was a
declaration from the Clintons on Inauguration Day that the White House was
to be a smoke-free zone.
The Environmental Protection Agency report has had far-reaching effects in
the US because it has enabled non-smokers to claim that cigarette smoke is
not just an irritation, but a menace to their health.
It is largely on the back of this report and later ones giving more weight
to it, that the US has seen a wave of anti-smoking ordinances aimed at
safeguarding the health of non-smokers in public places.
Meanwhile, the Clintons' anti-smoking stance has undermined the political
influence of the tobacco industry, shifting the balance of power in favour
of anti-smoking activists.
Could it be curtains, then, for Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco, American Tobacco
and the other US cigarette makers? Certainly, they are on the defensive.
Such is the abuse being heaped on the tobacco industry, and so great the
obstacles being thrown in its path, that it is tempting to ask why its
executives do not simply give up and try something else.
One reason they have not is that, though the US market may be turning ugly,
new markets for cigarette exports are opening up worldwide. For example,
Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco ship more than 10bn cigarettes a year to the
former Soviet Union, adding Dollars 100m a year to sales. The total market
in the former eastern bloc countries is estimated at about 700bn cigarettes
a year, far exceeding the 485bn consumed last year in the US.
The cigarette makers, wary of accusations that they are exploiting ignorance
of smoking-related health risks in less developed countries, play down the
export opportunities, saying that profit margins on overseas sales are lower
than on domestic sales. In any event, prospects in the US may not be quite
as bad as they seem.
For one thing, cigarette manufacturers still derive big profits from the US
market: Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco alone made operating profits totalling
Dollars 4bn from domestic tobacco sales of Dollars 15bn last year, even
during a vicious price war. As long as that kind of money is available, the
industry will fight to the last to defend its market. Last month, for
example, Philip Morris filed a Dollars 10bn lawsuit against the ABC
television network for broadcasting a programme claiming that the company
added nicotine to its cigarettes.
There must also be doubts about how quickly the government could move
towards total prohibition, if it developed the will to do so. Apart from the
political considerations, a sudden collapse in the Dollars 43bn a year spent
on cigarettes in the US would leave a big hole in the economy; and a cut in
the Dollars 16.5bn a year collected in tax revenue could be even more
awkward, especially at a time when government is looking for funding for
healthcare reform.
Meanwhile, although total cigarette consumption continues to fall in the US,
there are signs that the proportion of people who smoke has bottomed out at
about 25 per cent, and may even be rising again among the youth, women and
ethnic minorities. Moreover, according to Ms Faith Popcorn, a New York
marketing consultant, some middle-class adults are sick of healthy living
and have started lighting up in a rebellion against political correctness -
a trend she calls 'pleasure revenge'.
Smokers, it seems, have little to look forward to but vilification. They
will also find it harder to find an appropriate or convenient place to
indulge their habit. But neither they, nor the tobacco industry, believe
they have quite had their last gasp - at least, that is, not yet.

John Major is not the only one on the receiving end of serious flak for the
shambles over how to celebrate the 50th anniversary of D-day. Sir Tim Bell,
Lady Thatcher's favoured public relations guru, has seen his reputation in
Whitehall plummet as the din over commemoration of the Normandy landings has
increased.
It was Bell - for a trifling Pounds 60,000 of taxpayers' money - who
suggested that nationwide street parties and spam-fritter frying contests
would provide a suitable tribute.
When protesting veterans said such events trivialised a battle which saw the
death of 37,000 allied soldiers, the complaints were initially dismissed as
'their problem'.
Now it is Sir Tim's problem - if the fulminations of one leading minister

Is the Veuve Clicquot Business Woman of the Year award in danger of losing
its fizz? After 21 years of boosting female executives, it's beginning to
look almost as accident-prone as the now defunct Guardian Young Businessman
of the Year scheme.
Remember Sir Clive Sinclair, John Gunn of British and Commonwealth and John
Ashcroft of Coloroll? They got their GYB gongs and then fell flat on their
faces. The casualty rate among the bubbly businesswomen of the year is not
quite as high but it's starting to cause some concern.
Mair Barnes (1988 winner) resigned all of a sudden in February after seven
good years as managing director of Woolworths. Other honourable mentions go
to Debbie Moore (1983), whose Pineapple empire called in the receivers last
year owing upwards of Pounds 1m, and Sophie Mirman (1987), founder of Sock
Shop, who emerged from the attentions of administrators with only a small
children's wear chain.
But top marks surely go to Ann Iverson, who made it to the short list of
five for the 1993 awards, to be presented today. With cavalier disregard for
the champagne-maker's feelings, Iverson chucked in her job at Mothercare
earlier this week.

Shouldn't MBA students take a few courses in anthropology? Tram-line
thinking and peer pressure are the sins of business these days, reckons
Robert Waterman, in London to push his latest book, The Frontiers of
Excellence.
Waterman argues that companies which look after staff and customers also do
shareholders a power of good. Commonsense stuff, surely? 'Not really.
Management theory is still largely predicated on 18th century principles,
that is 'be nice to the workers because they're really dumb, it's the boss's
function to be smart'.'
A former McKinsey executive, Waterman, 57, himself exemplifies the kind of
individual creativity - he turns out excellent watercolour and oil paintings
 -he says companies should relish.
In the 1970s he took a lengthy sabbatical from McKinsey to go back-packing
round the world with wife and two adolescent children - very odd by McKinsey
standards of the time. 'We used to say you could be weird on one dimension
and get away with it; but be weird on two and you'd get fired.'
Still, the theorist now has his work cut out trying to turn round the
fortunes of the US software producer ASK, on whose board Waterman sits. ASK
has recently narrowly avoided going under - ironically and depressingly,
Waterman admits, by having to deploy some of the tough cost-cutting tactics
his book deplores.
'We've got to be fairly ruthless or the whole thing might go down - that's
how I defend myself to my wife, anyway.'

FT  21 APR 94 / Personal View: Transparency the best regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GLENN MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What should be the purpose of financial regulation? Too often, debate on
this issue has contrasted the goal of 'consumer protection' with the need to
maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of the UK financial services
industry and markets. Such a view is based on a false premise. The problem
is not that the competition will be damaged by investor protection, but that
there is not enough competition in the first place. The goal of regulation
should be to introduce more competition in the industry. The best protection
which any consumer can have is the existence of a clear and transparent
market.
The market for personal financial services may seem highly competitive with
every local high street full of banks, building societies, brokers and
insurance companies. But how does this competition work from the point of
view of the consumer? The fact is that there is a wide variation of
performance between companies on almost every measure, whether it is costs,
investment returns, surrender values, lapse rates or salesforce turnover.
Yet there is no clear dynamic in the market to force poor providers to
improve their performance or to reward efficient companies. Consumers cannot
see these differences because of the lack of disclosure, and companies can
get away with flouting standards because of a lack of rigorous enforcement.
So long as this continues, it is not even in the interests of the efficient
providers to change the situation, since they gain extra profits from this.
In the UK, companies gain customers not by out-competing their rivals in
terms of providing better and more efficient products, but by owning and
controlling distribution outlets (at times, regardless of cost, such as when
companies were buying up estate agencies or tying with building societies).
The consequence is that we have a market with many new entrants over the
last few years as new distribution outlets are set up or purchased. On the
other hand, there have been few exits. More sales people are chasing about
the same number of customers. Customers gain little from these new entrants;
few have come into the market with innovative products that offer something
distinctive.
The goal of regulation should be to break this log jam. What is needed is
regulation that will enable the customer to distinguish between good and bad
companies. This can be achieved by intervening in the market from two
directions.
On the demand side, the Treasury's recommendations on information provision
and disclosure should be pursued with all speed. Attention should focus in
particular on revealing the cost of the product and its value to the
customer. Broader data on surrender rates, lapse rates and salesforce
turnover rates should be placed in the public domain for debate by
interested parties. On the supply side, there should be stronger
intervention in order to raise the standards by which companies operate.
Standards should not be determined according to what companies claim they
can afford, but by objective criteria decided by the regulators.
Regulation should not be constrained by a requirement to ensure the survival
of existing companies. Disclosure and the creation of high standards go
together, because they will force companies to become more efficient or go
out of business while deterring potential new entrants unless they can offer
something significantly new.
Can self-regulation work in these circumstances? The evidence is that
existing regulatory bodies have not established an autonomy from the
interests of those which finance them and control their decision-making.
Such bodies are unlikely to put in place measures which aim to increase
competition to such an extent that some companies will have to leave the
market.
The sensible solution is to establish a form of state regulation now, rather
than wait another few years for the Personal Investment Authority to fail.
State regulation should have as its primary goal the creation of the
conditions for ensuring a competitive market in this industry. Such a goal
will bring benefits to consumers, as it will ensure disclosure and standards
are achieved rapidly and fairly across the industry. In doing so, it will
also bring advantages to those companies which are operating efficiently.
The companies which will suffer are those which have not been operating
efficiently, which have been winning market share through high-pressure
sales tactics, but not offering good value products. Their exit will damage
only themselves, while benefiting the industry.
The author is lecturer in management at the Manchester Business School, the
University of Manchester. He has recently completed a report: 'The
regulation of personal financial services'

FT  21 APR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: 'Competitiveness' rides again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do you do if a confused idea has a seemingly irreversible hold on
politicians and businessmen? Oppose it to the bitter end, saying in
adaptation of King Lear: 'No sense will come from nonsense: speak again
prime minister'? Or redefine the idea to mean something sensible?
The first attitude describes the reaction of the Treasury's economic
thinkers to the UK government's promise or threat to publish a
'competitiveness' white paper on May 16 (a deadline likely to be missed).
The second is the alternative preferred by thinkers at the Department of
Trade and Industry, who would like to redefine competitiveness to mean
overall economic performance.
My sympathies are with the doubters. Competitiveness is a concept that
applies to companies, not countries. The interests of Coca-Cola and
Pepsi-Cola are in conflict, as one gains largely at the expense of the
other. The economic interests of the US and Japan, or of the European Union
and post-communist Europe, are not.
There is a limited meaningful sense in which one can talk about an
individual nation being uncompetitive. It may have cost levels at prevailing
exchange rates which are so high as to undermine the solvency of otherwise
profitable companies or to threaten jobs which would otherwise be safe. It
is in this sense that the UK was seen as uncompetitive at the 1990-92 ERM
exchange rate.
Uncompetitiveness here means an overvalued exchange rate. It is rarer than
supposed. Not every country can have an overvalued exchange rate. Moreover,
if a country has repeatedly depreciated, and the benefits are repeatedly
offset by rising domestic costs, then its problems are not those of
competitiveness even in the narrow, parochial sense, but of a different kind
 -often labour market ones.
The well-known US economist, Professor Paul Krugman, diagnoses the European
unemployment problem: 'Taxes and regulations imposed by Europe's elaborate
welfare states have made employers reluctant to create new jobs, while a
generous level of unemployment benefits has made workers unwilling to accept
the kind of low wage jobs that help keep unemployment comparatively low in
the US.' These difficulties are, he thinks, aggravated by exchange rate
links with post-unification Germany.
The British government would be in broad agreement with Krugman's diagnosis;
and even Jacques Delors came to adopt some of it in later versions of his
white paper. But both have done so under the misleading slogan of
safeguarding European competitiveness.
Indeed I have been provoked to return to the issue by the UK government's
efforts to make 'competitiveness' the focus of its economic policies.
Another influence has been that of Krugman, who has delivered what in a
logical world would be a knock-out blow to the idea in an article in the
April issue of Foreign Affairs and in a very entertaining book called
Peddling Prosperity, already published by Norton in the US and to be issued
in the UK on June 1 at the bargain price of Pounds 16.95.
One puzzle is how the European Union, whose currencies float against the
rest of the world, can be uncompetitive even in the narrow overvaluation
sense. John Major had a very good try at persuading EU summit conferences
that it was in 1993. But as I pointed out in an Economic Viewpoint of July 1
last, he based himself on a Commission chart of European unit labour costs
compared with US and Japanese ones, which contained a howler. For it was
drawn up in national currencies without correcting for exchange rates. When
this correction was made, it showed that both the US and the European Union
costs had risen less than Japan's.
Krugman comments: 'How could John Major, with the sophisticated resources of
the UK Treasury behind him, present an analysis that failed to make the most
standard of adjustments?' Scarcely credible as it may seem, the same chart,
without the exchange rate correction, was repeated in a 1994 UK paper,
Competitiveness and Employment.
In his efforts to be fair, Krugman tries to squeeze another meaning out of
'lack of competitiveness'. This is when deteriorating terms of trade are
required to price a country's goods into overseas markets. Krugman examines
an official US index called 'Command GNP', which corrects for terms of trade
effects and is thus an index of the nation's purchasing power. The
correction makes a trivial difference to the US trend.
I have replicated his analysis with the aid of the official index of UK
'Gross National Disposable Income'. This corrects the GNP estimates for
terms of trade effects and other modest complications. Over the whole period
1971-93 and even sub-periods, the movement of the two series was, as in the
US, almost identical.
The result is pretty remarkable for an exposed country with an overseas
trade sector three times as large as that of the US. But in both countries
exchange rate changes mainly offset inflation differentials and did not have
any noticeable effect on living standards.
British experience following the departure from the ERM in September 1992
does show some, probably temporary, departure from trend, but of an opposite
kind to that envisaged by pedlars of competitiveness. For the UK, terms of
trade have improved radically since ERM departure. If the official estimates
are to be believed, import prices have risen by 6 per cent, but export
prices by 17 per cent. Exporters have been criticised for raising margins
rather than reducing foreign currency prices. But if prices were already in
line with world markets, they have moved quite rationally to prevent their
products from becoming too 'competitive'.
Why does the rhetoric of 'competitiveness' have so much appeal? Businessmen
have a comfortable feeling of understanding if they can believe 'what is
good for General Motors is good for America'. Moreover, the images of the
'strategic traders' (those who sell competitiveness slogans in the US) are
bloodthirsty and thrilling, eg 'The decisive war of the century has begun
and America may already have decided to lose'.
A further reason may be that 'competitiveness' is often confused with the
case for competition. The latter refers to the benefits of rival bidding by
companies for their customers' dollar or pound, for workers and for loanable
funds in the capital market. It is promoted by measures such as anti-trust,
the outlawing of price rings and union closed shops, and the removal of
barriers to international trade, none of which depends on treating
international trade as warfare.
But why not allow our leaders their rhetoric if they can use it for good
causes, such as reducing the US budget deficit or removing rigidities from
European labour markets?
Krugman suggests three reasons. First, it can result in wasteful government
spending. An example is the proposed focusing of US government-sponsored
research on manufacturing, because it is more open to foreign competition
than services. Second, it can lead to protectionism and trade wars. One only
has to look at the US attempts to impose specific import targets on Japan.
Third, and most important, by encouraging sloppy thinking it can undermine
policy on a much larger range of issues. For instance, Lawrence Summers, a
former colleague of Krugman's and himself a well-known economist, in his
capacity as under-secretary of the US Treasury, asserts that Japan's surplus
is a drag on world growth instead of a source of useful savings. In Britain,
the normally economically-literate Peter Lilley, the social security
secretary, talks of Europe's 'need to be 'competitive' with the rising
Tigers of Asia'. Quite apart from any effect on GNP, clear thinking is
worthwhile for its own sake.

FT  21 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sacrosanct dividend is weak ground on
which to fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Paddy Linaker's article, 'City must defend its capital position'
(Personal View, April 19), provided a good starting point for debating the
City's role in financing companies and its attitudes to dividends. It also
underlines the difficulties that institutions are going to face in coming up
with a unified approach.
Whatever the theoretical strength of the 'dividend discipline' argument, the
public perception is of rapacious institutions demanding dividends at the
expense of all else and of failing to take their share of the pain in
difficult times. In industries where margins and return on capital are
volatile, it is difficult to see why dividends should be held through the
downswing, especially if this is at the cost of investment in capital
equipment, R&amp;D and training - thereby diminishing future growth prospects.
The primary function of the stock market is to provide new capital to
finance growth, given that capital is finite and needs to be rationed
according to where it will earn the highest return.
The slightly quaint but durable share underwriting process in the London
market has proved highly effective in providing new capital even at times of
financial distress.
However, the notion that City institutions should encourage companies to
maintain dividends at all costs and then to pay those dividends back via an
equity issue seems iniquitous. It is also grossly tax inefficient.
The M&amp;G should be congratulated on encouraging the City to set the agenda in
the debate about savings and investment flows. However, if it chooses to
rally around the banner of sacrosanct dividends, it will be fighting on weak
ground.

FT  21 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No better in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr STEVEN R HUGGINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I think that the article by Gerald Cadogan (Property, April 16/17) may
leave people with the impression that the system of home-buying in Scotland
is better than that in England and Wales.
It is neither better nor worse; it is equally deficient. True, there is no
gazumping, but the downside for the buyer in Scotland is as follows. The
great majority of homes are advertised for sale as 'offers over' a certain
amount. A closing date is announced for the offers, and each person
interested in the home must pay for a survey and then put in their offer -
in total ignorance of how much other offers are or how much is expected - by
the closing date. It is a blind bidding system with no negotiation. If your
bid is not the highest, your offer will almost certainly not be accepted and
you will have lost the money you paid for the survey - at least Pounds 100
for just a valuation survey. Blind bidding or gazumping, home-buying in
Britain is no joy.

FT  21 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Irrelevance of share options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL DYCKHOFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have read with interest the various articles and letters over the
past few months on the subject of share options.
Although the coverage has been virtually comprehensive, there are a couple
of vital points which have been overlooked. The first is that share options
have for some years been cynically regarded as 'a gamble to which executives
were entitled'. I think it is now questionable whether, in fact, share
options are necessarily any more a relevant method of reward. They obviously
had a place when executives had been highly taxed and found it almost
impossible to amass capital during their business career but now, like long
contracts and over-generous severance payments, they may no longer deserve
their place.
Second, if parity between executives and shareholders in the ownership of
their company is sought, then perhaps the old-fashioned route of loans to
purchase shares at full value and freedom to sell and buy to suit the
executive's personal circumstances might not be a bad way of ensuring
involvement.
Outstanding company performance may be better rewarded by cash bonuses paid
over the long term and directly and visibly linked to that performance.

FT  21 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Arrival of second generation Concorde
is only a question of time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir PETER MASEFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The FT's normally perceptive attitude towards technological development
(one of its instructive and welcome features) was woefully,
uncharacteristically and surprisingly lacking in its negative, anti-SST
leading article 'Supersonic subsidies' (April 11).
As the history of science and transport makes clear, in due course a
dramatic advance on Concorde - larger, of longer range, quieter,
environmentally acceptable and of much better economics - will certainly be
funded, developed and introduced, profitably, by the world's big airlines on
to intercontinental routes. The question is not 'if', but 'when'.
Experience - and Concorde (first flown 25 years ago in 1969) - has shown
that, at the competitive fares which can, and must, be achieved for its
successor, a wide market exists for non-stop services over longer distances,
with flying times cut to less than half those of subsonic jets. Hence, the
current joint studies by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale and Dasa for an
eventual, but by no means final, successor to Concorde is a logical,
sensible and commercially profitable advance along the path of human
progress.
During the past 38 years, there have been dramatic advances in all aspects
of supersonic technology: in materials, structures, systems, aerodynamics
and computer-controlled engine characteristics and performance. Aeronautical
progress, only glimpsed when Concorde first flew, will not be cast aside,
nor left to become no more than history.
Fortunately - as with earlier aircraft - the service lives of existing
Concordes can be extended, usefully and safely, into the next century
through the process of computerised continuous maintenance. Thus there need
be no gap in supersonic transatlantic services while the next generation of
SSTs is explored, developed and brought on stream, to follow the next series
of much larger, subsonic aircraft.

FT  21 APR 94 / Book Review: Skilful navigator of the money flows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MONEY, CREDIT AND ASSET PRICES
By Gordon Pepper
Macmillan, 304 pages, Pounds 40
Although Gordon Pepper's book has been some years in the preparation, and is
retrospectively based upon nearly 30 years of experience as a stockbroker,
it is oddly topical. Its publication comes in the wake of February's sharp
break in the global securities markets, and the negative reaction of markets
this week to Monday's further quarter-point increase in short-term interest
rates by the US Federal Reserve. Monetary conditions, as always, have a
strong impact on asset prices.
Pepper began work in 1960 in the newly launched gilt-edged department of
London stockbrokers W. Greenwell. At the time, the gilt-edged market was a
stuffy and introverted place, overshadowed by a buoyant postwar equity
market. Yet his time would soon come. By the mid-1970s, the government had
huge deficits to finance, inflation surged, the UK securities markets staged
dramatic slumps and booms, and Pepper became, through the Greenwell Monetary
Bulletin, the most influential financial pundit in London - in the same way
that Henry Kaufman of Salomon Brothers became Wall Street's dominant guru.
As a trained Cambridge economist and qualified actuary, Pepper brought
exceptional talents to bear upon the rather mundane (in the 1960s) world of
UK government securities. He found himself drawn towards the deeply
unfashionable field of monetary economics in a period when Keynesianism
carried all before it and monetary policy, after many years in the deep
freeze, was beginning to run wild.
His book appears to be a delayed encapsulation of the perceptions he gained
in the 1970s and early 1980s of the impact of money flows on the securities
markets.
It is a gilt-edged expert's view of equities: share prices in the short term
do not, he argues, depend in any substantial way upon conventional valuation
factors such as dividends or profits, but primarily upon bond yields. Flows
of money, he argues, explain the paradoxes that make it so hard for the man
in the street to understand or trust the stock market. Share prices go up
when unemployment is rising and production is weak, but just when the
economy appears to be showing decent recovery - as it is now - the indices
begin to stumble.
It is a question of timing. In the short run, the effect of the economic
recovery on the flows of funds within the economy is to reduce the surpluses
that have been pushing down long-term interest rates and pushing up share
prices. Pepper's department at City University Business School, where he is
now professor of banking and finance, studied the UK stock market indices
from 1967 to 1989. It concluded that dividends had a negligible influence on
the indices within a year or two, but the gilt-edged market had quite a
powerful impact over such a time period. After five years, however, the
'real' factor of dividend growth was more influential then gilts.
Pepper's conclusion is: don't use the behaviour of aggregate dividends and
earnings as a basis for forecasting the overall level of the stock market
over a year or two (although this might not apply to individual stocks).
Instead focus on the flows of funds and especially upon imbalances within
the financial system.
This leads on to the other main theme, the cyclical forces within the
monetary economy. In the 1960s and early 1970s, for instance, UK banks used
to swing from financial deficit to surplus and back again during the
economic cycle. This led to predictable changes in demand for gilt-edged and
sterling.
Nowadays the patterns are more difficult to interpret, because most western
economies have opened up to international flows of funds. Cycles in the
securities markets tend to be longer, but are punctuated by sharp setbacks.
Pepper does not bring his analysis sufficiently up to date in this respect
(though there is a late chapter on cross-border flows). But he points out
that securities markets respond strongly to an economic recession and
subsequent recovery - more strongly than should be expected by believers in
the efficient market hypothesis, who might assume the predictable movements
in interest rates would be discounted in advance.
Coming right up to the minute, for instance, why did the international bond
markets respond so negatively earlier this week to the latest Fed
tightening? The rise in interest rates was scarcely unexpected, and most
investors expect further rises soon.
Pepper's views on this particular issue are a matter for conjecture, but his
general approach is to point to market participants who are forced into
transactions for non-investment reasons. In certain circumstances markets
can have a 'nasty feel' which professionals recognise. Imbalances are
developing, and forced sellers exist.
Alternatively, certain kinds of speculators may push the markets to
unsustainable levels. In these conditions crowd psychology may be much more
important in explaining market prices than the rational expectations of
individuals which are the basis of conventional financial market theory.
Unfortunately Pepper does not fully develop the relationship between his
monetary approach and the efficient market analysis - for instance, in the
impact of fluctuating discount rates. And too many of his examples go back
to the 1970s and earlier (although there is a lengthy discussion of the 1987
stock market crash).
The core of the book is in a few short early chapters. Many later sections
are reprinted papers and speeches of variable vintages, which make the book
appear rather disjointed.
All the same, the text is full of the kind of original analysis and insights
which made the Monetary Bulletin such essential reading for many years. For
amateurs and professionals alike wishing to deepen their understanding of
the often mysterious and counter-intuitive fluctuations in asset prices,
this book provides essential reading.

FT  21 APR 94 / Arts: Two Parisian Hamlets - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Helas] pauvre Yorique. Je l'ai connu, Horatio . . .' Right now, Paris has
two French-language stagings of Hamlet - Georges Lavaudant's at the
Comedie-Francaise (with Redjep Mitrovitsa), and Terry Hands's at the Marigny
(with Francis Huster as Hamlet). The hero's name is pronounced 'Hum-lett' at
one theatre, 'Am-lett' at the other.
Naturally, the compare-and-contrast exercise is rife. To a British observer,
however, what they have in common is equally striking. French actors are
full of old-fashioned virtues: no one comes onstage as if by accident, all
of them know how to let their faces catch the light, each of them knows how
to project his or her voice into the auditorium in fluent phrases. Though
both stagings were heavily cut (running at just over three hours), both were
played with liberal supplies of calm and silence. In the closet scene, both
Gertrudes kept their tears pianissimo or silent. Above all, both Hamlets
were spoken with marvellous clarity, and performed with physical authority.
One goes to see the French perform Hamlet, not to catch some reproduction of
what has succeeded in English stagings, but for whatever the French can
reveal in it. And it is the Comedie-Francaise Hamlet (no interval) which is
the more French and, to this Briton, the more remarkable. I have never seen
Hamlet performed with so much stillness and economy; or so constant a supply
of vocal beauty. These actors know how to stand and how, without gesturing,
to project physically to the other people onstage (as well as to the
auditorium), so that a scene for three people creates a visually compelling
triangle. The tall, elegant, bronze, box set (by Jean-Pierre Vergier), with
a door at the rear and two further entrances downstage, never changes,
except as Lavaudant's lighting sets it in different hues. Vergier has
costumed it in 16th-century garb; Gertrude and Ophelie might have stepped
out of Holbein. As for the melodramatic pomposity which can be so deadly at
the Comedie-Francaise? Confined to the peripheries. The core of this Hamlet
is serious and fresh.
Redjep Mitrovitsa - an actor at the same time classic, Romantic, and modern
 -is the main reason for this. He is slight but commanding. The small head
is dominated by massive, downward-slanting cheekbones, and large, deep-set
eyes; the hair, like Olivier's in the movie, is dyed white-blonde; the voice
is a full, deep baritone so perfectly projected that a fortissimo was
employed only two or three times, and even then without any kind of
shouting. He can quickly alternate between anguish, philosophical enquiry,
and sardonic wit.
What one remembers most is his sheer stillness. The first third of the 'Etre
ou non etre' soliloquy, spoken at the front of the stage, is delivered
without movement. During the second third, he simply raises his arms, holds
them during a climax, and then lets them drop. The last third is again all
stillness. The auditorium hangs upon his eyes and his voice - and upon the
agony of mind which is Hamlet's legend and is vividly present here.
Terry Hands's Hamlet, taken at a brisker lick, has altogether more movement.
Not, however, more naturalism. 'Etre - ' says Francis Huster's Hamlet; then
tumbles to the floor; where he lies supine and says ' - ou non etre'. He
rises, gestures, and then says 'Voila le question: est-il plus noble . . .'
Huster, who must be well into his 40s (and often brings Michael Pennington
to mind), is a star who has assembled this company and organised this
Marigny season. He emphasises Hamlet's rhetoric. A light, dry baritone, he
has energy, charm, and edge without great depth.
Hamlet at the Comedie-Francaise is in repertory with other plays until June
30. Hamlet at the Marigny is being given until May.

FT  21 APR 94 / Arts: Sunset Boulevard revised - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Andrew Lloyd Webber's new version of Sunset Boulevard superior to his
original? Is cyanide more effective than arsenic? If you gotta go, you gotta
go. This way is quicker and more intense.
The main difference now is that Betty Buckley plays the diva role, the
bygone star Norma Desmond. She brings it more energy and more bite; and she
wears umpteen suitably repulsive over-the-top outfits, turbans, and wigs.
Patti LuPone, who launched the role here last year, seemed to have -
Spiderwoman-like - more belief in Norma's own self-myth, and her vibrato was
less tremulous; but she had fewer frocks to wear. LuPone, whose voice opens
so powerfully at its top and can swell a phrase, reminded us that Lloyd
Webber seemed to have composed the role for Barbara Streisand; Buckley,
whose face has been made up like a staring pale mask, reminds us that he
revised Norma for Glenn Close (in Los Angeles) - in her hammy, lethal,
Dangerous Liaisons mode.
This exercise in compare-and-contrast, with its wealth of dull detail, is
not a task that can interest intelligent adults. The most curious thing is
that Lloyd Webber had to revise Sunset Boulevard at all. Though he is crass
and corny as a composer of popular music drama, he is terrific as an
inventor of blockbuster tourist attractions - usually. His canniness in
finding the right theatrical formulas for his era, and in marketing them, is
mightily impressive - usually. Like Eurodisney, however, Sunset Boulevard
was not doing good enough business. Hence revisions.
But oh] revise it altogether. Lloyd Webber's tinkerings cannot disguise the
ghastly unoriginality of his mind. Other composers borrow material, but they
make something personal from their borrowings. Lloyd Webber, however, simply
presses musical feel-good triggers in your mind. His scores have no
intention of doing anything new. He means simply to remind you
subconsciously of ways you have enjoyed yourself before.
If, alas, you become conscious of this, his method becomes eminently
resistible. The title song here harps on a phrase and a rhythm that are
crucial to a Piaf song, 'La Foule'; the central phrase of 'The Greatest Star
of All' uses material that works better in either the Warsaw Concerto or
Rachmaninov (I wish I could remember which); and the 'Let's Have Lunch'
number is merely a Sondheim pastiche. And as you get to hear each of these a
zillion times during the course of Sunset, you cannot miss how little he
makes of them.
In the original movie Sunset Boulevard you cannot miss how, when Joe escapes
from Norma to write scripts (and fall in love) with Betty, he is escaping
from a mausoleum to a world of spontaneity. Not so here. Betty's milieu is
as musically repetitious as Norma's. More so, in fact. At least Norma's New
Year's Eve party breaks out of a tango into a waltz; Betty's stays stuck in
a tango.
More important, in the movie, you cannot miss the appalling moral collapse
of Joe, as he falls reluctantly into Norma's power. Yet here he is little
better than a gigolo. Superficially, John Barrowman is an improvement on the
musical's previous Joes - especially in his virile, all-American looks (a
mix of Tom Cruise, Christopher Reeve, and Montgomery Clift.) But just look
how smoothly he enters into Norma's clutches; he actually dances the tango,
which should be too dated for Joe, with considerably more flair than she.
And he sounds and acts not like an individual but like a formula.
This is the worst staging I have ever seen by Trevor Nunn. Why does Norma
roam around constantly during her first number? And Joe during the title
song? Why are the lines of spoken dialogue paced with such predictable
rhythm? When Joe and Betty fall in love (1, 'What happened?' 2, 'You did.'
3, they kiss) it sounds like emotion by metronome.
At the Adelphi Theatre, WC2.

'Unashamedly biased. And unashamedly jaundiced.' John MacUre is the writer
of Cardiac Arrest (9.30 BBC1) a new six-part drama series about working in
the NHS, He adds: 'It is a tale that any junior doctor will tell.' He should
know - he is himself a practising junior doctor.
In the first episode, a young houseman's idealised sense of health care
buckles under the weight of a chaotic system trying to save lives -
including the NHS's. 'People will hope it is make-believe. But it's not,'
Doctor MacUre says bleakly. Oh, really? Tell us about it.
Before plunging into a sea of medical troubles, brace yourself with Class
Act (9.00 ITV), which continues the comic adventures of a mismatched trio
starring the lovely and talented Joanna Lumley. Romance is in the air this
evening - but is it the real thing? Who cares - Miss Lumley is real enough
for anyone to love.
And if you want to stick around long enough for another dose of professional
angst, Street Legal (12.35am ITV) is a Canadian drama series which follows
the personal and professional lives of four trial lawyers.

FT  21 APR 94 / Arts: Jansons and the London Philharmonic - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Even now the final act of the London orchestras' drama has not been played
out. By failing to follow through its policy on creating a super-orchestra,
the Arts Council has contrived to leave one of the London orchestras without
a principal conductor.
The choice was essentially between the Philharmonia and the London
Philharmonic. In the belief that either one or the other would get the money
(but not both) Mariss Jansons signalled his willingness to be principal
conductor of the former while still principal guest conductor with the
latter. But even a two-way bet is not guaranteed to win, when it is the Arts
Council spinning the roulette wheel.
Both orchestras were reprieved and Jansons had to make a choice. Doubtless
because he was already in post at the London Philharmonic, he decided to
stay there, leaving the Philharmonia without a successor to its departing
music director, Giuseppe Sinopoli. The orchestra had been unanimous in its
support for Jansons and has not identified any other conductor with whom it
wants such a close relationship.
Jansons's first concert at the Royal Festival Hall since details of the
backstage wrangling leaked out was a vivid example of why two orchestras
should be fighting over him. During the past decade he has consistently
shown that he can get razor-sharp playing out of his orchestras and the
London Philharmonic will prosper if it can continue to hold on to him.
Although he is no 18th-century specialist, his Mozart is worth a hearing. A
polished Symphony No 41 before Christmas was followed on Tuesday by a
sparkling Symphony No 40. The clarity that he gets is remarkable, every
inner part in the finale crystal clear. No doubt Mozart was intended to be
the link with Schnittke's (K)ein Sommernachtstraum, a piece of classical
pastiche that quickly turns sour with sarcasm. As in Shostakovich, the
humour is delivered with a Soviet-style iron fist.
The Schnittke demands a huge orchestra, which was on hand because of
Strauss's Don Quixote after the interval. This is a flamboyant score very
much after Jansons's heart. The performance was one of heightened contrasts,
speeds and colours all more extreme than usual. It is easy to imagine the
swashbuckling Jansons charging at windmills, while the eloquent cellist
Heinrich Schiff looked after Quixote's idealistic dreaming and sensitivity.
Where Straussians like Karajan and Kempe used to blend the orchestra into a
homogenous whole, Jansons separates out the sounds to reveal countless
details, missing only the autumnal warmth of the final pages. Ironic that
Strauss in his 30s was already so sentimental. Jansons has turned 50 and is
still a man of action.

BEYOND BEDLAM (18) Vadim Jean
PAINTED HEART (15) Michael Taav
BACK IN THE USSR (15)Dean Sarafian
SONATINE Takeshi Kitano
The question of the week, if the nightmare sequences in Beyond Bedlam have
not confused me, is 'where is all this shit coming from?' Unless sitting
through four films in a row has addled my memory, I heard it asked by a
breathless Elizabeth Hurley as she flapped, Daphne Duck running on a
catwalk, along the cheap corridors of this tawdry shlock-horror attempt at
psychological melodrama.
Suffering the fate of all mad scientists, Ms Hurley was fleeing, together
with her detective-hero, from nasty images. These were inserted into their
collective dream by a proto-Frankenstein serial killer whose brainwaves
invaded their skulls . . .
It should terrify; in fact I had to shut my eyes for just a few seconds, as
the screen-sized needle went in over the opening titles, and, unmentionably,
later. But why be unpleasant? Let me be mealy-mouthed. Beyond Bedlam is
badly written, unconvincing, poorly directed and a disservice to its cast.
It could, without further assistance, finally bury the reputation of
British-made films. If it is offered in an aircraft, take evasive action.
Make for the emergency exit and jump.
That leaves the question I fancy I heard Ms Hurley put. It is a jewel, of
sorts. It encapsulates the Ratner's setting in which I keep telling myself
it was delivered. It may not reveal what goes on in your mind or mine, but
it certainly tells us what the moving picture industry is capable of aiming
at our heads. 'Where is all this shit coming from?' is exactly right for the
present season, both of cinema and the news. The latter is dispiriting when
made in Westminster, ghastly when emanating from Bosnia. Invited to fill in
for the absent Nigel Andrews, I therefore welcomed the prospect of a short
respite from real life. What a fool] The great escape of science fiction is
dependent upon memories of Star Wars. No musical, MGM or otherwise, came
along to lighten the darkness. Not even the balm of syrupy romance was on
offer.
Painted Heart is at least restful, if you forget the moment the hero cuts
his forearm to prove his love. A quirky piece, it shows how to portray
serial killers with delicacy and taste. It suggests violence without rubbing
it in; passion without anyone taking their trousers off. It is lightly
humorous, for which much thanks. Willie, the sk in question, is beaten up by
his vile father. Naturally he grows up to become a murderer of old drunks,
whom he lures into the back of dilapidated buildings.
This is, however, only his hobby: he holds on to his daytime job. A
house-painter, he employs three assistants. One of them, Wesley, falls in
love with and seduces Willie's wife Margaret, a simple soul nicely played by
Bebe Neuwirth.
All the characters are of low intelligence and little education. Except for
the absence of swear-words, the dialogue could have come from a playground.
Informed by a pop-eyed Wesley that her husband is a 'real certified serial
killer', Margaret, eyes popping back, responds that if Willie heard that
'you won't be painting around here for a long time'. Her bungalow in
suburban Wisconsin looks authentic; the scenes showing bored house-painters
pushing their rollers up the walls of larger houses are realistic. The bars
to which the painter-buddies go after work feel genuine. Robert Pastorelli
plays Willie for sympathy, and gets it; Will Patton does a good empty-headed
Wesley. When it all goes wrong, his relationship with Margaret, she tells
him, is 'a . . . a . . . cracked cup.' These are weak, undemanding folk, in
a film which suits such characters.
There is, likewise, nothing demanding about Back in the USSR, a film whose
essence most of us have seen many times. It is the nearest thing to a
holiday for the brain. A young couple find love. First the boy, Frank
Whaley, falls by accident into an adventure involving a stolen treasure
lifted by the charming Natalya Negoda. She plays an apprentice prostitute
('it was her first time, and she hated it'). We see rival gangs, shoot-outs,
suspect police, a treacherous diplomat, an infuriating doorman, and Roman
Polanski. This familiar mix has the comfort of old slippers. There are no
surprises, and if there are loose ends, nobody cares. There is a further
advantage. Back in the USSR is a Russian-American collaboration, exploiting
the ample wastebins of Hollywood for its tone, while shooting on location in
Moscow. You get an hour and a half of Valium, plus a free travelogue.
The best bit is a chase in the GUM department store. Busy Moscow street
scenes are interspersed with picture-postcard shots of Red Square, the
subway, the Kremlin and the Izmailova flea market. A rickety taxi rumbles
down shoddy back streets. Ms Negoda inhabits a thieves' paint-peeled
apartment, furnished with barely sufficient necessities. Old soldiers remind
you of the Soviets' war; an ample lady street-cleaner provides further
verisimilitude. When our lovebirds get on a train the camera lingers over
the Russian faces in adjoining seats. The Orthodox Church is part of the
tour, as is that enduring Western image, the substandard 'luxury' hotel
bedroom. The underlying proposition that this may be what it was like as the
Soviet Union reached its end, is, however, buried by commercial garbage.
Mosfilm, once the proud home of Eisenstein, helped make Back in the USSR. It
is no 'Potemkin', just what you might expect with a production manager
called Boguslavsky.
Serial killing Japanese-style is a serious matter. The gangsters in Sonatine
carelessly shoot one another, causing paint-potsful of blood to spurt from
their wounds, They are coolly, philosophically, murderous. They care neither
for life nor death; so why, when they meet the latter, should we? Perhaps
because this is not an entirely worthless film. Takeshi Kitano's eccentric
assault on our sensibilities is carefully stylised. It is equipped with the
most opulent cars and the best guns of the week. Clearly the chief thugs of
the yakuza are rich. Their headquarters office might have been conceived by
Attali, although their temporary hide-out, in Okinawa, is properly flaky.
The beach scenes, which could have been shot on any coast in the world, are
balletic. The action moves between simple pop-pop shooting and old-time
vaudeville as the gunfighters hide away in a coastal house. They play games
on the sands: two thin mock-sumo wrestlers in a seaweed ring; Russian
roulette with no bullets; frisbee. Then everyone gets killed.
Kitano, starring in his own film, started life as a stand-up comic. He still
occasionally comes across as Benny Hill, his beatific smile breaking out at
regular intervals. When his moll removes her wet T-shirt he cracks a Benny
Hill joke through his chubby cheeks. He remembers to look serious as he
forgets how long he can leave an enemy under water without drowning him, or
when he expresses fatigue at his gangsterish way of life. Tired of living,
but evidently not scared of dying, he clears his brain with a
carefully-aimed bullet. It is the least he could do.

FT  21 APR 94 / Technology: Opportunity knocks - Collaboration between
industry and academia is gathering pace in Canada, says Bernard Simon in the
second of a series on research
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Union Bank of Switzerland, the Japanese government, British Nuclear
Fuels and Caterpillar, the US construction machinery maker, were looking for
a fast and versatile data search and retrieval system, they turned to a
small company in Waterloo, Ontario.
Open Text Corporation's software can search 60m words a second in any
language and in any database. Its system helps Caterpillar's
customer-support staff around the world, including Japan, keep abreast of
changes in maintenance procedures. Writers of Caterpillar product manuals
can be sure of updating every reference to a component whenever a supplier
modifies a specification.
Open Text, which has been profitable for the past three years and expects
1994 sales to top CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.4m), is a rare example in Canada of
a successful business nurtured by university research and a dollop of
government money. The company has its origins in work done by two University
of Waterloo scientists for the computerisation of the Oxford English
Dictionary in the mid-1980s. An Ontario provincial agency put up seed money
to help commercialise the software.
While success stories such as Open Text remain the exception rather than the
rule, there is growing collaboration between business, government and
academia to apply the fruits of research to commerce and industry. Henri
Rothschild, chief scientist in the Department of Industry, Science and
Technology in Ottawa, says that 'science policy is now considered an
integral component of industrial policy. It's not a peripheral issue.'
Canada's research effort remains hobbled, however, by the dominant role of
government laboratories and by a lop-sided allocation of private-sector
resources. According to Statistics Canada, the federal government's 200
laboratories for research and development will account for almost one-third
of all R&amp;D spending, totalling CDollars 11bn, in the year to March 31 1994.
The research budgets of some agencies, such as the National Research Council
and the Department of Agriculture, match the combined resources of all
Canada's universities.
By common consent, the government gets poor value for money from its
in-house laboratories. They have little incentive to compete for funding or
for the best brains. Private-sector researchers can only marvel at the
bureaucrats' success at beating off every attempt to scale back or privatise
government research facilities.
Outside Ottawa, almost half all industrial R&amp;D is handled by 25 enterprises,
led by Bell-Northern Research, the research arm of Bell Canada, the
country's biggest telephone company, and Northern Telecom, the telecoms
equipment maker. The 25 top spenders include three government-owned
corporations.
Industry, however, is starting to take research more seriously and to
collaborate with universities and government. Much of the impetus has come
from trade liberalisation, especially the 1989 US-Canada free trade
agreement. For years, high tariff walls shielded Canadian 'branch plants'
from international competition, rewarding second-hand technology (usually
imported from US parent companies) and discouraging innovative research.
One recent business initiative involved a CDollars 700,000 gift by Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce to the University of Waterloo to set up a centre
for the management of technological change and innovation. The bank has
retained Douglas Wright, a former president of the university, for advice on
how to adapt banking practices to research-based companies.
The University of Waterloo is leading the way in fostering collaboration
between academia and business. It claims to have the world's biggest
'co-operative education' programme, in which some 10,000 students spend part
of their courses gaining practical experience with 2,500 employers,
including several Japanese companies.
John Branch, Open Text's president, ascribes the company's existence to a
university policy, unique in Canada, of allowing staff members to retain
legal ownership of their research: 'They tend to keep their ear to the
market place more closely than those who are just working on a research
project.'
Research on the Waterloo campus has so far spawned 19 companies, including
Open Text. One spin-off venture designs and makes seat supports for the
disabled, another produces high-performance image sensors and a third makes
instruments to measure the computer-controlled drying of grains.
Another closely-watched experiment in collaborative research involves seven
so-called Centres of Excellence which were set up by the Ontario provincial
government in 1987. Each centre is organised as a non-profit company, with
equal representation from business and academia on its board. Industry
nominees comprise a majority of the centre's advisory committee, which
approves research projects.
The seven centres, whose work ranges from groundwater and manufacturing
processes, to space and mapping science, and laser technology, were the
winners of an open competition. Some 40 proposals were judged by a panel of
independent researchers, including several from outside Canada.
The centres started with a CDollars 204m grant from the Ontario government,
spread over five years. The government chipped in another CDollars 180m last
year to keep the programme going until 1997.
Thanks to the centres, about 2,000 postgraduate students have been able to
work with some of the country's top researchers on industry-directed
projects. The vice-president for finance at the space and terrestrial
science centre has teamed up with one of the scientists to form a company.
The groundwater centre has licensed production of its software programmes.
When the independent judges returned for a five-year review in 1992, several
of the centres got rave reviews. Especially encouraging is that the private
sector's financial contribution has jumped from zero in 1987 to between 30
and 50 per cent of the centres' current budgets.

FT  21 APR 94 / Technology: Aids research suffers setbacks - High hopes have
been brought low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past year has been one of dashed hopes for researchers and sufferers of
Aids. The Concorde study results on AZT, announced earlier this month,
concluded that the drug yields no benefits to people who have contracted HIV
and have yet to show any symptoms. The news was just the latest in a series
of setbacks.
Many Aids medicines have failed to live up to their promise. The Berlin Aids
conference last June was hardly upbeat but several glimmers of hope still
shone. Yung-Kang Chow of Harvard University had just announced positive
results from trials using a cocktail of AZT-type drugs.
A number of companies, including Merck, Roche and Vertex, were concentrating
on a promising new class of Aids drugs, called protease inhibitors. And
Chiron, the US biotechnology group, was preparing for large-scale trials of
vaccines made up of an empty shell of the HIV virus.
Shortly after the Berlin conference, Harvard admitted its data on the
cocktail drug had been faulty. Earlier this year, Merck, said to have one of
the most promising of the protease inhibitors, announced that its initial
trials had held the virus back for periods of only 12 to 24 weeks.
Chiron has suspended research for its Aids vaccine pending government
funding for wide-scale trials. 'We will not move ahead on that until funding
comes through,' says Lawrence Kurtz, a spokesman for the group. Aids
scientists are concerned that continued disappointment may lead the private
sector to put less money into HIV research. 'I think some companies have
been disappointed,' says Fernando Zacarias, regional co-ordinator for the
Panamerican Health Organisation.
Myron Essex, chairman of the Harvard Aids Institute, believes there are
other disincentives to private research. 'There is evidence that the number
of people with Aids in developed countries may be plateauing and even
decreasing. Most new Aids cases are in developing countries, which may not
be able to afford treatment even if it were available. Pharmaceutical
companies don't usually invest heavily in researching drugs for declining
markets.'
The lack of progress is even more disappointing as the public's hopes of
fighting the disease are so high, fuelled by rapid developments in research
early on.
While our understanding of the disease has deepened considerably,
researchers say there is no cure in sight. 'To even think of a cure is going
well beyond anything we have our eyes on,' says Emilio Emini, executive
director of antiviral research at Merck. Even the prospect of controlling
the virus for a period of years has proved daunting.
'The general public thinks in terms of infections you can absolutely cure,'
says Martin Hirsch, a professor at the Harvard Medical School and a leading
Aids researcher. 'But Aids is a virus, and we have never been able to cure
any virus, only prepare the body's natural defence system to attack (the
virus) once it arrives. There is no evidence that the body has any
sustainable ability to fight HIV.'
Aids activists believe this view may be too pessimistic. 'There is no cure
for herpes, but we are able to keep it in control with acyclovir, and that
amounts to the same thing,' says Raymond Schmidt, an Aids activist with the
organisation Act Up.
Scientists point out that in the case of herpes, the drug merely suppresses
the virus long enough for the body's immune system to prepare a
counter-offensive. One of the main problems in fighting Aids is that the
virus invades the cells responsible for immunity, namely the CD4
lymphosytes. There is no pause in the virus's onslaught. Last year,
scientists discovered that HIV uses the period of 'clinical latency' -
during which patients show no increase of the virus in their blood - to
implant itself deeply in the lymph nodes. After multiplying there for years,
it again invades the blood stream.
Another research challenge is that HIV replicates itself with frightening
speed. Vaccines for influenza, for instance, are troublesome because the
virus mutates about once a year. HIV can metamorphose once every few days,
and its ability to transform itself has frustrated many researchers. Merck,
for instance, identifies this mutability as one of the main problems with
the effectiveness of its protease inhibitor.
Protease inhibitors prevent the production of the protease enzyme, which is
necessary for the virus to replicate effectively. However, the inhibitor
matches a certain molecule, and becomes ineffective if that molecule changes
form.
'The Aids virus selects for resistance,' says Emini. 'If the environment
changes, the population will replace the eliminated virus with a new,
resistant strain. Ironically, the more virus you kill off, the more
resistance will occur. With our protease inhibitor, the body switches to the
new resistant strain within 12 to 24 weeks.'
Merck says it will continue research on the protease inhibitor to see if it
becomes more effective when used in conjunction with other drugs, such as
AZT.
News has not been completely bleak, however. While progress in treating
infected patients is slow, a new study with AZT shows that the drug may keep
HIV-positive pregnant women from passing the virus to their children. Gene
therapy also holds promise. 'I think if there is an effective treatment for
Aids, it may come out of gene therapy,' says Essex.
Many scientists believe research on Aids will resemble progress on cancer.
The fight will be long and hard, and no absolute cure is likely to be
discovered soon, but advances will be made. 'We're light years ahead of
where we were on cancer research in the 1960s,' says Emini. 'We can cure
some forms, and we have a number of treatments. Yet there was no blinding
moment when everyone realised progress had been made. I think it will be the
same with Aids.'

FT  21 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Time to cut it out -
US manufacturers are questioning the value of money-off coupons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Americans get more than news when they pick up a weekend newspaper. The
typical Sunday morning edition, already requiring a specially reinforced
breakfast table to bear the weight of its numerous sections, is further
fattened by the inclusion of supplements containing page after page of
clip-out coupons offering money off specified goods.
Interleaved among the 13 sections of last Sunday's New York Times, for
example, were three inserts containing nearly 100 coupons inviting readers
to save money on products as diverse as bleach, tea bags, cat litter and
anti-flatulence tablets.
It is the same story across the country. Indeed, coupons are found in
newspapers, magazines and other printed matter everywhere. Almost
incredibly, some 298.5bn coupons were distributed in the US last year, with
a face value totalling Dollars 177.6bn (Pounds 121.6bn)
But has the whole thing gone too far? General Mills, the US food group,
thinks so. From next month, it is sharply reducing the number of coupons it
issues against its cereal products like Cheerios and Wheaties, preferring to
cut its prices of the products by 11 per cent instead.
General Mills's reasoning is straightforward: coupons are too often a waste
of money. They cost a great deal to print, distribute and handle, yet last
year barely 2 per cent of those issued were redeemed.
'Because of this inefficiency, the 50 cents that the consumer saves by
clipping a coupon can cost manufacturers as much as 75 cents,' says Steve
Sanger, General Mills's president. 'It just doesn't make sense.'
General Mills is planning to reduce its annual promotional budget by 30 per
cent - about Dollars 175m - by cutting back on coupons and in-store
promotions. That means it will lose sales. But it reckons the net effect on
revenues will be a loss of only Dollars 110m, so it will still be much
better off at the bottom line.
Apparently, General Mills is not the only US company questioning the
efficiency of coupons. According to NCH Promotional Services, the promotion
information division of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the 298.5bn coupons issued last
year represented a 4 per cent decline on the previous year's peak of 310bn.
And because companies cut the average period of validity of their coupons,
the number redeemed went down from 7.7bn to 6.8bn - a fall of nearly 12 per
cent.
So is this the beginning of the end of the coupon? Hardly, says Jane Perrin,
NCH's senior vice president of marketing. While it is true that one or two
companies - notably Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products group - have cut
back on coupons in favour of everyday low pricing, a more significant trend
is that companies are trying to improve the efficiency of coupons through
better targeting.
Inserting coupons in newspapers, while relatively cheap, is a scatter-gun
technique. Instead, says Perrin, companies are experimenting with more
sophisticated ways of reaching their audiences. One example is the targeted
mailshot; another, the machine at the supermarket check-out that detects
when shoppers have bought a Diet Coke and automatically dispenses a coupon
offering them money off a Diet Pepsi.
This said, many companies would be glad to see an end to coupons. Josh
McQueen, director of research at the advertising agency Leo Burnett, says
the logistical cost of meeting a sudden upturn in demand caused by a coupon
issue can be great - and all to little purpose if most of the increased
volume comes from existing customers stockpiling goods while prices are low.
Another risk is that money is wasted on loyal consumers, while those who
switch will move on to the next cheap product once the offer is over.
Then there is the opportunity for fraud - for example, by stores allowing
the redemption of the coupons against products other than the one named, or
through reproduction of coupons on a colour photocopying machine.
Notwithstanding the reaction of Hans Storr, chief financial officer of
Philip Morris, the food and tobacco group - 'I hate coupons, with a
vengeance' - they are not going to go away quite yet. Perrin maintains that
many people enjoy clipping coupons, regarding it as an inherent part of the
planning stage for a shopping expedition. 'The danger for manufacturers is
that other promotional vehicles may not be as rewarding or as motivating for
the consumer,' she says.
And quite apart from anything else, it is a brave company that gives up such
a powerful promotional tool while its competitors retain it. For that
reason, if for no other, a lot of eyes will be fixed on General Mills's
cereal sales figures from next month.

FT  21 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Can't get no
satisfaction - The prospect of public rankings of European cars by owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carmakers have been conducting their own customer satisfaction surveys in
Europe for years. But their practice of sharing the syndicated results with
each other but not the public is about to be challenged. An independent
organisation - the leading US automotive consumer research group JD Power -
has just published its own findings.
If it succeeds in transplanting its expertise in automotive market research
from North America to Europe - and there are still important question marks
 -JD Power's work will bring new dimensions to car marketing in Europe.
The results of its first survey in Britain, the 1994 customer satisfaction
study, have made sobering reading for most of the leading carmakers in
Europe. They show that Toyota, the Japanese carmaker, has achieved the
highest level of overall customer satisfaction. Its Corolla small family car
was the top individual model.
The study measures car owners' attitudes to the quality of their vehicles
and to the service and care they receive from dealers. The 1994 survey is
based on owners of cars with a J-registration prefix, covering cars
registered from August 1991 to July 1992.
In the results that are made public JD Power's practice is to rank
individually each brand that performs above the industry average, but to
name simply as a group, in alphabetical order, all those with a
below-average performance. The top half of the carmakers ranked in the 1994
study is dominated by Japanese producers with Mazda and Honda in second and
third places behind Toyota, Daihatsu fourth equal, Subaru seventh,
Mitsubishi 10th and Nissan in 13th place.
The highest-ranked European producer is Mercedes-Benz at fourth equal, with
Saab eighth, Skoda ninth and BMW in 11th position. Hyundai of South Korea
was in 12th place with Proton of Malaysia fourth equal. The performances of
the leading carmakers in the UK - Ford, Vauxhall (General Motors) and Rover
 -are all ranked below average in the study along with Peugeot, Citroen,
Volkswagen, Renault, Audi, Fiat, Lada, Land Rover, Volvo, Seat and Suzuki.
The JD Power studies, first launched in the US in 1981, have been a driving
force in improving quality in the US car industry.
Greeted at first with scepticism and hostility, they eventually helped to
convince the big three US carmakers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -
that they were lagging behind their Japanese rivals in customer
satisfaction, and that they needed urgently to close the gap.
According to David Power, president of JD Power &amp; Associates: 'Detroit
viewed us at first as if we were on the lunatic fringe. Then we were seen as
a nuisance, and then as heretics. They challenged our methodology, but we
had it evaluated by outside experts. And by 1985 we had begun to convert
Detroit top management to what we were about.'
JD Power accepts that it now faces the same sort of uphill struggle to
convince European carmakers of the value of its work, as it did a decade ago
in the US.
Several European carmakers, in particular PSA Peugeot Citroen of France, see
JD Power as a stalking horse for the Japanese carmakers.
The group has already had one false start in Europe, in 1988. Power insists
that this time it will stay, but its work remains hampered by European data
protection regulations. In much of Europe registration details such as names
and addresses of car owners are kept confidential  - in the UK by the state
agency, the DVLA (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency).
To overcome this barrier, the first JD Power survey in the UK has been
conducted in a joint venture with BBC Enterprises and the BBC Top Gear
motoring programme, which solicited UK car owners to participate in the
industry-wide study. From 5m viewers more than 58,000 calls were received,
which produced a quota sample of 16,250 participants. JD Power accepts that
this is not ideal for obtaining a totally representative sample, and it
would prefer the co-operation of the DVLA. But 'it seems to be quite
bureaucratic. We met them 18 months ago and they are yet to get back to us,'
says Power.
Until it finds an alternative source to obtain car owner names and
addresses, it will persevere with the BBC programme, and it is now actively
seeking data sources elsewhere in Europe to spread the customer satisfaction
gospel beyond the UK.

FT  21 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Eastern Europe on
show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 1,000 exhibitors from more than 20 countries will gather in
London's Earls Court next month for the first Central and Eastern European
Technology and Investment Exhibition (Ceetex)*.
The trade exhibition will be the first large-scale showcase of technology,
investment and joint-venture opportunities in former Soviet Union countries,
Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Hungary.
Main industries represented will include oil and gas, aviation and space,
pharmaceuticals and chemicals, and machine building. Other stands will be
devoted to areas where eastern expertise is less developed, for example
white goods and consumer durables.
Some exhibitors will be hoping to arrange sales directly to the west, says
Michael Summers, managing director of the exhibition's organisers, Stirling
Publishing. 'Others will be demonstrating what they presently produce with a
view to forging links with western businesses who can then move into their
part of the world - it's a two-way process.'
One of the pavilions at the exhibition, containing 30-40 stands, will be for
western companies already involved, or looking for involvement in central
and eastern Europe. These include AEG, Saab Scania, Rank Xerox, Ford,
Lufthansa and Amoco.
Almost half of the stands will be taken by Russian exhibitors, many of whom
will never have exhibited in the west. Stirling held seminars in Moscow on
how to produce brochures, display material, and even advice on appropriate
dress.
The event, which is expected to draw 10,000-15,000 visitors, is being
supported by two EU programmes, Phare and Tacis, which are designed to help
the move from centrally-planned to market economies in central and eastern
Europe.

FT  21 APR 94 / People: 'Great survivor' steps down from Clyde
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Colin Phipps, who is stepping down as chairman of Clyde Petroleum after more
than a decade at the helm, only went in to Britain's North Sea oil industry
in the 1960s as a temporary measure.
In the event he has turned out to be one of the great survivors among the
bosses of the small independent oil companies spawned by the discovery of
North Sea oil.
Having trained as a geologist - he did his doctorate on the geology of the
Malvern Hills - Phipps's early career was spent overseas with Shell. But he
always hankered after politics and after returning home took a job as an oil
industry consultant while he looked for a parliamentary seat.
He eventually got into Parliament in 1974 as Labour MP for Dudley West. But
by then he had founded Clyde Petroleum and soon fell out of step with the
old Labour party. Having lost his seat in the 1979 election he helped found
the Social Democratic party in 1980 and stood as an unsuccessful SDP
candidate in the 1983 and 1987 elections.
Although Clyde's market capitalisation is less than Pounds 150m, Phipps bows
out of a company which has grown into the UK's fifth biggest oil independent
and is producing a record amount of oil. Phipps' only sadness is that he is
retiring at a time 'when the industry is in severe trouble because of low
oil prices'. He notes that the membership of Brindex, the trade body for the
small oil independents, is less than half what it was when he was chairman
in 1984.
Phipps is one of the last of the entrepreneurs who were in at the beginning
of the North Sea oil boom. Several, such as Tricentrol's James Longcroft,
Jack Pierce of Ranger Oil and John Leonard of Carless Capel Leonard, have
died. Phipps could have soldiered on till in his 70s like Premier
Consolidated's Roland Shaw. But he always said that he would follow Shell's
retirement rule and go at 60. 'If you stay too long, it plays havoc with
management succession,' says Phipps, who turns 60 on July 23.
That is the date he hands over the chairmanship to his chief executive,
Malcolm Gourlay, 51, who has also been with Clyde from the start. Ex-BP man
Roy Franklin, 40, who joined in 1991, will become group managing director.

FT  21 APR 94 / People: Manduca to leave Henderson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Manduca, deputy group managing director of City fund manager Henderson
Administration, is to become chief executive of Threadneedle Asset
Management, the newly formed fund management arm of BAT Industries.
Manduca has been at Henderson for just over a year. His appointment there
followed the acquisition of investment trust managers Touche Remnant
Holdings where he had been chief executive. At the time, there was
considerable speculation about how Manduca's outspoken personal style would
mesh with Henderson's 'City gents' culture.
Henderson, which has been losing pension fund clients in its institutional
business, had been buoyed by the acquisition of TR, which made it the UK's
largest investment trust manager, and by the acquisition of Manduca,
arguably its most dynamic board member.
While Henderson insists Manduca's departure is 'not a bitter blow', it says
it is very sorry to lose him. Moreover, the departure now creates a
succession problem at Henderson. 'It was Henderson's intention to announce
that Manduca would succeed Jeremy Edwards as chairman when he retires at the
turn of 1996/97,' a spokesman said.
Threadneedle is the amalgamation of the fund management businesses of Eagle
Star and Allied Dunbar insurance companies and it has combined assets of
Pounds 30bn.

FT  21 APR 94 / Accountancy Column: Britain: an audit society in the making
 -A critique of an over-dominant approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People who spend too much time trying to measure the volume of smoke end up
being consumed by the flames that cause it. Those who gaze too intently at
columns of detailed figures lose sight of the wider issues at stake in the
organisation they are examining.
Since the early 1980s, accountants have achieved a new position in British
society more dominant than ever before, applying their skills more widely
and, in particular, disseminating in all directions one of their most
powerful tools: the audit.
From the fairly narrow application of traditional financial auditing, the
notion has spread into an ever increasing number of areas in contemporary
society.
There are: environmental, value for money, data, medical, stress and
democracy audits.
Entities such as the National Audit Office, the Audit Commission and the
European Court of Auditors have all helped to expand the role of auditors.
Even after the boom of the late 1980s, about 8 per cent of all university
graduates are still being swallowed by the traineeships offered by
accounting firms. Britain has become an 'audit society'.
This 'audit explosion' is the subject of an important new booklet published
today by Demos, the independent think-tank, and written by Michael Power, an
academic at the London School of Economics*.
Ironically, most other professions - such as teaching, medicine and more
recently law - have come under attack and have been forced to change and
become more accountable in the last decade.
Yet accountants - who are often held in lower esteem than other occupations
 -have escaped virtually unscathed. They have received little extra
scrutiny, yet all the while their power, influence and income has grown
substantially thanks to audit in its widest sense.
'Audit processes have been implicated in the new market culture,' says
Power. 'There is enormous blind faith in their benefits. What's really been
going on is a massive experiment. It's time to take stock.'
In his booklet, he warns that auditing has firmly seized the public
imagination and has had a tendency to shift notions of control and
accountability from what he calls 'Style B' to 'Style A'.
Style B involves qualitative, multiple measures, local methods, autonomy,
high levels of trust and 'real time' control. Style A is quantitative, more
focused on a single measure, using external agencies, long-distance methods,
private experts, and involves little trust.
Its approach has become so entrenched and powerful that it is difficult to
find an audience for an alternative view.
Power sketches out a number of arguments. He says that auditing has involved
the spread of a distinct mentality of administrative control, a pervasive
logic in which organisations and individuals increasingly come to regard
themselves as subjects of audit.
While the word audit is used very loosely in many different contexts, he
suggests that there is a common thread. It relies on bureaucratic procedures
which can be used for independent verification. The documents created by
these processes can then be applied outside their original context.
Audit is often seen as a series of uninteresting technical and operational
practices, but it is also an idea - and one that reflects a certain approach
to values and control. He argues that it reflects a shift in concepts of
administration and governance, at a time when society has moved from being
primarily industrial to being increasingly conscious of the production of
risks.
The growing dominance of auditing reflects a period when government has
withdrawn from the direct provision of services to take on instead a
regulatory or supervisory role. The consequence has been a shift in the role
of the state from debating broader values towards focusing on more abstract
financial and quantitative issues.
Power argues that auditing is focused not on primary activities - such as
quality - but on other systems of control, such as the mechanisms an
organisation has in place to maintain quality. As a result, they provide a
more remote level of assurance than many people imagine. It also focuses
excessive energy into an abstract 'economy of compliance'.
He says that auditing may be driven by demands for greater transparency, but
ends up making organisations more obscure. Even when there is extensive
public disclosure, it can simply pacify rather than encourage further
inquiry.
It displaces trust from operatives within organisations and on to auditors.
It may in fact spread the distrust it was meant to address, while failing to
give power to those it was intended to serve.
Power also flags up a 'remarkable' capacity of audits to be invulnerable to
their own failure. For example, the collapse of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International and the Maxwell empire were 'particularised'. They
led to calls for more and better auditing through more detailed rules
designed to respond to the particular events. They did not trigger a more
general analysis into the limitations of auditing itself.
The consequence of all these trends is that there has been growing focus on
a narrow set of measurable and controllable factors which represent only a
very limited perspective on accountability.
'Efficiency is about measuring outputs compared to inputs,' says Power. 'But
what counts as outputs? In so many areas they are difficult to measure, but
the tendency is to drift towards a few simple ones. I think we need multiple
measures.'
Audit has become a dominant influence with little scrutiny, and scant
discussion on the unintended side effects such as executive stress, a
breakdown in trust and organisational loyalty and a risk that it may be
addressing the wrong issues.
However, he suggests that audit may well be a passing phase like so many
other fashions in management thinking even though at present it seems to be
the 'natural' solution to problems.
One of the strengths of Power's analysis - and one that makes it stand out
from the work of some of his rivals in the small group of social scientists
and theorists who have explored auditing - is that he does not start from a
negative or nihilistic standpoint towards accountants and their firms.
'I am not interested in conspiracy theories,' he says. 'Accountants can't be
blamed for seeking new opportunities, though I do have questions about the
absorption of the nation's brightest and best graduates into the audit
process.'
More generally, his study represents a rare attempt to stand back and
question the very notion of auditing and the place it has assumed in
society.
The price is that anyone reading the booklet has to be prepared to wade
through some fairly abstract and theoretical notions often divorced from
specific examples.
Frustratingly, there is relatively little discussion of alternatives. Power
calls for the need to consider a broader range of approaches such as public
access to organisations, and whistleblowing. He says he wants to
re-establish trust and focus on internal rather than external measures of
accountability. But he devotes little space to developing these alternative
models.
Equally fundamental, he does little to explicitly explore whether and how
accountability and control themselves are desirable objectives.
As the starting point for a wider debate, it certainly deserves a wide
audience.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: 'Britain's finest ragworms' - The
choice of winners among environmental companies is diverse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Healthy and lively worms' are the attraction offered by Seabait, the
Northumberland-based fishing bait company which has won one of this year's
Queen's Awards for environmental achievement.
This is the second year in which the awards have been made, and like the
first, the choice of winners is striking for its diversity. The eight
winning products include technology to reduce pollution from power
generation, recycling of polythene and newsprint, and valves to handle
hazardous chemicals.
Despite this range, there is very little overlap with last year's list. The
main criterion laid down for the award is that products and processes should
make 'a significant advance' and yield 'major benefits in environmental
terms compared to existing products, technology or processes'.
Two of the award-winning companies have arisen directly from the science and
technology departments of universities. Universities have been defending the
funding for these departments partly by pointing to their capacity for
generating technological innovations.
Of the other award-winners, several say that they relied on the support of a
single large customer in developing the product, and are only now beginning
to test the waters of the international markets.
Seabait, which describes itself as 'the world's first ragworm farm' grows
'millions of Britain's finest ragworms' for use as fishing bait.
Traditionally, fishermen dig up beaches and mudflats in pursuit of the
worms, which are becoming increasingly scarce. Councils and
environmentalists have become concerned about the disruption to seashore
ecology.
Nine years after it was set up on the back of research at the University of
Newcastle upon Tyne, Seabait has seen output rise by nearly 10 times,
although it says it is 'only scratching the surface of the UK market'.
Alida Recycling, a Derbyshire-based subsidiary of British Polythene
Industries, has won an award for recycling polythene films into pellets
which are then reused in packaging. The process, which uses waste polythene
collected from stores around the country, is able to handle material which
has adhesive labels or other plastics attached to it, or is printed with
ink.
The problem of removing contaminants is one reason why recycling polythene
and other plastics is expensive and not widespread. Alida's two plants
remove these contaminants automatically. However the company notes that 'the
development of more outlets for recycled materials' remains a 'challenge' in
developing markets for their products, and that the solution is partly in
retailers' hands.
The government's current proposals - now the subject of consultation with
the packaging industry - to increase the amount of packaging that is
recycled may help the development of these markets. A new European directive
to be debated by the European Parliament could have an even greater effect.
Recycling - which is now the subject of government consultation - is also
the reason for the award to the Bridgewater Paper Company. Bridgewater,
based in the South Wirral, produces newsprint and other paper for use in
directories and other products which contain on average 80 per cent recycled
fibre.
The company, a subsidiary of Stone-Consolidated Corporation of Montreal,
Canada, exports a fifth of its product.
A second theme of the government's recent environmental policy - energy
efficiency - features in the award to Combined Power Systems. The company,
which grew out of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology, makes generators for use in hospitals, hotels and leisure
centres.
The 'combined heat and power' systems generate electricity and heat from a
single fuel in the building where the electricity is used. This enables the
waste heat from electricity generation to be used for heating the building,
making the process more efficient than conventional large-scale power
stations.
The Energy Saving Trust, set up by the government to encourage energy
efficiency and help curb the emission of gases linked to global warming, has
chosen to promote combined power systems as one of its first projects.
Similarly, Vickers Electronics, the Cheshire-based producer of
electronically-controlled heating systems, claims that its products bring
considerable energy savings. The company has won the award for its
Synchronous Burner Control, an electronic heat sensing system which allows
businesses to heat their offices more efficiently. According to the company,
the savings, which 'are achievable in most non-domestic premises', average
around 50 per cent on conventional heating systems.
Dorman Diesels, a Staffordshire-based engine manufacturer, won an award for
low emission gas engines for industry. The company, which is also known for
making diesel engines for industry, power generation and shipping, has
teamed up with German and Japanese manufacturers to market its products.
Shaw Valves of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, have won their environmental
award for producing valves to handle hazardous chemicals safely. The valve,
which arose from discussions in 1985 with ICI, the chemical group, controls
the use of liquid chlorine.
Chlorine, which is used in treating drinking water, in the production of
food and medicines and in bleaching paper, is nonetheless highly toxic and
harmful to the environment.
The company says that in developing the product it was battling against the
attitude of 'better the devil you know', which it feels is 'common in
industries with high risk processes'. The product has already secured a
contract with ICI which the company believes will be worth some Pounds
100,000 a year.
Multicore Solders, the Hertfordshire-based producer of soldering materials,
has won its award for development of new materials which eliminate the need
for cleaning with solvents after soldering.
Multicore's products, called 'no clean' solders, are used particularly by
the electronics industry in manufacturing components and assembling circuit
boards.
Many solvents used for cleaning have employed CFCs - chlorofluorocarbons -
which damage the ozone layer of the atmosphere. Since the 1992 renegotiation
of the Montreal Protocol, which governs use of ozone-damaging substances,
many countries have agreed to phase out their manufacture.
Companies which have depended on these substances have been searching for
alternatives or for new processes which eliminate the need for CFCs.
Environmental pressure groups have cautiously welcomed the introduction of a
green category to the Queen's awards. But they point out that the award
simply commends a technological development and is not the same as an
environmental audit of the companies' activities.
Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, the pressure
group, welcomed Seabait's award, saying 'bait digging causes serious damage
to wildlife in mudflats'. He called for digging licences in sensitive areas
to be revoked.
Pressure groups welcome in general the development of environmental
technology markets and the encouragement that awards schemes give to
companies competing in these arenas. However they argue strongly that the
growth of the markets is driven by regulation. 'Without intervention by
governments, these markets are not going to develop,' says Mr Lees.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Green revolution in business - The
effect legislation to protect the environment has had on managements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Queen's awards for the environment, created two years ago, have emerged
at a turning point in the environmental debate. Businesses are beginning to
pay considerable attention to 'greening' their activities.
After a decade of intense legislative effort by the UK, the European Union
and other international organisations, industries find themselves the
subject of a barrage of measures to control pollution.
You do not, however, have to assume that managements have adopted green
convictions to see why it might be in their interests to spend any money on
the environment.
Taxes on many kinds of fuel have been steadily rising, while one of the
European Union's main environmental proposals is the introduction of a tax
on energy and its carbon content, to help reduce the threat of global
warming.
The UK's much-delayed new rules on the management of landfills - licensed
rubbish dumps - which come into force on May 1, are also likely to push up
the cost of disposing of solid waste. Meanwhile, the National Rivers
Authority and the water companies have been steadily ratcheting up the cost
of permits to discharge effluent into rivers and estuaries.
Controls on air emissions are also one of the main targets of the pollution
inspectorate as it seeks to apply the provisions of the 1990 Environmental
Protection Act.
A second reason for companies' increased concern about their environmental
impact is the growing difficulty of getting planning permission for new
processes and sites. Many local councils have become tougher about granting
such permission, mindful of the public protests that now regularly follow
threats of environmental damage. Oil and chemical companies, in particular,
say privately that without a green image they will find it hard to win
planning battles.
While all these factors have had some effect in greening companies, the
spread of regulation to control pollution is the greatest driving force
behind the growth of environmental technology markets.
According to a UK government report last month, the world market for
pollution control equipment and services is worth about Dollars 210bn and
will grow to about Dollars 320bn by 2000 and Dollars 570bn by 2010. The
report said that British environmental technology companies generate an
annual trade surplus of Pounds 234m - water treatment technology is a
particularly strong sector.
However, in many sectors, UK companies lag behind German, US and Japanese
companies, whose growth has been helped by the long history of tight
environmental regulation in those countries.
Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, the pressure
group, says that the development of UK environmental technology will be
handicapped by the UK government's comparative slowness in drawing up
regulation.
But he remains sceptical that the Queen's Award scheme marks any deep-rooted
greening of British business: 'The Queen's Award will not deliver (a
thriving British environmental technology sector) unless the government uses
regulation to drive the market.'
Environmentalists and industrialists unite in pointing out that
technological innovation alone is not enough to generate these markets.
Techniques for recycling many products have been available for years, they
say, but the demand for recycled material remains low.
The near failure of the German attempts to bring in tough quotas for
recycling waste packaging shows how difficult it can be to create such
markets. In an endeavour to avoid these mistakes, the UK government has
challenged the UK packaging industry to draw up a workable scheme.
Industrialists in many sectors are also sceptical that the emergence of
environmental technology markets can compensate for the extra costs which
the rules place on businesses. They suggest, too, that much environmental
technology is relatively unsophisticated and will be rapidly 'poached' by
companies in developing countries as those markets develop.
Controversy about whether higher environmental standards in developed
countries hindered businesses when competing internationally surfaced last
week in Marrakesh in debates on the environmental implications of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Chemical companies have repeatedly
voiced their concern that western Europe will lose sectors such as bulk
chemical manufacture to other less regulated parts of the world,
particularly to eastern Europe, because of the high costs of compliance with
environmental regulation.
Such talk is anathema to many policymakers as well as environmentalists.
However, firm figures on revenues and markets are difficult to establish in
this early stage of the environmental markets' development. While schemes
such as the Queen's Awards give prominence to new green technology, the
debate about whether greener really means richer has a long way to run.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: The key to innovation - The British
problem of progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain has some of the most innovative companies in the world - as the
Queen's awards for technological achievement show.
Those companies which have succeeded technologically have been willing to
take risks or been forced to change when their markets were threatened. They
looked ahead and worked out where they wanted to be in a few year's time.
Then they invested the money and worked hard to get there.
Put like that, it sounds straightforward and obvious. But keeping up with
modern technologies, let alone leading the field, requires imagination and
vision as well as conventional management skills and proper financing.
Europe as a whole lags behind Japan and the US in high-technology
industries.
There is no obvious recipe for technological success, but those whose
companies have become innovative leaders stress the need to look wider than
the technology itself.
'Just having innovative technology is not enough to claim true innovation,'
Mr Akio Morita, chairman of Sony, the Japanese electronics giant, said at
the Royal Society in London where he gave the 1992 innovation lecture.
This year's lecture was delivered by Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive of
Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications concern which has invested heavily
 -at the expense of dividends - to stay at the front of the mobile telephone
systems market.
This was a risk that Mr Ramqvist convinced managers and shareholders to
accept a few years ago. If it had failed in any area of the technology, the
market or the timing, 'we would have been a dead duck'.
Instead, Ericsson emerged stronger than ever, more than doubling profits
last year. Ahead of his innovation speech, he praised British innovation,
but criticised the common failure to make it a commercial success. 'You have
been too prudent, too logical, you've done everything step-by-step. But in
the end, the world has moved faster.'
The lecture's sponsors, including the Confederation of British Industry and
the Department of Trade and Industry, are well aware of this failing and the
need to put it right. Their joint programme to make UK industry more
innovative - right the way through from research to the final sale of a
product - is aimed at helping to make companies more competitive in today's
fast-changing and aggressive markets.
The 18 companies winning Queen's technology awards, seven fewer than last
year, make products ranging from the prosaic such as backhoe loaders (JC
Bamford) to the esoteric like acousto-optic modulators (Gooch and Housego).
They include big companies such as British Telecommunications and the UK
division of IBM of the US and small ones like Dunn Systems and Sonardyne.
Dunn is a prime example of a company which was forced to innovate when
staring disaster in the face. The UK miners' strike more or less put paid to
its traditional coal mining equipment business, so it switched its skills to
the retail sector. 'We are a creative company, but we had to look to other
markets to live,' says Mr Dennis Kirtland, the chairman.
In its small way, Dunn's example mirrors some of the lessons which
Ericsson's performance has highlighted. One is the need for strong
commitment to a new direction, whether in products, markets or both. Another
is the awareness that companies can rarely go it alone these days.
Ericsson co-operates with a variety of outside companies on key
technologies, such as Texas Instruments. Dunn turned to Loughborough
University for help in developing sophisticated electronic controls for its
conveyors.
Mr Ramqvist made the oft-quoted point about too many British companies being
run by accountants. Clearly, if accountants had had the final say, Ericsson
would probably not have doubled the pace of its R&amp;D spending in the 1990s.
The process of innovating to stay at the forefront of technological progress
will never be over. This lesson is one which many UK companies still have to
learn.
It was put sombrely by Paul Stoneman, a professor at Warwick Business
School: 'Unless the UK invests more heavily in new technology, it will not
be able to generate the extra productivity and new products that it needs to
compete successfully in international markets and will continue its relative
decline.'

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Eggs and chips go down well -
Awards made to information technology companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Software which persuades Apples to jump through Windows, electronic locks
which yield to plastic keys and computers which shrink mainframe power to a
handy size are among the contributions of the information technology
industries to the awards for export and technology.
The technology winners - all computer makers - took their awards for
products which combine compact dimensions with substantial computing power.
Husky Computers, a 200-people-strong subsidiary of the Peek Group, has been
developing rugged, hand-held computers for data collection since the early
1980s. Its latest creation, the FS2, for which it took the award, is already
showing promise in the US where the utility metering company Itron has opted
to use it in place of its own hardware.
Psion was a pioneer in hand-held computers that pack the power of a desktop
into a package the size of an electronic organiser. Its Series 3 computer,
for which it won the award, uses a variety of advanced manufacturing methods
including surface mounted chips and folded printed circuit boards.
International Business Machines' manufacturing facility in Havant,
Hampshire, has distinguished itself more than once by serving as the sole
source world-wide for key devices. So it is with the 0681 disk drive, an
eight centimetre high box which provides enough storage for 1bn bytes of
data.
Products from equipment which makes chips, to machines which write on eggs
won export awards. ABS Electronics of County Down, Northern Ireland, won its
award for electronic locks which prevent unauthorised use of photocopiers,
printers and other office equipment. With a turnover of more than Pounds 3m
and employing some 30 people, the company's present product line developed
out of coin-operated devices. Now magnetic striped cards are the key to the
lock. Some 95 per cent of sales are outside Northern Ireland.
Applied Implant Technology is the UK subsidiary of Applied Materials of
Santa Clara, California, one of the world's largest manufacturers of
semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Established in the UK since 1980, it
has won an award for exports of its Precision Implant 9500 ion implant
machine - essentially an electronic gun which 'shoots' ions of boron,
arsenic or phosphorus into the microchip surface. The 9500 was designed in
the UK and the entire yearly output of 50 machines is exported.
Semefab, now operating out of General Instrument's old semiconductor
fabrication plant in Glenrothes, Scotland, is evidence that a UK company can
be successful at the leading edge of the semiconductor business. Started
eight years ago as a subsidiary of the privately held UK company Semilab of
Lutterworth, it employs 55 people and turned over Pounds 3.8m last year. It
makes custom semiconductors for customers in the US, Hong Kong, Germany and
Switzerland.
Software supplied by Insignia Solutions of High Wycombe depends on the
success of Microsoft's 'Windows' operating system. Windows - and therefore
Windows applications - runs on personal computers which use Intel
microprocessors, that is, about 90 per cent of all pcs. Insignia's software
persuades other kinds of computer - Apple Macintosh, Unix-based and so on -
that they, too, can run Windows and MS/DOS applications. With its
headquarters in the UK, the company has US operations in Mountain View,
California. Some 95 per cent of the company's sales - Dollars 19m in 1992 -
are outside the UK.
International Banking Information Systems makes a different scale and
flavour of software. Part of the Italian Monte dei Paschi banking group (IBM
has a 10 per cent stake in the company), its principal offering is a
fully-integrated banking package running on IBM's mid-range AS/400 computer.
IBIS is one of a small number of companies - the others include BIS, now
part of ACT, and Kapiti, taken over last month by Misys - which have been
developing international banking packages since the 1980s. Some 70 per cent
of IBIS sales are abroad.
Lombard Risk Systems, based in London, also develops software for financial
services but within a narrower focus. Founded in 1988, it has grown to 50
people selling a software package which enables banks and leading companies
to manage the risks of trading in financial derivatives such as interest
rates and currency swaps, caps, floors and swaptions. Called 'Oberon', the
package will also handle less complicated instruments such as futures,
options on futures, loans, deposits and bonds.
Exports have nearly trebled over the past three years and 60 per cent of
revenues come from outside the UK.
Scientific Software Intercomp, British subsidiary of a US company based in
Denver, Colorado, provides consultancy services and develops software for
the oil and gas industry. Its packages fulfil a variety of functions. Some
are used to analyse data derived from oil reservoirs enabling engineers to
describe the reservoirs in numerical terms. Others can be used to simulate
the behaviour of the reservoirs.
The telecommunications and data communications business is represented by
three companies, Cable &amp; Wireless, Philips Telecom and Madge Networks. It is
the second time C&amp;W has won an award; perhaps not surprisingly because this
UK-based telecommunications group, which includes Mercury Communications,
has a powerful reputation for winning business overseas. In the past year,
it has secured contracts in collaboration with Telecom Finland to develop
telecommunications services in Latvia, it is working on cellular radio
networks in South Africa, a joint venture in undersea cables with the
Chinese government and it is chasing developments in Bulgaria.
It is also second time round for Philips Telecom although it was the
technology award which it won in 1989. Now it exports more than 50 per cent
of its radio pagers to mainland Europe, especially Sweden, India and the Far
East. The pagers are designed and manufactured in Philips' Cambridge
facility.
Madge Networks, one of the UK's few international successes in computer
technology, has taken on a bewilderingly cosmopolitan air in the past few
months. With headquarters in Paris, it is registered in Amsterdam, carries
out research and development in the UK and is listed on the US NASDAQ
market. The company supplies hardware and software for computer networks
which stretch across organisations. It specialises in local area networks
using IBM's token ring technology.
Advertising on eggs, a current fad, is made possible by continuous inkjet
printers, tough, industrial variants of the familiar office machines,
developed by companies such as Willett International. It is this company's
second award.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Invisible exports - Bechtel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is invisible, yet profitable, and exported only to return to the UK?
And why on earth should anything which fits this description win a Queen's
Award?
The answer is people - or rather, their skills. Bechtel Ltd, the UK arm of
the San Francisco based corporation, has won the Queen's Award for exports
for the second time in three years by selling skills from the UK abroad -
otherwise known as 'invisible exports'.
'Because we are a service company it is difficult to show what we export,'
Bechtel says. Yet between 1991 and 1992, Bechtel exported more than 500
people from the UK to support the fire-fighting teams in Kuwait. They built
roads, cleared mines, designed and constructed equipment - 'anything needed
to help fight fires', the company says.
Bechtel set up shop in the UK in 1952. It provides a range of engineering,
procurement, construction and project management services to customers as
diverse as the power industry, chemical companies, petroleum and mining
group, and the civil sector.
The company claims its export success is based on the wide range and
flexibility of services offered: 'It is  .. how we are able to compete.'
Between 1990 and 1992 Bechtel recorded substantial and sustained increases
in export revenues from projects in the Middle East, Africa and the former
Soviet states.
For Africa alone, Bechtel's exports during that period increased by 600 per
cent. Since 1988, overall export earnings have risen more than 300 per cent.
The largest market is the Middle East, closely followed by Africa.
Future growth, however, lies in the under-developed regions of central and
eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union. 'We are looking to increase our
market share particularly in those countries,' the company says.
Bechtel's determination to expand the markets for services such as
procurement and project management also has a knock-on effect for Britain's
export industry, the company claims.
'We provide opportunities for UK manufacturers to bid for contracts worth
many hundreds of millions of pounds,' Bechtel says. 'That is a significant
contribution we can make by being successful.'

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Postman Pat gets his reward - A
media company producing animated TV shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Postman Pat, the animated puppet, has been entertaining pre-school children
for years with his gentle humour in the small community of Greendale, but
now at last has won some official recognition for his efforts.
The character has, along with Peter Rabbit, Captain Zed and even
Shakespeare: the Animated Tales, helped to win a Queen's award for exports
for HiT Entertainment, the UK television distribution and co-production
finance company.
The company which started business in October 1989 with only 40 episodes of
Alvin and the Chipmunks and Postman Pat to offer broadcasters, now has one
of the largest animation libraries outside the US with more than 700 half
hours and a total of 900 hours of programming overall.
In addition to animation HiT, which had pre-tax profits of just under Pounds
1m in its last financial year, has developed a second area of expertise -
distributing nature films from around the world under its Wild Media brand
name.
The company is also the exclusive distributor of the programmes of
Television New Zealand which has a catalogue of more than 400 hours of
family drama and natural history programmes.
'More than 90 per cent of our business involves exports,' says Mr Peter
Orton, managing director of HiT, who at the moment is at the international
programme market at Cannes trying to get more television series off the
ground and into international markets.
HiT Entertainment has won its export award in the first year in which it was
eligible - three years complete accounts are needed to be considered.
Recently HiT and Flextech, the oil services company that turned itself into
a media group, confirmed plans to set up a new Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.5m)
fund to back animated programmes. The aim is to create a range of new
animated titles - among the most international of all programme genres - in
the UK, continental Europe and the US. HiT has already come a long way in
just over four years since it was set up by the former sales team of Henson
International Television, a subsidiary of Henson Associates, the company
famous for programmes such as The Muppet Show.
The subsidiary was allowed to move off on its own by Mr Jim Henson, who
before his death had been negotiating to sell Henson Associates to Walt
Disney.
Mr Orton put Pounds 300,000 of his own money in the project and Flextech
took a 20 per cent stake which has now grown to 24 per cent.
The HiT managing director believes the company has been able to grow partly
at least because it is a niche player and has not tried to compete with the
big studios head on.
Distribution these days increasingly involves far more than acquiring rights
to programmes and selling them to broadcasters all over the world.
A good distributor, Mr Orton emphasises, should be in at the start of a
programme concept and be able to create a sales package and raise production
finance before shooting even begins.
For instance, HiT recognised the potential in the Where's Wally books which
have sold more than 16m copies worldwide.
It financed the development costs of preparing an animated series called
Where's Waldo, based on the books, to offer to network television in the US.
On the basis of a detailed treatment and a pilot episode CBS paid Dollars
295,000 an episode for a 13-part series - the first time a US network had
taken a UK-originated series.
The series, however, cost Dollars 345,000 an episode to make. HiT funded the
deficit which it recouped from international sales including a pre-sale,
selling rights in advance of production to TBS, the Japanese commercial
network.
Overall the series generated Dollars 222,000 an episode in television and
video cassette sales outside the US.
An even more complex international story lay behind the making of
Shakespeare: the Animated Tales - six half-hour animated Shakespeare plays
each of which cost Dollars 800,000 to make.
The Welsh Fourth Channel, S4C, the BBC and the Russian animated studio
Soyuzmultfilm were all involved.
HiT was responsible for raising co-production funding and received financial
commitments from HBO, the American pay television network, and Fujisankei,
the Japanese commercial network operator as well as making pre-sales in both
Germany and France.
Meanwhile, Alvin and the Chipmunks and Postman Pat go marching on, because
as Peter Orton says, one of the main advantages of distributing children's
animation programmes - apart from the ease of dubbing into any language - is
that a new audience appears without fail every three or four years.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Tough talking men of cloth - Jenny
Luesby tests the fabric of high-speed textile makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Snap-Drape won a Pounds 50,000 order from Eurodisney to dress five
hotels - worth of tables in covers and skirts, it must have known it had
broken through into the ranks of the outstanding exporter.
'In 1982, we thought table skirting would be a nice little earner for the
two of us, my wife and myself,' says Mr Peter Graville, Snap-Drape's
managing director. 'Within six months we realised we had a really good
product, and we got serious.'
For directors' lunches and conferences, wedding receptions and hotel
buffets, Mr Graville and his wife toiled in the garage of their Cheam home,
whipping up Austrian valances with swags, Victorian skirts with lace
overlays and two - tier tables bedecked in regency pleats.
In seven pleat - styles, nine fabrics and 150 colours, they moved into the
screen printing of company logos and the marketing of mobile storage
caddies.
The result, last year, was export earnings of Pounds 1m for 30 miles of
tablecloths and 33 miles of table skirting.
'We created a market,' says Mr Graville, 'that is why we succeeded.'
'It can take two hours to box a tablecloth around a six-foot table using
pins - and then you have to undo it again. Ours clip on in minutes, and off,
and on again.'
Booming overseas sales in the UK textile industry are not based on price
competition. They require something else, be it speed, flexibility, quality
or design.
Another winner that went down the design path is Crowson fabrics of east
Sussex, which markets 2,500 choices of fabrics and wallpapers as next-day
deliveries within Europe. The company has increased its exports from Pounds
7.5m to Pounds 20m in just three years, thanks to its 'design flair', it
says.
'We have 11 designers, all of them under 25, who came to us straight from
design college. The point is that their work gets copied. Their designs have
made us industry leaders,' says Crowson.
The company cites as its latest success a Javanese collection, in rich and
vibrant colours, 'inspired by south sea island folk lore and art'.
However, speed and flexibility feature more strongly as the bywords of this
year's textile winners.
'Quick response production' is the industry jargon for what is better about
British textiles. What it means is that for award-winning fashion exporters
Mondbury, and Finesse 14-day delivery is a basic tenet, not an optional
extra.
'Everything is built for speed,' says Mr Stephen Sugarman of Finesse.
Cash-rich, Finesse 'does not work with banks,' he says. The company keeps
bulk fabric stocks to feed the 50 sub-contractors that it employs: 'They get
the order and they get the fabric, the same day.'
Finesse has increased its exports five-fold in the last three years, to 75
per cent of its roughly Pounds 9m of annual sales.
'We've got there by catching the market,' says Mr Sugarman. 'If they want
ruffled blouses in Europe, we supply them, and if they sell out in 10 days,
we supply them again. Every week, I drive around Europe, making contacts,
marketing our service. In garment runs from 500 to 10,000, what we offer is
speed.'
Mondbury operates to much the same philosophy, but has carved out a niche
market in French and German mail order women's clothes.
'Our prices are much the same as our competitors, but we're quicker,' says
Mr Anthony Ruffman. Mondbury's chairman. 'We can deliver a finished product
in two weeks, and that's impossible from south-east Asia.'
In three years, Mondbury has doubled its exports, to Pounds 3.2m. 'Our move
into the export market was a conscious decision. We had to do something. The
UK market was getting tougher and tougher. Our turnover and our margins were
falling. But with a low cost base and minimal overheads, we've been able to
compete in Europe.'
'In fact, what has surprised us is just how conservative the European market
is for women's clothing. It doesn't change. We sell Princess-line type
dresses. None of them are short and they're all in Polyester, which wouldn't
suit a younger market. And every year navy and white is a winner.'
Youth is, nonetheless, a feature of Mondbury's award. Snap-Drape, Crowson,
Finesse and Mondbury are all youngsters in the British textile industry,
every one established between 1978 and 1982.
It is the old timers that the world's market for high-quality garments has
embraced.
J. Barbour and Sons, the maker of weatherproof country clothing, traces its
history back to 1894. Today's award is its second, having doubled its
exports again since winning in 1992. It now sells more than half its
production overseas, with the US, Germany and France its three biggest
markets.
But the prize for the vibrant oldie must surely go to James Johnston and
Company of Elgin, founded in 1798. Export sales now account for 40 per cent
of its total production with annual sales of more than Pounds 2m in both
Germany and Japan.
It, too, has gone for quick response production. 'We can serve the
just-in-time syndrome because we are completely vertical in our production
methods,' says Mr James Sugden, Johnstons' managing director.
'We bring raw cashmere into the Scottish Highlands and then process it
completely, into a branded garment, for export. There are no intermediate
processes and we have control over speed and quality.'
'We've also become more aggressive in our buying policies - access to China
is easier, and we're now buying our cashmere off the back of the goat in
Mongolia. But there really are a lot of unexploited markets out there for
luxury clothes. Just building up a distribution network has boosted our
sales.'
Thus, Johnston has doubled its exports of cashmere clothes in three years,
to Pounds 9m.
It is a tough job being a successful British textiles exporter, but it seems
as if the men of cloth have not yet been deterred.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Earthmovers scoop awards - JCB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TRAHERNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simply commending JCB, the Midlands based manufacturer of construction
equipment, for winning two Queen's Awards would be only to scratch the
surface of what many in the construction plant sector will undoubtedly
acknowledge is a remarkable achievement.
It is not so much that the company has scooped two Queen's Awards in one
year for the second time - JCB Hydrapower has received an export award for
its mini-excavator range and the backhoe loader division of JC Bamford
Excavators has won a technology award - but more the way it has achieved its
goals.
When JCB Hydrapower entered the mini - excavator market (a segment of the
industry for diggers up to six tonne operating weight) with its own product
in 1989 the news prompted mixed reactions from the competition.
JCB had built its reputation on the success of its now famous backhoe loader
digger. The mini - excavator market, however, was saturated with well -
established brand names, many belonging to Japanese manufacturers which had
built up big sales in their domestic market. By the late 1980s they were
feeding European customers from factories within the Euroepan Union.
But JCB had identified a growth market and the company argued that the mini
 -excavator was a natural extension of the backhoe loader concept, the
cornerstone of the JCB empire.
To attack what was predominantly a Japanese - controlled industry in Europe
JCB moved a small subsidiary, JCB Hydrapower, to its own facility in
Rugeley, Staffordshire, away from the hub of JCB's operations at Rocester,
Staffordshire.
Under the guidance of Mr Martin Coyne, now JCB's group's chief executive, a
single status plant was established and an assembly line laid down in 1988.
The company addressed the largest segment of the UK market first, launching
a 1.4 tonne machine in early 1989. It was robust and simple to operate and
maintain.
'We went for the largest segment of the market to prove our ability and
technology without overstretching our position,' explains Mr Howard
McCallum, JCB Hydrapower's director and general manager.
The company then turned to continental Europe, developing a three tonne
machine in 1991 which would appeal to owner - operators. It also developed
three machines around 1.5 tonne but to higher specifications than the
original unit.
This further enriched the range of machines it could offer into this high
volume market segment which could 'cater for the vastly different tastes in
continental Europe,' says Mr McCallum.
The tactics worked. Total sales in Europe grew from some 14,470 units in
1989 to 20,380 units in 1992 before easing back to around 18,000 last year,
according to London-based Corporate Intelligence Group. And JCB Hydrapower
says that between 1991 and 1993 its market share in Germany grew from 1.3
per cent to 2.6 per cent (the German market peaked at 11,000 units in 1992
according CIG), in France increased from 4 per cent to 7 per cent and rose
marginally in Italy.
During the same period the value of its mini - excavator exports increased
from Pounds 5.25m to Pounds 8.3m. The company this year has increased
production from six to 11 machines a day and is changing the factory layout
to triple capacity to 3,000 units a year.
It was the needs of a much smaller market which prompted the group's backhoe
loader division to develop the award winning 4CX 4x4x4 Servoplus. The
machine is a derivative of the equal - sized wheel, all - wheel steer 4CX
which cost around Pounds 4m to develop and was launched three years ago.
A backhoe loader digger, the 4CX combines the stability of a rigid chassis
machine with the manoeuvrability of its articulated competitors through the
introduction of four wheel steer and four wheel drive.
The Servoplus version was developed some 18 months ago at a cost of about
Pounds 250,000. The Servo system itself - joystick controls built into the
armrests which allow the operator to control many functions with fingertip
movements rather than moving levers - is not new but JCB has developed what
it claims is a unique double command servo system which allows the operator
to drive and operate the machine from two standard operating positions.
The machine was developed initially for the demanding conditions experienced
in the Nordic countries, a small but technically sensitive market.
Since the introduction of the Servoplus, JCB's market share in the Nordic
countries has increased from 14 per cent to 25 per cent. Dr Henry Shirman,
managing director of the backhoe loader division, says the Servoplus
machines have generated interest in other technically sensitive but much
larger markets such as Germany, France and North America.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Trio get the chequered flag - The
dominant role the UK plays in motor racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three export achievement awards in the motor sport sector, to Williams Grand
Prix Engineering, race-engine designer and manufacturer Ilmor Engineering
and precision castings specialists Zeus Aluminium Products, underline the
dominant role played by the UK in the world motor racing industry.
The industry accounts for more than three-quarters of all the world's
single-seater racing car production; behind closed doors, it designs,
develops and builds many of the cars raced or rallied by leading Japanese,
German and other foreign car makers under their own names; it has an annual
turnover of more than Pounds 1bn (of which exports account for more than 40
per cent) and employs around 50,000.
Unlikely as it may sound, a diet of pasta, coffee and cigarettes has helped
the Williams grand prix team, which employs more than 200 and is one of the
top names in motor sport, collect its second award for export achievement
since managing director Frank Williams founded the team at Didcot,
Oxfordshire, in 1976.
This year's award is based on the fact that Williams Grand Prix Engineering,
six-times winner of the Formula One constructors' world championship,
derives 70 per cent of its Pounds 30m quoted turnover from non-UK companies
taking advertising space on its 700 horsepower, Renault-powered projectiles
which carried Frenchman Alain Prost to his fourth world driver's
championship title - and gave Englishman Damon Hill his grand prix debut -
last year.
That the Italian companies Divella (pasta maker), Sega Fredo (coffee) and
tobacco multinational Rothmans are prepared collectively to spend millions
to put their names on Williams' race cars might sound just cause for
shareholder apoplexy - until global TV viewing figures are taken into
account.
On average, each of last year's 16 grands prix was watched by more than 439m
in 121 countries. Williams' and a handful of other grand prix teams can
attract particularly large sums because TV cameras almost invariably spend
most time focused on the front-runners.
Thus in fact, if not in name, the award is also a recognition of the
engineering technology which for years has kept Williams at the front of the
grand prix field, despite a poor start to the current season.
In addition to their livery on the grand prix cars, overseas sponsors also
capitalise on Williams' name in active marketing of their products or
services. Renault itself has taken advantage of Williams' cachet, as well as
its engineering capabilities, to launch a limited production version of its
Clio hatchback - the Clio 'Williams'.
Brixworth, Northamptonshire-based Ilmor Engineering is not quite such a
'household' name, but has made a substantial impact in both grand prix and
IndyCar racing since it was founded in 1984.
This season in particular, its engines have swept the Penske IndyCar team to
victory in the first two races of North America's premier motor racing
championship, leaving 1993 IndyCar champion Nigel Mansell's Lola Ford
Cosworth in their wake. (It is indicative of the extraordinary strength of
the UK motor industry that almost every car on the championship's grid -
including Penske - is British-made. Lola itself is a past export award
winner and has won the past five IndyCar championships in succession.)
Meanwhile, the black Sauber-Mercedes cars have become a familiar sight to
grand prix watchers - except that beneath their engines' camshaft covers,
complete with three-pointed stars, lies not Mercedes' mechanicals but
Ilmor's. And when Mercedes makes its scheduled entry into IndyCar racing as
well in 1995, that engine, too, will be an Ilmor.
Like many other leading car makers engaged in motor sport, Mercedes is using
Ilmor not just because of the depth of its engineering expertise but because
its relatively small size - fewer than 150 employees - gives it the speed
and flexibility of response needed in motor racing and which it is very
difficult for a large company to achieve.
It is entirely engineering driven - its co-founders Mario Ilien and Paul
Morgan are both former Cosworth engineers.
Such is the closeness of the association between Ilmor and the German
manufacturers that Mercedes has taken a 25 per cent stake in the company
formerly held by General Motors' Chevrolet division. Longer term, it could
lead to Ilmor-based high performance versions of some Mercedes cars.
Zeus Aluminium Products is on a yet smaller scale, employing 16 at its plant
in Dudley, West Midlands, where it produces precision sand castings in
aluminium and magnesium alloys.
The castings it makes - far removed, says managing director Peter Harpin,
from the low-tech image of traditional foundries - find their way into
competition vehicles across the motor sport spectrum. Nor are they minor
components. Zeus's output includes both engine cylinder blocks and head
castings. They and other cast components are to be found in Le Mans, grand
prix, British and German touring cars and IndyCar racers. However, Zeus is
not confining itself to motor sport activities. It is designing and
developing new ideas and technologies for a wide array of thinwall castings
requiring great accuracy. The company is also considering adding machining
downstream of its casting processes to meet a growing demand for more
finished products.
Zeus was founded as a toolmaking business in 1974 by chairman Mr Brian
Poade. Zeus Pattern and Tool Company and Bullock and Mills, also in tooling,
form the biggest part of the group, which employs 140.
The castings company turned over Pounds 3.5m last year, and Mr Harpin
forecasts that it will exceed Pounds 4m this year. 'We want to be a Pounds
10m-a-year company by 1996,' he maintains.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: APV's hot competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
APV Baker, a subsidiary of food processing equipment group APV, shares a
Queen's Award for Technology for the commercial development of ohmic
heating.
APV Baker secured a licence for the system from EA Technology in 1984 and
spent millions of pounds turning it into a commercial product which was
launched in the late 1980s.
The technology has been showered with awards over the last few years yet in
spite of its significant advantages over existing heating processes APV has
sold only Pounds 6m worth of equipment so far.
APV blames conservatism in the food industry. 'The western food giants are
approaching it with caution though the Japanese have seized on it,' said a
spokesman.
Among the 13 installations ordered worldwide six have been sold in Japan.
These include the Wildfruit Products Division of Nissei which supplies the
Japanese market with processed fruit for use in bakery and dairy products.
The only commercial scale installation in the UK is at Deeside-based Sous
Chef, a company formed specifically to capitalise on the new technology
which was recently acquired by Heinz.
The other installations and the identity of the 'dozens' of food
manufacturers that are evaluating the technology are confidential.
Even the UK food manufacturer which worked with EA and APV on the technology
remains anonymous. 'No-one wants their competitors to know what they are
doing,' said APV.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: The European bridgehead - Kevin
Done discusses the runaway success of Japanese carmakers in the UK. Nissan
has now won a Queen's award for three years in succession while Honda joins
the ranks of winners for the first time
</HEADLINE>

Japanese carmakers have quickly established the UK as their main bridgehead
in Europe and last year accounted for three of the top six places as UK car
exporters.
Nissan, which has now won the Queen's Award for Exports for three years in
succession, emerged as the leading UK car exporter last year outstripping
the traditional heavyweights of the motor industry in Britain, Rover group,
Ford and Vauxhall.
Honda has joined the ranks of export award winners for the first time, as
production builds up at its plant at Swindon, Wiltshire.
Its award this time, however, is largely based on exports of cars produced
for it under licence at Rover's Longbridge, Birmingham assembly plant.
Car output is also rising quickly at the Toyota car assembly plant at
Burnaston, near Derby. By the second half of the 1990s Japanese carmakers
will be accounting for around a third of UK car production.
Nissan, which has the largest share of any Japanese carmaker both in the UK
and in the overall western European new car markets, was the first Japanese
producer to begin car production in Europe in 1986.
By last year output at its Pounds 900m plant at Sunderland in north-east
England, had jumped to 246,281 of which 74 per cent was exported, although
production is forecast by the company to fall to between 200,000 and 240,000
this year.
Nissan's car exports have climbed from 59,739 in 1990 to 112,700 in 1991, to
157,234 in 1992 and reached a peak of 182,207 last year.
Exports accounted for around 90 per cent of output in both 1991 and 1992,
when the UK market was in recession, but the export share fell last year, as
demand picked up in the UK and markets weakened in continental Europe.
Measured by the volume of car exports, Nissan moved ahead of the Rover
group, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, for the first time last year with
shipments of 182,207 compared with the Rover group's 161,932.
The Rover total included some Honda Concertos produced for the Japanese car
maker under licence at Rover's Longbridge, Birmingham, plant.
Trailing in the wake of these two groups were General Motors of the US with
its Vauxhall and IBC Vehicles subsidiaries with car exports of 72,090, and
the Ford group of the US with total car exports of 34,217.
The Ford total included 22,999 Jaguars and only 11,218 cars exported under
the Ford badge.
Ford car exports, excluding Jaguar, have plunged under the impact of the
recession in continental European new car markets falling from 120,178 in
1991 and 72,825 in 1992.
The volume of exports of Ford-badged cars was overtaken last year by all
three Japanese carmakers producing in the UK.
Toyota car export volumes of 27,735 and Honda exports of 27,121 (excluding
cars produced under licence by Rover) also exceeded exports by Peugeot
Talbot, a former Queen's Export award winner. Peugeot's shipments of cars
from the UK fell to 25,975 from 52,099 in 1992 and a peak of 83,591 in 1990.
Honda and Toyota both began production in the UK at their own plants in late
1992, although the assembly of Honda-badged cars under licence by Rover in
the UK began in 1986 with the export of such cars starting in 1987.
Honda itself produced 32,139 cars (the Accord large family car) at its
Pounds 370m plant at Swindon last year, of which 84 per cent were exported.
Output at the plant is planned to rise to 50,000 this year and to 100,000 in
1995.
Its export effort, which until late 1992, was based on cars assembled by
Rover, is set to gather pace rapidly, when it adds production of a second
car range at Swindon late this year.
Production of the Honda Concerto by Rover will cease later this year, and
the replacement car will be produced at Swindon.
Output by Toyota at its Pounds 700m Burnaston car plant (it is also
investing Pounds 140m at its Deeside engine plant) totalled 37,314 last
year, of which 74 per cent was exported. Output is planned to reach 100,000
already this year.
Nissan said that the export earnings of its Sunderland plant totalled Pounds
967m in 1993 compared with Pounds 911m in 1992 and Pounds 695m in 1991.
It said the overall contribution by the plant to the UK balance of trade
totalled around Pounds 500m after subtracting the value of imported
components.
Honda said that the value of its exports rose from Pounds 160m in 1991 to
Pounds 188m in 1992 and Pounds 304m in 1993, although in the first two years
the exports were solely of cars assembled for it by Rover under licence.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Malted health drinks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the highly competitive food and drinks ingredients sector, flakes don't
usually last. But for Edme, the malt and malted ingredients manufacturer,
flakes have brought the company great success, and this year, a Queen's
Award for export achievement.
Mr David Bevan, managing director of Edme heads the Essex-based company
which has increased its exports by 400 per cent in the past five years.
Exports to more than 35 countries, predominantly in North America and
Europe, accounted for one third of the company's Pounds 9m turnover in 1993.
Edme was founded in 1884 along the River Stour at Mistley, Essex, and 120
employees still work on that 4.5-acre site today.
Edme was incorporated into the Anglia Maltings Holdings group in 1972 and
the company began expanding into markets in North America and Europe in the
late 1980s.
During the 1980s, the company bought the Tom Caxton brand of home brew kits
from Colmans and the Sparklets company, which produces soda syphons for the
drinks industry, from the British Oxygen Company.
Now the company supplies barley malt extracts to the brewing, bakery and
breakfast cereal industries, malt flours for the biscuit and bakery
industries and produces a canning line for the production of home brew kits.
Edme also manufactures malted wheat for the increasingly health conscious
food industry and speciality syrup-based products for brewers.
Although Edme is one of the smallest malt producing companies, it plans to
move into Middle Eastern and Asian markets.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Breaking into outer Mongolia -
Norbrook Laboratories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The break-up of the former Soviet Union has helped Norbrook Laboratories
break into its furthest - flung market.
The veterinary pharmaceuticals company, based in Newry, Northern Ireland,
now has a good line selling animal antibiotics to Mongolia.
Mr Alan Patterson, deputy managing director, said: 'Mongolia was left in the
lurch by its former Soviet suppliers and we now do significant business with
our range of antibiotics for goats and cattle.'
Such successes have now gained Norbrook its third Queen's Award for Export.
It previously won the award in 1987 and 1990.
Since 1991 Norbrook's export sales have risen by 86 per cent and account for
nearly 85 per cent of turnover.
'Since the last time we won the award in 1990 we have started selling in 22
new countries taking the total number to 95. There are now not many more
countries left,' said Mr Patterson.
Founded in 1969 by Mr Edward Haughey, chairman and managing director,
Norbrook now has 350 staff in Newry, making it the town's largest private
sector employer.
It has a further 50 employees in its overseas offices in the US, Holland and
Kenya.
Mr Patterson said that the company could not survive without exports.
'Research and development is very important and very expensive so we have to
develop products for the global market,' he says.
The company has 44 staff in research and development on which it spends
around 10 per cent of its sales.
Mr Patterson said that recent export growth was based largely on a series of
new products, including Alamycin LA 300, the world's first antibiotic to
give animals cover for six days.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Wagons roll into Eastern Europe -
Burton's gold medal biscuits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weston's Wagon Wheels - the chocolate - coated, mallow - filled biscuits
beloved of children in the UK - have established a new market: they are now
among the most popular imported biscuits on sale in Russia.
Their manufacturer, Burton's Biscuits, has won a Queen's Award for exports
thanks to a surge in overseas sales in the past three years.
Although Burton's still only exports about a fifth of its Pounds 160m
turnover, its exports have doubled in the past three years and rose by 70
per cent in the past two years.
Burton's claims to be the UK's fastest growing biscuit manufacturer. It is
part of Associated British Foods, which merged with Weston Biscuit company
in 1968. The Weston family are major shareholders in the big milling and
baking group with Mr Garfield Weston chairman.
Burton's products include Jammie Dodgers, Jaffa Cakes, Royal Edinburgh
Shortbread, Rich Tea biscuits and Liquorice Allsorts. It produces its
biscuits and other confectionery in factories at Llantarnam in Gwent, in
Edinburgh and in Blackpool where the business was founded in 1935.
Though based in Bracknell, Berkshire, its export division is based in
Edinburgh. Burton's has invested Pounds 80m in manufacturing equipment in
the past seven years.
According to Mr Ian Gibson, the general manger of the export division, the
company's export efforts focus on Europe. 'We've developed private label
products for food retailers in France and the Netherlands to sell under
their own names, and we also have a branded operation,' he says.
The Nordic countries are good markets for Burton's brands, and its biscuits
sell in Singapore, Australia and North America.
Burton's is a good example of a British manufacturer taking advantage of the
opening up of eastern European markets since the fall of the Berlin wall in
1989.
As well as selling in Russia it has also developed markets in Hungary,
Bulgaria and Slovenia.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Piglets in paradise - SCA Nutrition
/ Normal feed fails to produce textures necessary for young animals.
Acceptability, digestibility and palatability are crucial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
SCA Nutrition, founded in 1973, has grown into Britain's leading
manufacturer of food for piglets and other young farm animals.
The Yorkshire-based company has a significant share of the UK milk replacer
and free access mineral market and is the market leader in piglet diets
producing over 50,000 tonnes annually.
Piglet feed accounts for roughly 85 per cent of turnover although the
company also produces specialist food for calves and lambs and its own dog
food - SCA Dog Diet - which is favoured by sheep dog owners.
Total turnover grew from Pounds 14.7m in 1990/91 to Pounds 23.5m in 1992/93
while exports increased almost sevenfold over the same period jumping from
Pounds 784,000 to Pounds 5.35m.
Outside the UK the company now claims a 20 per cent market share in Denmark.
Other export markets include Ireland and Spain, where SCA has subsidiaries,
Portugal, Italy, Germany, France and Poland.
SCA was founded by Mr Stephen Clements and remained a small privately owned
company until the 1980s when it was acquired by NuTec. Early last year it
was bought by Eridania Beghin-Say, a French group. The number of employees
has grown from 61 in 1990/91 to 84 today.
The company's success in the young animal feed market reflects its
accumulated experience and expertise in animal feed technology.
SCA claims that conventional feed manufacturing techniques cannot produce
the finished product textures which are so necessary for young animal diets.
The company says: 'Acceptability, digestibility and palatability are
crucial.'
All products are manufactured using specialist plant at Thirsk, North
Yorkshire. Heat sensitive milk products are carefully blended in the
manufacture of milk replacers while other specialist processing equipment is
used to produce piglet diets.
The company's commitment to quality was recognised last year when its gained
BS 5750 accreditation on its first attempt.
SCA products are distributed throughout the UK through a network of
merchants and compounders. Product support is provided to distributors and
their customers through practical, on-farm specialists who offer advice not
only on feeding regimes, but also on environmental and disease control,
housing and general management.
Reflecting its confidence in the future SCA has already commissioned the
design and building of a new production mill which will open shortly and
will double production capacity to more than 100,000 tonnes per annum.
The company also recognises the need to consolidate its market position
though an extensive programme of product development. Accordingly a
dedicated team of nutritionists continuously monitor the world's research
papers.
All product developments are thoroughly tried and tested on farms under
controlled conditions before being incorporated into the product range.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Medical men making money -
Novocastra Laboratories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Novocastra Laboratories, founded in May 1989 by three members of Newcastle
University's medical staff, has built a fast growing business producing and
supplying specialist antibodies to medical researchers such as those
involved in cancer research.
The company, which employs 14 people, is managed by Professor Charles Horne,
a practising academic histopathologist, assisted by Dr Brian Angus, also an
academic histopathologist, and Dr Geoffrey Toms, an academic virologist with
close links to the Royal Victoria Infirmary virus detection laboratory.
As such Novocastra is a prime example of the successful transfer of
technology from an academic environment to commerce.
Newcastle University retains a minority stake of 'less than 20 per cent' in
the company and provides Novocastra with an academic, research and facility
base.
Exports, valued at Pounds 660,000 in 1992/93, represent about 94 per cent of
turnover and are expected to top Pounds 1m next year reflecting the rapidly
expanding market for biotechnology derived products and the increasing need
for high quality low cost medical diagnostic and research products.
The company's main export market is the US followed by Japan, Germany, Italy
and France. The freeze-dried antibodies are dispatched by courier from the
company's Newcastle University premises to order.
Prof Horne, Novocastra's chairman and managing director who also received an
MBE in the new year's Honours list for services to science and export, says
the company could not survive in the UK market alone.
'We are very much export oriented,' he says, adding, 'there is really no
reason why we should not continue to grow rapidly.'
Novocastra produces more than 200 niche re-agent products, mostly monoclonal
antibodies which are marketed for use in immunohistochemistry by biomedical
researchers and histopathologists working in hospitals, universities and
other medical establishments around the world.
The technique enables researchers to identify specific molecules in tissue
when viewed through a microscope. For example one product is used to
identify breast cancer while others, which helped establish the company in
the market, can be used to test for muscular dystrophy and other muscular
disease.
Prof Horne says the fact that the company is run by people who actually use
the products in their own clinical research gives it a key advantage.
'We are in a position to identify what people need and want,' he says.
Several of the company's main research products have been funded by the UK
department of Trade and Industry through its SMART award scheme - Novocastra
has won six SMART awards.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Serving seafood to the Far East -
Loch Fyne Oysters / James Buxton examines five companies which are leading
Scotland's export drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once a week a consignment of oysters, smoked salmon and other Scottish
seafood leaves Loch Fyne in Argyllshire to be airfreighted to Hong Kong.
There, the delicacies are eaten in leading hotels and an oyster bar, and are
supplied to delicatessens.
Loch Fyne Oysters, a business founded in 1978 by Mr Johnny Noble and Mr
Andrew Lane to assist the former's Highland estate, now claims to be the
market leader for smoked salmon in the British colony.
The export initiative began about eight years ago with a British Overseas
Trade Board-sponsored mission.
'We met Mr Andrew Smith, the Scot who manages the Hong Kong Hilton, and he
pointed us to the big distributors,' says Mr Lane. 'That man should get a
knighthood for what he does for Scottish companies.'
Loch Fyne Oysters rears oysters and other shellfish in the clear waters of
the eponymous loch.
But it is primarily a smoking business, smoking farmed salmon, eels, kippers
and trout which it buys from local producers.
The business will have turnover of almost Pounds 4m this year and intends to
expand by 25 per cent a year over the next four years.
'Rearing shellfish is a credibility thing,' says Mr Lane, managing director.
'If you produce oysters people realise your fish are fresh. We are perceived
as handling the fresh end of seafoods.'
Another crucial ingredient is being located in the Scottish Highlands, he
says. 'Many UK smokers hint at a Highland or a Scottish location in their
names even if they are based somewhere else. We are genuine.'
Loch Fyne Oysters employs 42 full-time staff at Cairndow, Argyllshire, and
also runs three oyster bars and seafood restaurants in England.
About 40 per cent of the company's turnover is exported, with the Far East
its main market.
Mr Lane said: 'We are flirting with Taiwan at the moment.' But Loch Fyne
also sells in Italy, Germany, France and Luxembourg.

Anderson Group / James Buxton examines five companies which are leading
Scotland's export drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anderson Group, the mining equipment manufacturer, has shrugged off the
severe blow to its business caused by the rundown of the British coal
industry by making a greater success of the export markets which have always
featured strongly in its operations.
The company, a subsidiary of Charter, formerly Charter Consolidated, claims
to have about 50 per cent of the world mining equipment market which is open
to western competitors.
Last year it won a large order for equipment from China and Mr Alasdair
MacLauchlan, chief executive, says Anderson is 'by far the market leader in
China'. Anderson's exports have doubled in the past two years.
The company, based at Motherwell near Glasgow used to be called Anderson
Strathclyde and in 1982 employed 4,400 people worldwide, of which about
3,000 were in the UK. Successive restructurings to improve efficiency and
match the rundown in the British coal mining industry have taken the payroll
down to 900, of whom 600 are in the UK, 90 per cent of them at the only
surviving manufacturing facility at Motherwell.
Turnover last year was about Pounds 65m, of which Pounds 42m came from the
UK, with 60 per cent coming from exports. Anderson's overseas subsidiaries
account for the remaining Pounds 23m of sales, mainly from maintenance and
overhaul contracts. The company contributes to Charter's mining equipment
division which in 1992/93 made operating profits of Pounds 3.8m on sales of
Pounds 118m.
Anderson's traditional markets are in Australia, China, France, India,
Poland, South Africa and the US. It has established new markets in central
and south America, western and south-east Asia, eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union.
The company has subsidiaries in Australia, South Africa and the US which are
responsible for their own after-sales service and marketing.
'We are making relatively high-tech equipment which is going into a very
aggressive environment,' says Mr MacLauchlan. 'The technology has changed in
the past 10 years. The equipment is more reliable, more hard working and
more powerful. The ability to steer and control it has improved and we use
gamma radiation to locate the coal seam.'' The improvements in the equipment
reflect what the industry wants,' he says.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Spirited performances - James
Buxton examines five companies which are leading Scotland's export drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The two biggest companies in the Scotch whisky industry, United Distillers
and Allied Distillers, have won awards for export achievement.
United Distillers is the whisky and gin subsidiary of Guinness and is the
giant of the whisky industry, accounting for 38 per cent of the industry's
exports in 1992. It was born in 1986 from the takeover of Distillers by
Guinness, which had earlier absorbed Bell's.
Allied Distillers is part of the Hiram Walker group, the wines and spirits
arm of Allied-Lyons. It began operating in its present form in 1988. Its
export sales in 1992 accounted for 7.8 per cent of the industry's total
exports.
As any expert on the whisky industry will tell you, it is the malt whisky
distilleries which have the cachet and the romance, but the grain
distilleries which produce the large volumes: the vast majority of whisky is
a blend of grain whisky with dashes of a number of malts.
Allied has 14 malt distilleries, 12 of them in the Highlands and two on the
island of Isla; it also has two grain distilleries, the Strathclyde and
Dumbarton distilleries. The company has annual turnover of more than Pounds
320m. In the past three years Allied's exports increased by Pounds 50m to
Pounds 270m, a rise of 18 per cent, constituting its claim to the award.
'Our most successful brands are Ballantine's, Teacher's Highland Cream, Long
John and our Isla single malt Laphroaig,' says Mr Paul Hick, Allied's
marketing director.
Ballantine's Finest is the leading brand in western Europe, particularly in
Spain where sales have increased by an average of 20 per cent a year and
where the brand now claims a quarter of the whisky market. According to
Allied, Ballantine's Finest is the third largest brand worldwide with export
sales of nearly 5m cases a year. Teacher's, a well known brand in the UK, is
also a leading brand in Commonwealth countries, especially Australia and
Canada. It is also expanding in Germany where it is the third best selling
brand (with Ballantine's the leading brand).
Whatever people thought of the Guinness takeover of Distillers few doubt
that it was a positive development for the industry. Guinness shook up the
individual companies that comprised Distillers, rationalised distilling,
bottling and distribution, and centralised marketing and export operations.
Mr Alan Gray, the noted whisky analyst who is now with the Edinburgh
stockbrokers Sutherland and Partners, pointed out in his 1993 Scotch whisky
review that United Distillers controls more than 25 per cent of Scotland's
malt whisky distilling capacity, 31 per cent of its grain distilling
capacity and had 38 per cent of the export market for blended Scotch whisky.
United Distillers plays a big role in Scottish life through its chairman
Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden (who chaired Guinness itself after Ernest
Saunders was ousted in 1986). It has 27 malt distilleries and two grain
distilleries, Cameron Bridge in Fife and Port Dundas in Glasgow.
United Distillers won the Queen's export award for its export performance
over the past six years, during which its sales outside the UK grew by 10
per cent a year. Over that period United Distillers sold Pounds 4bn worth of
whisky and gin.
United Distillers produces Johnnie Walker, the world's leading whisky brand
which alone sold more than 12m cases in 1993, accounting for one in every
five bottles of whisky exported from Scotland. The company's other popular
whisky brands include Bell's, Dewar's and White Horse. It also makes
Gordon's and Tanqueray gin, with Gordon's alone representing around 50 per
cent of all gin exports.
Broken down by country, the Guinness subsidiary has seen big increases over
the past six years in its sales to countries such as Spain (17 per cent),
Germany (20 per cent) and Turkey (25 per cent), with particularly fast
growth coming from the small Paraguay market (30 per cent).
In Italy, United Distillers' brands saw their sales grow by eight per a year
and in Japan, where whisky producers are still fighting discriminatory
tariffs, by 6 per cent.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Freezers of the frozen north -
Norfrost / James Buxton examines five companies which are leading Scotland's
export drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norfrost is unusual not only for succeeding in an industry in which the UK
is not a substantial player, but for doing so from one of the most remote
locations in Britain - Caithness.
It makes chest freezers and coolers, which are used predominantly in shops
and businesses, as well as in private homes.
Last year its turnover was Pounds 24m, of which two-thirds was exported.
Seven years ago exports accounted for only eight per cent of much lower
sales.
Norfrost, a private company, says it exports to 80 countries, but entered 24
of them for the first time last year.
Norfrost is the creation of Mrs Pat Grant and her husband Alex who
established it in 1972. She supplies the entrepreneurial drive and he the
technical expertise which enables Norfrost to produce successful designs at
economic prices.
The company, which employs about 300 people, concentrates on only one basic
product which is assembled on a large production line.
Its freezers and coolers are basically the same: the only difference between
them is in the type of thermostatic controller.
Norfrost has major customers on its books. It supplies Coca-Cola with
coolers which the drinks company provides to retailers. It also sells to
manufacturers such as Zanussi and Hitachi which sell the machines under
their own labels.
Its largest markets are the US and France, as well as Germany, Italy, Japan,
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and eastern Europe.
After completing a three year Pounds 8m factory extension last year, Mrs
Grant announced further expansion plans which would create a minimum of 120
new jobs within the next two-and-a-half years. She hopes to employ 1,000
people by the end of the decade.
Mrs Grant's achievements have already been honoured by the Businesswoman of
the Year award 1988 and the Women Mean Business Award.
Part of Norfrost's achievement is in brushing off the disadvantages of its
remote location.
It does this through vertical integration: it makes its own production
tools, carries out its own maintenance and has its injection moulding
company.
To ensure that its trucks return fully laden, it provides a haulage service
for other businesses in Caithness.

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Lessons for foreign students - Lisa
Wood looks at five UK colleges and universities which are exporting their
knowledge around the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Individuals from such far-flung corners as Alaska and China are among those
currently matriculated as part-time post graduate students of Heriot-Watt
University in Edinburgh, one of five colleges and universities to have
received the Queen's Award for Exports.
It is the first time that the Esmee Fairbairn Research Centre at the
University of Heriot-Watt has received the award. Similarly, it's a first
award for the Queen Mary and Westfield College at the University of London,
the University of Buckingham and Unived Technologies, the commercial arm of
the University of Edinburgh.
However, it is a second award for the Imperial College of Science,
Technology and Medicine in London which has been involved in educating
overseas students since its founding in 1907.
For all five institutions growth in overseas earnings - from both fees from
foreign students and contracts for research - have been the result of
strategic planning and considerable marketing effort.
The Esmee Fairbairn Research Centre has been operating since the mid-1970s.
In October 1990 its function changed and it became a commercial venture
under the aegis of Heriot-Watt University.
The centre, which gains most of its earnings from overseas, produces and
distributes Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree programmes, texts
and software. It also arranges for the sitting of examinations in 184
centres throughout the world. Since its introduction the MBA distance
learning programme has attracted 8,000 students from 110 countries.
Professor Keith Lumsden, director of the centre, said the training packages
were entirely self-contained, requiring no live tuition. 'It is one of the
biggest business schools in the world,' he says.
At present all the tuition is in English, with papers marked in Scotland.
The centre is considering offering the MBA in Chinese and Spanish. But,
Professor Lumsden said courses in a foreign language afforded problems.
Even if a sister body could be recruited abroad to mark the papers a
significant number of scripts would have to be translated and re-marked by
outside examiners in order to ensure consistency in standards.
Unived Technologies is a similar commercial venture at the University of
Edinburgh. Set up in 1984, it is the commercial arm of the university and
markets research and development, consultancy and training services.
Viewed by subject, information technology is the most successful research
area but Unived has also won contracts in faculties of science and
engineering, medicine, veterinary medicine, arts, social sciences and law.
The company's export earnings have increased 2 1/2 times over the past three
years.
The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine in London, by
contrast, has been earning a significant part of its income from overseas
fees for many years and holds the 1990 Export Award.
Dr Tim Seller said the college recruited about 20 per cent of its students
from abroad, particularly from the Far East, the Americas and Europe. At
present they make up some 1,480 of the college's intake of 5,308.
'We recruit up to the government's imposed limits upon students in the UK,'
he said. 'But, ever since we were founded in 1907, a basic part of our
mission has been to be involved in overseas education.'
Imperial had made substantial increases in its numbers of foreign students,
said Dr Seller, with active marketing to young people who would be making
their selection from the world's most prestigious institutions in sciences
and engineering in particular.
An equally strong marketing effort overseas is being made by Queen Mary and
Westfield College, the fourth largest constituent college of the University
of London. Some 24 per cent of its students come from more than 100 overseas
countries.
The college said: 'There has been a steady increase in the college's fee
income from overseas students during the past six years, despite the
competitive market.'
The college currently attracts nearly Pounds 7.5m a year from abroad for
courses, educational services and research.
The college attributed its success in recruiting overseas students to
several factors. They included offering degree courses in specialist areas
such as commercial law; offering a modular programme of study; a dedicated
international office to promote courses; and the provision of a range of
support services including an English language and study skills unit and
guaranteed housing for international students.
At the University of Buckingham, a wide range of programmes and a two-year
honours degree are among the attractions to overseas students.
The university, which was founded in 1976, is the only independent one in
the UK and does not receive direct government funding.
It has pioneered two-year honours courses, offering it says 'mature students
the opportunity of entering the job market a year earlier and school leavers
the opportunity of a year out between school and university while graduating
on time.'
Sir Richard Luce, the university's vice-chancellor, said the award was a
tribute to his staff who had devoted themselves to the university. 'We have
reached nearly 1,000 students of whom 60 per cent are from overseas, with
over 80 nationalities being represented,' he said.
'We believe that, with our two - year degree, we do have something very
special to offer overseas students.
'British students benefit from this multicultural atmosphere and the alumni
have an extensive global network. We are very proud of this award.'

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: The picture of success - Tony Stone
Images sells photographs around the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A picture may be worth a thousand words, but sometimes it can be worth
thousands of pounds.
Tony Stone Images, a photographic stock library, sold one image - which
pictured the silhouettes of a group of business men walking across a map of
the globe - 300 times in 1992 for a total of Pounds 30,000.
Tony Stone, which supplies photographs to the advertising, design,
publishing, travel and printing industries, has built its business on
multiple sales of a core collection of 20,000 images, a fairly small number
for an international photo-library.
'We determined that the best thing to do was to understand what subjects our
clients wanted and find the very best possible examples of those images,'
said Mr Simon Thornley, group managing director.
With 75 per cent of its revenue earned outside the UK, Tony Stone is one of
the few non-manufacturing, creative services companies to win a Queen's
award for export this year.
The company is among the top five photolibraries in the world, and the
largest in the UK. Tony Stone's 1993 turnover was Pounds 18.5m and the
company expects to bring in more than Pounds 20m in 1994. Its growth from an
annual turnover of Pounds 3.6m in 1988 is primarily due to international
revenue.
When photographer Tony Stone founded the company in 1969, he peddled
pictures around Europe, where the market was primarily for photos on
'chocolate boxes and greeting cards'. He began thinking about expanding the
company's international market about 10 years ago.
In 1984, Tony Stone acquired a small Paris-based photography agency. Since
then, acquisition has been the company's international strategy.
This strategy really took off in 1987 when Mr Stone sold 20 per cent of the
business to 3i, the venture capital enterprise. In 1988 Tony Stone used the
money from 3i's investment to buy a Chicago-based photo agency which serves
the publishing industry in the mid-west of the US. 3i has since made four
more investments in Tony Stone.
From Chicago, Tony Stone built up its North American business which is now
the company's most competitive single market. It has a turnover of Dollars
10.6m (Pounds 7.1m)
The company now has wholly-owned offices in London, Paris, Munich, Los
Angeles, Chicago, New York, Seattle and Toronto, and agencies that represent
it in 15 other countries.
Five hundred photographers actively take pictures for the company, while
another 500 are on the books. Tony Stone recruits photographers who are
willing to take the photographs that the company's clients demand, and the
photographer earns 50 per cent of the profit of the sale of an image.
Clients actually buy specific reproduction rights of the pictures they
select, and must use them only for the purpose designated.
Looking to the future, Tony Stone plans to invest in digital technology to
enhance its products and its distribution to clients.
With such technology, along with a software programme designed especially
for Tony Stone, the company hopes to expand its products to include other
intellectual property, such as film, illustrations and music.
On the expansion front, the company is also looking eastward. 'We are not as
strong as we would like to be in Asia,' said Mr Stone. 'We are now committed
to an Asian strategy whereby we become a major presence from Korea to
Japan.'

FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Hopes rise, but no room for
complacency - Although exporters are more optimistic about future prospects,
writes Andrew Baxter, the widening trade deficit in the first three months
of this year is a worrying trend

<TEXT>
After three years of recession that has touched most sectors of industry and
commerce, today 165 British companies, at least, have something to crow
about.
The companies are the winners of the 1994 Queen's Awards for export,
technological and environmental achievement and the latest awards take to
3,506 the number of winners since the scheme was inaugurated in 1966.
The export achievements come against a background of rising optimism about
prospects in export markets such as North America, which has been out of
recession for the past year, and long-term growth opportunities in Asia -
which many of the winners have been exploiting successfully.
This is offset by continuing depressed conditions in continental Europe,
which for many companies is the biggest export market.
The awards for technology and environmental achievement, meanwhile,
underline the continuing relevance of maintaining investment in research and
development - whatever the current market conditions - to ensure that
British companies have the products to exploit the opportunities in the
global marketplace.
This year's awards come as the importance of manufacturing's contribution to
national wealth seems to be better understood in government than it was,
say, five years ago.
Exporters, too, are generally much more positive about the help received
from the government than they were two or three years ago.
The most recent trade figures, showing a sharp fall in the January visible
deficit from Pounds 1.57bn in December to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 916m,
was immediately welcomed by Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, as 'a very
encouraging start to the year'.
But there is little room for complacency with a visible trade deficit of
Pounds 13.4bn both last year and in 1992.
In the three months to January, total exports fell 3 per cent compared with
the previous three months, the trade gap widened and analysts said the trend
was still worrying. Significantly, perhaps, 20 per cent of the export awards
were given to companies in the 'invisibles' sector.
The state of export markets for manufacturers, meanwhile, was highlighted
this week in a report from the Engineering Employers' Federation, which
covers industries from computers to machine tools and motor vehicles.
This showed that the devaluation of the pound in autumn 1992 has boosted UK
manufacturers' competitiveness and market share, albeit unevenly against
different national competitors, but underlined the sharp differences in
outlook in different export markets.
While the US economy is growing strongly, the Japanese economy is still
weak, while continental Europe, which accounts for 60 per cent of UK trade
in engineering products, is forecast to make only a slow recovery this year.
From the point of view of the trade deficit, this makes it all the more
important that UK companies can continue to succeed on the continent.
With the UK out of recession but its principal market still in it, a surge
in consumer spending at home could further increase the deficit.
The EEF believes engineering exports will rise by about 6 per cent in the 18
months from the second half of 1993 to the first half of 1995 as European
markets begin to recover, and says automotive and electronic products will
do particularly well. But imports are forecast to rise by 10 per cent.
The difficulties in European export markets would appear, at first glance,
to explain why the total number of applications for awards dropped this year
from 1,822 in 1993 to 1,682.
Companies, after all, do have to demonstrate a 'substantial and sustained
increase in export earnings to a level which is outstanding for the products
and services concerned, and for the size of the applicant unit's
operations'.
In fact, the drop can be explained mainly by a sharp fall-off in the number
of applicants for environmental awards, perhaps inevitable given that 1993
was the first year and only 12 out of 240 applicants struck gold. This year,
just eight out of 133 applicants proved successful.
In contrast applications in the export category actually rose from 1,230 in
1993 to 1,246, while technology applications slipped from 352 to 303.
Recession in Europe may have offset the competitive edge offered to UK
exporters by the weaker pound, but it is not the only difficulty they face.
It has emerged in the past few days, for instance, that the government has
been tightening export regulations, possibly pre-empting some of the
recommendations of the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
In a move that particularly affects machine tools builders, the Department
of Trade and Industry has briefed companies in recent weeks on the new
regulations, which mainly involve applications for licences on potentially
defence-related dual use goods.
A further challenge, linked partly to the latest and previous UK recession,
is the question of how to react to permanent decline in the domestic markets
that often provide a base for export success.
The strength and reliability of the home market has, after all, been the
cornerstone of much of Japanese industry's export achievement - coupled, of
course, with its relative impenetrability for would-be importers.
Two examples linked to the coal industry show the importance of responding
promptly when the home market for a product is undergoing fundamental
change, or simply disappearing.
Among the technology award winners, Leicestershire-based Dunn Systems faced
the need to adapt and innovate because of the decline of its business
selling conveyor systems to the coal industry. Badly mauled by the 1984/85
miners' strike, it has hit back with the high-speed Wagtail pack orientation
system for the food and drink industries.
From the export award winners, Motherwell-based Anderson Group, which
produces mining equipment, has more than doubled exports in the past two
years, reflecting its success in replacing a declining home market with new
business overseas. The traditional base of export markets has also been
augmented by success in new countries.
A further challenge in export markets is to rise above controversy. Export
award winner McKey Food Service, based in Milton Keynes, supplies frozen
beef hamburgers to McDonald's. In spite of adverse publicity for British
beef because of BSE disease, the company doubled its exports between 1989
and 1992.
The export awards represent a wide range of industrial sectors, though four
have done particularly well: pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, electrical
and transport. The technology awards represented 10 industrial sectors,
while the environment awards represented seven.
Although the awards are for UK companies, 19 per cent of the winners had
foreign associations of some kind. about the same as last year.
The breakdown was as follows: 20 per cent of the export award winners had
foreign associations, 17 per cent of the technology winners and 12 per cent
of the environment winners.
Overall, the awards show the continuing vitality of smaller companies.
Companies with fewer than 50 employees scooped up 24 per cent of all awards,
although their performance varied considerably in the three sectors.
In the export section they won 26 per cent of the awards, compared with 6
per cent in technology and 20 per cent in the environmental section.
The largest winning company is Swiss-owned Nestle UK with 20,000 employees
and the smallest winners are Mondbury, a London-based maker of dresses and
skirts for the 'mature woman', and Tritech International, Aberdeen-based
producer of subsea electronics and robotics, with six employees each.

FT  21 APR 94 / Political Notebook: Strategy of survival for Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Westminster there is the uneasy calm of a phoney peace. In Downing Street
the atmosphere is strained. Mr John Major has six weeks to put in place a
strategy for survival.
Nobody at Westminster is quite sure what to expect from the local elections
on May 5 and the European elections on June 9. That the Tories will do badly
is taken for granted. The scale of defeat is harder to gauge.
But the anecdotal evidence is deeply depressing for the prime minister. Tory
MPs returning from the campaign trail say the party faithful are still
seething with resentment. Once-loyal activists are in no mood to be told
that better times are around the corner.
Local loyalties might blunt the disenchantment in the council elections. But
there seems a real prospect of a collapse in the Tory vote in the European
poll and the Eastleigh by-election. The possibility can no longer be
discounted that the party will be placed third in a national election for
the first time in living memory. The immediate aftermath of the European
poll will be the most dangerous moment of Mr Major's premiership. A formal
leadership challenge must wait until November. But the risk is of an
irresistible tide sweeping him from office during the summer.
Mr Major insists that nothing will shift him. But remember Margaret
Thatcher's words just a day before she was driven from Downing Street: 'We
fight on. We fight to win.'
So the focus of Mr Major's strategy for survival is to hold on in Downing
Street from June 9 until the summer recess in mid-July. A challenge in
November will have to be tackled if and when. There is a chance that by the
autumn economic recovery will have refloated his government.
To have a decent chance of surviving until then Mr Major has to do two
potentially contradictory things. He must maintain the visible loyalty of
his cabinet - it was the desertion of her colleagues which finished Mrs
Thatcher. But he must also shake up the government - and his own team of
personal political advisers - in a way which begins to rebuild his shattered
authority.
On paper Mr Major should have little trouble securing cabinet backing. Save
for the two leading contenders for the succession - Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr
Michael Heseltine - most see a vested interest in sticking with the present
leader.
That might change swiftly if the election results trigger a collective
nervous breakdown on the back benches. Supporters of Mr Clarke and Mr
Heseltine are not alone in planning for other contingencies. Mr Michael
Portillo's friends have been testing his support on the back benches.
Mr Major has rejected advice to bring forward the cabinet reshuffle to
before June 9. Aides insist he will not be panicked and are talking in terms
of July. But it could come within a week or so of the European election if
the poll results are as bad as some fear.
Mr Major must make extensive - although not draconian - changes. He must
give the cabinet a sharper political edge, replacing administrators with
street-fighters.
Among the names already at the top of Downing Street promotion lists are Mr
Stephen Dorrell at the Treasury, Dr Brian Mawhinney at health, Mr Jonathan
Aitken at defence and Mr David Davis at public services.
In a government underburdened with talent all have a decent claim to seats
at the top table. Their elevation - and the sacking of a number of
middle-ranking timeservers - would make way for a wave of promotions from
the restless back benches.
The relative youth of the new team could be balanced by the return of one or
two heavyweights from the 1980s. The idea is a long shot, but Lord Howe
might calm a fractious House of Lords. If Mr Heseltine cannot be persuaded
to take the party chairmanship, Lord Walker might be the next best choice.
Mr Major has also been told in the strongest possible terms that he must
replace Mr Graham Bright, his lacklustre parliamentary private secretary,
with an adviser of stature and reputation in the Commons.
The common denominator linking those on the list of possible cabinet
departures is that they would be either unwilling or unable to damage Mr
Major from the back benches. Mr John MacGregor, Mr Peter Brooke, Mr John
Patten and Mr John Gummer would not become plotters.
Overall, the ideas now being floated have the makings of a credible if
less-than-fireproof strategy. But Mr Major, who sometimes appears at once
stubborn and indecisive, must strike the right balance between unaccustomed
boldness and more familiar panic.
