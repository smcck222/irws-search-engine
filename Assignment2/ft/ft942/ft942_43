FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (15): Farmers bring home the bacon -
Agriculture / At first glance, Estonia's agricultural statistics seem to
tell a story of disaster. Yet the sector is recovering steadily from the
shock of Soviet collapse, and it is already contributing substantially to
the republic's economic turnround

Estonia's hardy, practical folk have always been first-rate farmers. In the
1930s, the country foreshadowed the post-war success of Denmark as an
agricultural exporter; its seed potatoes were admired all over Europe, and
its bacon and eggs were sold in every city from London to Leningrad.
Under the Communist system, too, Estonia was an important supplier of meat
and dairy products to Russia. Its agronomists prided themselves on keeping
in touch, through their contacts in Scandinavia, with all the developments
in agricultural technology; and it is still hard to convince them that they
have something to learn from western Europe about growing potatoes.
Collective farms in the smallest Soviet republic carved out a formidable
reputation as purveyors of farming skills to the rest of the Union. Compared
with other Soviet regions where nature had been much kinder, the Estonians'
use of fertiliser was far more efficient and their veterinary knowledge
outstanding.
The Danish-built slaughter-house at Rakvere, capable of handling 800 cows a
day, meets the highest international standards, as does the dairy products
factory at Viru.
All this should have left Estonia better equipped to face the brave new
capitalist world than most parts of the former communist empire. But the
economic disintegration of the Union - and the breakdown of virtually all
agricultural trade with Russia - was, at least in the short term, a body
blow.
It was not so much the loss of revenue from Russia, which was modest enough,
as the instant creation of a huge mountain of surplus farm produce which
depressed prices on the internal market. The livestock industry,
traditionally dependent on Russian fodder, was only saved from collapse by
free deliveries of western feed-grain.
From Estonia's point of view, the ideal solution to the crisis would be a
steady increase in agricultural sales to the West. Farm goods already
account for more than 20 per cent of total exports, more than any other
single sector, and quality control and packaging are more and more closely
aligned with western requirements.
But Scandinavia and western Europe are, of course, brimming with their own,
heavily subsidised farm output. Indeed, Finland effectively dumps on Estonia
a significant slice of its domestic farm surplus, which is duly bought in
the shops of Tallinn by bargain-hunting tourists from Helsinki.
So Estonian farmers will have need to be even more canny than usual if they
are to secure a firm niche in the west. Output of some of Estonia's key
products has plunged since independence. Milk production is projected at
600,000 tonnes this year, down from 1m in 1991, and the grain harvest is
forecast at no more than 550,000 tonnes, down from 940,000 three years ago.
Last year, farm gate prices in both those sectors were barely half the
international level. Only now is the market tightening to the point where
makers of high-quality cheese are finding it difficult to obtain milk of the
right grade.
Western experts see specialist meat and dairy products - blood sausage,
gourmet cheeses, milk powder - as providing Estonia's best hope of gaining a
long-term foothold in overseas markets. The export of live animals to the
Middle East, notably sheep to Syria, is another lucrative business.
'About one-third of our farmers have already adapted their thinking to the
market-place,' says Mr Ants Laansalu, a senior official at the agriculture
ministry. 'Some of the remainder still believe in production for its own
sake. But they will gradually adapt.'
Yet two question marks hang over the future of Estonian farming. One is the
structure of ownership: how fully and how soon Estonia will switch from the
agricultural collectives of the communist system to reliance on the family
farms which seems to be in the blood of every Estonian?
There is a universal consensus on the desirability of reverting to private
farming, and of restoring as far as possible the title deeds of pre-war
farmers and their descendants. The legal procedures by which former owners
can reclaim their land do exist, although they are in need of refinement.
And yet the privatisation process has been curiously slow.
In Soviet times, Estonia had about 350 large farms, either state-owned or
collective. After two and a half years of independence, the proportion of
land farmed privately is still only 14 per cent, while the 'socialist
sector' has undergone a very limited break-up into about 1,000 co-operatives
and public companies.
No one denies the difficulties in the way of privatisation. Many pre-war
family farms have been gobbled up by expansion in forestry, and some have
been divided between collective institutions. Most pre-war farming families
will no longer want to work the land themselves; and the interests of
current users must also be secured.
The average pre-war small-holding, at 25 hectares, would not be economic in
today's conditions. Many of them consist of narrow strips - measuring, say,
30 metres by 1,000 - which were sliced out of German baronial estates in the
1920s. By now, the strips have been merged into huge fields, and it would
make little economic sense to divide them up again.
And yet the consensus among experts is that, given the political will, all
these difficulties can be overcome. Since the the pre-war land registries
are intact, it should be possible to identify pre-war farming families and
invite them to choose between selling or renting to the state or current
users. There is a mystery as to why this has not happened.
The other question mark concerns sales to Russia, which are of course linked
to the wider issue of relations with the eastern neighbour.
The absence of an inter-governmental trade agreement with Russia rules out
any revival of the old state-to-state arrangements; but with capitalism
flourishing in both countries, it ought to be possible to revive the old
trade on a strictly private sector basis.
There are two questions in the minds of Estonian officialdom: is the Russian
government willing to give Estonia the economic shot in the arm which
reviving the farm trade would mean? And if not, can it actually stop Russian
businessmen from importing Estonian produce if they want to?
Estonian eggs have returned to the St Petersburg market, and Russian tariff
barriers on Estonian fish have failed to disrupt that trade. But many
Estonians fear that if the cross-border trade in meat and dairy products
shows signs of reviving, Russia will immediately erect more tariff barriers,
for reasons that are as much political as economic.
As in every other sector of Estonian life, the influence of the Russian
factor is an enigmatic one. And indeed, there are some suspicious minds who
attribute the slowness of the privatisation process to the hidden hand of
Moscow. And it is undoubtedly true that re-establishing Estonia's yeomanry
on its ancestral lands would make the territory that bit harder to occupy.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (14): An acutely sensitive hot spot - In
the Russian-speaking border town of Narva, where Slav and Nordic worlds
meet, old resentments are never far below the surface
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travel to Narva from the west, and you will be struck by the grim monotony
of the apartment buildings, by the paucity of decent shops cafes or anything
else to relieve the dullness of the scene. But the sensations are quite
different when you cross the Narove River and enter the town from Russia
under the awesome shadow of a white medieval tower which for centuries was
the outmost bastion of Nordic power.
Compared with the adjacent bits of Russia, the pavements look cleaner, the
roads better maintained; and the visitor is grateful for a restaurant that
can serve up a tasty enough version of steak, egg and chips, and would not
disgrace a depressed Belgian mining town.
Narva has often been a nodal point between the Slav and Nordic worlds. In
1700, Peter the Great suffered a humiliating blow when the army he sent to
the town was routed - it was this defeat which spurred him to wrest the
whole Baltic region from the Swedes.
Today, the town is once again an acutely sensitive spot, for there is
nowhere else in independent Estonia which has such a high concentration of
ethnic Russians. Barely 3,000 of the 82,500 townspeople are of Estonian
origin. And if relations between the Estonian authorities and the
Russian-speaking community should ever break down irretrievably, this is
where the break will come.
Just over the river - and the border - lies the Russian fortress town of
Ivangorod, which in Soviet times formed a single conurbation with Narva.
Because it views itself as legal successor to all the territory of the
pre-war republic, Estonia formerly asserts sovereignty over Ivangorod. And
there are hotheads in Russia who also want to re-unite the towns - by taking
Narva back. So Narva is the place where Estonia's biggest internal problem
can be seen in sharpest relief.
Since language skills have been made a criterion of Estonian citizenship,
more than 400,000 of the republic's inhabitants have failed to quality for
passports. Essentially, these people are Soviet-era immigrants brought to
the Republic by the Communist regime as soldiers or workers in new
industries.
They are the reason why the ethnic Estonians share of the republic's
population has fallen from 88 per cent in 1940 to just over 60 per cent
today. And 'immigrants' and their families form the overwhelming majority of
the population of Narva, where only 12 per cent of residents have qualified
for Estonian passports.
Although Estonia has convinced several pan-European bodies that its laws do
not violate human rights, the de facto situation is a peculiar and
potentially dangerous one.
About one Estonian resident in three can complain that he is subject to
'taxation without representation.' The non-citizens are agents in the
Estonian economy - as tax payers or social benefit collectors - and subject
to Estonian law, but they have no input into Estonian policy.
For many members of the minority, discontent over their legal status is
assuaged by relative material well-being. A Russian factory worker in
Tallinn is still better off than his counterpart in St. Petersburg - but
that factor hardly applies in Narva. One in three residents is a pensioner,
relying on an income that is barely above the poverty line. And Narva's
factories, once show pieces of Soviet industry, are in difficulty.
The sensitive Baltiits, which makes equipment for handling uranium, has work
for barely 1,000 of its 5,000 employees. Its best hope probably lies in
marketing high technology medical apparatus.
Less than half the 12,500 workers at Kreenholm, a giant textile factory, are
gainfully employed. It has become virtually impossible to procure the basic
raw material, cotton from central Asia, for the simple reason that it gets
stolen on the way through Russia.
After dipping into insolvency, Narova, a furniture factory, is struggling
back on to its feet, thanks to partners in Israel and new customers in Hong
Kong. But its chairman, Mr. Valery Myachin, says it has been an uphill
struggle to wean his 1,500 employees off the Soviet habit of production for
production's sake.
Political tension came to a head last summer when the Estonian parliament
passed a law requiring all inhabitants to apply for citizenship or residents
permits, a move that appear to mean expulsion for those who failed to
qualify for either.
In a stinging rebuke, President Yeltsin accused the Tallinn authorities of
practising 'ethnic cleansing' and apartheid. He warned that they would bear
the 'entire responsibility' for any breach of public order.
His adviser, Mr. Sergei Stankevich, went even further: he warned that the
Russian minority would reserve the option of 'self determination' if its
rights were trampled upon.
Translated out of Soviet language, these threats were clear enough unless
Estonia was a little kinder to its Russians, Moscow might sponsor a local
'independence' movement within Estonian territory which could tear the
Republic apart - that is exactly what Moscow has done in Georgia and
Moldova, with tragic results. In both those cases, Moscow made the
calculation - correctly - that the Republic authorities would over-react to
the situation.
So the challenge for the Estonian government is how to avoid falling into
the same trap. Events appeared to be moving in an ominously familiar
direction last year when pro-Russian politicians defied Tallinn and staged a
referendum on 'autonomy' for the town. And organisers claimed that over half
the adult population passed ballots; the Estonian authorities - who urged
residents not to vote but did not physically prevent them - dismissed this
figure as an exaggeration.
Tension in Narva has eased since it became clear that most ethnic Russians
in Estonia will, in practice, receive residents permits for another five
years. Another stabilising factor was the outcome of last October's fighting
in Moscow, and the defeat of the 'parliamentary' forces which had always
been keen sponsors of the most militant factions in Narva.
But resentment is never far below the surface. Estonian law allows resident
aliens to vote in local elections, but not national ones. And even in local
ballots, only citizens may stand for office.
So Narva's old town council, elected under Soviet procedures, has recently
been replaced by a new municipal authority in which the key figures are
Estonian or at least pro-Estonian. The new authority maintains that its
predecessors and their friends in local industry, deliberately turned away
foreign investment proposals because economic discontent suited their
political book.
'The old leadership wanted social tension, so they could call meetings in
the central square and whip up false rumours,' says Mr. Ants Liinets, the
Municipal Secretary. 'It was easier for them to do that when the local
economy was in serious difficulty.'
The challenge for the new administration is to boost local living standards
to the point when the populace no longer provides tinder-dry material for
Russian nationalist firebrands - from the town or further afield.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (17): A nation of talented innovators -
Bruce Clark highlights Estonia's inventive tradition and creative flair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Estonians make good inventors. The small Estonian community in Sweden has
produced several talented innovators and Estonia's Johannes Hint - whose
efforts were rewarded with a criminal case and a grisly death in prison -
had one of the most original scientific minds in the former Soviet Union.
Mr Toom Pungas is another standard-bearer of Estonia's inventing tradition.
A florid, genial figure whose looks reflect the Estonian farming stock from
which he springs, Mr Pungas rose to considerable prominence in the Soviet
scientific world.
In the 1980s, Moscow put him in charge of a sensitive government project
seeking to reduce - from a staggering seven years - the average time lag
between scientific discoveries and their application in Soviet industry. He
was successful enough to make some bitter enemies, notably bureaucrats in
Moscow industrial ministries with a vested interest in maintaining the time
lag.
He has now returned to his native Estonia where he heads the local
Inventors' Union and campaigns vigorously for the adoption of tough patent
laws.
While his work in Moscow involved pioneering technology in fields such as
lasers and compact discs, Mr Pungas is engaged in the more homely task of
restoring the 60-hectare family farm where he grew up.
He believes he has found a way to bring his ancestral acres - ruined by
noxious waste from the shale-oil industry - back to life, and solve a number
of ecological problems.
In a discovery for which he recently filed a US patent application, Mr
Pungas has made an environmentally friendly fertiliser out of oil-shale
waste, mixed with pigs slurry - another pollutant that is turning the Baltic
into a dead sea - plus an activator produced by Medina, an American
biotechnology company.
The oil-shale tips, Mr Pungas points out, are a hazard which will need to be
neutralised, anyway. His proposal is to create soil-enriching virtue out of
a pollution-fighting necessity. The alkalinity of the oil-shale waste -
micro-organisms cannot survive in it - is counterbalanced by the acidic pig
slurry so the redolent mixture becomes an agency for restoring micro-organic
life, as well as minerals, to the soil.
The inventor reckons his fertiliser soil could be used by Middle Eastern
states battling desertification and for reforestation in Scandinavia on soil
damaged by chemical fertiliser and acid rain. After 'extremely positive'
indications from tests on potatoes and tomatoes, he plans to go into
production on a small scale - about 30,000 cubic metres - this year and
hopes to capture a large chunk of Estonia's 3m ton per year market in
fertiliser soil.
But Mr Pungas is not counting any chickens, or fertiliser pellets, yet.
Already, he says, he sees signs of 'negative reaction' to his project:
samples disappearing, faxes going astray, production licences failing to
materialise.
He says he cannot tell whether this reflects the activity of commercial
rivals, or of governments who fear the economic strength that pioneering a
successful fertiliser project would give Estonia.
But if Estonia's inventors are permitted, mixing shale waste and slurry will
be the first of many ideas and the country's ability to convert these ideas
into profitable production will be a test of its viability as a small but
efficient outpost of capitalism.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (11): Ambitious renewal plans - Ice-free
ports and new ships / Important developments are under way at deep-water
ports of Tallinn, Muuga and Paldiski
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shortly after Peter the Great wrested control over the eastern Baltic from
the Swedes at the start of the 18th century, the Russian Czar singled out
three key sites for future port development - Paldiski and Tallinn in
Estonia, and St Petersburg itself.
For 50 years, Paldiski was a Soviet navy training base and, eventually, a
nuclear submarine port, off limits to Estonians and tucked away behind
sentries and double files of barbed wire. Now the doors and windows of
Paldiski's bleak, Soviet-era, prison camp hang agape, a clutch of trawlers
lies rusting at anchor, the barracks and buildings are gutted.
On a bleak January afternoon, the last trucks loaded with ripped-out cables
and anything else of value, were being loaded on to a grey naval
transporter, the Donetsk Miner, before heading off to the Russian enclave of
Kaliningrad, formerly Konigsburg.
By mid-1994, the last of the dismantled training reactors will have been
removed - and Paldiski, with its sheltered harbour and 9.5 metre draught,
will be both liberated and potentially ripe for development as a commercial
harbour or, given the area's natural beauty, a yacht basin and tourist
complex.
But the real focus of Estonia's maritime and entrepot enterprise are the
ice-free, deep-water ports of Tallinn and nearby Muuga. The dry bulk, oil
and container terminal now being extended and developed at Muuga, will cost
Dollars 600m. The 18-metre draught ensures that Muuga, like Tallinn City
Port with its 16.5-metre draught, is able to take every kind of vessels able
to sail in the shallow Baltic.
Neste, the Finnish oil company, has helped finance a 500,000-ton oil storage
facility at Muuga while Japan's Sumitomo bank, as well as the World bank,
the EBRD and other international financial institutions are involved in
plans to build a 300,000 unit capacity container terminal, a coal export
facility for the Russian trade and improved ro-ro and other facilities.
St Petersburg, by comparison, is poorly equipped and much shallower as well
as dangerously polluted and poorly guarded, Already a high proportion of
Russian trade including mineral shipments by rail from as far afield as
Kazakhstan, plus more than 70,000 Lada cars for export and other fragile, or
vulnerable cargoes, are shipped through Tallinn.
The harbours and the new Estonian shipping lines carved out of Morflot, the
former all-union Soviet shipping company, are the main source of hard
currency earnings. Taken together, the income from hard currency services -
shipping, port services of all kinds and tourism - help to keep the current
account in surplus.
These activities form the basis for future development of a largely
service-based economy for the capital city and its entrepot trade with the
former Soviet states and the rest of the world. To this important extent,
the real potential of Tallinn will only be reached when Russia itself is
more prosperous and linked to foreign trade.
Meanwhile, Tallinn is the home port for the Estonian Shipping Company
(ESCO), which took over maritime assets left at the time of the Soviet
dissolution. It has embarked on an ambitious renewal programme to update its
current fleet of 73 vessels of 517,000 dwt capacity. Its inherited stock of
general purpose ships, ro-ro vessels, timber carriers, bulk carriers and
river-sea going ships have an average age of nearly 18 years.
The company, due to be privatised by the end of 1996, carried 5.23m of the
just over 11m tonnes of cargo which passed through Tallinn port complex,
including the new port of Muuga, last year.
Trade with Scandinavia generally is rising strongly, although the fastest
rise in both passenger and freight traffic is on the short Tallinn-Helsinki
run of only 80 kms, essentially a link in the mooted Via Baltica
super-highway which will eventually connect Helsinki, and St Petersburg
through the Baltic States to markets in central, southern and western
Europe.
With well over 2.3m passengers now passing through Tallinn every year, a new
ferry terminal building will be ready for the start of the tourist season in
May.
Mr Peeter Palu, who was construction minister in the former communist-era
government, remembers how all key jobs in both the port and the connecting
transport services, as well as the bulk of manual grades, were effectively
reserved for Soviet (meaning non-Estonian) citizens.
'Under market conditions the port is already being run very differently,' he
says.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (10): Crucial political conundrum - Debate
on civil rights of ethnic minorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restoration of the rights and liberties of the inter-war Estonian republic
became the obsessive goal of all politically-aware Estonians - once
glasnost, the great achievement of the Gorbachev era, made it possible,
after nearly 50 years of silence - to debate the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop
pact which transferred independent Estonia into the Soviet sphere of
influence.
Local reformist communist party leaders - men like Edgar Savisaar and Arnold
Ruttel - took the lead and, in the summer of 1988, the Estonian Supreme
Soviet became the first of the 15 Soviet national parliaments to declare
national sovereignty. This was followed by the first free elections in March
1990 which brought openly pro-independence nationalists into the parliament
and swept Mr Savisaar into power as prime minister.
The government was always regarded as transitional but became even more so
after the failed August 1991 coup in Moscow which was immediately seized
upon as an occasion to declare full independence from Moscow and set up a
constitutional assembly to draw up a new constitution.
Communists and nationalists together started work on the new constitution in
November 1991 and the new document, which rejected the authoritarian
presidential model of the pre-war constitution in favour of parliamentary
government, was approved by referendum in June 1992.
The first elections under the new constitution took place in September 1992
and the pro patria, or Fatherland front, a loose alliance of conservative
and Christian democrat groups, led by Mr Mart Laar, a young former academic,
emerged as the largest single grouping with 23 seats in the 100-seat
Riigikogu (parliament).
Mr Laar became prime minister of the five-party conservative coalition
government formed after the elections. He used his party's swing vote to
break an inconclusive outcome to the presidential elections, which took
place at the same time, and ensure the election of Mr Lennart Meri as the
first president of the restored Estonian republic.
Mr Meri, a well-known film-maker and historian, is the son of the foreign
minister of the inter-war republic, and was among 100,000 prominent
Estonians deported to Siberia after the Soviet takeover in 1940. He lacks
the formal powers enjoyed by Konstantin Pats, the last pre-war president of
Estonia, but enjoys high prestige as a canny observer of Russian affairs and
elder statesman in a government whose ministers average age hovers around 30
years.
Last year, President Meri obliged the government to revise its nationality
laws to take into account objections of discrimination against Russians,
voiced by the Council of Europe, and caused a flurry early this year when he
protested against the January government re-shuffle which, he feared, would
distract attention from the worrying signs of resurgent Russian nationalism
and talk in Moscow of restoring Russian influence over the Baltic states.
Given Estonia's recent history, and the colonial nature of Soviet dominance
throughout the Baltic states, a crucial political conundrum concerns the
civil rights of ethnic minorities, mainly Russian speakers, who make up 35
per cent of the population.
All the current members of parliament are ethnic Estonians. Automatic
citizenship, and therefore full rights to vote and participate in politics,
is limited to those whose families were resident before the waves of
Soviet-inspired immigration after 1940. Non-citizens were able to vote in
local elections last year, but were not eligible to stand as candidates for
election.
More than half the population of Tallinn, and over 90 per cent of the
inhabitants of Narva, the eastern border city, are Russian speakers and over
10,000 former Soviet army and KGB officers have set up their retirement
homes in the republic. The latter in particular are openly viewed as a
potential fifth column by many Estonians, including ministers.
The government offers to help defray the removal expenses of non-Estonians
wishing to leave and an estimated 30,000, plus thousands of Soviet military
personnel and their families, have left over the last 18 months.
Most Russian-speakers, including an estimated 80-100,000 'old Russians' from
Czarist days, want to stay in what is expected to become a stable and
prosperous democracy. They have been granted residence permits for the next
five years and the offer of citizenship conditional on learning basic
language skills and demonstrating loyalty to the Estonian state. Dual
citizenship is not allowed.
Acute observers like Mrs Marju Lauristin, the minister of social affairs,
notes that 90 per cent of Russian speaking children, hitherto segregated
into Russian speaking schools, are now seriously studying the Estonian
language - 'for Estonians the issue is not blood, but the survival of their
language and culture,' she underlines.
Mrs Lauristin is a social democrat in a government whose overall
conservative philosophy is deeply influenced by Thatcherite notions of
self-reliance and the virtues of thrift and hard work. Taxation and other
policies are expressly aimed at encouraging the emergence of a large,
stable, property-owning middle class, concentrating social assistance on the
really poor and introducing self-financing health and pension schemes.
For many, Estonia's determination to achieve the prosperity of its
Scandinavian neighbours by the turn of the century is symbolised by the top
priority given to first establishing and then sustaining a convertible,
gold-backed, independent national currency.
Significantly, plans for the new independent Kroon were first drawn up in
1987 when Mr Siim Kallas, the president of the Bank of Estonia, was not a
banker but a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union working
closely with the Russian reformers whose star is now waning in Russia
itself.
He saw that Soviet reforms would falter without serious monetary reform,
doubted that Russia's reformers had the strength to push through what was
required, but was convinced that Estonia alone could succeed. Two years of
independence have proved him right.

When Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, sought vainly to keep
Estonia and the other Baltic states within the Soviet Union he warned that
divorce would cut the umbilical cord which kept Estonia supplied with energy
and raw materials and lead to economic disaster.
Nothing could have been further from the truth, although Mr Gorbachev almost
certainly believed in what he was saying.
Within two years Estonia has shifted from more than 90 per cent dependence
on the Soviet market to around 30 per cent, including trade with its Baltic
neighbours, Latvia and Lithuania which it is trying to boost through the
Baltic free trade agreement.
Russia remains an important trading partner with strong potential for rapid
growth once this can be placed on an ordinary commercial basis. St
Petersburg, with more than 9m inhabitants in the city and its surroundings,
is a rich potential market for agricultural and industrial goods.
Tallinn and other Estonian ports are well-placed to serve the expected
growth of Russian foreign trade into the 21st century.
Estonia's experience over the last three years demonstrates that a
combination of political independence, a strong currency and a rational,
market-determined price structure can lead to dramatic shifts in both the
direction, volume and usefulness of foreign trade.
In the specific Estonian case it has led both to a change in the pattern of
trade, as energy and raw material consuming industries have been closed or
cut back, and a geographical shift in trade from east to west.
Both aspects have been helped greatly by the physical proximity of Finland,
only 80kms across the Gulf of Finland, and the cultural and linguistic
affinity between these two Finno-Ungaric peoples.
Even so, the turnaround has been exceptional. In 1991, more than 56 per cent
of Estonian exports - mainly foodstuffs, textiles, chemicals and machinery -
went to Russia alone and over 90 per cent to the Soviet Union as a whole.
Total dependence on Soviet oil and gas ensured a similar pattern of imports
with Russia alone accounting for 46 per cent of imports.
In 1993, Estonia's foreign trade more than doubled to around EEK20,000m
(over Dollars 1,450m). Detailed figures for the first nine months show that
exports, at EEK7,143m grew by 218 per cent compared to the same period in
1992 while imports grew 240 per cent to EEK7,515m, leaving a small negative
balance of EEK372m.
Further strong trade growth is expected as Estonia, with its excellent
deepwater ports, resumes its old Hansa league trading habits and the economy
expands.
Given the small overall size of the economy, the biggest potential for
growth lies in shipping services and the development of an already
substantial entrepot trade. With a touch of irony, and some immodesty, the
port of Tallinn likes to bill itself as the 'Hong Kong of the Baltic.'
The move of Estonian exporters into new markets meanwhile will be
facilitated by a series of new trade agreements.
These started in July 1992 with the bi-lateral free trade agreements with
Finland, Norway and Sweden.
This was followed by the tri-lateral free trade agreement between Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania in September 1993.
This year, Estonia and the European Commission are due to discuss a free
trade agreement with the EU, talks which will largely try to eliminate the
possibly harmful consequences of Finland's own application for EU
membership.
For Estonia, close trade and investment links with Finland are vital. In
1993, Finland became both the main export market, taking 22 per cent of
Estonian goods compared to Russia's 20 per cent, and the main source of
supply, 25 per cent of total imports compared to the 19 per cent supplied by
Russia. Sweden and Germany are the next most important trade partners.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (13): Light industry benefits from
innovative drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems a long time ago now, but back in the late 1980s, a man called
Mikhail Gorbachev was struggling valiantly to shore up the Soviet economy.
He gave enterprises more independence, in the hope they would behave like
western ones, and encouraged them to seek help with re-tooling, particularly
if they were makers of scarce consumer goods.
In Russia, the old dogs of communist industry were reluctant to learn new
tricks. Instead of making better consumer goods, they used their newfound
freedom to splash out on western luxuries as a treat for their workers.
But the Baltic states were a different story. By Soviet standards, they
already had flourishing, innovative light industries - and they jumped at
the opportunity Mr Gorbachev offered them. For this, at least, independent
Estonia has reason to thank Mr Gorbachev.
A typical beneficiary of the Gorbachev innovation drive is Baltika, a
Tallinn company staking out a claim to be the region's leading garments
maker. Three years of consultancy from the UK company Taylor Woodrow helped
the 66-year-old business re-orient its production from the undemanding
Soviet market to the more bracing atmosphere of Scandinavia. With average
daily output of 1,000 jackets and blouses, 2,500 pairs of trousers, and
wages of less than one fifth of the Scandinavian level, Baltika is a useful
sub-contractor for middle-market European clothing chains such as Next and C
&amp; A.
Baltika has two labels of its own - Plus B and Baltman - which it sells at
five stores in Estonia and is now introducing them to Latvia and Lithuania.
While Baltika's own brands accounted for just 20 per cent of output last
year, the hope is to boost that figure to 50 per cent in 1994.
Group turnover, including 13 wholly or partly-owned companies, is also seen
rising impressively, to EEK 200m this year from EEK 135m in 1993. But profit
margins in the embryonic Baltic market are relatively low (about 6 per cent
last year) and as soon as it feels able, the company hopes to launch its own
labels in western Europe.
Another of Tallinn's light-industries is the HTM ski boot factory. Here, a
foreign technology partner of several years' standing - the Austrian-Italian
leisure goods consortium, HTM - took a 90 per cent share in the joint
venture that was created last summer out of Salvo, an Estonian business that
once made helmets and other plastic goods.
With annual production of 400,000 pairs of ski boots, nearly 8 per cent of
total world output, the Estonian plant expects to handle more and more of
HTM's product range - including ski bindings and diving equipment.
Neither Baltika nor HGM makes much use of local raw materials or equipment.
Estonia may be full of ailing textile companies, but the quality is nowhere
near Baltika's requirements and most of its fabric comes from western
Europe. So, too, does the granulated plastic which is the basic raw material
for HTM.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (8): The inflow accelerates - Foreign
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreigners accounted for more than half the EEK2,540m (Dollars 195m) of new
investment in the Estonian economy over the first nine months of 1993 with
Finland and the Scandinavian countries in the lead. The inflow is expected
to quicken in 1994 with the speeding up of privatisation and a possible 4-5
per cent rise in GDP.
Investment mirrors the trade pattern. Over the first nine months of 1993,
Finland - with EEK45.7m invested in 502 Estonian enterprises - topped the
league followed by the US with EEK35.5m in 31 enterprises.
US investors include PepsiCo, although the largest US investor is a company
owned by Mrs Tivu Silves, an Estonian entrepreneur with subsidiaries in the
US.
Swedish companies, eager to secure a lower cost production base invested
EEK31m in 94 enterprises although their presence is actually greater because
many Swedish companies, including Asea Brown Boveri, operate through their
Finnish subsidiaries.
Italy comes fourth with EEK23m, but virtually all of that is accounted for
by one big investment, the HTM Sport Estonia ski boot and accessory factory.
Germany completes the list of the top five foreign investors with EEK12m in
35 companies while the bulk of the EEK8m invested by UK companies is
accounted for by Shell, the oil company. Russian entrepreneurs invested
EEK7.9m in 76 companies.
Several big projects are in the pipeline however with Sumitomo Bank of Japan
involved in financing the big new container and oil port at Muuga, just
outside Tallinn.
Other foreign investments include:
A Dollars 10m investment by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in a
Dollars 44m project to modernise and clean up the 1m tonne a year Kunda
Nordic Cement plant. Kunda is jointly owned by the Estonian government and
Atlas Nordic Cement, controlled by Euroc of Sweden and Switzerland's
Holderbank.
Modernisation of the telecommunications network, including a FMk100m mobile
phone system and a ten-year Dollars 50m fixed line project for 600,000
lines. Joint venture between the Estonian government (51 per cent) and
Telecoms Finland and Swedish Telea, with 24.5 per cent each.
Electrolux of Sweden - a plant to produce 80,000 electric cookers.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (7): Tough, candid, and rich - Profile of
a surprising entrepreneur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Tiiu Silves, Tallinn's best-known private entrepreneur, first became
famous in the city as a rag and bone merchant. After graduating from selling
home-cooked waffles and flowers in the streets of the capital five years
ago, she started offering hard-to-come by video-recorders and other western
goods for every five tonnes of metal scrap brought to her scrapyard in the
Tallinn docks.
After sorting and baling, the scrap was exported for hard currency.
Today, she and her immediate family own and control Silves Enterprises, a
holding company with 22 operating divisions and subsidiaries in eight
countries, including the US where she is building a house. Reputedly the
richest woman in Estonia, she is guarded day and night by large, 're-cycled'
gentlemen who received their training in the KGB.
Much of her time is spent alternately wheedling and threatening recalcitrant
payers in Russia and other former Soviet states on behalf of foreign
companies which despair of getting payment through conventional channels.
She is tough, no question of that. But she is also humorous, resourceful and
refreshingly forthcoming about what it takes to do business in the former
Soviet world.
'Bribes?' she replies with a weary interrogative. 'No business is done in
Russia without bribes of some kind. When I need wagons and I'm told nelzya
('impossible'), then I don't mind if we have to slip something to the
badly-paid man on the ground to make sure he does what he is supposed to do
anyway. But it sticks in my throat when we have to pay off the senior
officials.'
She also has harsh words for many of the new-breed Russian entrepreneurs -
'they don't understand that many western companies approach Russia with a
genuine desire to be helpful.
'Many Russians just feel that westerners have come to exploit Russia and are
therefore fair game.'
Many of her companies are heavily involved in trucking and trading in
foodstuffs, vehicles, timber and fish, as well as metals and scrap.
'Less than 10 per cent of scrap comes from Estonia now,' she says. 'We've
cleaned-up Estonia. Now my people go as far afield as Kazakhstan. At that
distance the profit margins are really slim, once costs are covered.'
Competition is also fierce in the foodstuffs business, selling western
products into the kiosks and privatised retail food shops which have opened
up in Russia and beyond.
'While we are content with small margins, say five cents a can, the people
who buy our goods in Russia load 15 - 20 cents on top. That's why prices are
so high there,' she says.
'What they charge is their business. But I insist on getting paid. The
golden rule is never to pay roubles in advance.
'My main headache at present is trying to get back Dollars 250,000 I
foolishly agreed to extend on a three-day credit to an Armenian
'businessman' in Moscow. I found out too late that he enjoys the highest
protection.
'He drives a white Cadillac, lives in Kruschev's old villa in Moscow's Lenin
Hills and has 'friends' at the top of the central bank,' she says.
'I'd shoot him if I thought I'd get away with it, He's a creep - a nothing,'
she candidly adds with a grimace.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (6): The pace is beginning to quicken -
Privatisation / This year, 155 out of the remaining 500 industrial
enterprises have been prepared for sale by tender
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Estonian government decided last year that rapid privatisation of
the virtually all-encompassing state sector was a priority issue, it was not
interested in re-inventing the bicycle.
Instead it decided to hire an expert from Treuhand, which has been
responsible for selling off former East Germany's once-vaunted 'crown
jewels.' The aim was to apply German methodology, modified where appropriate
to the specific local circumstances.
The man and the ideas came mixed together in Mr Herbert Schmidt whose
penchant for blunt speaking appears to be matched by a similarly steely
resolve to get privatisation up and running demonstrated by his principal
Estonian colleagues, Mr Vaino Sarnet, director of the Privatisation Agency
and Mr Jaan Manitski.
The trio appear to circle around each other with a mixture of mutual respect
and wariness.
The privatisation process started, as elsewhere in the post-communist world,
where it was easiest. This meant the sale by auction or the restitution to
former owners of small property - shops, restaurants and the like. The
process is virtually complete, with the exception of rural land and property
where restitution and other legal problems are still acute.
Large scale privatisation only started to take off in August last year with
the creation of the Privatisation Agency, (PA). The agency is modelled
closely on Treuhand, and designed as a one-stop operation for potential
investors - 'the international investor wants to know with whom he can
deal,' explains Mr Vainet. 'This is the one-stop agency which carries out
the privatisation programme through tenders.'
The decision to proceed with privatisation as fast as possible was an
all-party decision, overwhelmingly approved in parliament.
This is reflected in the composition of the agency's 11-strong board. It is
chaired by Mrs Liia Hanni, the minister for reform and ownership
transformation, and includes representatives from the finance and economy
ministries, the central bank and six political parties.
As Mr Schmidt makes clear, the Estonian way eschews various forms of mass
privatisation through vouchers, popular in the Czech Republic, Russia and
elsewhere, as well as simple auctions to highest bidders.
'Privatisation is an economic exercise. It is not about selling assets so
much as purchasing capital, know-how and access to foreign markets,' he says
to nods of assent from his Estonian colleagues. 'For this,' he adds, 'the
appropriate method is the tender, with no distinction between foreign or
local bids.'
A few restrictions on foreign participation in the Estonian economy do,
however, remain. Since April 1993, foreigners have been allowed to buy land,
but only in connection with a particular land-use connected to their
investment, not land as such. This is not overtly discriminatory but makes
it harder for ethnic Russians and others, including the 10,000 retired
Soviet servicemen, from buying in potentially strategic areas.
The authorities have also drawn up a list of over 20 sectors which are
currently restricted for foreigners. They include electricity, harbours,
gas, liquor and tobacco, but definitely not telecommunications where a joint
venture between the state telecom system and Finnish and Swedish telecom
companies is busy upgrading mobile and fixed land telecommunication systems
in a 10-year priority programme.
The pace of privatisation started to hot up towards the second half of 1993.
Last year the PA signed 50 contracts involving the sale of assets worth EEK
400m.
When taken together with assumed debts, future investment, job creation and
other commitments this translates into deals worth around EEK 1.5bn to the
economy, securing 10,000 jobs, Mr Schmidt calculates. 'This helps to make us
popular with the unions,' he adds.
The agency is now fully operational with 50 trained Estonian staff and 15-20
experienced consultants, thanks partly to financial and other assistance
from US-AID, the EU's Phare Fund, the EBRD and Treuhand.
This year some 155 out of the remaining 500 industrial enterprises have been
prepared for sale by tender, out of a total of what Mr Schmidt delicately
describes as 2,000 state-owned 'objects.'
In practice, a high proportion of these assets can best be described as
'dogs,' like the former Soviet managed rocket and military engineering
factories which ran to a different music when the economy was not about use
and utility as now, but about power and authority - Soviet authority at
that.
Some of the old plants may be salvageable in a new form, but the fate of
many will be oblivion. But this process will be much lass painful than
seemed likely only two years ago. Then privatisation of state assets looked
like virtually the only show in town.
Now the main dynamism in the economy stems from greenfield investments and
start-ups by new homegrown and foreign entrepreneurs.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (5): Key role for Treuhand's man in
Tallinn - Dr Herbert Schmidt advocates a 'third way' to privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a nation that spent many centuries under the tutelage of Teutonic land
owners, the Estonians tend to be admirers of most things German.
And the government, faced with the task of parcelling out Estonia's state
industries efficiently but fairly, has looked for advice to Berlin - in the
shape of Treuhandanstalt, the German privatisation agency.
This makes Dr Herbert Schmidt, Treuhand's man in Tallinn, one of the most
influential figures in Estonian public life.
Since taking up his job in autumn 1992, his experience and above all his
contacts in the banking and corporate worlds have been of invaluable help in
enabling Estonia to sell itself to the world - even at a time of instability
in neighbouring Russia.
'We have kept investor confidence, despite Zhirinovksy' is Dr Schmidt's  -
so far - justifiable claim.
He has brought from Treuhand a 'philosophy' of privatisation - 'in some
countries,' he says, 'the main purpose is the political one of dismantling
the state as rapidly as possible; in others, the exercise is mainly fiscal,
aimed at boosting state revenues without looking too closely at the buyers.'
Dr Schmidt advocates a 'third way' to privatisation: seeing the process not
as a sale of assets but a purchase of management skills, technology and
capital. For 'political' privatisation, a Czech or Russian-style voucher
system is appropriate; for fiscally-minded privatisers the obvious road is
straight auctions. But the 'purchase' of external help can only be done by
using an elaborate range of criteria to evaluate each potential buyer.
Dr Schmidt has encouraged his Estonian colleagues to look not simply at the
direct fiscal benefits from each bid, but at the more broadly defined
'transaction value,' which takes into account promises of long-term
investment and employment.
He is frank about Estonia's possible drawbacks, which makes him more
plausible than when he talks about the country's undoubted assets.
While Estonians are by instinct a law-abiding, even legalistic nation, the
Soviet takeover of 1940 interrupted the parliament's adoption of a
fully-fledged civil war code.
So the only legal tradition on which Estonia can draw is the fragile one
that was instituted by Russia's Tsar Alexander II in the 1860s. That makes
it harder, though certainly not impossible, to draw up contracts.
He likes to compare Estonia with 'Hong Kong of twenty years ago' - a
strategically located 'entrepot' and outpost of capitalism, with a deep,
efficiently-managed port. These assets, he reckons, should make up for the
tiny size of the local market.
On the future of Estonian industry, he is sure that those businesses which
'grew up naturally' in the pre-war period out of the region's own resources
can restructure and flourish. But some of the manufacturing that was
artificially planted in the republic by the Soviet occupiers, particularly
in the defence sector, may now wither away.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (9): Super modern but still super
conservative - Commercial banking profile, Hansapank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The view from Hannes Tamjaru's office at Hansapank, Estonia's second largest
and most profitable private commercial bank, encompasses the onion domes and
spires of Tallinn's historic city centre and the nodding cranes in the
harbour from whence the city gains its wealth.
The bank which started as a subsidiary of Tartu bank, one of eight banks
closed by the central bank in a demonstration of its close monitoring of the
fledgling banking system, began as an independent institution in January
1992.
The youth of the institution is matched by that of its 250 staff. Their
average age is 25. This reflects the determination of Mr Tamjaru and his
eight partner-shareholders, not to employ anyone with experience in the
previous state banking system, and to concentrate resources heavily in two
directions - staff training and state of the art computerisation.
The banking hall is super-modern and functional. The larger Estonian
companies and wealthy individuals who make up the target-customer base are
received by senior management in a top floor foyer lined with elegant nude
statues. You could be in Scandinavia, not a former Soviet republic.
The bank may be super modern, but it is also super conservative - 'our
capital adequacy ratio, based on BIS standards, is 18/19 per cent, and is
growing through retention of profits. But if we are cautious lenders it is
partly because we have cautious borrowers,' Mr Tamjaru notes. 'Most of our
lending finances working capital. So far, there is little long-term capital
project financing and in any case the banking system is still too small. The
total balance sheets of all the 23 private banks put together is around
EEK5,000m, while the total equity base is only EEK450m, around Dollars 40m.
'As the central bank limits loans to any single customer to 50 per cent of a
bank's equity, all the banks taken together could not raise more than
Dollars 20m for an investment project. At our bank, we limit such loans to
20 per cent,' he adds.
This means that big investment projects, like developing the new container
port at Muuga, modernising and reducing pollution in the shale oil, cement
and other industries or modernising telecommunications, is beyond the local
banks.
In 1992, the European bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) stepped
into finance emergency oil shipments and ensure diversification of supply
away from traditional Soviet sources. It works closely with the Estonian
Investment Bank, in which it is a shareholder alongside the Nordic
investment bank and the Bank of Estonia.
Sumitomo bank of Japan is playing an important role in financing port
modernisation. The International Finance Corporation has also announced its
first investment of Dollars 10m in a Dollars 44m modernisation of the Kunda
cement factory.
Thus far, however, the presence of foreign commercial banks in the small
domestic market of only 1.6m people is limited to the odd representative
office. Given the balanced budget and the automaticity of the currency board
system, there is no deficit financing to spur the development of a money
market, although the Bank of Estonia has started to issue certificates of
deposit which are sold at auction with interest rates close to D-mark rates
on international markets.
The short-term nature of the bulk of deposits is another reason why bank
lending is conservative and liquidity high. At Hansapank, foreign exchange
and fee income is currently higher than interest income, although the high
spread between current 9.25 per cent yearly deposit rates and the 19.5 per
cent average lending rate ensures a 14-16 per cent spread 'which means good
business,' notes Mr Tamjaru.
But lending is expected to pick up sharply this year - 'the quality of the
entrepreneurs coming to us for money is rising all the time. We have been
saying for a year that the economy has been growing much more rapidly than
shown by the official statistics. New entrepreneurs, not privatisation, are
the real movers behind economic growth.
'Business know-how is developing quickly, success is shining on our
customers,' he adds with a grin.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (1): Small is beautiful - Liberated from
50 years of Soviet rule, Estonia, smallest of the Baltic states, is
revelling in its new-found freedom to rediscover its historic traditions and
adapt them to a modern, democratic way of life

Estonia is an encouraging place for those who argue that the dissolution of
the Soviet empire has released much frustrated energy which allows the world
to face the 21st century with guarded optimism.
In less than three years, a small group of youthful politicians, academics,
bankers and businessmen has managed to restore the liberties and customs of
a small nation, introduce market-based economic reforms and shift trade and
investment decisively towards the west in general and Scandinavia in
particular.
Taking advantage of Russia's internal turmoil after the failed August 1991
coup, Estonia, together with the other former Soviet Baltic states, promptly
declared independence and then moved with great speed and determination to
create a new constitution and a multi-party political system.
The central bank, headed by Mr Siim Kallas, who worked closely with Russian
reformers in the Gorbachev-era Supreme Soviet, reinforced economic reforms
by the introduction on June 20, 1992 of an independent national currency,
the Kroon. Its value is fully backed by the new state's steadily rising gold
and hard currency reserves.
Multi-party parliamentary and presidential elections in September 1992
allowed the formation of a broadly-based coalition government, headed by Mr
Mart Laar, the 33-year-old prime minister. His 'Fatherland Coalition' of
centre-right parties also secured the election of Mr Lennart Meri, a
distinguished historian and film-maker, as president of the restored
republic.
A top priority of the newly independent state was to form a 3,000-strong
armed border patrol force and a 2,000-strong national army backed by a
volunteer national reserve. The army is commanded by an Estonian-American
former US Army colonel and armed mainly with Israeli weapons following a
Dollars 47m arms deal.
Clearly, Estonians, after centuries of domination by Baltic Germans and
Swedes, and subjected to nearly 300 years of Russian hegemony in the eastern
Baltic, believe that strong fences make good neighbours.
Not everyone is amused. Estonia's reluctance to extend nationality rights to
former Soviet military personnel, and some other categories among the ethnic
Russians who now make up 29 per cent of the population, has attracted the
ire of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian chauvinist, and others.
To which Mrs Marju Lauristin, the minister of social affairs replies: 'Such
people are demanding for ethnic Russians in Estonia rights and privileges
which they cannot guarantee in Russia itself.'
Given that Estonia's main requirements are independence and stability,
however, Mrs Lauristin argues that it is in Estonia's own best interests to
see that its ethnic minorities feel at home in, and loyal to, the restored
state. Such expressions of enlightened self-interest are welcomed by many
Russians, especially those with family roots in Estonia, dating back to the
Czarist period and the younger, better-educated business people for whom
Estonia is an excellent place from which to do business with neighbouring
Russia.
One prerequisite for acquiring nationality is proof of minimal linguistic
language ability. The Council of Europe judged this a not unreasonable
request, given that ethnic Estonians, who make up 65 per cent of the
population, speak a distinctive language related to Finnish and Hungarian.
For most Estonians, full independence requires that the 2,500 Russian troops
who remain from a once 100,000-strong Soviet occupation army, leave by
August 31, 1994 - the deadline agreed with Moscow after months of difficult
talks conducted by Mr Juri Luik, a government high-flyer who has just
swapped the defence portfolio for the foreign affairs ministry. But in later
talks Moscow withdrew this promise despite strong pressure from western
governments.
Despite the second thoughts in Moscow, the Soviet withdrawal is virtually
complete. Only the nuclear training reactor remains to be dismantled at the
big Soviet-era naval and nuclear submarine training base at Paldiski on the
west coast. The huge military airfield at Tartu has been abandoned, as has
the nuclear fuel plant at Sillimae, all once staffed only by non-Baltic
Soviet citizens.
Only 1,000 special assault troops in a barracks, 500 metres from Toompea
castle, the pastel pink parliament building in the centre of the old town,
remain vaguely menacing, apart from the paratroop units stationed just
across the border in Russia's Vitebsk and Pskov military districts.
There is less progress, and less, insistence, on an outstanding territorial
claim. A swathe of territory recognised by Moscow as Estonian in perpetuity
by the 1920 Tartu Treaty remains outside the de facto border of the new
Estonian state. The actual frontier remains the old Soviet administrative
dividing line between the Russian and Estonian Soviet republics.
It will probably remain so for the foreseeable future. Moscow has signalled
its determination to keep the frontier where it is by building a big, modern
customs and frontier post at Ivangorod just across the river from the
largely Russian-speaking Estonian city of Narva on the western bank.
A similarly permanent-looking border post is currently being built by the
Russians on the south-eastern border where the main Riga-St Petersburg
highway crosses the Estonian line.
Already much of the reduced volume of trade which crosses the borders is
private, not inter-state. Estonia was tied to the Soviet Union for over 90
per cent of its trade, three years ago. Now Russia accounts for little over
20 per cent of a total which is now overwhelmingly orientated towards
western markets.
Finland has replaced Russia as the top trading partner. But all Estonia's
gas and much of its oil and raw materials still comes from Russia while 90
per cent of the traffic through Tallinn port is linked to the former Soviet
hinterland. St Petersburg, Russia's second city and the former imperial
capital, is partially lit by electricity from Estonia's oil-shale fired
power stations.
Estonians will never be able to ignore the giant on its doorstep. The trick
is working out a way of living more creatively and freely with it. After 50
years spent debating the merits of submitting to Soviet forces without
firing a shot in 1940, many Estonians are determined never again to suffer
the subjugation which followed the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact on the
eve of the Second World War.
They see their future in the closest integration into western defence and
economic structures, starting somewhat reluctantly with half-way houses like
Nato's 'partnership for progress.'
But there is also a widely spread conviction running from President Meri
throughout the government and society that the future stability and
prosperity of Estonia and the other Baltic states hinges largely on the
degree to which the St Petersburg area can be integrated economically into
what could become one of the fastest-growing regions in 21st century Europe
 -the Baltic basin.
Asked to look ahead and describe the Estonia he expects to see by the turn
of the century, Mr Laar, the prime minister replies 'a young, modern
fast-developing country that looks to Europe, is part of Europe, but
maintains its own identity.'
That looks well within grasp, provided Russia abides by the rules of decent
international behaviour and honours the sovereignty of a small neighbour
which can never be a threat but could serve Russia's interests well as a
friendly, independent state and efficient trade partner.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (4): Protecting the kroon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high priority given to the maintenance of a strong independent currency
is crucial to the success of Estonia's economic reforms, writes Anthony
Robinson.
'When inflationary financing is impossible and the exchange rate is not
flexible, other factors such as domestic prices and wages, must adjust.
Softening adjustment by inflation and money illusion is made impossible,'
commented Mr Siim Kallas, governor of the National bank of Estonia and
widely recognised as the key figure in monetary reform.
'Perhaps not surprisingly, currency board solutions have proven unacceptable
to large countries,' he added, in a recent paper.
The currency board undertakes to convert all kroons offered to it at the
fixed rate of EEK 8 to DM1 and ensures that the issuance of new currency is
umbilically linked to the size of the foreign exchange reserves.
Indicator of success
The monetary reform with its automatic link between reserves and currency
issuance was supported almost unanimously by the Estonian parliament and was
specifically designed to enhance the prestige of the new currency and
protect it from political interference.
One clear indicator of success is the level of gold and foreign currency
reserves. When the new central bank published its balance sheet for the
first time in July 1992, a month after the reform was introduced, reserves
amounted to EEK 1,165m (DM 145.65m).
The total included 11.3 tons of gold transferred abroad by the pre-war
government and returned to its legal successor after the restoration of
independence.
Thanks largely to sharply higher tourist and other invisible receipts from
the booming shipping and harbour sector, foreign reserves to back up the
kroon have been piling up in the Estonian National Bank.
By the start of 1994, reserves had quadrupled to EEK 5,237m (DM 655m),
demonstrating the solid basis for a non-inflationary increase in the money
supply needed to sustain the expected economic growth this year.

FT  19 APR 94 / Survey of Estonia (3): Reforms at a high price - The economy
/ Estonia is the first and only economic success story to emerge thus far
from the wreckage of the Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Backed by a strong, convertible currency, and wedded to balanced budgets and
fiscal rectitude, a small band of young and determined economic policy
makers has managed to throw off the legacy of Soviet rule and open Estonia
up to trade and investment from their Baltic neighbours and the world
beyond.
Industrial output has been climbing steadily since February last year,
contributing to a 3 per cent rise in the gross domestic product after three
years of sharp declines. Overall GDP is expected to grow by 5 per cent in
1994, boosted by a fast-growing service sector, rising foreign investment,
mainly from Finland and Scandinavia, the privatisation of hundreds of former
state enterprises and an explosive growth in new private businesses.
Economic activity is heavily concentrated on Tallinn, the capital, in which
a third of the population of 1.6m live.
Provided relations with Russia can be kept on an even keel, the city can
look forward to a prosperous future as a 'Baltic Hong Kong,' blessed with
the deepest ice-free ports in the region and perched just beyond the western
extremity of virtually land-locked Russia.
Three years ago, such optimism would have appeared preposterous - Mikhail
Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, warned Estonians and other
independence-minded Baltic states that divorce would mean economic disaster.
Well over 90 per cent of Estonia's foreign trade was conducted with the then
Soviet Union which supplied energy and raw materials as well as a wide range
of intermediate industrial goods.
The World Bank and other institutions warned that Estonia would need to seek
Dollars 1bn in foreign financing to make up for hidden Soviet subsidies and
argued against leaving the rouble zone.
For a time it looked as though the Cassandras from east and west might be
right. In 1992, industrial production slumped 38 per cent, inflation soared
to 1,069 per cent and only an emergency shipment of 100,000 tons of heating
oil from Finland prevented thousands from freezing to death - literally, in
the case of the old and infirm.
But right in the middle of Estonia's annus horribilis an event of crucial
importance took place. On June 20, 1992 the central bank initiated monetary
reform by introducing the kroon, a new and independent currency fully backed
by gold and foreign currencies. It was pegged to the D-mark at a fixed rate
of 1 DM=8 EEK. Up to 1,500 roubles per person were exchanged at 10 roubles
for one kroon, equivalent to the D-mark-Rouble parity on the day.
Since then, the kroon's fixed exchange rate with what is still Europe's
strongest currency has been the principle anchor of economic policy. By
adopting a currency board system Estonia's monetary reformers effectively
put the economy back on the gold standard of yore and laid the basis for
what has become one of Europe's strongest currencies.
Inflation last year was reduced to 36 per cent, economic growth is on a
rising track and foreign trade doubled in volume.
Finland has replaced the former Soviet Union as the main trade partner. More
than 40 per cent of all imports now flow through Finnish ports only 80km
away across the Gulf of Finland.
Russia remains an important trade partner but took only 38 per cent of
Estonian exports last year, compared to 95 per cent in 1991. It supplied
only 30 per cent of Estonia's imports, mainly oil and gas, compared to 85
per cent three years ago.
But the reforms which are transforming the economy have come at a high
price. Average real incomes shrank dramatically over the last two years,
accompanied by a rapid increase in income differentials.
The young, multi-lingual, entrepreneurial types in the new banks and
enterprises enjoy high and rapidly rising incomes.
Civil servants, teachers and workers in the old-style state-owned
enterprises, many of them ethnic Russians, have seen their incomes fall. An
estimated 20 per cent of the 1.6m population live on or below the poverty
line.
Official statistics may tell only part of the story, however. Ms Marju
Lauristin, the minister of social affairs, estimates that income from wages
and salaries only accounts for 55 per cent of average family income.
Part-time jobs specially in the fast-growing service sector help make up the
difference.
In spite of all the wrenching changes in this small economy, however,
unemployment has been kept remarkably low - although employment in the
official, still largely state controlled sectors of the economy, has fallen
steeply.
Soviet Estonia boasted 850,000 jobs, but only 635,000 official work-places
remain. Despite this shrinkage in the old economy of large textile and
engineering plants, oil shale mines and related heavy industry, only 16,000
workers, between 2-3 per cent of the work force, are officially unemployed.
A further 45,000 are registered as semi-employed.
Low unemployment is partly a function of definition. After six months
looking for a job, the unemployed are struck off the unemployment pay
register.
Pockets of high unemployment certainly exist, especially in rural areas and
in the heavy industrial areas which were built in the Soviet period and
staffed largely by ethnic Russians.
However, thousands of new jobs have been created in the fast-growing
construction, transport, private retail and other service sectors.
Tax evasion is widespread in the vibrant new capitalist economy. But recent
tax reforms, introducing VAT and simplification of the income tax structure
by imposing a flat rate 26 per cent personal and corporate income tax, have
been designed to broaden the tax base.
A reform of the social security system this year will create a
self-financing health and pension system based on employer and employee
contributions.
The aim is to free-up the budget for more productive infrastructure and
other investments.

FT  19 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee rallies after early setback
 -Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE futures opened sharply lower at the London Commodity Exchange
yesterday morning reflecting hefty losses in New York on Friday following
news Brazil was to release coffee stocks internally. But prices bounced in a
move some traders linked to the Brazilian growers' association voicing its
disapproval of the plan and threatening legal action.
The near July position closed Dollars 9 down at Dollars 1,437 a tonne after
touching a low of Dollars 1,428.
The COCOA was roused from its torpor by a lively New York market. Traders
said there was nothing fundamental behind the interest but some cited the
bullish implications of a trader's report showing a large net long
speculative position. The July position ended at Dollars 917 a tonne, up
Dollars 16, after backing off resistance at Dollars 920.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER'S early rally, encouraged by commission
house buying, had dwindled by the close as overhead selling and resistance
took the three months price from a high of Dollars 1,894 a tonne to Dollars
1,885, a net loss of Dollars 2 and still within the recent Dollars
1,880-Dollars 1,900 range.
Attempts by ALUMINIUM to break above Dollars 1,300 resistance (for three
months delivery) failed repeatedly during the day as the market ran into
profit-taking and speculative selling. The price ended at Dollars 1,298 a
tonne, down Dollars 7.50.
LEAD traded routinely but continued to find support on dips towards Dollars
450 a tonne, where underlying trade interest was again emerging.
News that the US Federal Reserve wanted to raise short-term interest rates
had little impact on LME trading, dealers said.
But the news caused some slippage in precious metal prices, which had
previously firmed slightly in the afternoon, spurred by fund buying on the
New York SILVER futures market, which encouraged participation in gold.
In London cash silver closed 3 cents up at Dollars 5.28 1/2 a troy ounce,
while GOLD put on 45 cents at Dollars 377.70 an ounce.

FT  19 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US resists broadening of
aluminium cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium producing countries are at odds about how Brazil, Venezuela and
the Gulf States could be encouraged to join in international efforts aimed
at reducing world output by between 1.5m and 2m tonnes a year.
This subject will top the agenda when the six countries and the European
Union - which agreed to make the cuts as part of an unprecedented trade deal
in January - meet again in Brussels this week.
Western companies so far have announced annual cuts totalling more than
900,000 tonnes to last two years and the Russian government has promised
cuts of 500,000 tonnes. So there is considerable disappointment that some
important aluminium-producing countries not represented at the trade talks
have failed to follow this lead.
The European industry is now urging EU trade delegates formally to invite
Brazil, Venezuela and the Gulf States into the production-cuts scheme. It
suggests that the reluctance of these countries to share the industry's pain
by cutting output by about 10 per cent is understandable because they did
not take part in the original discussions.
However, US trade delegates are strenuously resisting any broadening of the
scheme on the advice of Justice Department lawyers, who are worried about
anti-trust problems. The more countries involved in the scheme, the more it
begins to look like an illegal cartel, the lawyers argue. It was for this
reason that Japan, one of the biggest aluminium consuming nations, was
excluded from the negotiations even though it asked to join in.
Brazil's aluminium smelters have an annual capacity of more than 1.3m tonnes
and Venezuela's can produce about 640,000 tonnes. The Gulf States' capacity
is roughly 800,000 tonnes. So far only Alba (Aluminium Bahrain) has
announced cuts - 20,000 tonnes - as a way of 'supporting the present
international drive to re-establish balance between supply and demand in the
primary aluminium market'.
The industry's determination to re-establish that balance has resulted in
the aluminium price climbing by abut 25 per cent since it reached an
all-time low of 47.2 US cents a pound in November.
Some analysts suggest the rising price might result in some companies either
not going ahead with planned cuts or reversing those already made. With this
in mind, Canada will be pressing at this week's Brussels meeting for more
'transparent' or precise statistics from the industry.
It is understood that Russia has made a first stab at presenting its
production statistics to the International Primary Aluminium Institute, the
London-based trade association, in time for the meeting.

FT  19 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber pact negotiations set to
resume in the autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations on a producer/consumer rubber pact are to resume in the autumn
after the failure of this month's 10-day session to agree on price
stabilisation measures, reports Reuter from Geneva.
Producer and consumer states were reported to have made good progress at the
talks, which ended on Friday, but remained too far apart on key price issues
to finalise a deal to replace the 1987 International Natural Rubber
Agreement, which expires in December.
'We still differ on the reference price, the price range, and how to review
and revise the price,' consumer delegate Mr Derek Taylor, representing the
European Union, said after a last-ditch meeting failed to bridge the
differences.
Resumption of negotiations between the 29 rubber exporting and importing
states had been tentatively scheduled for October 3-14 in Geneva, according
to a statement from the conference secretariat.
'The core issues have been narrowed down but we now have to get down to the
nitty gritty,' Mr Taylor said.
The Kuala Lumpur-based International Natural Rubber Organisation, which
administers the pact, will review the outstanding issues at a meeting in
May, to prepare the ground for an October deal.
'The conference has allowed us to clarify where we stand. . . we now have to
do more work,' said Mr Ahmad Zubeir, a Malaysian producer representative.
The current pact, unlike other commodities agreements, has been reasonably
successful in offering consumers orderly markets in return for supporting
Inro, and by protecting producers from sudden price slumps through buffer
stock buying operations.
Consumers wish to maintain the current deal's market orientation and they
seek a future reference price at or close to the current 196.84
Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilogram. Led by the United States and the
European Union, which together consume 40 per cent of world supplies, they
have said they cannot justify any imposed market-lifting measures.
But producers want a reference price above 200 cents.
They argue that the market price, although temporarily buoyed by seasonal
tightness and economic recovery, is too low to encourage smallholders to
stay in business.
'But we have to know what price they are seeking and why,' Mr Taylor said.
'Producers have not presented the economic rationale for higher prices amid
sufficient supply,' explained a trade expert. 'Their approach is too much
tied to past trends. We need a price that is economically justified and not
one which is the product of political pressures.'
Consumer delegates added that the current pact cost them enough. 'Trying to
push prices up and hold them there would be prohibitively expensive,' one
said.
Nevertheless, tyre manufacturers have agreed that they would prefer the
long-term security of supplies to rock-bottom prices now.

Nearly 1,000m above sea level, on the barren, treeless plateau of the high
Andes, the humble houses of Cerro de Pasco cluster around a gaping open-cast
pit. Way below the rim, front-loaders scoop up ore while lorries trundle to
the top to disgorge their loads. Miners, lamps on their headgear blazing,
emerge from the warren of tunnels beneath the mountainside.
Though the technology and work practices look antiquated, this is one of
Peru's richest lead and zinc mines. It has been continuously worked for 90
years, yet proven reserves assure another 20 years of output and potential
reserves maybe 40 more.
Cerro de Pasco is the largest and most coveted of the seven production units
owned by Centromin, Peru's state mining and refining giant, which goes on
the auction block at the end of this month. Besides these mines  - six of
them polymetallic, one, Cobriza, copper only - Centromin's new owner will
inherit four hydro-electric power stations, 270km of railway, more than
11,700 workers, 12,000 dwellings and four dozen schools.
Not surprisingly, few companies have seriously contemplated this daunting
challenge. Chief interest has come from Britain's RTZ, Mexico's huge silver
producer Penoles and Gencor of South Africa. Canada's Cominco, and Sweden's
Boliden, as well as Frisco, a medium-sized Mexican mining concern, have also
made recent evaluations.
Centromin produces some 45 per cent of all Peru's lead and zinc, 40 per cent
of its silver and 16 per cent of its copper. Annual sales are about Dollars
400m, with 70 per cent of production exported.
The base price for the complex but intimately interrelated operation has
been set at Dollars 280m. Bidders will have to put up another Dollars 60m in
debt papers (at today's secondary market prices, that means an outlay of
Dollars 30m).
Additionally, at least Dollars 240m must be pledged in fresh, long-overdue
investment over three years. The La Oroya smelter and refinery complex is a
notorious polluter and studies indicate expenditure on the most basic
environmental improvements will run to Dollars 120m-plus.
So is Centromin a bargain or not? Mr Hernan Barreto, a private sector
businessman who has presided the past two years of company restructuring, is
Centromin's keenest salesman. He stresses it is 'very much a going concern',
with 1991 losses of Dollars 174m transformed into Dollars 19m profits in
1992. Despite higher productivity, last year's profits fell slightly to
about Dollars 15m - low 1993 international prices cost Centromin Dollars
100m, says Mr Barreto.
'We also boast a positive cash flow, quality products that command premiums
on world markets, excellent professionals and a prestigious mining
tradition,' he says. There have been no strikes for three full years.
A hefty plus for the eventual buyer could be the four hydro-electric power
plants, whose 183 megawatt capacity and 910km of transmission lines could
easily be expanded and the surplus sold - as already happens on a moderate
scale - to the national grid. Peru's energy deficit has aroused keen foreign
investor interest and Centromin's generating plants alone have been valued
at around Dollars 300m.
Then the company has accumulated losses of Dollars 240m which could prove a
'very interesting tax shelter', according to Mr Barreto.
But the heart of this grand old company - born in 1902 as US-owned Cerro de
Pasco Corporation and nationalised by Peru's left-wing military government
in 1974 - is its mines and refinery complex. Of the former, Cerro de Pasco
is the star. Last year it produced 310,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate, out
of the company total of 500,000 tonnes, and 116,000 tonnes of lead
concentrate (total company output was 148,000 tonnes).
Cerro's open pit has proven reserves of some 10m tonnes, enough for just
seven years operation. Future expansion is likely to focus on the
underground mine's 47m tonnes of proven and probable reserves. A promising
deposit called Matagente, part of the same orebody, has a possible 37m
tonnes more.
Of the remaining six mines, most require substantial investment in new
machinery. The copper-only Cobriza mine is nearly exhausted and the huge
copper deposits of Antamina - formerly owned by Mineroperu - have been
included in the Centromin package to replace it. Development costs for
Antamina could top Dollars 300m.
The multiple smelter and refinery complex of La Oroya, meanwhile, is one of
the world's largest and most complicated. It refines copper, zinc and lead
and produces a grand total of 20 mineral and chemical by-products including
antimony, bismuth, tellurium and selenium.
Centromin's new owner will also inherit a varied portfolio of mining
concessions totalling 256,000 hectares (632,000 acres). Among them are
promising but only superficially explored deposits such as gold-bearing
Quiqai, near Cerro de Pasco. Mr Barreto says the disseminated deposit, still
at the 'grass-roots stage', has similar characteristics to Newmont Mining's
hugely profitable new Yanacocha venture.
Whoever eventually acquires Peru's giant will find it a friendly one.
Management and, in general, workers welcome privatisation. They have
soldiered on for years on shoestring modifications - a brand-new Dollars 25m
oxygen plant, mainly financed with an Andean Development Corporation loan,
is almost the only major recent investment - making up in ingenuity and
commitment for the absence of cash.
'My hope is that the new owners will transform Centromin into a great
employer once again,' says Mr Jose Carrascal, general manager at La Oroya.
That hope is fervently echoed by the 60,000 or so Peruvians who directly
depend on Centromin for their livelihood - and by tens of thousands more in
Centromin's mini-kingdom of the high Andes.

FT  19 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries plunge after surprise move by
Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US bond prices plunged yesterday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve
surprised the market by announcing a move to lift short-term interest rates
for a third time in two months.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 11/32 lower
at 86 5/32 , with the yield rising 12 basis points to 7.407 per cent. On the
short end, the two-year note was down  5/16 to 99 1/16 , to yield 5.638 per
cent.
Early in the session, prices were drifting lower in quiet trading. The
market was jolted out of its slumber by a 10am statement issued by Mr Alan
Greenspan. The Fed chief said the central bank would 'increase slightly'
pressure on reserve positions in the banking system, a move which is
expected to boost the Federal Funds inter-bank lending rate, from 3.50 to
3.75 per cent.
Most traders had not expected the Fed to act until the next meeting of its
policy-making arm on May 17. Last week, many were speculating the move would
coincide with Friday's release of data on March capacity utilisation. When
the figures proved tame, and the morning passed uneventfully, the market let
down its guard.
Yesterday, prices on the long end of the maturity range quickly dropped
nearly a point, stabilised and then dropped a further during the afternoon.
Traders said the losses reflected disappointment that the Fed had not acted
more aggressively in moving toward its stated goals of 'neutral' credit
conditions. Many economists believe the Fed will continue to lift rates
until Fed Funds are at 4 per cent or higher.
European government bond markets plummeted as news emerged of the rise in US
short-term interest rates. Bond futures contracts lost between a point and
two points on the day, breaking through key support levels which then
triggered further selling by investors. While most of the activity took
place in the futures markets, the steep fall pulled cash bond prices down
too.
'It was a bit of a meltdown,' said Mr Steve Major, bond analyst at Credit
Lyonnais.
Europe opened on a fairly bearish note yesterday morning as investors
digested the implications of the Bundesbank's small easing last week.
'Investors are reconciling themselves to the fact that the Bundesbank is
going to continue with its slow pace of easing, cutting three or five basis
points from the repo at a time,' said one bund trader.
While the Bundesbank's interest rate cut last Thursday prompted several
other European central banks to follow suit, there was disappointment that
the Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 5.90 per cent
yesterday.
The French notional bond futures contract on the Matif opened at 122.94 and
fell to a low of 121.94 after breaking through the key support level of
122.00. The contract settled at 122.02.
'The European markets were driven by weakness in the US, and in the near
term we can expect to see technically driven trading. All the markets are
breaking important support levels, and this is triggering stop-loss
selling,' said Mr Ifty Islam, bond strategist at Merrill Lynch.
The German government bond market fell sharply too: the Liffe bund futures
contract opened at 96.47 and quickly reached the high of the day at 96.57
before drifting lower. But news of the Fed tightening sent the futures
contract down to a low of 95.36, after which it recovered to trade at 95.47
by late afternoon.
High-yield European markets suffered even bigger losses with Spain and Italy
falling nearly two points on the day.
The Liffe long gilt futures contract fell nearly two points, again prompted
by the unsettling news from the US and despite relatively favourable
economic fundamentals. Friday's good inflation figures, and the prospect of
'gilt-positive' news this week on the economic front did little to stem the
selling, dealers said.
However, before the US news was released, and while market conditions
remained relatively calm, the Bank of England sold out its tranche of Pounds
150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2011. announced on Friday.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Record fine for CBoT over
CFTC complaint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, has agreed
to pay a Dollars 300,000 fine and undertake remedial actions to settle a
complaint by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that the exchange
failed in its supervision of a member firm, Stotler and Company, which
collapsed in August 1990.
The fine is the largest civil penalty the CFTC has imposed on an exchange.
The settlement ends a three-year examination of the exchange's treatment of
Stotler and its records in the period leading to the company's demise.
Mr Karsten Mahlmann, who was CBoT chairman at the time of Stotler's failure,
was also a principal at the firm.
In its 10-count complaint against the exchange filed last May, the CFTC said
the CBoT failed to notify the agency of serious deficiencies in Stotler's
financial records as early as 1987 and failed to enforce its own capital
rules by allowing the firm to remain undercapitalised in 1988.
Although conflicts of interest on the part of Mr Mahlmann were not addressed
in the CFTC complaint, the CBoT as part of its settlement has agreed to
'implement policies and procedures designed to ensure that its staff
maintains an independent mental attitude toward member (firms) when an
officer or director of the firm is also a director of the CBoT.'

FT  19 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: British Columbia in Dollars
2bn EMTN launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Canadian province of British Columbia plans to launch a Dollars 2bn Euro
medium-term note programme (EMTN) arranged by Lehman Brothers, a finance
ministry official said.
The programme, which is due to be launched in early to mid-May, is part of
an ongoing process of diversifying the province's borrowing sources and
broadening its investor base, said Mr Jim Hopkins, assistant director of
debt management at the finance ministry of British Columbia.
The dealer group will include Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, UBS, Goldman Sachs,
Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and SBC, he said.
British Columbia is a well-known name in the Eurobond market, which it first
used in 1983. Last year, it issued a CDollars 1.25bn global bond as well as
two Canadian dollar-denominated Eurobonds with maturities of 12 and 30
years. Its borrowing requirement for the financial year 1994-95 totals
CDollars 4.1bn, down from last year's CDollars 4.8bn.
British Columbia has the highest credit rating among Canada's provinces.
Standard &amp; Poor's rates its long-term debt double-A-plus while Moody's
accords it a double-A-1 rating.
The Finnish Ministry of Finance has appointed arranger Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and UBS as dealers for its
Dollars 10bn Euroshelf for the issuance of debt instruments. The equivalent
of Dollars 4.3bn has been issued to date under the programme, which was
established in March 1993.

debut

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The state-owned Polish Development Bank (PDB) is planning an issue of
short-term hard currency bonds through the ING Bank in London, in Poland's
first appearance in the international capital markets.
The PDB sees the Dollars 100m three-year programme as paving the way for the
government's plans to place Dollars 1.5bn worth of bonds abroad once the
country's 43 per cent reduction deal on its Dollars 12.2bn debt with the
London Club of commercial bank creditors is finalised this autumn.
Terms on what is effectively a certificate of deposit programme have yet to
be fixed but the ING says that they will be above Mexican bank yields and
below Brazilian or Argentine bank yields. The CDs are to be issued for
between a week and six months but initially they will be limited to 90 days.
The PDB already has a domestic CD programme in place serving companies
listed on the Warsaw stock exchange.
The bank, which is 91 per cent state owned, is itself planning to apply
later this year for a Warsaw bourse listing coupled with a new share issue
which would boost its capital from its present 1,207.3bn zlotys to 1,407.3bn
zlotys. Last year the PDB reported a 147.9bn zloty net profit on a balance
sheet worth 6,582.2bn zlotys.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Bonds: US rate rise unsettles potential
Eurobond issuers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpected rise in US short-term interest rates yesterday afternoon upset
a promising start to the week in the Eurobond market. Syndicate managers
said several borrowers had been close to launching mothballed Eurobond
issues but were unsettled by the market volatility which was triggered by
the Federal Reserve's action.
'The US rate rise has closed the sterling fixed-rate market for the week,
and probably the other currencies too,' said one syndicate manager.
L-Bank, the recently re-named state development agency of Baden-Wurttemberg,
was putting the final touches to its long-awaited D-Mark global bond
offering yesterday but today's planned launch was in doubt after the US
news. Prior to the rise, market talk on the five-year issue, which could
raise between DM2bn and DM3bn, was 35 to 37 basis points over the five-year
Treuhand bonds due October 1999.
L-Bank and the lead managers, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Salomon Brothers,
are expected to take a final decision this morning on whether the deal
should go ahead.
Syndicate managers said L-Bank's dithering was creating a backlog of D-Mark
Eurobond issues. For example, KfW, the German government agency for
redevelopment, is thought to be keen to raise DM1.5bn though an offering of
10-year Eurobonds but is waiting for L-Bank's larger offering to be out of
the way. Greece is also looking to tap the D-Mark floating-rate market next
week.
By contrast, Sweden is expected to take advantage of the rise in Canadian
government bond yields to attract investors to its CDollars 200m issue of
five-year Eurobonds which is due to be launched today via Daiwa. The bonds
are likely to be priced to yield between 20 and 30 basis points over the
five-year area of the Canadian government bond yield curve.
Spain is reported to be seeking advice from four or five firms on an Ecu1bn
issue of 10-year Eurobonds. Price talk on this issue is around 15 basis
points over the yield on the French government's Ecu OAT.
Among yesterday's issues, 3i, the UK venture capital company which is
earmarked for a partial flotation later this year, took advantage of steady
market conditions in the morning to raise Pounds 150m through an issue of
five-year floating-rate notes (FRNs).
The discounted margin at re-offer on the notes of 25 basis points over Libor
was described as reasonable and syndicate managers said the notes sold
quickly with around two thirds going to UK investors. When the notes were
freed to trade, they rose from their re-offer price of 99.725 to 99.75. The
offering replaced an Pounds 125m FRN issue which 3i called earlier this
year.
Standard &amp; Poor's affirmed its double-A rating on the long term debt of
Daimler-Benz, the German luxury car, aerospace and defence group, but
changed its outlook to negative from stable to reflect difficult operating
conditions facing the company's key areas.

<TEXT>
Intel, the world's largest maker of computer chips, reported strong growth
in revenues and earnings for the first quarter, its seventh consecutive
quarter of record results.
Revenue for the first quarter totalled Dollars 2.66bn, up from Dollars
2.02bn a year ago. Net income was Dollars 617m, or Dollars 1.40 per share,
compared with Dollars 548m, or Dollars 1.24 per share, in last year's first
quarter.
Growth was driven by a 'steady migration of computer buyers toward higher
performance (personal computer) systems,' said Mr Andrew Grove, president
and chief executive.
First quarter orders set another company record, he said.
Intel is the leading supplier of microprocessor chips to the personal
computer industry.
Strong demand for personal computers, together with a slight increase in the
average price of microprocessors, is driving the company's growth.
Intel is 'on the most aggressive processor (production) ramp in our history
in order to deliver Pentium processors in high volume for mass market PCs,'
said Mr Grove.
The Pentium is Intel's latest and highest performance microprocessor.
The company aims to produce 6m-7m Pentium chips this year, with Pentium
sales expected to represent 25 per cent of fourth quarter sales to the PC
industry, Intel said.
The company said that in the first quarter revenues came 51 per cent from
the Americas, 27 per cent from Europe, 8 per cent from Japan and 14 per cent
from the Asia-Pacific region.

McGraw-Hill, the US publisher, said a 1.9 per cent fall in first-quarter net
income to Dollars 14.97m from Dollars 15.2m in the same period last year
reflected the seasonal impact of owning 100 per cent of a former
joint-venture school publishing company, Reuter reports from New York.
Earnings per share were 30 cents, compared with 31 cents a year earlier.
The company reported a strong performance in financial services, continued
improvement in some advertising-based businesses and better than anticipated
results in school publishing. Revenue for the quarter rose 19.9 per cent to
Dollars 559.8m.
A strong performance by its broadcasting group and upswing in advertising at
Business Week and other publications helped revenue rise 2.6 per cent in its
information and media services segment.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Treuhand summoned Schneider over
debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Treuhand, the eastern Germany privatisation agency, had summoned Mr Jurgen
Schneider, the head of the collapsed construction group that bears his name,
to a meeting in Berlin tomorrow. He faced questions over why he was behind
in payments for seven properties bought from the Treuhand.
Mr Schneider, who fled Germany shortly before the collapse last week, and is
now missing, had already been sent several letters by the Treuhand seeking
clarification on why he was not keeping up with interest payments.
There were also inquiries into delays in paying for other properties
acquired from the agency.
The properties, employing over 2,000 workers, include enterprises and real
estate, all in Leipzig, with the exception of a purchase in Dresden. Mr
Schneider bought these properties from the Treuhand's Leipzig branch between
mid-1991 and December 1993.
The Treuhand says it is owed DM53m (Dollars 30.9m). Yesterday it passed the
case on to the Leipzig and Frankfurt prosecutors. It would not comment on
why it had not taken action earlier, given Mr Schneider's repeated delays in
paying for, or meeting, interest rates.
On November 16, 1992, the Frankfurt developer bought the Thomaskirche Hof, a
prestigious site in Leipzig. But he did not pay until March 17 this year.
The Treuhand is now owed more than DM1.3m in interest payments.
Even before that purchase, the Leipzig branch sold properties to Mr
Schneider, with similar problems over delay in payments. On August 1, 1991,
he bought Bergwerk Eigenturm Kieswerk, a gravel company. Last week, the
Treuhand was still owed DM1.3m in outstanding payments, plus DM340,000 in
interest payments, in connection with the deal.
The Bau und Plannung Gesellschaft Leipzig, a construction company, was sold
to Mr Schneider in November 1991 for DM42m. The Treuhand is owed DM7.3m in
interest. A further DM437,000 in interest payments is owned from October 8,
1991, when Mr Schneider bought Gastronomie Service, a food distribution
business in Leipzig. Interest payments exceeding DM350,000 are outstanding
for Unwelt Technik Luftreinhaltung, an air cleaning business.
Meanwhile, the Treuhand is trying to get back a property in Leipzig Mr
Schneider had negotiated to buy on December 20, 1993, but the contract was
never closed, similar to a real estate property Mr Schneider had wanted to
buy in Dresden.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Citic Pacific in HK3.82bn share
issue to fund expansion

Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong listed arm of the Beijing investment company,
has issued HKDollars 3.82bn (USDollars 492.3m) worth of new shares to fund a
series of tunnel and property acquisitions and to provide a treasure chest
for further capital expenditure.
The acquisitions are to be injected into Citic Pacific from parent Citic HK
under a series of share asset swaps, which sees the Hong Kong listed arm
raise its stake in the Western Harbour Crossing, one of the most important
projects in the new airport programme, to 35 per cent from 10 per cent. It
also takes strategic stakes in the Eastern Harbour Crossing and the Shanghai
Tunnel.
The Western Harbour Crossing is scheduled for completion around mid-1997,
when it is expected to account for an average cross harbour flow of 69,000
vehicles a day, increasing to 160,000 by the year 2023. The total budgeted
project cost is HKDollars 7.5bn.
Two Hong Kong properties, one luxury residential and one industrial, are
also being switched into Citic Pacific, both at prices which represent a 10
per cent discount to market valuations calculated by independent valuers.
The new shares represent around 8.25 per cent of the enlarged issued share
capital of Citic Pacific. They were issued at HKDollars 23, representing a
discount of around 3.36 per cent to the closing price on Friday when the
transaction was completed.
Following the deal, Citic HK marginally loosens its grip on the Hong Kong
listed arm, down to 42.78 per cent from 43.04 per cent.
Of the new Citic Pacific shares, 66m will be swapped with Citic HK and a
further tranche of 100m, worth HKDollars 2.3bn, will be used for capital
expenditure and to pay down debts.
Directors of Citic Pacific also said they had shelved plans to spin off Dah
Chong Hong Holdings, the motor distributor.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Combined net losses at Randgold
group increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The four gold producers in the troubled Randgold stable had another
disappointing quarter as expected productivity gains failed to materialise
and the group had to make provisions for claims after an accident at its
Harmony mine. The mines' combined after-tax loss increased to R21.52m
(Dollars 5.9m) compared with R17.29m in the December quarter.
Mr John Turner, chief executive, said overall yields had remained lower than
expected. Combined with long-standing forward sales contracts at gold prices
significantly below spot, this prevented the group from taking full
advantage of the improved gold price.
Overall ore milled increased slightly to 2.26m tonnes from 2.23m tonnes last
quarter, but gold output dipped further to 8,758kg from 8,941kg.
At East Rand Proprietary Mines, expected productivity improvements resulting
from the introduction of a seven-day week proved unattainable and the scheme
had to be scrapped as a result of excessive fatigue on the part of
mineworkers. Nonetheless, ERPM was the group's only mine to stay in the
black, with after-tax profits of R3.19m following a loss of R16.87m in the
previous quarter.
At Harmony, the group's biggest mine, an improved after-tax profit of
R9.67m, compared with R8.97m, was transformed into a R18.3m loss after R28m
had to be put aside to cover expected costs for the clean-up after the
collapse of a slimes dam.
Further provisions are possible as third-party claims are made, but the
company believes it has adequate insurance to cover these.
Durban Roodepoort Deep improved slightly, turning in an after-tax loss of
R1.56m compared with R6.82m, but Mr Turner said new capital expenditure and
development was 'absolutely essential' for survival and that the mine would
request further state aid.
Blyvooruitzicht reported an after-tax loss of R2.67m compared with R2.55m,
reflecting a continued decline in yield to 5.66 grammes/tonne from 6.19
grammes/tonne.

Enso-Gutzeit, the Finnish forest products group, said yesterday it planned
to tighten its grip on Berghuizer Papierfabriek, its struggling Dutch paper
subsidiary, through an offer for the outstanding shares in the company.
'The offer would be a first step towards a further integration of Berghuizer
into the Enso group, with the intention of providing better safeguards for
(its) continuity', it stated. Enso already owns 57.8 per cent of the
company.
Berghuizer specialises in high quality copying and writing papers. Last year
it made a Fl 14.8m (Dollars 7.7m) loss on sales of Fl 194.8m. It is not
expected to improve this year.
Enso said its offer would be based on a price of Fl 50 per Berghuizer share,
against a Fl 47 market price.

for market

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's rapidly-expanding quoted wine sector is to gain another new
entrant with the flotation of Simeon Wines, the country's largest supplier
of contract wine and grape juice and incorporating the Buronga Hill winery
in New South Wales.
Simeon Wines has been formed as a holding company by Orlando Wyndham, the
South Australian wine producer which is owned by France's Pernod Ricard.
Orlando is injecting Buronga Hill into Simeon, along with three
fully-developed vineyards. The new company will also own land at Padthaway
and Cowra, which is due to be developed.
Under the flotation plan, 12.5m shares in Simeon are being sold to the
public at ADollars 2 each, along with 12.5m convertible notes, also at
ADollars 2 each. Orlando Wyndham will retain 5.8m deferred participation
ordinary shares in Simeon, equivalent to an 18.8 per cent holding once all
notes are converted. At the issue price, and on a fully-diluted basis,
Simeon will be capitalised at ADollars 61.6m (USDollars 43.3m).
Simeon said yesterday that the funds raised would help to expand the
winery's capacity and finance the vineyard development. At present, the
Buronga Hill winery has an annual crushing capacity of 50,000 tonnes.
The enormous recent export success of Australian wines - particularly in the
UK - has put the industry under pressure to expand to meet demand. As a
result, a number of companies - including BRL HArdy and Rothbury Wines -
have listed on the stock market as a means of raising capital. Last month,
BRL Hardy raised ADollars 31.7m via a rights issue, and Australian Vintage,
based in South Australia, is also in the process of joining the stock market
via a much smaller share issue.
Meanwhile, anyone wondering about the choice of name for the latest market
entrant should refer to the Bible. Orlando Wyndham is best-known for its
Jacobs Creek wines, and Simeon was the son of Jacob.

<TEXT>
Energie-Versorgung Nieder-osterreich (EVN), the Austrian regional energy
utility, yesterday announced a rise in operating profits for the six months
ended in February, with increased sales of electricity, heating and natural
gas to private and industrial customers.
Earnings from ordinary operations amounted to Sch1.28bn (Dollars 106.3m) on
sales totalling Sch6.13bn. The earnings reflected an increase of 7.3 per
cent over the figure for the same period a year earlier.
The improvement was achieved despite a mild winter and pointed to strong
results for the full year, the company said.
The positive results were reflected in a 45 per cent rise in the value of
EVN shares on the Vienna stock exchange, with the price of a share rising to
Sch1,596 in February from Sch1,100 on September 1.
The company has looked to expand its activities in central and eastern
Europe and recently signed co-operation agreements with JMP and JME, two
Brno-based Czech utilities, supplying natural gas and electricity
respectively.
This follows two earlier agreements signed with JCE, a south Bohemian
electricity company, and Degaz, the Hungarian gas supply company.
'These agreements represent a preparatory step in a process which we hope
will lead to EVN taking stakes in one or more of these companies,' said Mr
Rudolf Gruber, EVN chairman.
Last week EVN was awarded a AA+ rating on its senior unsecured long-term
debt by Standard &amp; Poor's, and a Aa3 rating by Moody's.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Record profit for Merrill Lynch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Merrill Lynch, the biggest US securities house, yesterday reported a 21 per
cent improvement in first-quarter profits, to a record Dollars 372m, or
Dollars 1.68 a share.
The firm maintained its profits growth in spite of recent increases in
interest rates, which have cut into trading profits at all Wall Street
firms. It attributed its resistance to the less favourable interest-rate
environment primarily to big increases in brokerage commissions and asset
management fee income.
Commissions rose 20 per cent in the quarter, to Dollars 868m, reflecting
increased investor activity in financial markets. Asset management and
portfolio service fees climbed 23 per cent to Dollars 444m, as client assets
under management at Merrill Lynch grew 13 per cent to stand at Dollars 164bn
by the end of March.
Elsewhere, the earnings picture was not as bright. Revenues from principal
transactions - when the firm trades securities for itself and its customers
 -fell 12 per cent to Dollars 667m.
Merrill said that although revenues from trading in swaps, equity
derivatives, equities, commodities and mortgage-backed securities were up
over the three months, higher interest rates led to lower revenues from the
trading of corporate debt, municipal securities, money market instruments
and non-US government and agency securities.
Investment banking revenues were much the same as a year ago, at Dollars
444m, as higher advisory fees offset lower underwriting earnings.
Other revenues - primarily investment gains - rose 72 per cent to Dollars
116m.
On the cost side, Merrill's non-interest expenses climbed 8 per cent to
Dollars 2.2bn, reflecting the rise in employee compensation payments, which
are tied to the company's earnings.
The share price climbed Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 36 1/4 in New York.

<TEXT>
Coca-Cola yesterday said an 'exceptional' performance in emerging markets
helped it achieve an 18 per cent increase in net earnings in the first
quarter.
The results suggest the US company is regathering pace after several years
of lack-lustre growth.
The world's largest soft-drink company said strong sales in Poland and
China, as well as in such 'leading edge markets' as Mexico and Australia,
offset soft market conditions in the European Union and Japan.
For the first three months of the year, the company posted net income of
Dollars 521m, or 40 cents a share, against Dollars 442m, or 35 cents, in the
corresponding period of 1993.
Net operating revenues advanced 10 per cent to Dollars 3.35bn, compared with
Dollars 3.05bn a year earlier. The improvement was struck on a 7 per cent
worldwide gain in unit case volume, exceeding the company's projections.
The results overseas were particularly impressive in view of continuing
economic weakness in many important markets. International unit case volume
climbed by more than 6 per cent, due largely to a 33 per cent rise in
north-east Europe and in the Middle East.
By contrast, growth in the EU was an anaemic 2 per cent, with a 3 per cent
decline in the UK. In Japan, unit volume inched 1 per cent ahead.
The importance of the overseas markets, which account for 80 per cent of
Coca-Cola's revenues, was underlined by its performance in India, where the
company began operating at the end of last year for the first time since
1977. In the first quarter, it sold 12m cases.
In the US, sales volume jumped by 7 per cent, better than forecasts of
around 4 per cent.
The results were a little better than analysts had expected. However, after
early gains, the stock closed unchanged at Dollars 39 3/8.

<TEXT>
Bank of Montreal has begun a long-planned expansion into the Chicago banking
market with the purchase of Suburban Bancorp.
The deal will merge Suburban, which has USDollars 1.3bn in assets, with Bank
of Montreal's Chicago subsidiary, Harris Bancorp, with assets of Dollars
13.5bn. Under the agreement, Bank of Montreal will pay around Dollars 246m
by exchanging 3.93 of its own shares for each of Suburban's. Based on
Friday's closing markets, it will pay Dollars 73.08 a share for Suburban, or
about 17 times 1994 earnings.
Suburban Bancorp owns 13 community banks in Chicago's suburbs and the
majority of its stock is owned by members of the Gerald Fitzgerald family,
which has agreed to the sale.
The acquisition will boost the Chicago profile of Harris Bancorp, which has
banks in 42 locations and is the parent of Harris Bank, one of the five
largest banks in Chicago.
The deal is the first big acquisition for Harris since the Bank of Montreal
unveiled plans to treble its Chicago subsidiary's earnings and market share
within a decade. It is competing for acquisitions with large
expansion-minded regional US banks.
Bank of Montreal will file a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange
Commission relating to the shares it will issue to pay for the acquisition.

Banco Santander, the Spanish bank and one of the largest shareholders in
Kemper, yesterday sided with the US financial group's management in its
fight to ward off a Dollars 2.2bn approach from GE Capital.
However, comments made by Mr Emilio Botin, chairman of the bank, suggested
it may be prepared to accept a higher offer.
Mr Botin praised Kemper's management, led by Mr David Mathis, for
transforming the firm into 'a dynamic financial services company with
considerable upside potential'.
In an apparent indication that the bank might be prepared to sell at a
higher price, he said shareholders should back the current management
'rather than be acquired at a price which does not recognise its (Kemper's)
true value'.
GE Capital's bid to win control of Kemper has so far failed to flush out any
rival bidders for the company.

<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, reported record
revenues for its third fiscal quarter, although earnings were reduced by a
Dollars 120m charge for litigation.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.24bn, a 30 per cent increase over
the Dollars 958m for the same period last year. Net earnings for the quarter
were Dollars 256m, or 84 cents a share, after the litigation charge, against
Dollars 243m, or 80 cents.
In February, a Los Angeles jury ordered Microsoft to pay damages to Stac
Electronics for infringement of patents covering data-compression
technology. Microsoft said it would seek a reversal of the verdict and
would, if necessary, file an appeal.
Excluding this charge, net income for the quarter would have been Dollars
336m, up 38 per cent from the same quarter last year, with earnings a share
of Dollars 1.11, well above Wall Street expectations of about Dollars 1.01.
'This is another record-breaking quarter for the company,' said Mr Mike
Brown, vice-president of finance and treasurer, 'with revenues reaching an
all-time high. While we've had good results across our product line,
Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office continue to lead the way.'
Windows is Microsoft's widely-used personal computer operating system, while
'Office' is a suit of applications products.
For the nine-month period, revenues were Dollars 3.36bn, up from Dollars
2.71bn in the same period last year. Net income was Dollars 784m, or Dollars
2.58 a share, compared with Dollars 688m, or Dollars 2.28.

<TEXT>
The Canadian Pacific group's most profitable subsidiary, PanCanadian
Petroleum, will spend a record CDollars 725m (USDollars 523m) on exploration
and development this year, including CDollars 600m in western Canada, said
Mr David O'Brien, president.
The emphasis is on finding more natural gas. PanCanadian holds the biggest
land base for exploration in western Canada.
Mr O'Brien said although the company's debt level was low, PanCanadian
preferred to grow internally because of the high cost of acquisitions.
PanCanadian is reducing its investment in a joint venture oil project in
Russia because production was not profitable.
The blended price available for Russian crude was about USDollars 13 a
barrel, well below the current world price for conventional oil, said Mr
O'Brien.
PanCanadian's total oil production rose 30 per cent in 1993 and gas output
was up 20 per cent. In the first quarter this year oil output rose 20 per
cent while gas was little changed. PanCanadian expects to report
first-quarter profit of more than CDollars 50m, well up from a year earlier.

RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group, has finalised its takeover of EM
Terrabusi SA, one of Argentina's biggest food companies, after a long
courtship.
Terrabusi recorded sales of Dollars 242m last year, a 25 per cent increase
over 1992, while its pre-tax profit rose 69 per cent to Dollars 12.9m. It
holds one-quarter of the big cookie and cracker market and has Argentina's
best-selling pasta brand.
Nabisco bought 70 per cent of the company from members of the controlling
family. The remainder is still held by the public. Neither side disclosed
the value of the transaction, but analysts in Buenos Aires believe Nabisco
paid between Dollars 245m and Dollars 250m.
This was the largest takeover of a private company by a multinational since
Argentina embarked on a market-oriented stabilisation programme in 1989.
The last year has seen a surge in acquisitions by companies from the US,
Europe, Chile and Brazil. Buyers have focused on the food industry because
Argentina is a large, low-cost agricultural producer.

<TEXT>
Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint producer, continued to post
losses in the first quarter. However, it expressed confidence that signs of
stronger US consumption would bring an improvement later this year.
The Toronto-based company posted a CDollars 43.9m (USDollars 31.7m) loss
from continuing operations, equal to 57 cents a share, up from a loss of
CDollars 27.9m, or 40 cents, a year earlier.
However, the latest quarter includes a CDollars 21.6m write-down on a
newsprint mill in Manitoba, which the company is handing over to its
employees.
Sales rose to CDollars 471.6m from CDollars 454.7m.
Average US newsprint selling prices were 3 per cent lower than in the
previous three months, and 6 per cent below the first quarter of 1993.
Predictions of an improvement are based on signs of rising newsprint
consumption and a sharp fall in customer inventories.
Like other North American newsprint producers, Abitibi announced a reduction
in discounts from March 1. It said it had implemented a 7 per cent cut.
Offshore newsprint shipments were 27 per cent higher, and US dollar prices
rose by 4 per cent against the previous quarter.
The market for uncoated groundwood papers, Abitibi's other speciality, has
been stronger, with sales volumes up 7 per cent over the past year.
Consumption of super-calendered papers, used for advertising flyers and
magazines, was especially buoyant.

Universal Foods of the US is selling its frozen foods business to ConAgra,
the diversified foods group, Reuter reports Milwaukee.
The purchase price reflects a premium over book value, but no details were
disclosed.
The proposed sale, for cash, of the frozen foods business was a step in
Universal's strategic transition to an ingredients company, the company
said.
The Universal Frozen Foods division produces frozen potato products for the
US and international markets. Division sales in 1993 were Dollars 268m.
Universal said it expected to use proceeds from the sale to expand its
geographic presence and invest in technology, process improvement and
product development.
'Consistent with our long-term goals, we are also aggressively pursuing a
number of acquisition possibilities,' Mr Guy Osborn, chairman, said.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Montreal has begun a long-planned expansion into the rapidly
consolidating Chicago banking market with the purchase of Suburban Bancorp.
The deal will merge Suburban, which has USDollars 1.3bn in assets, with Bank
of Montreal's Chicago subsidiary, Harris Bancorp, with assets of Dollars
13.5bn.
Under the agreement, Bank of Montreal will pay around Dollars 246m by
exchanging 3.93 of its own shares for each of Suburban's. Based on Friday's
closing markets, it will pay Dollars 73.08 a share for Suburban, or about 17
times 1994 earnings.
Suburban Bancorp owns 13 community banks in Chicago's suburbs, and the
majority of its stock is owned by members of the Gerald Fitzgerald family,
which has agreed to the sale.
The acquisition will boost the Chicago profile of Harris Bancorp, which has
banks in 42 locations and is the parent of Harris Bank, one of the five
largest banks in the city of Chicago.
The deal is the first big acquisition for Harris since the Bank of Montreal
a year ago unveiled plans to triple its Chicago subsidiary's earnings and
market share within a decade.
It is competing for acquisitions with large expansion-minded regional US
banks, which view Chicago as one of the largest and most profitable banking
markets in the country.
Bank of Montreal will file a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington relating to the shares it will issue to pay for the
acquisition. A official said yesterday the bank would probably seek a
listing on a US stock exchange later this year.
All Canada's six big banks are eager to expand their operations in the US,
especially in the corporate market. So far, however, they have been
discouraged by the high prices demanded for acquisitions.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: United Technologies rises 66%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Technologies, the US technology group, yesterday reported a 66 per
cent increase in first-quarter net income, powered by a sharply improved
performance at Pratt &amp; Whitney, its aero-engine manufacturing subsidiary.
The group reported earnings of Dollars 106m, or 71 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 64m, or 42 cents a share, in the same period last year on
revenues down from Dollars 4.86bn to Dollars 4.84bn.
Pratt's operating income was Dollars 84m, compared with Dollars 24m, and the
underlying improvement was even greater since the 1993 quarter benefited
from a Dollars 75m fee from a company wishing to participate in Pratt's
PW4000 engine programme.
Pratt has been hit hard over the past two years by the downturn in the civil
aviation business, which has cut demand for lucrative spare engine parts.
The company said the improved performance was due to higher commercial
spares sales, lower research and development spending, and continued cost
improvements. This was partly offset by lower shipments of commercial
engines.
Commercial spare parts orders in the first quarter averaged Dollars 140m a
month, compared with a monthly average of Dollars 124m for all of 1993.
The group's flight systems segment had operating income of Dollars 47m, down
from Dollars 71m, as income growth at the Sikorsky helicopter group was more
than offset by results at Hamilton Standard and Norden.
Carrier, the air conditioning unit, had operating income of Dollars 18m, up
from Dollars 8m, as results continued to strengthen in North America,
Asia-Pacific and Carrier Transicold. This was offset partly by European
weakness.
Otis, the elevator group, made Dollars 97m, up Dollars 3m, while automotive
made Dollars 44m, up from Dollars 37m, due primarily to higher production of
American-built cars and trucks and greater penetration in Europe.

Reynolds Metals, the US aluminium processor, said its first-quarter net loss
shrank to Dollars 21m, or 46 cents a share, from Dollars 33m, or 55 cents, a
year earlier.
Sales rose to Dollars 1.3bn, from Dollars 1.2bn, largely because of rising
shipments of aluminium packaging and containers.
'While our loss of Dollars 21m continues to reflect the impact of excess
world aluminium inventories and low pricing, it shows a 35 per cent
improvement over our 1993 first quarter,' said Mr Richard Holder, Reynolds'
chairman.
Aluminium shipments in the quarter fell to 345,000 tonnes, from 352,000
tonnes last time. Primary aluminium shipments dropped to 55,000 tonnes, from
70,600 tonnes last year, while fabricated products shipments rose. The
company received an average price of 61 cents a pound for primary aluminium
against last year's average 57 cents.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Time Warner trims net deficit to
Dollars 54m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time Warner, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a first-quarter
net loss of Dollars 54m, compared with Dollars 124m a year ago. It
registered a slight rise in operating earnings as strong growth in its film
and publishing businesses were partly offset by dips in cable and music.
The group said combined earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortisation (Ebitda), for the group and for Time Warner Entertainment,
totalled Dollars 639m on revenues of Dollars 3.485bn. That compared with
earnings of Dollars 632m on revenues of Dollars 3.277bn a year earlier.
Time Warner Entertainment, a subsidiary grouping its Warner Brothers' film
business, HBO cable channel and cable systems, reports its operating results
on a deconsolidated basis.
The group, which was left with a heavy debt and depreciation burden
following the 1989 merger between Time and Warner, tries to focus attention
on Ebitda as a measure of its underlying performance.
The net loss after preferred dividends worked through at 14 cents a share,
against a net loss of 33 cents in the same period of last year.
Mr Gerald Levin, chairman, said the growth in Time Warner's copyright
businesses had allowed it to sustain an increase in Ebitda, in spite of the
Federal government's first round of the re-regulation of cable industry
prices last September.
The Warner Brothers' film business produced a record Dollars 117m of
earnings, up 10 per cent from a year before. HBO produced record earnings of
Dollars 61m, up 11 per cent, but the cable business saw a drop to Dollars
244m from Dollars 255m because of the new government regulations.
The publishing business, Time Inc, saw earnings rise 25 per cent to Dollars
70m. The Warner music business earned Dollars 147m, down from Dollars 160m.

drug range

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eli Lilly has formed an alliance with Mylan, the generic drugs company, in a
move which signals a drive by US pharmaceuticals companies to extend the
range of products they sell.
Under the exclusive arrangement, Lilly will have the rights to sell Mylan's
anti-ulcer compound, Cimetidine, to its own managed care customers.
By filling out the range of drugs it sells, Lilly hopes to strengthen its
relationships with managed care organisations, which are becoming the
dominant buyers of drugs in the US.
Several drugs companies have also held talks which could lead to a
co-operative agreement to sell each others' products to health maintenance
organisations and other managed care customers.
Lilly's move marks the growing competition in the anti-ulcer market, which
is shaping up to become one of the most competitive in the US. In New York,
Lilly's shares closed Dollars 1 1/4 higher to Dollars 48 3/4 .
Tagamet, the prescription drug made by SmithKline Beecham, loses its patent
shortly, and Mylan's drug is set to become the first generic version to hit
the market.
At the same time Zantac, the Glaxo drug that is patented until the year
2002, is facing potential competition both from Cimetidine and other
generics.
Lilly also reported yesterday a 5 per cent increase in first-quarter sales,
to Dollars 1.64bn, compared with a year before. Operating income grew 2 per
cent.
However, net income for the period fell as a result of a higher tax rate and
a Dollars 56m charge related to the recall of some of the company's
anti-biotics. After-tax profits were Dollars 330.7m, or Dollars 1.14 a
share, down from Dollars 362.6m, or Dollars 1.27m (before the effect of
accounting changes) the year before.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Whirlpool ahead 16% in first
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whirlpool, the US manufacturer of domestic appliances, yesterday reported a
16 per cent increase in comparable first-quarter net earnings, helped by
strong sales growth in the US, Latin America and Asia and cost-cutting in
Europe.
Whirlpool reported net earnings of Dollars 67m, or 90 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of Dollars 162m, or Dollars 2.27 a share, in the
first quarter of 1993, when it took after-tax charges for a new accounting
standard and for financial services subsidiary accounts.
Without the charges, 1993 earnings were Dollars 58m, or 81 cents a share.
Revenues for the latest quarter totalled Dollars 1.87bn, up from Dollars
1.81bn.
The group's home appliance operations reported earnings of Dollars 64m on
revenues of Dollars 1.83bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 51m on
revenues of Dollars 1.76bn.
Mr David Whitwam, chairman, said that 'in terms of operating earnings, we
are well on our way to what we expect will be another excellent year for
Whirlpool'.
In North America, shipments reached record first-quarter levels and ran
ahead of the industry, which grew about 8 per cent.
Whirlpool said that expectations for full-year 1994 industry shipments in
North America had risen to 6-7 per cent better than last year, due mainly to
stronger volumes of air conditioners and microwave ovens.
In Europe, Whirlpool had a slight gain in shipments but turned in its best
first-quarter operating results by continuing to make significant cost
reductions.
The company said central Europe, including new sales organisations in the
Slovak and Czech republics, had contributed nicely to first-quarter volumes.
Whirlpool's sale of its European compressor business to Embraco of Brazil
was expected to be completed in the second quarter.

Fotex, the private Hungarian retail group, has raised Dollars 70m new
capital through the largest international equity offering by an east
European company.
CS First Boston, global co-ordinator, said the offer had been fully
subscribed. Fotex raised Dollars 54m through an international placement in
1991.
The current offer was taken up by institutional investors in Europe and the
US, including CSFB's own recently-launched Dollars 200m Central European
Fund.
Mr Gabor Varszegi, Fotex's chief executive, principal shareholder and
eastern Europe's richest individual, subscribed to the new issue and
maintained his holdings at 24 per cent.
Fotex and CSFB had planned to raise between Dollars 80m and Dollars 100m,
but adverse market conditions curtailed their ambitions. Prospects of a rise
in US interest rates, and sharp falls on the Turkish and Warsaw stock
markets, contributed to a general nervousness among investors.
The size of the issue was also limited by Mr Varszegi's reluctance to issue
shares at a discount. The deal was priced only marginally below the
prevailing market rate, at Ft507 (Dollars 4.88), giving a ratio to
prospective 1994 earnings of about 15-16.
Fotex is listed on the Budapest exchange and traded over the counter in
London, Munich and Frankfurt. The group's ADRs trade in New York and Fotex
plans to apply for a Nasdaq quotation.
Fotex said it would use part of the proceeds to complete the Dollars 30m
purchase of Keravill, Hungary's largest chain selling consumer electronics
and household appliances.
Audited net profit rose 38.2 per cent to Ft945m (Dollars 10.3m) in 1993 and
turnover grew 83.4 per cent to Ft15.8bn. Mr Varszegi forecast a doubling of
both sales and profits in 1994, due in roughly equal measure to acquisition
and organic growth.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas down 38% as
airliner sales fall

<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, yesterday reported a
38 per cent drop in first-quarter net income, due to unusual gains a year
ago.
Operating income, however, rose 20 per cent as improved efficiencies and
property sales helped offset sharply lower sales of commercial aircraft.
The group, which two years ago was suffering under a heavy debt burden, also
reported that stronger-than-expected cash flow of more than Dollars 430m had
allowed it to cut further its aerospace debt burden, which totalled Dollars
1.404bn at the end of March, compared with Dollars 1.625bn at the end of
December and down 49 per cent from the end of 1992.
The improvement came despite an 18 per cent drop in revenues, to Dollars
2.953bn from Dollars 3.617bn, the result of a 53 per cent drop in commercial
aircraft manufacturing sales.
The group's net earnings for the quarter totalled Dollars 134m, or Dollars
3.41 a share, compared with Dollars 216m, or Dollars 5.51 a share in 1993.
However, stripping out unusual gains last year totalling Dollars 122m, or
Dollars 3.10 a share, McDonnell group produced a rise of 42 per cent in the
net figure.
Mr Herb Lanese, finance director, said he was very comfortable with Wall
Street earnings per share forecasts of Dollars 12 to Dollars 13.50 for the
full year, given that the company's weakest quarter was traditionally the
first.
The military aircraft business produced operating earnings of Dollars 166m,
compared with Dollars 99m a year ago, largely due to the F/A-18 programme
and the C-17, a controversial military cargo aircraft which was profitable
in the quarter, compared with break-even last year.
The commercial aircraft side was marginally profitable, with Dollars 3m of
operating earnings against Dollars 12m a year ago, due to reductions in
overheads and improvements in productivity.
It delivered only four MD-80 twin jets and three MD-11 tri-jets during the
period, down from 11 and nine respectively a year ago.
Mr Lanese said that McDonnell expected twin-jet deliveries in the low 20s
and tri-jet deliveries around 20 in 1994, but he thought this would be the
low year of the current cycle, with the market improving in 1995 and 1996.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Time Warner trims net deficit to
Dollars 54m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Time Warner, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a first-quarter
net loss of Dollars 54m, compared with Dollars 124m a year ago. It
registered a slight rise in operating earnings as strong growth in its film
and publishing businesses were partly offset by dips in cable and music.
The group said combined earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortisation (Ebitda), for the group and for Time Warner Entertainment,
totalled Dollars 639m on revenues of Dollars 3.485bn. That compared with
earnings of Dollars 632m on revenues of Dollars 3.277bn a year earlier.
Time Warner Entertainment, a subsidiary grouping its Warner Brothers' film
business, HBO cable channel and cable systems, reports its operating results
on a deconsolidated basis.
The group, which was left with a heavy debt and depreciation burden
following the 1989 merger between Time and Warner, tries to focus attention
on Ebitda as a measure of its underlying performance.
The net loss after preferred dividends worked through at 14 cents a share,
against a net loss of 33 cents in the same period of last year.
Mr Gerald Levin, chairman, said the growth in Time Warner's copyright
businesses had allowed it to sustain an increase in Ebitda, in spite of the
Federal government's first round of the re-regulation of cable industry
prices last September. The significant strengthening of the balance sheet
during the past year had helped improve the earnings per share figures.
The Warner Brothers' film business produced a record Dollars 117m of
earnings, up 10 per cent from a year before.
HBO produced record earnings of Dollars 61m, up 11 per cent, but the cable
business saw a drop to Dollars 244m from Dollars 255m because of the new
government regulations. A second round of government price regulations will
go into effect around mid-year.
The publishing business, Time Inc, saw earnings rise 25 per cent to Dollars
70m.
The Warner music business earned Dollars 147m, down from Dollars 160m, due
to marginally lower US record sales and losses from start-up ventures in
cable music programming and direct marketing.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Montedison sues Price Waterhouse
for L1,000bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Montedison, the Italian industrial company, is claiming damages of more than
L1,000bn (Dollars 611m) from Price Waterhouse Italy, part of the
international accountancy group, alleging 'serious negligence'.
Sources at Montedison, which is the principal subsidiary of the Ferruzzi
Finanziaria holding company, confirmed yesterday that a writ had been served
on Price Waterhouse Italy.
Montedison's new management alleges that the company breached international
auditing and accounting standards between 1983 and 1992, when it was
Montedison's auditor.
The first hearing in the case should take place in Milan on May 24.
Price Waterhouse Italy said yesterday it would 'vigorously defend itself'
against the writ.
In a statement, the company said Montedison's claim was 'based on the
mistaken assumption that it is the auditors, not the previous management (of
Montedison), who were responsible for the deliberate and systematic fraud
now known to have been conducted at the highest levels of management'.
The writ had been expected since November last year, when shareholders in
Ferruzzi Finanziaria voted to proceed with legal action against Price
Waterhouse Italy.
However, the scale of the Montedison claim was not known until yesterday's
leaks from the Milan court. Nor was it known that the writ would relate to
the period before 1987, when Montedison was taken over by the Ferruzzi
commodities group, then headed by Mr Raul Gardini, who committed suicide
last year.
Price Waterhouse Italy has already lodged counter-claims in the Milan court,
alleging that the former directors of Montedison are 'liable . . . for
deliberate fraudulent conduct intended to frustrate normal auditing
procedures' and claiming compensation for the damage to its reputation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ciba and Sandoz, two of the three big Basle-based pharmaceutical and
chemical groups, have provided fresh evidence yesterday of the squeeze on
drug prices in industrialised countries.
Both groups said their pharmaceutical sales were down 3 per cent in the
first quarter, Ciba's to SFr1.4bn (Dollars 962m) and Sandoz's to SFr1.8bn.
Roche, the other big Basle group, showed a greater immunity to drug price
cuts last week, reporting a 10 per cent rise in first-quarter pharmaceutical
sales to SFr3.7bn.
Mr Marc Moret, Sandoz chairman, devoted his statement in the group's 1993
annual report to the drug price issue. He argued that drugs play an
important role in cutting healthcare costs and denounced moves by
governments to cut drug prices. 'The pharmaceutical industry is fighting
disease, not exploiting it,' he wrote.
However, both Sandoz and Ciba forecast further profit growth this year. 'I
would be surprised if we were not able, as in the past three years, to raise
our profits steadily,' Mr Moret told the group's annual press conference.
Another Sandoz director emphasised that double-digit increases had been
achieved in each of the past three years.
Sandoz also forecast a rise in sales of between 5 and 8 per cent this year,
after last year's 5 per cent advance to SFr15.1bn. Ciba said only that it
expected an increase in operating profit.
Both groups said their weak overall sales performance in the first quarter
was due partly to the strong Swiss franc. Sandoz's sales were up 1 per cent
to SFr4.27bn while those of Ciba were 2 per cent lower at SFr5.58bn.
Within its healthcare sector, Ciba's self-medication, diagnostics and Ciba
Vision divisions showed modest growth while sales in Sandoz's nutrition
sector, led by Ovaltine and Isostar, jumped 25 per cent to SFr558m.
Roche will publish its 1993 results today.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Insurance interests boost Worms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Worms, the French holding company, last year saw net profits rise by 25 per
cent to FFr714m (Dollars 122.46m), from FFr571m in 1992, due mainly to a
strong performance from its insurance interests.
Mr Nicholas Clive-Worms, chairman, said that the group had performed fairly
well last year and that, as it was in a net cash position, Worms was
considering plans for expansion.
He identified one of the likeliest areas for investment as insurance, where
it may add to its Athena Assurances business.
Athena last year performed well and increased its contribution to group net
profits by 26 per cent. The contribution from Demachy Worms, the bank, rose
by 8.2 per cent to FFr79m from FFr73m.
Worms also benefited from the capital gains yielded by last year's sale of
its interest in Financiere Truffaut, the luxury goods conglomerate, to Mr
Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH luxury goods group.
By contrast, Compagnie Nationale de Navigation, the shipping subsidiary,
made a net loss of FFr78m in 1993.
The Arc Union property company stayed in the red: albeit with a reduced loss
of FFr115m against FFr252m in 1992.
The contribution from Saint-Louis, the French food group which last week
merged its prepared meals business with that of BSN, slipped by 4 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to FFr21.70 in 1993 from FFr17.35 in 1992. The board
has proposed an increase in the net dividend to FFr7.50 from FFr7.00 over
the same period.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Pinault warned over La Redoute
takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pinault-Printemps, the French retail group, has received a formal warning
from the Paris stock market authorities over the terms of its all-share
offer to buy out the minority shareholders in La Redoute, its mail order
subsidiary.
The Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB) announced that it had
concluded after an investigation that the takeover offer was not fairly
valued in terms of its relation to La Redoute's share price.
Pinault-Printemps came under fire three years ago from minority shareholders
over the terms of the Pinault group's takeover of the Au Printemps retail
chain.
It is extremely unusual for the COB to issue a warning to a company over the
terms of a transaction. The last time that it did so was in the
controversial takeover of the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house by the
Elf-Sanofi pharmaceuticals group.
However, the COB is not empowered to force Pinault-Printemps to change the
terms of the deal as it has no authority to do so in the case of the
takeover of an existing subsidiary.

<TEXT>
Alcatel Alsthom's ambitions to participate in the privatisation of Stet, the
Italian telecommunications group, were dealt a blow yesterday when Mr Romano
Prodi, chairman of IRI, the Italian state holding company, said he opposed a
significant role for the French group.
Mr Prodi, whose company has a 52 per cent shareholding in Stet, said he did
not see why Alcatel should be at the controls of Stet 'while we don't have
the same rights in France'.
Mr Prodi said he was also against mixing the manufacturers of
telecommunications equipment with service operators, and indicated his
opposition to privatising Stet through the formation of a group of core
shareholders.
Alcatel Alsthom has said that it wants to participate in the privatisation
of Stet through a partnership with Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables
group.
Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the French energy, telecoms and transport
group, said he was ready to participate in the privatisation of Stet,
linking industry groups, with Italian majority control. He said any
decisions needed to await clarification of the process for the
privatisation, expected by the end of the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After-tax earnings at Chase Manhattan comfortably exceeded market
expectations during the first quarter as the bank recorded profits on a
series of asset disposals.
Net income for the first quarter was more than double the Dollars 153m, or
74 cents a share, recorded in the first period of 1993.
The disposals, which included real estate assets, loans to developing
countries and so-called 'Brady bonds', helped push net earnings for the
period to Dollars 364m, or Dollars 1.80 a share, compared with market
expectations of around Dollars 1.15 a share.
Trading revenues, at Dollars 179m, against Dollars 175m a year earlier, were
boosted by the sale of loans made to countries which had not reached a debt
restructuring agreement, mainly Brazil.
'Several hundred million' dollars of these loans had been switched into the
bank's trading account at the end of last year, said Mr Michel Kruse, chief
financial officer. Most of the disposals were made during the first weeks of
the year, before prices on such loans traded in the secondary market fell,
he added.
The bank also recorded a Dollars 53m profit from selling real estate assets
held in its accelerated disposition portfolio. These sales also reduced the
carrying value of remaining assets in the portfolio to Dollars 121m.
A further Dollars 79m gain came from selling investment securities, up from
Dollars 6m a year before, as Chase disposed of Brady bonds, securities
issued by developing countries which have reached debt restructuring
agreements with their foreign bank creditors.

<TEXT>
Recent increases in US interest rates failed to dent the net interest income
of NationsBank during the first quarter of the year, enabling the North
Carolina-based commercial bank to report stronger than expected earnings.
The net interest margin on NationsBank's underlying loans business was
maintained at 4.16 per cent, identical to the year before, despite increases
in money market interest rates.
US banks increased their prime lending rates - the rates on which loans to
many customers are based - by only a quarter of a percentage point at the
end of March, lagging the half-point rise in money market rates engineered
by the Federal Reserve during the first three months of the year.
Yesterday's quarter-point rise in money market interest rates threatens to
eat further into banks' interest margins, which have stood at historically
high levels in recent quarters.
However, Banc One said yesterday it was boosting its prime lending rate by
half a percentage point to 6.75 per cent, having raised it from 6 per cent
at the end of March.
Including the lower-yielding trading assets of Chicago Research and Trading,
a derivatives company acquired last year, the net interest margin at
NationsBank as a whole was 3.69 per cent.

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The field to take over Banesto, the failed Spanish financial group which is
to be auctioned next month, narrowed yesterday to three of the largest
domestic banks: Argentaria, the government-controlled banking corporation,
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), and Banco Santander.
The successful purchaser will become by far the largest financial
institution in Spain and one of the biggest banking groups in Europe.
The three banks informed the Deposit Guarantee Fund, the banking agency
managing the Banesto auction, that they contemplated making individual bids
for the financial group.
At the same time Banco Popular, the fourth domestic banking group, pointed
out the possible dangers of a Banesto acquisition.
Popular, which previously expressed an interest in Banesto and which, like
its rival banks, had closely examined the Banesto offer document, said it
would not bid because of the 'truncated' and 'opaque' nature of Banesto's
business.
It added that there was an 'excessive artificiality' in Banesto accounting
procedures and commented on the 'bad quality of its doubtful assets'.
Popular, which is 54 per cent owned by foreign institutions, said that while
a Banesto acquisition 'could be a normal risk for our colleagues, it
represents a high risk for us.'
Banesto was Spain's fourth-largest banking group when the Bank of Spain
intervened last year after an inspection discovered that it had grossly
over-valued its assets.
A subsequent audit established that Banesto had financing needs of Pta605bn
(Dollars 4.3bn), a sum that has been met partly by the transfer of the
bank's entire reserves to provisions and partly by a Pta180bn
re-capitalisation channelled through the Deposit Guarantee Fund.
The potential buyers of Banesto have until April 25 to deliver sealed bids
for the equity in the bank that is currently held by the Deposit Guarantee
Fund as a result of the rescue plan. The fund's shareholding represents 73
per cent of Banesto's reconstituted capital and under the terms of the
auction the buyer must maintain at least 30 per cent of this equity over
four years.
The winning bid for Banesto, which is likely to be in excess of the Pta180bn
that the fund has put into the institution, will be announced on or before
May 9.

Avesta Sheffield, the Swedish-British stainless steel producer, yesterday

aggressive investment programme and lift profits.
The company plans to spend more than SKr1bn over the next three years,
aiming to raise profits by SKr600m a year by 1997. Last year it cut losses
after financial items to SKr98m from SKr574m in 1992.
The largest investments include upgrading the company's melting shops in
Avesta and Sheffield.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Big US banks overcome the
upheaval in markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The upheaval in financial markets in recent weeks failed to dent the trading
profits of US financial institutions Merrill Lynch and Chase Manhattan.
Other US banks, though, have already reported sharp falls in trading income
in the period, mainly because of tumbling prices in the emerging securities
markets.
Merrill Lynch maintained its trading income at Dollars 667m in the first
three months of the year, a similar level to the fourth quarter of 1994,
though down 12 per cent from the record Dollars 761m reported in the first
three months of 1993.
Mr Joseph Willett, chief financial officer, said the result reflected the
fact that Merrill relies on orders from customers for much of its trading
income and hedges most of its positions. The firm also benefited from its
broad range of trading activities, with higher profits in some areas
offsetting declines in others.
Merrill suffered a 'modest loss' during the quarter in trading emerging
market debt, he said.
Chase Manhattan sold off much of its holdings of emerging market debt early
in the year, avoiding the worst of the turmoil in these markets after the
Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates on February 4. Yesterday,
the bank reported trading income of Dollars 179m, in line with the Dollars
175m of a year before.
Mr Michel Kruse, chief financial officer, said losses made on trading such
debt since the middle of February had been more than offset by profits made
in disposing of positions before this. 'It was a very tricky environment,
particularly in the second half of the quarter,' he added.
Last week, First Chicago said it lost Dollars 54m on emerging market
securities in the first quarter, leading it to report an overall trading
loss of Dollars 25m in the period.
JP Morgan, thought to be the biggest trader of emerging market debt,
reported trading revenues of Dollars 356m, down from Dollars 469m a year
before. In the previous quarter, emerging market debt trading had boosted
its revenues to Dollars 606m.

Higher tea production and prices in Kenya and Malawi were behind a 38 per
cent rise in 1993 profits at Linton Park, the tea and coffee producer,
importer and exporter that also has interests in Scottish fishing.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 7.66m to Pounds 10.6m on the back of an 11
per cent rise in turnover from Pounds 129m to Pounds 143.5m. The shares rose
22p to 360p.
The latest turnover figure includes Pounds 7.1m from Kakuzi, a long-time
Kenyan associate which became a subsidiary in March 1993.
The company is 60 per cent owned by Lawrie Group, itself owned by Camellia,
the quoted investment company with interests which include fine art and tea
plantations.
Operating profits from continuing operations increased from Pounds 9.06m to
Pounds 11.5m.
Tea profits had also been good in Kenya.
The pre-tax figure included an exceptional gain of Pounds 306,000 on the
disposal of Macfish, compared with Pounds 500,000 last time.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 1.91m to Pounds 1.14m, reflecting
lower rates.
The tax charge rose from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 3.1m. However, the 1992
figure included an exceptional UK tax credit of Pounds 886,000.
After minority interests of Pounds 1.94m, compared with a previous Pounds
1.66m, earnings per share increased from 31.8p to 41p.
A final dividend of 12.5p is proposed, bringing the total for the year to
15p (14p).

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cheaper at half the price? - Peter John
examines Reuters' share split exercise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Reuters Holdings, the news and financial information group, closed
yesterday at 484p, their first day of trading after a 4-for-1 share split.
The move ended Reuters run as the most expensive single share in the FT-SE
100 index. Meanwhile, the US-traded American Depositary Receipts have only
been halved from their previous level of about Dollars 87 (Pounds 59.50).
Each ADR represents six shares.
Share splits are commonplace in the UK, particularly among FT-SE 100
companies but the logic behind them is hard to pin down.
Companies say splits make their shares more marketable and more attractive
to private investors.
The same rationale is used for consolidations. When shares are trading
below, say, 30p relatively small trades can markedly affect the price - and
this volatility can lead to illiquidity. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising
group, carried out a 1-for-10 consolidation in June 1992 when the shares
stood at about 15p each.
The dentist from Halifax with a few hundred pounds to spare might be
interested in 100 Glaxo shares at 600p each but doesn't like the idea of
buying 50 at twice that price and while she might like the cachet of owning
4,000 Saatchi shares she might not appreciate the fees.
That is the logic that persuaded Glaxo to have two share splits in the
company's glory period between 1989 and 1991. The pharmaceuticals group
said: 'The aim is to bring a price down to a level that makes shares more
available to shareholders. History shows this is usually done around the
Pounds 14 to Pounds 16 limit.'
Reuters takes a similarly pragmatic line. Mr Mike Cooling, corporate
relations manager, says: 'There is always an assumption that it will assist
in liquidity. You could argue that if you reduce the price of the stock, the
dealing size becomes greater for institutional trading. Both arguments sound
logical but there is no proof either way.'
However, there is a strong case for allowing a share price to appreciate
without splits, particularly for fund managers, who make up some 75 per cent
of the UK equity market. Ahead of the split, Reuters' spread - the
difference between the the bid and asking prices of the shares - was quoted
by marketmakers at 15p. That translates to a spread of 0.75 per cent. .
The new spread for Reuters is 7p on a share price of about 500p guaranteed
for a single trade of up to 100,000 shares. This translates to a spread of
1.4 per cent.
Even Mr Brian Newman, analyst with agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite and a
long-time supporter of the shares, finds the process slightly mysterious.
'It doesn't stand up to too close examination' he says.
There have been very few analyses of share splits and most fund managers
tend to echo the sentiments of Mr Peter Jones, investment director of M&amp;G'In
theory it makes not a slight bit of difference,' he says. 'Personally I
would always support a share split where it is into double figures but ask
me to prove why and I can't'
However, Mr Warren Buffet, the billionaire Nebraskan investor, wrote a
damning condemnation of the practice for the annual meeting of Berkshire
Hathaway, his US investment group. 'Brokers, using terms such as
'marketability' and 'liquidity' sing the praises of companies with high
share turnover . . . but investors should understand that what is good for
the croupier is not good for the customer. A hyperactive stock market is the
pickpocket of enterprise.'
Perhaps the reasoning boils down to something as basic as the British fear
of standing out from the crowd. 'We want to have a share split because we
were the only stock trading above Pounds 20 and that makes us an exception,'
says Mr Mike Cooling of Reuters.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition lifts Creston to profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the half year to December 31, Creston Land and Estates, the property
concern, achieved a turnround from four years of losses. Pre-tax profits
were Pounds 14,000 against losses of Pounds 57,000.
The result included Pounds 143,000 from the property activities of
Co-ordinated Land and Estates, acquired last June, offset by losses of
Pounds 129,000 on continuing operations.
Mr Ronald Hooker, the chairman, said that the reorganisation of British
Patent Glazing's activities into the Bradford premises had resulted in
substantial cost savings.
Turnover moved ahead to Pounds 2.84m (Pounds 2.4m). Earnings per share were
0.03p (0.25p losses).

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Britannia's better second half
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britannia Group, the property developer and builder, returned to profits in
the second half of 1993, but still ended the year Pounds 503,000 in the red
pre-tax, against Pounds 393,000.
There was a surplus of Pounds 362,000 for the six months to December 31, but
there was a Pounds 750,000 charge for land provisions which left the
year-end deficit higher. Turnover expanded from Pounds 29.3m to Pounds
36.3m.
Directors explained that the group's strategy of focusing on housebuilding
and construction 'is beginning to bear fruit while our divestment from
commercial property has continued both during the year and into 1994'.
They said they expected to return to the dividend list in the current year.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sharp setback for Densitron Intl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In line with its warning in January, Densitron International yesterday
reported a sharp setback in annual profits.
The Kent-based electronic components group blamed the decline over the 1993
year - from Pounds 1m, restated for a change in the treatment of goodwill,
to Pounds 606,000 pre-tax - on a substantial contractual problem and
disappointing sales in the US.
Turnover improved 27 per cent to Pounds 67.9m (Pounds 53.3m) although
directors stressed that the increase was largely attributable to currency
influences. 'In reality sales were essentially flat and while there was a
small increase in gross margin, there was a large enough real rise in costs
to reduce the outcome,' they added.
The proposed final dividend is maintained at 1p, making 1.5p (1.4p) for the
year, barely covered by earnings of 1.54p (3.89p) per share.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Usborne shares suspended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Usborne were suspended yesterday at 19 1/2 p after the group
warned of substantial interim losses following problems on the pig
production side.
Dealings have been halted until publication of the interim results, expected
next month after completion of an investigation and review of the pig
operations.
Usborne said arrangements to date, including a long term supply contract
with Unigate, had not been sufficient to insulate pig production activities
from the impact of the weak market.
The conditions, combined with a deterioration in productivity, had
contributed to substantial trading losses on pig activities.
The difficulties had been further compounded by a breakdown in management
control of the pig operations, including accounting systems, as a result of
which the extent of the decline was not immediately recognised.
The group's main grain trading activities had been unaffected by the
problems, although first-half profits were lower than last time.

Bridon, the wire rope and engineering products manufacturer, stepped up its
wide-ranging restructuring programme yesterday with the disposal of eight
subsidiaries.
The lossmaking group said it was selling its engineering companies to Vector
Industries, a private company backed by 3i venture capital, for Pounds 13m
in cash.
The move follows a group shake-up, announced in February, aimed at
streamlining production.
Mr Ronald Petersen, chief executive, said the disposals were identified in a
lengthy internal review - codenamed Project 360 - which recommended reducing
the emphasis on peripheral activities.
Proceeds from the disposal will be used to reduce the group's net borrowing,
which totalled Pounds 11.8m in the year to December 31.

Operating profits from continuing operations increased from Pounds 9.06m to

Mr Malcolm Perkins, managing director, said last year had seen good demand
for the high quality sun-dried arabica coffee from Kenya, and prices had
improved, partly because of the producer countries' introduction of a quota
system.
Tea profits had also been good in Kenya, reflecting quality improvements,
but not so good in Malawi.
The cold storage, transport and distribution side of Associated Fisheries
had performed well, but the fishing industry itself had had a bad year.
The pre-tax figure included an exceptional gain of Pounds 306,000 on the

1.66m, earnings per share increased from 31.8p to 41p.
A final dividend of 12.5p is proposed, bringing the total for the year to
15p (14p).

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Whitecroft nets Pounds 6m on option sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitecroft, the Cheshire-based light fittings, fire doors and medical fibres
manufacturer, has made nearly Pounds 6m cash profit by selling an option on
a Stockport retail centre.
The money will further reduce Whitecroft's borrowings. These stood at Pounds
30m at its half year end last December, but then fell to less than Pounds
25m after the sale of a property development at Hillsborough, Sheffield.
The option to buy the Stockport centre was a condition of the centre's sale
 -by a then distressed Whitecroft - at a reduced price to Confederation Life
Insurance in 1991. It was in Whitecroft's books at Pounds 800,000 and
produced no income. Confederation Life is paying Pounds 6.75m for it.
Whitecroft's financial year has just ended, so it cannot be specific about
the effect. However, borrowings are almost certainly now below Pounds 20m.
Gearing was 100 per cent after the Hillsborough deal.
The group was nearly brought down in the recession by the falling value of a
property portfolio built up in the late 1980s. It has since reverted to its
core manufacturing businesses. Remaining properties are two medium-sized
office developments in the south of England, but these are now unlikely to
be sold until they are fully let.

FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: DCC plans IPounds 25m flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DCC, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, is to seek a quotation on
the London and Dublin stock exchanges in May or June through a placing of
new equity.
Mr Jim Flavin, group chief executive said: 'The primary purpose of the
flotation is to get a listing and so we are fairly relaxed over the sum we
are planning to raise, but it will not be over IPounds 25m (Pounds 24.3m).'
Following a 5-for-1 share split last month, there are now 71m shares in
issue, 95 per cent of which are held by institutions.
DCC has gearing of only 6 per cent according to two stockbrokers reports
published yesterday. UBS Global Research also estimates pre-tax profits will
advance by about 40 per cent this year to IPounds 21.3m, giving earnings per
share of 19p on turnover of IPounds 330m.
Bank of Ireland, formerly the biggest shareholder, sold its 20 per cent
stake last December at IPounds 10 per share before the share split.
The flotation price is expected to be between 250p and 300p, for a market
capitalisation of more than IPounds 200m.
Mr Flavin expected the company to be of interest to overseas investors
'wanting to take a view of the Irish market'. About 54 per cent of profits
arise in Ireland with 45 per per cent in the UK.
DCC's operations are concentrated in five divisions: food, energy, print and
publishing, computer products distribution and healthcare. Two thirds of
earnings are derived from the food and energy sectors and a further 19 per
cent from print and publishing.
Mr Flavin plans growth to come 'through organic growth and bolt-on
acquisitions'. Some IPounds 61m has been spent on acquisitions in the past
three years. The issue is to be underwritten by AIB Capital Markets and JO
Hambro Magan. UBS in London and Davy in Dublin have been appointed joint
stockbrokers.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: NatWest checks cut risk on large company
loan book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank's policy of stringent and lengthy credit checks on
large companies seems to have resulted in a loan portfolio which is much
less risky than that of other large UK banks, according to research
published yesterday.
A report compiled by BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays, based on
Dun &amp; Bradstreet data covering 2.2m companies, found that NatWest had a
significantly lower proportion of high risk lending than its peers.
Although NatWest had the highest percentage of high risk lending to small
companies, only 14 per cent of its loans to large companies involved high
risk companies compared with 35 per cent for other banks.
This means that 28 per cent of its overall lending is to companies falling
in the two most risky categories of five bands devised by Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
compared with about 38 per cent for each of the other big clearing banks.
The BZW research used a more detailed analysis of 41,400 borrowing companies
with Pounds 25.9bn in debt to conclude that NatWest's avoidance of credit
losses from large corporate failures in recent years was more than good
fortune.
It said a possible explanation was that it had resisted the trend towards
giving rapid decisions on loan proposals, retaining 'a relatively lengthy
credit assessment process'.
It added that the relatively high proportion of high risk lending to large
companies by the other big clearing banks indicated that they were relying
too heavily on the assumption that large company size was equivalent to low
risk.
However, BZW pointed out: 'Large corporate lending could be more risky than
is generally thought by bankers, and furthermore, it is unlikely that the
low margins on large corporate lending are approaching the levels required
to compensate for the risk.'
The report found that although there was an overall improvement in credit
quality among banks' loan portfolios in the second half of last year, their
books remained worse at the end of the year than at the end of 1992.
Among the large clearing banks, only NatWest had grown its share of the
lending market in the past two years. Barclays, Lloyds and Midland had all
lost share, while smaller regional banks had made significant gains.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Waste Management up 12% in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Waste Management International, the environmental services group, saw first
quarter pre-tax profits rise by 12.4 per cent to Pounds 38.7m, despite
northern Europe's slowness in recovering from recession.
Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said that volumes in northern Europe in
January and February had been below expectations, partly because of bad
weather, but that the group was 'roughly on target for the full year'.
Price increases in the UK, Italy, France and Latin America accounted for
nearly a fifth of the 16 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 256m (Pounds
220.9m).
The group's formidable rate of acquisition - 48 deals in 1993 - also pushed
up turnover by 9 percentage points. However WMI, which is the UK quoted arm
of WMX Technologies of the US, said that currency movements cut turnover by
some Pounds 11m.
Italy, one of last year's main disappointments, contributed less than 30 per
cent of turnover in the first quarter.
Cost cutting, particularly in the UK, allowed operating profits to rise by
22 per cent to Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 34.3m), but an increase in net interest
payable held back pre-tax profits.
Tax planning as well as a larger contribution from low-tax regions such as
Hong Kong pulled the rate down to 26.1 per cent (28.4 per cent).
WMI expects the tax rate for the full year to be bet-ween 26 per cent and 27
per cent.
Improvement at Hong Kong and UK acquisitions accounted for the sharp leap to
Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 1.8m) in payments to minority interests. That held the
rise in earnings per share to 6.4p (6.1p).
Mr Falkman said: 'we continue to look at making strategic acquisitions,
particularly in Germany and the UK. The weak economic conditions create good
acquisition opportunities'.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hickson chief's payments jump to Pounds
183,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dennis Kerrison, chief executive of Hickson International, saw his total
emoluments jump by 45 per cent from Pounds 126,000 to Pounds 183,000 last
year when the chemicals company's profits fell by 9 per cent to Pounds
22.1m.
The increase partly reflects his promotion in 1992 when he was a director of
the group for only nine months. On an annualised basis his salary rose by 15
per cent to Pounds 137,000.
He also received a performance-related bonus of Pounds 34,000 (Pounds 8,000)
linked to targets for profits, cashflow and 'personal objectives'. The
company said Mr Kerrison received no bonus triggered by profits and only a
minimal payment for cashflow. The bulk of the payment related to 'the way he
has developed and driven forward the business'.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: CentreGold up 24% at Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New product launches, higher US sales and the growing popularity of personal
computer software in CD-Rom format helped CentreGold, the computer games
publisher and distributor, offset margin pressures and turn in a 24 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits.
The group, which was floated in October, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.6m in the six months to January 31, up from Pounds 2.09m, on turnover
ahead by 43 per cent to Pounds 52.6m (Pounds 36.6m.)
Earnings per share increased to 4.7p (4.46p) and the initial interim
dividend is set at 0.8p. The shares, which were placed at 125p, slipped by
2p to close at 134p.
Mr Geoff Brown, chief executive, said the results were 'fairly pleasing'.
The company had countered margin pressures by achieving substantial
increases in turnover and market share.
Turnover from the software publishing business increased by 81 per cent to
Pounds 26.2m. Cartridge software sales more than doubled to Pounds 19.2m
(Pounds 8.5m), reflecting the launch of the group's first Nintendo product
and the growth of the US publishing business.
US publishing sales jumped to Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 2.7m) and overseas sales
now account for 34 per cent of turnover. In addition Mr Brown said sales of
higher margin PC-CD games had increased dramatically. These gains helped
offset lower margins on cartridge software sales in Europe, reflecting the
increased costs of producing higher specification cartridges which could not
be fully passed on to consumers. As a result operating profits from
publishing slipped to Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 1.45m).
In contrast, operating profits from software distribution grew to Pounds
1.18m (Pounds 646,000) on turnover increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 26.4m.
This reflected strong growth in sales to specialist retail chains and higher
export sales.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Lucas sets Simpson salary at Pounds 340,000

   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas Industries is paying Mr George Simpson, its new chief executive, an
annual salary of Pounds 340,000.
The figure is well below what the automotive and aerospace components group
was rumoured to have offered Mr Simpson, the former deputy chief executive
of British Aerospace and chairman of Rover Group, BAe's vehicles subsidiary.
Mr Simpson's basic salary is in line with the Pounds 355,000 which Sir
Anthony Gill earned last year while acting as both chairman and chief
executive. However, bonuses could boost Mr Simpson's annual salary to Pounds
400,000.
He has been granted options on just over 700,000 Lucas shares at 194p each,
which cannot be exercised for another three years.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible rises to Pounds 66m -
Strength shown in final quarter continues into current year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Crucible, the speciality materials group, reported an 8 per cent
increase to Pounds 66m in pre-tax profits for the year to January 4 after a
strong final quarter.
Mr Bruce Farmer, managing director, said that a 'very changeable' year had
ended on a high note with the trend continuing into the current period.
'Some improvements in demand are beginning to show through in the UK and
Australia and the worst of the recession on the Continent now appears to be
over.' Mr Farmer also hinted that a decision was close on the future of Holt
Lloyd, the car care chemicals subsidiary where profits almost doubled to
Pounds 7.7m (Pounds 4.1m) on sales of Pounds 99m.
'If it was sold the way I want it would not dilute earnings this year,' he
said.
The group, which generates 85 per cent of turnover outside the UK, increased
sales by 16 per cent to Pounds 793.3m (Pounds 684m). Excluding the impact of
exchange rate movements and acquisitions, the rise was 6 per cent with order
intake up 6.5 per cent.
Operating profits rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 81.1m (Pounds 70.7m),
showing underlying growth of just under 3 per cent. The interest bill jumped
to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 9.3m) but should fall this year.
Operating margins slipped to 10.2 per cent (10.3 per cent) but Mr Farmer
said that price increases were now sticking and predicted that margins could
recover to between 13 and 14 per cent in two to three years time.
All the group's four divisions reported higher profits including thermal
ceramics which, in spite of 'very difficult' conditions in continental
Europe during the first half, contributed Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 20.8m). The
carbon division, which made Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 15.6m), did not experience
the downturn on the Continent until the second half.
Earnings per share rose 7 per cent to 20p (18.7p) and the dividend is held
at 12.6p with a proposed final of 6.85p.
Operating cash flow nearly doubled to Pounds 112m and there was a net cash
inflow of Pounds 200,000 compared with an outflow of Pounds 55.6m in 1992.
COMMENT
Thanks to its international expansion Morgan Crucible has had a less
traumatic time in this recession than a decade ago and with 39 per cent of
its sales in the Americas and 9 per cent in east Asia it looks pretty
well-placed for the 1990s. It is already reaping the rewards in China, where
it got in ahead of the crowd, and is now planning a green field carbon plant
in Vietnam. Despite this continued investment it is finally generating cash
and with a sale of Holt Lloyd likely to raise more than Pounds 80m fears of
yet another rights issue have at last been laid to rest. The shares have
bubbled up in response, adding another 1p to 381p yesterday. They may settle
now given the premium rating of 17.5 on top of the range forecasts of Pounds
73m for this year.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Johnson Fry Pounds 12.5m in red after
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson Fry, the financial services and investment group, incurred a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 12.5m in 1993 due to the impact of asset sales and a radical
restructuring, but showed a sharp improvement in operating profits.
The company sold its LIT America business last July, resulting in a book
loss of Pounds 7.8m, and a Pounds 19.8m goodwill write-down.
Total exceptional losses amounted to Pounds 22.7m in 1993, obscuring
operating profits of Pounds 12.2m, which compared with Pounds 2.8m in 1992.
As a leading sponsor of business expansion schemes, Johnson Fry benefited
from the spurt of interest before such schemes were phased out at the end of
1993.
It raised Pounds 486m for the schemes last year, generating gross profit of
Pounds 15.8m, up from Pounds 6.6m. This income will not recur.
Last year was a watershed for the group, which had started 1993 as LIT
Holdings, the heavily indebted parent company of the lossmaking LIT America
business.
Following the Dollars 23.6m (Pounds 16.1m) sale of LIT America and the
radical capital reconstruction, it now has a profitable core business,
negligible long-term debt, and a market capitalisation increased from Pounds
3m to Pounds 45m.
Johnson Fry Property now has a Pounds 903m portfolio, resulting from BES
property schemes, and this will contribute management fees during the 5 year
lives of the funds. It contributed Pounds 2.24m (Pounds 982,000) in 1993.
The investment management side made Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 372,000). Fees
should rise this year, as it gets a full year contribution from its two
utilities investment trusts, and other new products.
The company will consider the resumption of dividends next year. Losses per
share in 1993 came to 103.1p (8.1p).
COMMENT
What a difference a year makes. Johnson Fry is now a cash rich company on
the look-out for opportunities to expand by acquisition, when a year earlier
it was a financial wreck. But last year's outcome gives little sense of
itsfinancial strength, not just because of the restructuring, but because of
BES. Brokers expect pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.5m in 1994, putting the
shares on a p/e of 11.5. A discount to the sector is justified, given the
lack of a meaningful track record, but after falling 5 per cent to 283p
yesterday, the shares offer speculative value.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Norcor planning flotation by June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norcor, a corrugated board maker based in Norwich, Norfolk, is planning to
float on the stock market by June. It hopes to raise sufficient new money to
repay Pounds 17.5m debt, while loan notes totalling a similar amount are
likely to be converted into equity.
Once floated, the group should be capitalised at between Pounds 35m and
Pounds 40m and be ungeared. However, Norcor, originally Norwich Corrugated,
plans to spend Pounds 5m to Pounds 6m on a complete rebuild of one of its
four machines over the next two years, which will require debt finance.
UBS, the sponsor to the issue, is also the parent of Phildrew Ventures, one
of Norcor's largest investors following a Pounds 36m management buy-out in
1989. Phildrew and other backers will retain their shareholdings in the
group.
Norcor is the second largest force in the 'sheet feeder' market, buying
paper, making corrugated board and selling it to box manufacturers.
Profits have been fairly static through the recession, with operating
profits of Pounds 3.85m in 1993, compared to Pounds 3.76m in 1990. But
interest charges have kept the group in losses over that period.
The MBO failed to meet profit targets and was refinanced in 1991, with a
Pounds 2.5m equity injection and debt rescheduled.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Low voids level helps LAIT rise to Pounds
1.52m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London &amp; Associated Investment Trust, the shopping centres group, announced
a 37 per cent in pre-tax profits for 1993. The company said the advance was
the result of managing the rent roll with a low level of voids.
On turnover of Pounds 3.92m (Pounds 3.56m) profits were Pounds 1.52m,
against Pounds 1.1m restated for FRS 3. Earnings per share were 1.48p (0.9p)
and the dividend is raised to 0.64p (0.58p) with a proposed final of 0.59p.
Net assets per share advanced from 39.1p to 48.6p, a rise of 24 per cent. A
revaluation at the period end resulted in a surplus of Pounds 5.6m.
Since the end of the year LAIT has acquired Dagenham's main shopping centre,
taking its number of shops to 580 and the value of its portfolio to Pounds

director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown Holdings paid compensation for loss of office of Pounds 265,000 to
Mr Simon Moffat when he resigned as finance director in April last year. The
amount was revealed in the group's annual report, published yesterday.
Mr Moffat had been recruited as finance director only the previous June, but
his appointment had 'not worked out as envisaged by either side', Hillsdown
said at the time.
The report also showed that Mr David Newton, chief executive, received a
total of Pounds 412,000 for 1993, compared with a salary of Pounds 262,000
in 1992 plus a bonus of Pounds 490,000 that year which related to his five
year stint in Canada.
Sir John Nott, chairman since April 30, received Pounds 124,000 during the
year plus pension contributions of Pounds 40,000.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Board claims countered in Regina dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Shiraz Malik-Noor, the major shareholder of Regina, who is pushing for
reinstatement on the board of the USM-quoted royal jelly company, has sent a
second letter to shareholders countering the accusations of the current
chairman.
Mr Malik-Noor is involved in a fight for control of Regina's board.
His opponents are Mr Paul Geoghegan, chairman, and Mr Tony Shakesby, finance
director. They have sent three letters urging shareholders to vote against
Mr Malik-Noor.
Mr Malik-Noor wrote that the decision to sponsor a costly US polo tournament
was made jointly with Mr Geoghegan and Mr Shakesby, who have criticised the
move as a waste of money. He also said that interest on loans to Regina by a
connected company was agreed in arms-length negotiations which did not
include himself.
The appointment of Mr Malik-Noor and two non-executive directors to the
board will be voted on at an extraordinary meeting on April 25.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Guinness offshoot chief receives Pounds
670,000 pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Crispin Davis, former managing director of United Distillers, the
Guinness spirits division, who resigned from the group in October by mutual
agreement, will receive cash and non-cash benefits worth Pounds 670,000 over
the two years to October 1995.
Details of the compensation package for loss of office are contained in the
Guinness group accounts. Under the terms of the agreement Mr Davis will
remain available for consultation by the company.
His departure, after little more than a year as head of UD, was said at the
time to be due to a personality clash with Mr Tony Greener, Guinness's
chairman and chief executive.
Mr Greener was the highest paid Guinness director in 1993, receiving Pounds
648,000 in total remuneration. Sir Anthony Tennant, his predecessor, was
paid Pounds 777,000 in 1992.

FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Harmony Property in Pounds 7m mixed
portfolio expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harmony Property yesterday signalled another stage in its transformation
from a pubs and restaurant company with the Pounds 7.05m acquisition of a
mixed commercial and retail portfolio.
The transaction, funded from cash reserves and modest borrowing, follows two
months of talks between with Mid-Century Trust, the privately-owned property
developer.
Mr Lewis Davis, Harmony's managing director, said the acquisition -
involving offices and retail outlets in Luton, north London and Southampton
 -would almost double the value of property assets to about Pounds 20m.
'We've sold a number of lossmaking pubs and we're now developing the
property side, that's where we have expertise,' he said.
A weak performance from the group's two hotels and 13 pubs, however, led to
pre-tax losses of Pounds 323,000 in the six months to September 26, against
a Pounds 344,000 deficit last time.
Turnover fell from Pounds 3.09m to Pounds 2.25m, although reduced interest
payments contained losses per share at 0.5p (0.95p).
Mr Davis said the group, which has not paid dividends for several years,
should be in a position to do so next year.
The shares were suspended on the USM yesterday pending a transfer to the
Official List.

FT  19 APR 94 / Discount stores cost more than bargained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A plan backed by Rewe, one of Germany's largest food retailers, to open
discount stores in the south-east of England has proved more expensive than
anticipated.
Rewe has a 29 per cent stake in Budgens, the small UK retailing chain which
yesterday said the conversion of nine of its stores to Rewe's Penny Market
format had exceeded costings.
Shares in the UK group fell by 5p to 29p after it warned trading profits
from the 89 stores operating the traditional format were likely to be 15 per
cent lower than in the previous year.
However, Mr Christian Williams, executive director of Budgens, said the
group was sticking by its plans to open 40 discount food stores in the
south-east over the next two years.
Budgens said it had originally estimated the nine stores could be converted
for about Pounds 600,000. As well as higher initial development costs, these
stores experienced a decline of their customer base until a new regular
discount store clientele could be attracted, which had now been achieved.
The transition period was expected to incur additional losses of Pounds 1m
for the financial year to May 1.
Mr Williams was still confident about prospects for the Penny Market
concept, which is based on the private German group's chain of 1,800
discount stores. The new outlets stock between 1,200 and 1,300 lines - fewer
than the average Budgens store, which has 6,000 to 7,000.
Mr Williams said: 'Discount stores have done well in the north of England
and the Midlands, so there seems no reason why they should not succeed in
the south-east.'
Budgens said its year-on-year sales were down, reflecting the 3 per cent
deflation in prices being experienced by the group. It was trading
resiliently despite the opening of competing stores and aggressive rivalry
on price.
The group also said it had made a disposal profit of more than Pounds 1.6m
on the sale and leaseback of a secondary warehouse beside its main depot in
Wellingborough, Northants.
Last year Rewe underwrote a Pounds 30m loan stock issue by Budgens, which
will be used to expand the Penny Market chain. Rewe has an option to raise
its stake in the UK company to 47 per cent in September next year, which
would require it to launch a full bid.

FT  19 APR 94 / When people prove to be a costly liability: Tracy Corrigan
and Patrick Harverson explain the dangers highlighted by the Kidder affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment banks, particularly those with a strong bias towards trading, are
often fond of saying that their greatest assets are their people. The
Dollars 350m (Pounds 237m) pre-tax charge taken by Kidder Peabody in the
first quarter, as a result of a phantom trading scheme devised by its head
government bond trader, demonstrates that people can also be a liability.
Risk management has become a buzz word among financial institutions, many of
which now have global heads of risk management or risk control.
Sometimes, the human factor may be all but forgotten, as highly
sophisticated systems are set up to deal with the complex financial
instruments which increasingly dominate trading activities. 'Fundamentally,
banks are most exposed to their people,' said one treasury consultant. 'You
can invest a lot of money in computers and software but you also have to
find some degree of deterence: that is achieved if people know they will be
regularly audited.'
Traders at other Wall Street firms were puzzled as to how Mr Joseph Jett,
managing director in charge of Kidder's government bond trading desk, was
able to fake profits without being caught by the firm's internal accounting
procedures. 'We get our P&amp;L (profit and loss statement) from a separate
department, so there are checks and balances,' said one trader at a
prominent investment bank.
Yet, senior Wall Street executives point out that if an experienced
professional running a complex and fast-moving securities trading desk wants
to mislead the firm about his activities, it is not easy to stop him. As Mr
Michael Carpenter, Kidder's chief executive, told reporters: 'When somebody
is trying to obfuscate the systems for a deliberate purpose, it's hard to
always be protected against these things.'
Kidder is not alone on Wall Street in having suffered at the hands of a
'rogue' trader. Three years ago, Salomon Brothers had to pay hundreds of
millions of dollars in fines and compensation after the head of its bond
trading desk was found to have faked customer bids in auctions of Treasury
securities.
The main dangers for a bank are that a trader may try to book false
transactions or use inflated valuations for genuine trades - either to
inflate profits or to try to cover up losses.
To guard against phantom trades, banks should have 'an independent
confirmation function, where the back office (which settles trades) has a
system of obtaining direct confirmation with the purported counterparty',
says Mr John Hitchins, a partner in the capital markets group at Price
Waterhouse. This is standard practice in the foreign exchange market, as
most big banks automatically confirm through Swift.
To stop dealers from fiddling valuations, the back office also needs to have
independent ability to value positions. This involves taking prices from
external feeds and having their own models for calculating positions.
In an attempt to bridge the growing gap between back office and increasingly
complex trading activities, some banks have created a new function which
they call the 'middle office'.
'They have an appreciation of the markets but also come from an accounting
culture,' explains Mr John Tiner, head of financial markets at Arthur
Andersen in London. 'Their job is often to recalculate the daily
marking-to-market in order to compare traders' records and accounting
records.' Kidder admitted that it did not have such a function.
According to consultants and senior bankers, the separation of front and
back office is virtually universal. The result is that 'it is almost
impossible for fraud to be conducted by one individual', said one
consultant. 'If you have a fake trade you need to have a fake settlement.
Otherwise, the scam should show up pretty quickly. The problem occurs where
you have collusion, particularly between front and back office.'
Another consultant described it as folly to underestimate the ingenuity of
people who want to defraud, once they have been working on a particular
system. He pointed out that traders, who are trained to look out for and
exploit the inefficiencies of markets, may take the same approach towards
the systems designed to check them.
It does seem that in the case of Mr Jett, who earned Dollars 9m last year,
the risk/reward ratio so dear to traders was just not there.
But perhaps banks should brace themselves for further attempts. After
earning record bonuses last year, many traders will face massive falls in
earnings in this year's bear market conditions.

FT  19 APR 94 / Prosecutor raps Deutsche Bank over Schneider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Frankfurt prosecutors' office yesterday criticised Deutsche Bank,
biggest creditor to the collapsed Schneider property group, for holding back
information.
Mr Job Tilmann, a senior prosecutor, said his office was 'surprised and
displeased' by the way Deutsche bank had withheld important facts when the
bank launched its fraud claim against the missing Mr Jurgen Schneider, who
built up the group.
Mr Tilmann said that when Deutsche lodged its claim last week, alleging that
Mr Schneider had made a fraudulent loan application to finance a shopping
centre in Frankfurt, the bank had not mentioned that it had known about Mr
Schneider's disappearance on April 7 - four days before the group's problems
were made public.
The bank had also kept silent about access it had to documents at the
property group's Konigstein headquarters, Mr Tilmann told the Financial
Times.
He described the bank's silence as 'idiosyncratic'. The implication,
strenuously denied by Deutsche, is that the delay may have impeded the city
prosecutors' case against Mr Schneider.
Deutsche said that when it filed its suit against Schneider it offered to
participate in talks with the prosecutors' office.
Separately Mr Otto Lambsdorff, economics spokesman for the Free Democratic
Party, junior partner in the ruling coalition, said in a radio interview
yesterday that the affair was a 'huge disgrace for German banks', with
dangerous repercussions for the recovery in eastern Germany. It presented
the market economy in the wrong light.
'Anyone who makes it that easy to pull off a fraud cannot talk his way out
of the situation by saying that he was made a victim of fraud,' Mr
Lambsdorff said.
Deutsche Bank yesterday rounded on its critics, explaining how it had
reacted after a board member received a letter from Mr Schneider on April 7
asking for further credits and saying that on medical advice he had gone to
an unknown destination.
'Until this point there were no considerable payment delays (in respect of
Schneider) within the Deutsche Bank group,' the bank said. 'It was only then
that it became clear that the group was in acute financial difficulties.'
The bank said that in the following days it talked to officials at Jurgen
Schneider AG, discovering evidence which gave rise to the suspicion of
fraud. The loan application was refused and it was only on the evening of
Sunday April 10 that suspicion hardened that Mr Schneider had taken flight.
The next day the group's problems were made public.
Deutsche said that it was owed DM1.2bn in respect of eight of the group's 85
property developments in Germany. It insisted it had been gradually reducing
its lending to Schneider and that its loans were well secured by mortgages
against individual properties. Schneider collapsed with debts of more than
DM5bn.
The city prosecutor said it was in talks with the Federal Criminal Office
over the extent to which police should be brought in to track down Mr
Schneider.

FT  19 APR 94 / BAT seeks bigger stake in Indian arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance group, is considering raising its
stake in ITC, its Indian affiliate, in a move which has raised protests at
ITC. BAT has also proposed focusing ITC's activities around BAT's own core
areas of tobacco and financial services.
The plans could provoke controversy in India, where multi-national groups
are often still viewed with suspicion. ITC, which is one of India's largest
companies with a market value of about Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1.98bn), has
interests in hotels, paper and edible oils as well as tobacco and financial
services.
Mr Seroze Vevaina, ITC's deputy chairman, said yesterday that discussions
between BAT and ITC were at a delicate stage. A senior ITC executive said:
'If our big shareholder came and said we want you to be a little tobacco
company now, that would deflate morale here.'
BAT, which has a 31.5 per cent stake in ITC and nominates two directors to
the 13-member board, exercised little control until the present Indian
government liberalised foreign investment rules in 1991. Companies which
have recently re-established control under the new regime include Cadbury of
the UK and Colgate Palmolive of the US.
Mr Vevaina said: 'BAT are interested in raising their stake. And they are
interested in tobacco and financial services. What we need is a modus
vivendi where we can help them grow their interests, and grow away from them
in areas where they have less interest.'
BAT said yesterday it was 'not dogmatic' about being restricted to tobacco
and financial services. 'We wouldn't want to be forced sellers of some very
fine businesses,' it said. 'But if we had a higher shareholding, the board
would take a lot of convincing that we should make further investments
outside those areas.' The companies are working on plans which would allow
BAT to take substantial stakes in ITC's tobacco and financial services
without having to invest in the hotels and other businesses. This could
involve splitting ITC.
The Indian government is not expected to object to such restructuring, but
will keep a close eye on the price at which BAT increases its stake. Several
foreign groups have bought shares in affiliates at discounts of up to 90 per
cent of stock market prices, prompting claims of unfair practices.
BAT refused to comment on whether it wanted to raise its stake. However, it
said: 'If we were to decide to raise our stake we would follow local
regulations and guidelines.' Noting that price-earnings ratios on the Indian
stock exchange were high, the company said: 'We would only increase our
stake if it could be done in the interests of our own shareholders.'

FT  19 APR 94 / Storehouse falls on news of Mothercare departure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Storehouse, the retail group, saw its shares fall 11p to 218p yesterday
after it announced that Mothercare chief executive Ms Ann Iverson was
leaving to join Melville, one of the largest diversified retailers in the
US.
The resignation of Ms Iverson, who developed a 'fun' store concept including
talking trees and singing clocks to revitalise Mothercare, is a blow for
Storehouse, which also owns the BHS clothing chain. It comes little more
than a year after the departure of Mr David Dworkin, the American chief
executive credited with turning the group around, who recruited Ms Iverson
from the US.
Mr Dworkin quit in February 1993 to become chief executive of Carter Hawley
Hale, the US department store group - shortly after receiving a Pounds 2.7m
bonus.
The City regarded Ms Iverson as a source of stability who would continue Mr
Dworkin's work. But the offer to become president and chief executive of
Kay-Bee, Melville's toys division with 1,200 stores and annual turnover of
more than Dollars 1bn, proved too attractive. 'We tried hard to keep her,'
Storehouse said. 'We were hoping she would stay at least another year.'
News of Ms Iverson's departure comes only days after the resignation of Mr
Jim Maxmin, the American chief executive of Laura Ashley, the clothing and
furnishings group, after disagreement over investment levels.
Storehouse said Ms Iverson's decision did not result from any disagreement
with its new chief Mr Keith Edelman. She had received an attractive offer
and was keen to return to the US to be closer to her two children.
Ms Iverson was stores director at BHS before becoming Mothercare chief
executive in June 1992 and a Storehouse director in February 1993. She
earned Pounds 265,000 a year plus bonuses.
She helped Mothercare turn a Pounds 4m loss into profits of Pounds 5m last
year, on sales of Pounds 258m. Ms Iverson refocused its strategy,
concentrating on the twin markets of mother-and-baby products and children's
clothing, and developed the store design to provide an attractive
environment for young children.
'There is a blueprint in place now,' one analyst said. 'If she had gone a
year ago it would have been disastrous, but there is tangibly a recovery
story at Mothercare.'
Ms Iverson's departure will focus attention on management stability at
Storehouse. In addition to the departures of Mr Dworkin and Ms Iverson,
Storehouse has had three finance directors since 1990.

FT  19 APR 94 / Company car VAT challenge may cost state Pounds 15bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government could face a bill of up to Pounds 15bn for repayment of
value added tax which it is alleged to have collected illegally in
connection with the purchase of company cars since 1978.
Several UK clearing banks, led by Barclays, have lodged appeals with the VAT
tribunal claiming that a Customs and Excise 'blocking order', which prevents
UK businesses reclaiming VAT paid on the purchase of cars for business use,
is incompatible with European law.
The banks have also complained to the European Commission which has given
the UK government until June to respond to allegations that it has failed to
implement the European Sixth VAT Directive properly.
The government could be taken to the European Court in Luxembourg.
Preventing VAT-registered businesses from reclaiming tax paid on cars
results in consumers paying extra on their products, the banks say. This
represents an element of double taxation.
Car leasing companies are particularly badly hit. They say the order
artificially inflates the cost of car leasing and puts them at a
disadvantage compared with the rest of Europe.
The banks, on behalf of their car leasing subsidiaries, want repayment of
VAT from 1978 when the Sixth Directive came into effect in the UK.
By the end of last month 37 companies had lodged claims involving amounts
totalling up to Pounds 1bn. The appeals are due to be heard in the autumn
but lawyers expect the tribunal to refer the issue to the European Court.
Customs has calculated that if the VAT order is declared illegal, the
government could have to pay Pounds 6bn to the car leasing companies alone.
It said last night that efforts were continuing to negotiate a settlement
with the car leasing industry. If the government has to repay all UK
companies which bought cars for business use since 1978, the total bill
could be Pounds 15bn, it says.
It is believed to favour replacing the blocking order with a VAT sliding
scale charge to be paid by companies on the private use of company cars.

FT  19 APR 94 / Japanese trade surplus with Asia overtakes US figure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's trade surplus with Asia surpassed that with the US for the first
time during the financial year that ended last month, according to the
Japanese finance ministry.
The figures demonstrate the rapid shifts in trading patterns among
high-growth countries of east Asia, and provide ammunition for governments
in the region that have become increasingly concerned at Japan's trade
surpluses.
The surplus with China, South Korea and the Association of South East Asian
Nations (Asean) during the 12 months to March 31 expanded 25.1 per cent last
year to Dollars 55.95bn (Pounds 38.3bn), while Japan's surplus with the US
was Dollars 51.14bn, up 11.8 per cent.
Finance ministry officials said the 12.2 per cent depreciation of the dollar
over the year was partly to blame, as the overall surplus during the
financial year fell 4.7 per cent to Y13,180bn, the first fall for three
years. However, in dollar terms, the surplus rose 10 per cent to a record
Dollars 122bn. Japan's trade surplus with Asia is being driven by a sharp
rise in consumer spending and capital investment in the area, and by the
building of Japanese plants to assemble products from components
manufactured in Japan.
Meanwhile, Japan's trade surplus with the US rose 20.8 per cent during March
to reach Dollars 4.96bn, raising the possibility of further pressure from
Washington for market-opening measures. The overall surplus for the month
reached a record Dollars 13.95bn, an increase of 4.2 per cent on a year
earlier.
The surplus with the US during March expanded on a 12.6 per cent increase in
Japanese exports to Dollars 10.6bn, reflecting stronger demand from the US
economy. However, imports rose only 6.1 per cent, as domestic demand
remained weak in Japan.
The latest data are a disappointment for Tokyo since they follow a 0.9 per
cent fall in the trade surplus with the US during February compared with the
same month in 1993. But Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, and tipped to
become the next premier, said existing trade policies would be maintained.
'Japan needs to tell the world that there will be no change in policy, and
that includes protecting free trade,' Mr Hata said.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, warned that Washington would
continue to insist on Japan opening its markets.

FT  19 APR 94 / Solution to S Africa's election stalemate near: Chief
Buthelezi's Inkatha may take part in poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A breakthrough in South Africa's political crisis that would encourage Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu leader, to participate in next week's
all-race elections appeared suddenly within reach last night.
After a day of talks with President FW de Klerk and African National
Congress officials in Pretoria, Chief Buthelezi said he was confident of
positive results when the talks resume today.
It is understood that the proposed deal would involve the recall of the old
white-dominated parliament to entrench the powers, largely symbolic and
ceremonial, of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini in the interim constitution.
Neither the South African government nor the ANC appear to have conceded
ground in the fundamental issue that has led to the stalemate - Chief
Buthelezi's demand for what amounted to autonomous status for the Natal
province which includes his KwaZulu 'homeland'. Election officials were last
night investigating the possibility of a last-minute amendment to ballot
papers that would allow the inclusion of Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom
party. Should that not be possible, the agreement might be in jeopardy,
officials warned.
Asked whether Inkatha would participate in the poll, Chief Buthelezi said
that it was possible but noted that there would be practical difficulties,
including the fact that his party would have only a few days in which to
campaign. He added that he saw little likelihood of the election being
delayed.
Any deal would allow political violence to abate. In March nearly 300 died
in the Natal province and more than 240 lives have been lost there this
month alone.
Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, will join Chief Buthelezi and Mr de Klerk
at a summit in Pretoria this morning which officials hope will produce
endorsement of a deal understood to have been agreed in principle yesterday.
The deal has been endorsed by Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary-general,
and Mr Joe Slovo, the South African Communist party chairman who is also one
of the most influential figures in the ANC. Both participated in yesterday's
session.
Those close to the talks said that Chief Buthelezi demonstrated much greater
willingness for a settlement.
Apparently crucial in yesterday's initiative was the involvement of Prof
Washington Okunu, a Kenyan member of the team of international mediators
that arrived last week.
The financial rand, the main indicator of foreign investor sentiment,
strengthened on renewed hopes for a settlement, finishing in London 5 cents
higher at R5.345 to the dollar.

FT  19 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Waste Management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Waste Management International has been steadily de-rated since
international investors were offered stock in 1992. Following yesterday's
slide - in response to mildly disappointing first-quarter figures - the
shares stand on a multiple of 20 times 1993 earnings. The historic multiple
at flotation was over 30 times. Recession in Europe is to blame for the
pedestrian progress since then. The question is whether WMI is now cheap
enough to tempt the UK investment institutions which shunned the original
offer.
The company has fared better in recession than most of its peers. If it can
prove that yesterday's figures were indeed the result of fluke weather and
currency movements, the rating looks fair. Gearing of around 200 per cent
following last year's acquisition binge is a reason for caution. Under US
accounting principles gearing looks less threatening. But if WMI alights on
a substantial acquisition, it might still take the opportunity to raise
fresh equity.
Besides, the fall from grace of WMX Technologies, the US parent which owns a
controlling interest, has been far more severe than that of its
international offspring. An equity issue through WMI might look like
relatively cheap funding in the context of the wider group. If the free
float of shares was increased in the process, WMI could also find a place in
the FT-SE 100 index. UK fund managers might then sit up and take note.

FT  19 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Oil shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The oil share bulls are in the ascendant. The big UK integrated houses,
Shell and BP, have each outperformed the market by nearly 10 per cent this
month. Although both fell yesterday, that was only in line with the market's
overall decline. The immediate cause is the rise in crude prices, up from
Dollars 13.50 at the end of March to over Dollars 15 now. OPEC's failure to
cut production quotas, which prompted the earlier dive in oil prices, does
not look so bad on reflection. Given that most cartel members are operating
at near full capacity, there is less scope for cheating than in the past.
Meanwhile, economic recovery in much of the industrialised world is fuelling
demand. It has also helped boost petrochemical prices and refining margins.
But the oil price is not the only factor driving shares in the longer term.
Determined moves to cut costs and redeploy assets have played an important
part. This has been most apparent at BP, whose need to put its house in
order was greater than Shell's. Its management is no longer content to rely
on higher crude prices to deliver its profit targets. Shell's incentive to
restructure is not so pressing. But with its massive investment programme
and a return on capital still below the best of its US peers, it too needs
to deliver productivity growth.
Oil prices could still spring some nasty surprises. The main risks are that
news of breaches in OPEC ceilings or of increased stockbuilding will provoke
wobbles. But medium-term prospects look good.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Storehouse's chairman had some choice criticisms to make when Mr David
Dworkin resigned as chief executive after just six months in the job. Sadly,
his strictures appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Storehouse's revolving
door continues to whirl around with Ms Ann Iverson, chief executive of
Mothercare, being the latest to whoosh out. She, at least, will have had the
tenacity to do her job for two years. But her departure makes a mockery of
the company's watchword of stability and knocked 5 per cent off the shares.
That may seem excessive. Ms Iverson's team has done well to turn round
Mothercare and the chain appears to have acquired considerable trading
momentum. Its new store format is being successfully developed. The chain is
recording some of the strongest sales figures on the high street. The scope
for margin recovery is clear: last year, Mothercare accounted for 27 per
cent of group sales but just 10 per cent of profits.
Even so, the market is understandably averse to companies which have such a
dismal record of retaining staff. The remaining executive directors boast
less than three years' board experience between them. That is alarming when
consistency is such a vital ingredient of retailing success. Storehouse
suggests that while Ms Iverson's loss is disappointing, it will be no great
blow to Mothercare's recovery. If so, one wonders why Storehouse feels it
necessary to reward its directors so lavishly.

FT  19 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Greenspan's grip
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprising aspect to yesterday's Federal Reserve tightening was not so
much that rates moved up again. Rather it was the timing. Since the latest
data on capacity use, inflation and employment did not suggest any immediate
urgency, the markets cannot look to economic indicators for any short-run
indication of the Fed's intentions. Instead, the Fed simply appears to be
moving quickly to the neutral stance for which Mr Alan Greenspan originally
said he was aiming.
Further rises in the federal funds rate therefore loom, probably accompanied
next time by a discount rate tightening as well. But the markets cannot
predict when. Nor do they yet know exactly what constitutes a neutral
stance. The best guess is that it means a federal funds rate of over 4 per
cent and probably closer to 5. The uncertainty is a burden for equity and
bond markets alike even though there is no particular reason for the latter
to worry. A long bond yield of nearly 7.5 per cent amply discounts a federal
funds rate of 5 per cent. The equity market must worry that higher interest
rates will both slow down the recovery and cause the flow of mutual fund
money to dry up.
That liquidity concern extends to international markets too. On the basis of
yesterday's performance, European bond markets have signally failed to
decouple from the US trend. They are unlikely to do so as long as exchange
markets expect that rising US interest rates will eventually push the dollar
higher. Ironically, yesterday's Fed action left the dollar virtually
unmoved. Perhaps markets everywhere would calm down sooner if the Fed moved
in bigger stages. This is one occasion where it is better to arrive than to
travel fearfully.

FT  19 APR 94 / Leading Article: Fed up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Much ink will be spilled in the attempt to rationalise the US Federal
Reserve's decision to signal a third successive increase in short-term
interest rates in less than two months; and much of the spillage will be in
vain. Not even Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan can fine tune monetary policy
on a month-to-month basis in response to the latest data on the economy -
least of all when the first quarter has been subject to freakish weather
conditions and a Californian earthquake. What is clear is that the Fed is
seeking to shift monetary policy to a more neutral stance as quickly as it
can manage without destabilising markets further. The question is still what
constitutes neutrality.
The Fed's concern is with the real federal funds rate after allowing for
inflation. On most reckonings, this was around zero before the first nominal
rate increase in February. Since 1979, the real federal funds rate has
averaged some 3 3/4 per cent. Yet to take as a yardstick a period in which
successive Fed chairmen were seeking to squeeze inflation out of the system
after the shocks of the 1970s would be perverse, in the present less
inflationary climate.
Moreover, past comparisons are dangerously misleading in another sense. The
shape and composition of the balance sheet of the personal sector has
changed dramatically as a result of demographic change and the debt build-up
of the 1980s. The elderly and the rich, who borrow little, now account for a
larger share of the population's total income, so the debt servicing burden
is falling on a narrower proportion of the population's income. At the same
time, the increasing share of tax privileged forms of investment in
household assets means that savings are less liquid and that the less rich
and the less old have a smaller margin of safety in their financial
arrangements.
These structural changes may not be having a significant short-run effect on
the economic growth rate, which remains exceptionally robust. But they do
suggest that consumers may be more sensitive to any given change in interest
rates than in previous economic cycles. Against the background of a run down
in the household savings rate to 4 per cent or less, and the possibility
that inflation may be more subdued than the bond market assumes, this might
point to a relatively cautious Fed view of what constitutes a neutral policy
stance in today's circumstances - a federal funds rate nearer 4 1/2, say,
than 5 per cent. But it also underlines the inherent problems in reading the
US economy. US short rates still have further to rise. The longer-run
question is whether a tougher than neutral stance will be needed.

FT  19 APR 94 / Idealism gives way to disenchantment: Humiliating failures
in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda have undermined the role of the UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely can an empire have risen or declined so rapidly. The number of
soldiers wearing the blue helmets of the United Nations has soared over the
past four years from 10,000 to 70,000. The number of man-hours devoted to UN
matters by generals and politicians in the world's leading powers has
ballooned: woe betide the ambitious diplomat who cannot master its baffling
acronyms.
But the fall of Gorazde, the so-called safe haven for Moslems in eastern
Bosnia, should quash any remaining temptation to regard the gaunt skyscraper
on New York's East River as headquarters of a world government in embryo.
It seems a long time since mid-1992 when Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, sought to raise the body's profile with his ideas for
preventing civil wars, cross-border conflict and humanitarian disasters.
In Bosnia, at least, the UN now faces the worst of all possible worlds. It
has unleashed its most powerful weapon - air strikes - against the Serbs,
and failed to achieve either the protection of its own personnel or the
preservation of the haven. The UN is thus neither an effective belligerent
nor a credible honest broker. Even its role as a distributor of aid has been
compromised. In recent days the UN has experienced another setback, where
the human consequences are worse and the failure more complete: the orgy of
blood-letting in Rwanda, where Belgium, the linchpin of a peacekeeping
effort, is scrambling to pull out.
The organisation's bureaucrats and soldiers may justifiably argue that
neither failure was their fault - they were given inadequate resources and
incoherent mandates. But that will not stop blame accruing to the UN and its
secretary-general. Just as the UN may once have been a convenient vehicle
for the strategic ambitions of member states, it will now serve as a
convenient scapegoat for their failures.
Mr Boutros Ghali, already a bete noire among the Serbs and their traditional
allies in Russia for ordering air strikes, now faces calls for his
resignation from Moslem countries because the strikes patently did not work.
His humiliation in Bosnia is not so much a turning point as a landmark in a
process that began last autumn with a precipitous decline in the UN's
popularity in the US, which remains the principal pay-master and was the
main architect of its rise in status.
Mr Bill Clinton once gushed with enthusiasm for the UN. As a US presidential
candidate, he backed the idea of a standing 'rapid deployment force' whose
brief showed a touching faith in the solubility of conflict. It would guard
borders, prevent atrocities against civilians, distribute aid and deter
terrorism.
The onset of disenchantment is not hard to pinpoint. It began last August,
when the first US soldiers were killed in Somalia, and it became total on
October 3, when 18 Americans died in Mogadishu.
The UN fell even further out of fashion when the US ships dispatched to
Haiti a few days later, with a UN mandate to restore democracy, failed even
to land. Knocking the UN, and pledging that US soldiers should never be
subordinated to the incompetent foreigners, was an irresistible temptation
for US politicians. Squabbling over the US role in the UN has led to long
delays in the publication, now expected this week, of a presidential
directive on the deployment of troops abroad.
The degeneration of the UN's relief effort in Somalia into an ugly shooting
war was not the first disaster. But Mogadishu was the first televised
fiasco. According to Dr Mats Berdal, a Norwegian political scientist and
authority on peace-keeping, the loss of nerve in Somalia shows that 'US
policy is flawed by swings between idealism and overhasty disappointment'.
Europeans have often discerned the same contradiction in US policy towards
Bosnia as they saw in Somalia - the same yearning for solutions that are
both effective and risk-free. Air strikes, when combined with the enticing
word surgical, seemed to offer that combination: they would punish
wrongdoers and bring instant results without risking American lives.
As experience has shown, this was a false hope. Few people understand that
better than General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia. He is
well-qualified to discern theoretical flaws in the UN operation: a
disastrous muddle over vocabulary. In his previous role as commandant of the
British Army Staff College, he sponsored a revival of research into the
theory of peacekeeping. He insisted on the distinction between
peace-broking, peacekeeping (guarding a peace to which all parties have
agreed) and enforcing peace against the will of some of the parties.
The UN - or its leading members - failed to observe that distinction when
they drew up the mandate for the former Yugoslavia and allocated money and
personnel. To impose peace against the will of any party, the UN would have
needed far more firepower on the ground that members were prepared to
commit. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, openly expressed his
frustration in New York last week. He described as 'difficult to understand'
the US refusal to finance - let alone staff - an increased ground force in
Bosnia. 'We must not put ourselves in the situation where we lack the tools
to carry out the job,' he said.
Ironically, the outbreak of recrimination over UN failure has come as the
much-maligned bureaucracy in New York is finally becoming streamlined. The
Department for Peace-Keeping Operations has, under the galvanising effect of
the Bosnian crisis, started to work more effectively. Gone are the days when
UN commanders in Bosnia would complain that nobody in New York worked
weekends. Insiders say the department has become better at the things it can
realistically do - gathering information, planning for future requirements,
exercising broad control over finance and personnel - and better at
delegating to commanders in the field the operational control that it cannot
realistically exercise.
It would be ironic if these improvements - initiated during Mr Clinton's
early period of US enthusiasm for the UN - were now wasted because of a
politically inspired witch-hunt. The president's love affair with the
organisation began in the immediate aftermath of the cold war, when it was
tempting to believe that all world problems could be jointly managed by the
west and a compliant Russia.
The fact that Russia has now broken ranks with the west over Bosnia - by
denouncing the air strikes against the Serbs - probably sets the seal on
that period of optimism.
Now Russia is trying to do what the US, in a sense, failed to do - turn the
UN into an instrument of its own policies. It is pressing hard for the UN's
blessing, and above all for UN finance, for the maintenance of Russian
forces in the unstable southern republics of the CIS. Here again, it will be
essential to bear in mind the distinctions on which Gen Rose insists if the
UN wants to avoid fresh blows to its credibility.
The Russian word for peacekeeping - mirotvorcheski - means making peace,
establishing peace in a situation where none exists. And Moscow's approaches
to the establishment of peace have not, in practice, been hemmed by any of
the squeamishness about taking sides, or taking casualties, or observing
legal niceties.
Western diplomats at the UN are thinking hard about the terms on which they
could give the organisation's blessing to a mainly Russian peacekeeping
operation in the Black Sea war zone of Abkhazia, where Georgian government
forces were routed last summer.
Having approved a UN resolution that made possible the western air strikes
against the Serbs, Russia will from now on be more careful about how it uses
its vote in the Security Council: it will not permit any more ambiguous
mandates. The US, UK and France will in turn be more careful about giving
carte blanche to Russia.
That could mean a partial return to the cold war days when east and west
continually vetoed one another's resolutions - and place further obstacles
in the path of the blue helmets.

FT  19 APR 94 / Leading Article: Brands on the run
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A year after the startling decision by Philip Morris to cut the US price of
Marlboro cigarettes, this response to collapsing sales looks much more than
an isolated incident. Makers of most other branded consumer goods, from food
to toiletries, are finding that consumers are increasingly reluctant to pay
premium prices for their products.
The latest evidence of the manufacturers' discomfort is their campaign to
amend the UK trademarks bill, which received its Commons second reading
yesterday, so as to prohibit retailers from selling 'copycat' own-label
versions of their brands. The manufacturers' concern is understandable,
given the increasing success of keenly priced own-label ranges. However,
such a ban would probably offer only a temporary palliative. Nor will
economic recovery automatically reverse the industry's recent misfortunes.
The surge in consumer spending which inflated branded manufacturers' profits
and spurred a takeover frenzy in the late 1980s blinded them to fundamental
shifts in their industry. What today seems a golden age was actually the
swan song of outdated business methods.
Many companies are still struggling to escape from an industrial time warp.
As some admit, their priorities have been dictated too much by the need to
keep costly mass-production lines busy and not enough by market demand.
Their much-vaunted marketing departments have often become inward-looking
bureaucracies, cut off from the real world. Innovation and consumer
responsiveness have suffered as a result.
Many western industries, such as US car manufacturers, have grappled with
similar problems since the early 1980s. Consumer goods producers have
avoided them until recently for two reasons. One is the increasingly
oligopolistic structure of their markets, in many of which no more than
three suppliers can survive profitably. The other is the lack of effective
competition from Japanese and other Asian manufacturers, few of which have
so far ventured onto international markets.
But recession and the steadily growing power of supermarket chains have
changed all that. This is especially true in the UK, where centralised
buying and distribution have enabled supermarkets to drive increasingly hard
bargains. Furthermore, their electronic sales information systems provide
detailed marketing data long before it is available to manufacturers. As a
consequence, a traditional contest between customers and suppliers has
become a battle between their different brands.
It is little consolation to manufacturers that not every supermarket has
made the formula work, nor that they can still dominate unsophisticated
retailers in the emerging economies where sales are growing fastest. Modern
retailing technology moves quickly across borders, while the profits
available from own-label ranges will encourage supermarkets to keep
experimenting with them.
Many manufacturers have sought to restore battered margins by cutting costs.
Some are re-organising their marketing. However, their brands will once
again command historic price premiums only if they are backed by products
which are genuinely novel, distinctive and of superior quality. In an era
when technology and innovation are easily appropriated by competitors, that
requires unrelenting effort and constant corporate renewal. But companies
which shrink from the commitment will doom their brands to extinction.

The governor of the Bank of France enjoys monetary policy autonomy, but his
freedom of manoeuvre is painfully narrow. Since the central bank was allowed
to set interest rates independently of the government at the end of last
year, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet and his colleagues have reduced cuts in
short-term French rates to a trickle. The constraints were underlined by
yesterday's decision to keep the bank's money market intervention rate
unchanged, in spite of Thursday's  1/4 point reduction in the Bundesbank's
interest rates.
As a reward for caution, the bank can point to a partial decoupling of
French capital market yields from those in the US. After yesterday's Federal
Reserve tightening, cuts in short-term European interest rates may however
peter out before too long. That would leave French monetary policy at the
mercy of potentially adverse interest rate moves in the US and Germany at a
time of possible strain within Mr Edouard Balladur's government in advance
of the May 1995 presidential elections.
The Bank of France argues that the present mix of short- and long-term
interest rates is the best available in the unfavourable international
circumstances. In view of the importance of long-term interest rates for
French housing finance, there is a more pressing need than in Britain to
maintain low bond rates. However, long-term French yields, although up by
less than in the US, have risen by nearly 1.2 points since late 1993. With
French inflation down to only 1.5 per cent, real interest rates, long- and
short-term, are far too high to support self-sustaining recovery.
One reason for Bank of France prudence lies in the build-up of FFr1,200bn in
non-resident holdings of franc-denominated securities. Any attempt to cut
rates faster than the Bundesbank, it fears, could provoke a bond market
sell-off. However, the Balladur government's fiscal measures to counter 12.5
per cent unemployment are already adding to bond market worries about the
rising structural budget deficit. Long-term fiscal disarray will spell the
end to France's dreams of European monetary union. Yet the longer sluggish
French growth lasts, the more unpalatable will be the measures needed to
reduce the budget deficit to the Maastricht target of 3 per cent of GDP.
France's best hope is that it will be able to follow more inch-by-inch
Bundesbank cuts in coming months. If Germany starts to show firm signs of
economic recovery ahead of France, tighter interest rates in both New York
and Frankfurt later this year could subject French monetary policy to an
increasingly cruel test.

Political hacks were distinctly thin on the ground at BBC Enterprises'
launch party for the publication of Tony Benn's diary tapes at the House of
Commons yesterday.
Indeed, it seemed largely to be an exercise in feeding numerous
functionaries from obscure corners of the BBC, many of whose ample titles
barely fitted onto the name tags. A surprising proportion proved more than a
little vague on the subject of the Benn product.

Anne Wibble, formidable chairman of the governors of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, was yesterday explaining the significance of
St Petersburg as the venue for this week's relaunch of the bank under
Jacques de Larosiere's stringent regime. It was, she said, 'a city founded
in another reform era of watershed proportions during the reign of Peter the
First'. On marshland which he had won by conquest from her native Sweden,
she diplomatically omitted to add.
The conference audience, which included Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister
and possible successor to Boris Yeltsin, later had the benefit of her views
on the dangers of slow-paced reform. 'The gradualist approach can easily
lead to a vicious circle of generalised subsidies to non-viable activities,
continuous budget deficits, prolonged high inflation, falling exchange
rates, capital flight and economic stagnation.' On the subject of the
political costs to the likes of Chernomyrdin in the alternative tough-it-out
approach, she again chose to play stumm.

The white South Africans who have bought up just about every seat on flights
out of the country before the election have mostly purchased return tickets
 -not least because they are cheaper than one-way fares.
One of their number who really will be ditching the return portion is
39-year-old Graham Bell, until recently the highly rated chief economist for
Johannesburg brokers Ivor, Jones, Roy. He arrives at Barings on Thursday to
start his new job as head of the merchant bank's South African sales and
research desk in London. A Jo'burg office is also planned, serving as a
regional base for business in other southern African countries, too.
The bank's timing may look to be on the foolhardy side of brave, but is no
doubt born of the confidence derived from beating other UK houses fair and
square into almost every other emerging market to date.

Once upon a time there was a fine old City club called the Accepting Houses
Committee. It let in all sorts of riff-raff and changed its name to the
British Merchant Banking and Securities Houses Association.
Five years on and the increasingly international membership now feel that
the word 'British' is no longer appropriate and the term 'securities houses'
is a bit long-winded.
So unless there is a last-minute revolt at the annual general meeting on May
5, the BMBA will become the London Investment Banking Association (LIBA). It
seems only a matter of time before an American is allowed to be chairman and
this once proud City institution is renamed yet again.
How about the American Investment Bankers Club Abroad?

Meanwhile, latest word from Kuala Lumpur is that normal relations between
Malaysia and Britain could be restored before too long. The rumours appear
to have been prompted by Daim Zainuddin, one of Malaysia's wealthiest
businessmen, who recently returned from a trip to London.
Daim, a close confidant of Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, has come up
with an ingenious reason why Malaysia's ban on doing business with British
companies - imposed after sections of the British press said unflattering
things about the Malaysian prime minister - could be lifted within three
months.
Part of the problem in resolving the row has been the less than warm
personal relations between Major and Mahathir. Having surveyed the British
political landscape, Daim has concluded that Major will not be around too
much longer. So when the new man comes into Downing Street Mahathir will
take the opportunity of burying the business hatchet. All very neat - but
not necessarily a theory No 10's present incumbent would agree with.

Britain's John Major had an unusual opportunity yesterday to compare notes
with a fellow prime minister who came to office on exactly the same day in
1990: Goh Chok Tong of Singapore.
That's not all the two have in common. Goh has had a few political problems
of his own - the odd electoral setback, for example, and the tendency of his
predecessor Lee Kuan Yew to deliver stern rebukes when the government has
looked like straying from his chosen path.
On the whole, however, with Singapore's economy growing at nearly 10 per
cent a year and support for the authoritarian ruling party running at 61 per
cent at the last count, Major had to acknowledge that Goh's little local
difficulties are ones he can only dream of.

FT  19 APR 94 / Personal View: City must defend its capital position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PADDY LINAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last autumn, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer announced that Stephen
Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, would conduct a review of the
'impact of tax and other government policies on savings and the flow of
funds through the economy'. For a while, nothing emerged. Last month,
however, at a Confederation of British Industry conference, Mr Dorrell told
his audience that he had come to enlist their aid in a dialogue over the
issues raised by the review. He betrayed a belief, a dangerous one in my
view, that the emphasis in the UK on dividend yield has reduced cash
available to companies and harmed their ability to carry through capital
investment programmes.
At M&amp;G, we strongly dispute this belief. We also believe it is imperative
that the City makes its views known. Life and pensions policies, unit trusts
and the corporate sector could all be affected. As the CBI said following
the speech, the review is of potentially greater significance than was
originally thought. At the CBI seminar, Mr Dorrell said its purpose is to
test the UK's 'arrangements for handling savings and investment against our
desire to promote efficient allowance of capital within the economy'.
Perhaps it is some of the weaknesses he identified that are most intriguing:
manufacturing is now a small part of the UK economy.
dividend pay-out ratios appear to be relatively high in Britain,
particularly when compared with continental European economies.
M&amp;G's view is that these points fail properly to understand the role of the
institutions. In particular, institutions do not manage companies - boards
of directors do that. It is for those boards to identify good investment
opportunities and for institutions to assess them and to place their money
accordingly. So-called good investment opportunities are those which provide
the prospect of an adequate return on capital employed.
It is, of course, the stock market generally that passes judgment on the
wisdom of a board's long-term investment programme. It is no accident that
the manufacturing sector, in terms of gross domestic product, has shrunk in
the postwar period, as it has in other western countries. Foreign
competition is often fierce and returns on capital commensurately lower
unless the company concentrates on high added value, often
technology-driven, areas. The non-manufacturing sectors, in contrast, have
often suffered less competition and have prospered accordingly.
Mr Dorrell particularly emphasises the UK's high dividend payout ratio. The
UK equity market is very large in relation to the size of the economy and
the UK corporate sector is probably the least dependent of any major nation
on bank finance. It is therefore hardly surprising that the payout ratio is
the highest: by contrast, bankers abroad insist on stronger internal cash
surpluses to repay debt as a matter of prudence, and so they should. I
believe many overseas companies are actually envious of the freedom that the
UK's largely equity financed corporate sector enjoys.
In the very long term, it is the flow of dividends that determines capital
values and hence returns to shareholders: perhaps, in the fullness of time,
Mr Dorrell and his Treasury team will come to appreciate better the
excellent returns produced by British industry. He may also become more
fully aware of the vital discipline on company boards that dividend paying
represents. To cut a dividend usually leads to a fall in share price and
will diminish the company's ability to raise equity finance and lead to its
increasing dependence on bank finance.
I am therefore convinced of the correctness of high pay-outs and of capital
raising where necessary, a process which acts as a filter mechanism. The
City enjoys a flexible capital-raising system, and the process does not
constitute 'unnecessary and expensive churning', as Mr Dorrell suggests. It
not only reduces companies' reliance on bank debt, it also makes them less
vulnerable to the wide swings in interest rates that have been a
characteristic of UK economic management since the second world war.
It is clear the City needs urgently to understand the broad scope of Mr
Dorrell's review and the potential impact it could have on capital
investment and on savings - and it needs to respond. It needs to address two
particular questions: will the proposed changes benefit industry and the
saver? And will they increase or decrease the flow of savings from the
private to the corporate sector which is so necessary for the continued
expansion of the UK economy?

FT  19 APR 94 / First steppes to a consumer culture: Western companies are
overcoming obstacles and penetrating the Russian market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In post-communist Russia, political satire has been replaced by jokes about
western consumer goods, while propaganda on television and street billboards
has switched from praise of communism to the promotion of the products of
capitalism.
A consumer society, built largely on imports, is emerging from the ruins of
a state-run economy, which for decades produced some of the world's most
sophisticated weaponry while imposing on its citizens severe shortages of
consumer goods - whether shoes or washing-powder.
Mr Victor Naishuller, an entrepreneur who set up Office Club, Russia's first
discount warehouse for office supplies and furniture, says that of the 8,000
products it sells 3,000 - for instance, cardboard storage boxes - had never
been seen in the country before.
Russians, used under communism to hunting for months to find a pair of boots
or a sofa, are proving fussy consumers. When a Russian trader recently
arrived in New York to buy a container-load of women's underwear, he
insisted they should be labelled 'made in the USA' as his customers would
buy nothing else.
The emergence of western-style consumers, however, is threatening to fuel a
political backlash against the growing social inequality and industrial
decline which have accompanied market reforms.
Many Russians feel humiliated by the inability of their industry to compete
with cheaper, better-quality, or simply better-marketed imports, including
vodka. The adjustment of domestic production to the needs of consumers has
been delayed by high inflation, which makes short-term trading in ready-made
goods more attractive than long-term investment.
The government has reacted to growing protectionist pressures by clamping
down on imports, with tariff increases making some staple foods more
expensive. A symptom of popular resentment is the way western goods - from
Snickers bars to imported Smirnoff vodka - are the butt of a spate of
hostile newspaper articles and quips. One of several anekdoty by cosmically
minded Russians about the chocolate bars made by Masterfoods, the US food
company, relies on a TV advertisement claiming its Milky Way chocolate bars
are so light they never drown in milk. Snickers see Mars crying and asks:
'Why are you crying?' 'Milky Way has drowned,' says Mars.
This example of humour at the expense of western companies goes hand in hand
with more serious difficulties. Public hostility pales in comparison to
problems posed to western companies by high taxes and Mafia extortion. But,
despite these teething troubles in the development of a consumer society in
Russia, 150m people remain a tantalising market for western producers.
Mr Michael O'Neill, regional manager for Coca-Cola, which entered Russia
after its rival Pepsi-Cola but claims to be catching up fast, says that the
'potential . . . is quite fantastic'. Though western companies account for
only 20 per cent of the Russian soft drinks market, 'it's just a matter of
making the product available' for them to win the bulk of sales, he says.
Competition between western companies is so fierce that some pioneers are
reluctant to talk publicly about how they built up a presence for fear of
helping the competition learn from their experience.
Mr Larry Anderson, a partner at the Moscow office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accounting and management firm, says every company must devise its own
solutions in Russia's tough business environment. But enthusiasm, he says,
is a crucial component of success: 'If you have the attitude that Russia's
glass is half empty you are never going to get anywhere. You have got to
start with the belief that the glass is half full.'
The potential for companies with a popular product to attract consumers
whose monthly salary averages Dollars 85 is shown by Masterfoods'
transformation of its Mars and Snickers chocolate bars into household names
in less than a year. In late 1992, only 5 per cent of Russians knew of
Snickers, according to a Gallup poll; now the figure is about 80 per cent.
Establishing such awareness of a brand image calls for widespread
distribution and aggressive advertising. The latter is helped by low
advertising costs - western style TV air-time slots cost 10 cents per 1,000
viewers in Russia, against Dollars 6 per 1,000 in the US. Masterfoods' reach
was illustrated by the concierge in a dilapidated hotel in Russia's
breakaway Chechnya region. Her first question, after apologising for the
hotel's broken window panes and lack of heating, was: 'Will you have
Snickers with your tea?'
The second factor, distribution networks, which did not exist five years
ago, have been forged through the joint efforts of western companies and
Russian entrepreneurs, deploying methods that range from primitive to
sophisticated.
On the primitive end of the scale, Mr John Bailey, managing director of the
Russian subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US pharmaceuticals group, says:
'We had to start our distribution from scratch, with Russian enterprises
banging on our door and us sending people out banging on Russian
organisations' doors. We've had people coming to us in trucks from the far
east of Russia to collect things.' Although trucks keep coming from
far-flung corners of Russia, he can now use domestic wholesalers.
At the more sophisticated end is Mr Naishuller's Office Club. He opened the
edifice on the edge of Moscow after abandoning negotiations with Office
Depot, the US office supplies chain, to open branches for them in Russia.
Frustrated by the 'very bad' terms they were offering, he decided to go it
alone, with the help of two former Office Depot employees from the US. Later
this year, he hopes to open three more Office Club stores - in St
Petersburg, Siberia and in the rich southern Volga region.
However, despite progress, distribution is uneven and prices are high in
what remains a sellers' market. To promote the growth of a consumer society,
many western and Russian companies believe manufacturing operations must be
set up to generate jobs, local wealth and goodwill.
With only 85 of Office Club's 8,000 product lines made by Russian companies,
Mr Naishuller says he plans to encourage Russian companies to produce more
by investing in a number of them.
Some western companies are already making strategic investments in Russian
industry. MasterFoods, for instance, is negotiating to build three
food-processing factories near Moscow. Others are buying into and upgrading
existing plants through the government's privatisation programme, which aims
to put 80 per cent of Russian manufacturing in private hands by July 1.
With the aim of acquiring a controlling stake, Procter &amp; Gamble, the
consumer products group, last November bought 15 per cent of a Russian plant
which has been making its Ariel washing-powder since 1992. Western cigarette
manufacturers were also among the first to take up opportunities offered by
privatisation. Mr David Geovanis, director of a joint venture involving the
US's Liggett &amp; Myers tobacco company, says its Moscow factory is now
producing US-style brands using Virginia-blend tobacco. But it will still
make cheaper local brands because they have a 'big market'.
Yet the fact is that western investment is mainly designed to promote the
sale of western goods. In addition to stimulating popular hostility, it is
also generating an increasingly influential protectionist current among
Russian businessmen. Their argument for measures to shelter nascent Russian
free enterprise also has a political dimension. Mr Vladimir Gussinsky, a
Russian with large banking and construction interests, warns that, unless
more is done to help domestic industry, 'a backlash under the influence of
(ultra-nationalistic) patriots, who ask why we should drink foreign vodka,
could well create a fascist state in Russia'. While such warnings are
motivated by a strong element of self-interest, they highlight a trend
foreign companies will be increasingly unable to ignore.

FT  19 APR 94 / Serious local difficulty: Lewis Baston on prospects for UK
parties in elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEWIS BASTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opinion polls suggest the UK local elections on May 5 will be a disaster for
the Conservatives. The stakes are high for Mr John Major, the prime
minister, amid the current speculation about a leadership crisis. Almost
incidentally, they will decide control of hundreds of councils, from Penwith
in west Cornwall to Shetland, and elect all the councillors of London.
Because of the low Conservative base and the varying regional trends, this
year's local elections are more than usually difficult to analyse. How will
they go and what will they mean?
The 32 London boroughs and the 12 regional and island councils in Scotland
will be up for election, as will one-third of the councillors in the 36
metropolitan boroughs and 118 of the district councils in England and Wales.
The bulk of the votes cast will therefore be in the big urban areas.
Council election results have always depended on what the 40 per cent of the
electorate that bothers to vote thinks about the national government. The
parties' shares of the vote tends to move in line with the opinion polls. As
in general elections, campaigning is increasingly dominated by national
issues and personalities. Mr Major's personal involvement, and Labour's
emphasis on the government's tax record, show that the centralising trend
continues.
However, since the mid-1970s - especially in areas where the Liberal
Democrats have been active - the importance of local differences has been
increasing. There has also been a tendency since the late 1980s for Labour
to do worse in the local elections than in the national opinion polls. Last
year, Labour's local showing lagged by about 6 per cent and the Liberal
Democrats did correspondingly better.
In 1991 and 1993 there were signs of anti-Conservative tactical voting,
particularly in favour of Liberal Democrats in the south and south-west of
England. Liberal Democrat gains of seats and councils were more impressive
than their percentage vote. With tactical voting and the unpopularity of the
government, 1994 is likely to be one of the worst years ever for
Conservative local election candidates.
One glimmer of hope for Mr Major is that the seats to be fought were last
contested in 1990 - a similarly abysmal year for a Conservative government.
Then, as now, Labour led in the polls by more than 20 per cent; the
leadership of the prime minister, the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, was under
pressure; and new taxes - in 1990 the poll tax - were unpopular. The poor
Conservative showing then suggests that even disastrous unpopularity will
not cost many more seats this time, and a few gains might be possible.
Central Office may then be able to claim a victory and deflect attention
from a poor vote, as it did in 1990 by concentrating on Tory triumphs in the
'flagship' boroughs of Wandsworth and Westminster.
Every set of local elections since 1990 has produced some surprising
results. The big story last year was the surge in Liberal Democrat strength
which demolished the Tory shires, leaving only Buckinghamshire under
Conservative control. This year the Liberal Democrats do not stand to win as
many councils, though they are still likely to gain seats from both main
parties. The Conservative vote has fallen so badly that the Liberal
Democrats are the main opposition to Labour in Manchester, Sheffield and
Southampton, as well as Liverpool and Southwark. They can also hope to make
gains from Labour in several urban areas.
As always in elections, there will be variations in different parts of the
country:
In Scotland, the Scottish National party is hoping to break into the Labour
heartland in the central belt, although it is unlikely to win control in any
regional council.
The Conservatives' hopes are concentrated in the west Midlands, where they
did very well in the 1992 local elections. The party hopes to gain
Wolverhampton and Dudley, and end Labour control of Birmingham, despite a
recent by-election gain for Labour. Liverpool politics continues on its
idiosyncratic course, with a conflict between Labour, the Liberal Democrats
and candidates backed by the leftwing Militant group.
Labour will have to defend many of its southern strongholds, such as
Brighton.
As in 1990, the London elections will get the most media attention, because
more councils may change hands in the capital than in other regions. Labour
did poorly in London in 1990 compared with other areas, largely because of
the reputation for poor services and high taxes that London Labour councils
had acquired. The party can hope for more significant gains here than
elsewhere, being 300 short of its 1971 peak number of borough councillors.
The official target list of Enfield, Ealing and Croydon seems modest - a
reasonable swing should see Brent and possibly Redbridge fall, too.
On the other hand, Labour is under Liberal Democrat attack in Lambeth,
Southwark and Waltham Forest. If the Liberal Democrats are as strong as in
1993, they should win Kingston, and the Conservatives should lose Harrow,
Bexley and maybe Bromley.
The Liberal Democrats may, however, lose Tower Hamlets to no overall control
or to Labour, although politics there is confused. Both Labour and the
Liberal Democrats are split, and there is a risk of the far-right British
National party taking over the devolved neighbourhood council in the Isle of
Dogs, where it won a by-election last year.
While the Conservatives lost in 1990, clever public relations turned it into
a reprieve for Mrs Thatcher. This is cold comfort for Mr Major. The European
elections in June will overshadow the local elections, and have a bigger
impact on national politics - they could prove a tougher task for the public
relations wizards of Central Office.

FT  19 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confused thinking about Russian
'gradualism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor PADMA DESAI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Anders Aslund (Letters, April 12) recounts the well known
facts of the decline in Russia's inflation during the last several months to
the current 9 per cent per month to assert that Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
prime minister, is now opposed to 'gradualism' and has moved into the camp
of the discredited 'shock therapists'. Virtue has triumphed; the folly of my
longstanding support of gradualism has been exposed. But this claim is
confused in its economics and facile in its politics.
Shock therapy meant a drastic and swift slashing of the budget deficit with
a view to killing the inflation forthwith. Gradualism, in my view, does not
imply the lethargy of Oblomovism. It calls instead for a gradual but firm
and credible approach to cutting the deficit and the inflation. That is
certainly what the former finance minister, Boris Fyodorov, eventually
turned to, when shock therapy (begun in January 1992) had failed: the
results have been coming in.
The chief question, raised by Fyodorov in your columns ('Dangers of western
gullibility', March 28) and ignored by Aslund is whether the prime
minister's support of this gradualist programme is genuine, as the
International Monetary Fund has apparently concluded, or whether it is a
sham, as Fyodorov fears.
Political analysis and forecasts are always tricky, especially in Russia.
But the likelihood of the optimistic scenario being right is more
compelling.
The new Chernomyrdin administration is more cohesive and, so far, free from
the internecine political feuding in the earlier government. It is also a
cliche, but true, that Chernomyrdin, a 'manager' from the hinterland, is
more likely to carry the country (especially the large factories) with him
on the adjustment costs of even gradual stabilisation than hardline
'technocrats' from Moscow.
The IMF and the G-7 will have to monitor closely the situation and tailor
aid flows to the unfolding programme. But they cannot be faulted for
thinking that Russia deserves, not just needs, a chance.

FT  19 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: No hijack of Kent chambers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a leading player in the East Kent Initiative, we congratulate you on
your representation of the situation in our part of the world (East Kent
survey, April 8). However, we feel the article headed 'Striking the right
balance' gives the wrong impression concerning chambers of commerce in Kent.
In effect the Kent Chamber of Commerce represents only six individual
chambers which in turn have a collective membership of some 1,300 businesses
 -not the 3,000 quoted. Our organisation, Associated Kent Chambers of
Commerce, comprises 1,800 businesses in the membership of seven chambers.
A merger between the two bodies has been agreed in principle and only when
this comes to fruition will the new organisation become one of the UK's
largest chambers.
By networking a series of local chambers, we believe we shall be delivering
a strong organisation to assist the development of Kent's businesses, to
represent their interests to government and, hopefully, through being truly
representative, be able to fight off what we see as government's attempt to
hijack the chambers of commerce movement through mergers with Training and
Enterprise Councils.

FT  19 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Channel control overdue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KEVIN SHILLETO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A month ago a 100,000 ton tanker was in collision in the Bosporus. More
recently, a 300,000 tonner spilled 7,000 tons of crude oil in the Straits of
Oman, after hitting a bunkering tanker. On March 31, there was a near miss
in the English Channel between a 22,000 ton super-ferry and a small
freighter.
What all these incidents have in common is their occurrence in confined
waters. A disaster of almost unimaginable proportions is well overdue off
Dover between a ferry carrying up to 2,000 passengers and a fully loaded
supertanker. If one vessel strikes the other, the ferry will sink in
minutes. All roll-on, roll-off ferries are simple cardboard boxes, open plan
on several decks without bulkheads and inherently unsafe when breached.
Traffic on cross-Channel routes has more than doubled since the Spirit of
Free Enterprise disaster but still no effective traffic control system such
as that operated by the Civil Aviation Authority exists, although satellite
scanning of the entire Channel is feasible. Official routing exists, but
monitoring each vessel in transit through or crossing the Channel cannot be
delayed. The British and French governments and the International Maritime
Organisation must be deemed dilatory to the point of fecklessness in this
regard.

Sir, One small but important point on David Goodhart's article on our pay
deal ('Customs staff given performance pay targets', April 18). The deal
will not increase the bill by 2.6 per cent. In line with the chancellor of
the exchequer's policy, our pay bill is frozen at its 1993-1994 level, and
the cost of the 2.6 per cent deal will be funded through efficiency savings.

FT  19 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Drawbacks to share option procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID M W BROOKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your article, 'Avoid the BP trap' (Management, April 15),
concerning the need for executive pay and, in particular, share options to
be linked to performance measures.
The article indicated that some companies may select the criterion that
share options will become exercisable if a company's earnings beat inflation
by 2 per cent in three successive years. This approach has two principal
problems.
First, the joint statement by the National Association of Pension Funds and
the Association of British Insurers requires companies to choose performance
measures which will produce 'significant and sustained improvement in
underlying financial performance'. That implies that a company must consider
measures that are appropriate to themselves and not simply adopt a measure
because other companies are doing so.
Second, chairmen of remuneration committees may well have to justify to
shareholders in the future why substantial gains from share options have
been realised when the above earnings performance measure has been beaten,
but where a company's performance compared to its sector or the FT-SE 100 is
very poor.
If the link between corporate performance and executive remuneration is to
become meaningful, the use of industry standards is dangerous. In the
current environment, companies should question why they have share options
if they have not chosen performance measures appropriate to their specific
circumstances.

FT  19 APR 94 / Arts: Landscapes of the imagination - William Packer reviews
the work of two very different contemporary artists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The landscape to a painter is whatever he cares to make of it - indeed,
whatever he cares to call it. A single horizontal line across the surface of
the canvas becomes, well, an horizon, in which sense all nominally abstract
painting becomes a kind of landscape of the imagination. Alexander Cozens
used blots and smudges, and Gainsborough cauliflower and broccoli, to invent
their landscapes in the 18th century. Rothko's cosmic emptiness was long ago
prefigured in l'Immensite of Courbet, or the pools and river-banks of Monet.
Maurice Cockrill, at 57, is one of the more interesting of those painters
who occupy this no-man's-land of inventive representation -
non-representational representation if you like. He thinks of his work,
certainly, as landscape, and indeed it does take on something of the space
and scale of landscape. Yet he has dispensed with any defining sky-line or
horizontal, nor are there any near-vertical emphases to help the eye the
other way. If the suggestion is of landscape, it is that of the closer and
more constricted view, of a pit or quarry-side, with a tangle of roots and
undergrowth down the bank, or of the entrance to a thicket, confusing and
disorienting - even an aeroplane becomes confused without an horizon.
The informing sense is one of organic growth and rich profusion, and so
close does the imagery bear in on us that it becomes almost that of
landscape as still life - we are back again to Gainsborough and his
vegetables. The closer parallel, nearer our own time, is to Graham
Sutherland and his war-time Welsh landscapes, with their lanes and
hill-sides and hot colours, and his thorns and bushes of the later 1940s and
early '50s, romantic, surreal, threatening and intense.
But Sutherland's imagery is always specific to its source, and stated with
nothing of the expressive, expansive freedom and suggestive feeling that we
find here with Cockrill. If the sense in the imagery of his work is of
generalised organic growth, so it is with the actual quality of the paint as
it is handled on the surface. In the way he works, he stands much closer to
Francis Bacon.
These are big names, but not over-bearing influences, and Cockrill, while
tacitly acknowledging them, remains his own man. He begins with a canvas
prepared with an immaculate ground or colour-field which is to be occupied
by the mass of the image. This he lays on more or less across the centre of
the canvas, dense and rich in the paint itself, fresh and direct in the way
the paint is worked and moved about. At last comes a committed, all-or
nothing flurry of activity, a rapid, calligraphic sequence of marks and
gestures that overlays the more considered passages and ties them formally
to the larger, encompassing and still pristine spaces of the canvas.
Zen-like, he either gets them right at once, or they are nothing.
Cockrill is an artist who has long enjoyed the respect of his peers, but
only in the last few years has come into more public a reputation. The Tate,
at least, should buy him now.
Round the corner in Albemarle Street, Roger de Grey is showing for the first
time since giving up the presidency of the Royal Academy. Knowing how active
he was in that onerous duty, we might find it surprising that he has found
time to do any work at all. That he has managed only lately to do so much is
merely astonishing. He, by way of contrast, is a true landscape painter, no
less inventive than Cockrill - for even the most exact of artists must
invent in paint the visual metaphor or symbol for the reality he would
describe - but working directly from his subject as much as possible, which
he rationalises and simplifies back in the studio.
Kent, Cornwall and the Charente-Maritime supply his imagery, with the odd
still-life besides - a view out of the window to the garden gate, a wooded
hill-side, a high, wide succession of fading horizontals to take the eye out
across the fields to the distant estuary. All is quiet, undemonstrative,
well-ordered and structured, seemingly polite. The debt to Cezanne is
manifest, but other, more recent complements and parallels suggest
themselves, the American, Richard Diebenkorn for example, whose Ocean Park
paintings, with their schematic linear perspectives, simplified themselves
quite literally to abstraction.
Roger de Grey may disqualify himself as an abstract artist, saying he has no
facility in the invention of forms, but the fact remains that the
abstraction is implicit in everything he does, and sophisticated
constructivist abstraction at that, with the emphatic architecture of
vertical and horizontal that so often divides his canvases, lying on the
picture-plane and setting the visual space. Though the device may be only a
tree perhaps, a window-frame, or the sharp, sweet rise and curve of the road
across the plain, he is rather more adventurous a painter than he cares to
admit.

It seems that The Riff Raff Element (10.00 BBC1) cannot be kept off our
screens. This new six-part series begins immediately after the end of the
last one - with the pressing problem of Vincent's corpse. 'My characters are
all based on people I've come across. I don't make anything up,' says Debbie
Horsfield, whose comedy of class has been hailed as a pretty classy comedy.
Home Front (8.30 BBC2) starts a series about interior design; tonight we
travel the silk route in pursuit of - well, silk, I guess. But whatever you
do pay attention to Very Jean Muir (8.00 C4), the second film in this
(repeated) series of three. Miss Muir is still very reluctant to call
herself a dress designer but the frocks she fashions to her own daunting
standards are perfect for grown-up women aged anywhere between 20 and 80.
Incredibly, Joan Littlewood is 80 this year: still as sharp and funny and
outrageous as when she produced Oh, What A Lovely War] and Fings Ain't What
They Used to Be at the Theatre Royal in London's Stratford East in the 1950s
and 1960s. Omnibus (11.00 BBC1) wishes her many happy returns, and so do I.

FT  19 APR 94 / Arts: Lady Windermere's Fan / Our critic finds Wilde in
Kilburn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sean Kearns's gigantic Duchess of Berwick says 'None of us men do look what
we really are,' as she quick-changes before our eyes into Lord Augustus
Lorton. But the point about the production by the Irish company Rough Magic
of Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan, now at the Kilburn Tricycle, is not that
it is a drag interpretation but a brusque and clever ensemble piece in which
four of the seven actors happen to have multiple roles, male and female; a
production certainly thereby risking a roughness of despatch, but securing
its moments of magic.
The play is put within a double frame of music and circus. When we enter, a
violinist (Aingeala de Butca) and pianist (Andrew Synnott) are half-visibly
playing Palm Court Faure at the rear, and they sustain a musical commentary
throughout the entire action, underpinning suspense with a dry pizzicato,
sawing out the heartbreak, and crucially, of course, playing dances for the
Second Act ball. The Victorian melodrama of the plot becomes melodrama in
the other sense of melos plus talk.
The circus idea is that the butler Parker, acted by Mal Whyte, who also
skilfully takes the roles of Lady Plymdale and raucous Australian Mr Hopper,
presents the play at the outset in the character of a clown or Lulu-style
ringmaster, when he also points out the Tricycle fire-exits and mentions the
conveniences of the interval. He keeps his clown's white and rouged cheeks
in all three of his roles. Miche Doherty as a mincing Lady Agatha ('So
devoted to sunsets]', as her mother the Duchess says) and a scaldingly witty
Cecil Graham, wears that makeup too, as do Kearns and Darragh Kelly's deaf
Lady Jedbergh.
Through circus tricks the small cast on the small platform manages to
reproduce the whirl and glitter of a ball most admirably; and the collective
clownface is doubtless a gloss on Lord Darlington's famous remark, 'I think
that life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it'.
Martin Murphy, despite the earring and rings, makes the latter a dour sort
of dandy, and is more convincing later when thwarted love has taken the
dandy's humour away (also, it would seem, his English accent). Ali White is
an excellently noble and foolish, beautiful Lady Windermere; Paul Hickey
perhaps too solemn as her husband. Helene Montague's vivid Mrs Erlynne - the
scarlet woman - succeeds rather by force than finesse. The production's
magic comes with the strange, dark, cigar-smoky, violin-permeated atmosphere
of the all-male passage of the third act, when epigrams are hurled like
knives.
Till May 7; then in Sligo, Limerick, Belfast, Dublin.

FT  19 APR 94 / Arts: An erratic Crusade / Our critic finds a Middle Eastern
argument in Stratford, E15
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Vine once breathlessly intoned, 'Here we are in the holy city of
Jerusalem - a Mecca for tourists.' The knotty relationships of the region's
three main religions form both the immediate focus and the deeper background
of Paul Sirett's erratic play.
A minibus en route to Jerusalem breaks down, conveniently forcing a clutch
of character stereotypes to endure one another's company for 90 minutes. It
is not unlike a country house thriller, with Jenny Tiramani's looming rocky
outcrop serving as the smoking room, and Middle Eastern history standing in
for the bludgeoned corpse.
The range of suspects is as broad as one might expect: a lippy, upwardly
mobile Aussie woman with paranoid, bigoted Pom-born bank executive husband;
a whingeing, would-be 'radical' actor and his long-suffering art historian
girlfriend; a female crusty, and a New Age 'Rasta'; and Mahmood, the driver,
whose occasional flashbacks intimate something nasty in his personal
woodshed.
Israeli-Palestinian and Christian-Moslem tensions in the party's immediate
circumstances are maladroitly paralleled with the crusades of the 12th
century. Crass guy ropes are thrown out in the form of contrived passionate
outbursts and, of all things, a heated exchange about Islamic ceramics. At
one point a dream sequence consisting of a Mummers' play about Saladin and
King Richard is superimposed with slide projections of the Intifada - a
juxtaposition which conveys nothing except that whatever is going on in the
area has been doing so for a very long time.
Burt Caesar and Kate Lonergan get a raw deal as Rasta Barry and neo-hippy
Fran, theoretically open to ideas but mired in the vague generalities of
virtually every hackneyed line they utter. The norm of intelligent decency
is encapsulated in Moslem art historian Ayesha but Tara King's performance
is overwrought, crippling the character's function as a focus of audience
sympathy and identification.
Director Jeff Teare is understandably uninspired by Sirett's script, with
its inability to do more than nod at the magnitude of political and
historical issues. Improbably, the play's closing movement reveals Mahmood
as a personification of Christian-Jewish-Islamic entanglement, presiding
over a debate as to which of the party should be symbolically executed.
The characters' final exit on foot to seek help merely begs the question why
they did not buzz off an hour and a half earlier. Sirett has written a 90
minute shrug of bewilderment with the message, 'Golly - complex, isn't it?'
I think we knew that already, thanks.

FT  19 APR 94 / Arts: Contrasting fortunes at the opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, has made an operating surplus for the
second consecutive year.
Figures for the last financial year, announced at a press conference
yesterday, show a surplus of Pounds 400,000, bringing its accumulated
deficit down by half to Pounds 1.4m. By the end of the next financial year,
Covent Garden should be out of the red. But this successful turnaround of
the Opera House's fortunes has been at a cost. Chief executive Jeremy Isaacs
acknowledged yesterday that with seats in the stalls now costing Pounds 102,
ticket prices were too high.
Although an average of 86 per cent of seats were filled last year, the
company would like to make productions more accessible by reducing prices by
up to one-fifth. Nobody was proud of having to increase prices to their
present levels, 'but we have to, to earn the income to keep the house in the
black,' said Isaacs.
This year's Arts Council grant to the Royal Opera House stands at Pounds
7.76m, representing 28 per cent of the company's projected income. Although
a significant sector of the public was willing to pay the existing high
prices for seats at Covent Garden, this tended to be for popular operas like
Carmen and Rigoletto. Tickets of modern productions, such as Harrison
Birtwistle's award-winning Gawain, had to be discounted to fill the house.
'It is going to be very difficult to put on new work and British work,'
warned opera house chairman Sir Angus Stirling.
Meanwhile, down the road at the Coliseum, English National Opera is cutting
seat prices further in an attempt to reverse the decline in its audience.
New director Dennis Marks has filled 62 per cent of the seats this season,
as against a doleful 56 per cent in the last year of Peter Jonas's reign.
But with a frozen grant from the Arts Council of Pounds 11.65m for 1994-95,
and an accumulated deficit of Pounds 2.4m, this is not good enough. To build
up audiences for the new season in September, ENO will be offering discounts
to regular supporters, appealing to young audiences, and changing its
overall pricing policy to ensure that 60 per cent, as against 50 per cent at
present, of the seats available (except on Saturdays) will cost less than
Pounds 25.
The front stalls, 102 seats in all, at Pounds 45, will cost Pounds 5.50 more
on weekdays, but the remainder of the stalls, some 447 seats, will be
reduced to Pounds 35. The Friday premium also disappears, although you will
still pay more on Saturday. The changes will create more flexibility and
reduce the average price of a weekday ticket at the ENO to Pounds 25.80.
Anyone who buys tickets for three ENO performances at full price will be
offered a 10 per cent discount on any future purchases during the season.
United Airlines is helping to promote and underwrite the scheme. It is an
alternative to an ENO subscription, which has been hit by the recession: few
opera lovers these days are prepared to pay substantial sums and commit
themselves to performances months in advance.
To encourage new opera goers, ENO is offering Pounds 5 tickets for 100
school children aged between 13-18 at each of 12 performances next season.
An ENO fan, Irving Laidlaw, who paid for Ken Russell's ill begotten
production of Princess Ida, is subsidising the seats.

FT  19 APR 94 / Technology: Pool of IT resources keeps CAA in the race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far-reaching changes in the computer world are having an impact on the way
information technology departments are organised. When large, centralised
mainframes were the dominant form of computing, so were large, centralised
IT departments. But these were criticised for being expensive and remote
from the business.
Then came distributed computing. This made a 'federal' approach to IT
possible, with computers and IT staff devolved to individual business units.
A small, central IT department was usually retained to decide on the
company's computing strategy and which standards it should support.
Many companies hoped that putting IT staff in closer contact with
non-technical managers would make them more business oriented. But all too
often, devolved IT departments have expanded, creating their own fiefs and
spiralling costs. As a result, they have become just as remote and
inflexible as the large, centralised IT departments which they replaced.
This inflexibility and the growth of PC use is making some companies rethink
the way they organise IT. Stuart Vaughan, a senior consultant at Pagoda
Associates, a London-based management consultancy, believes turning the IT
department into a resource pool will solve some of the weaknesses inherent
in organising IT staff.
The idea has been tried before in the UK, but nowhere as radically as at the
Civil Aviation Authority. The CAA has replaced its 110-strong central IT
department with a resource pool of 50 staff and an IT department of 25. Any
CAA business unit can draw staff from the pool so long as it puts them on
its payroll for at least three months. Ad hoc PC projects (lasting no more
than a few days) are handled by a team of six in the IT department.
Vaughan, who is involved in the CAA project, says: 'A major benefit of the
resource pool is that it can be sized in an optimum way, avoiding
unnecessary duplication. It is also possible to demonstrate value for money
because business units cannot hire an IT person unless they present a
convincing business case.'
At the CAA, line managers can hire from the pool or buy services from
outside if the pool does not have the right skills. This makes IT staff very
service-oriented. Richard Brett, the CAA's director of finance and
management services, says: 'In the old days, staff whose skills were
obsolete were simply put to work on internal projects for the IT department,
while new staff with the latest skills were hired. But IT is no longer a
self-generating organisation.'
Now, he says, 'if people in the pool don't have an assignment, they are very
visible. We try to retrain, but if they haven't been requested for two
months, we put them on the redeployment list'.
The pool will not rise above 50. If more staff are needed, the CAA will
simply increase its use of outsourcing. In fact, the pool is likely to
shrink. It has been in place for a year (on a transfer-charging basis till
this month) and no one hired by a business unit has returned.
Brett finds it encouraging that once IT people get into the business, they
begin to develop real business skills. 'We're starting to overcome the bug
bear of project definition, where the line manager knows what he wants the
system to do but the IT expert is on a different wavelength.'
He believes IT should not be viewed as a black art but as a normal business
process. So the business planning group has responsibility for IT strategy,
the internal audit department checks that business units are sticking to
group technology standards, and line managers cost-justify and manage IT
projects.
This approach has helped the CAA to reduce its central IT overheads from
Pounds 43m three years ago to Pounds 18m. A lot of money is also spent on IT
in individual business units, where Brett says managers now see IT as a real
cost.

FT  19 APR 94 / Technology: Battling the weak link - Poor R&amp;D in Japanese
drugs companies is limiting overseas expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International expansion is the proclaimed policy of most of Japan's top
drugs groups. The strategy is motivated by a desire to reduce their
dependency on a domestic market that is under attack by a rolling barrage of
healthcare reforms.
But the ability of Japanese groups to compete effectively in world
pharmaceuticals may well be undermined by structural weaknesses in their
drugs research and development capabilities.
There is some good basic research in Japan. The country's expertise in
allergies, asthma, antibiotics and cholesterol-lowering drugs is widely
recognised. However, it lags badly behind the US and Europe in the
increasingly important field of biotechnology.
'Biotechnology will have an important role in contributing to drug
discovery,' says Teruhisa Noguchi, executive vice-president of R&amp;D at
Yamanouchi. 'But Japan is not very strong in biotechnology. We are sending
many of our young scientists to the US to study and then bringing their
experience back. But the relationship is still one of American teacher and
Japanese pupil.'
Masaji Ohno, managing director of R&amp;D at Eisai, agrees: 'We are well behind,
but by the beginning of the next century, we may be able to create some
original work.'
A few Japanese groups have attempted to remedy their deficiencies by forming
links with western biotechnology groups. These have not always been
successful.
Yoshihiko Baba, director of Sankyo's research institute, describes the
modest achievements of his company's links with US and British biotechnology
boutiques: 'To be honest they did not really thrive. I suppose it is partly
because the chances of success were not very high in the first place. But we
learnt you have to make sure the human side of the relationship works and
that both sides need a financial interest in making the alliance a success.'
Hiroyki Nagasako, director for corporate planning at Daiichi, adds that it
is also necessary to have in-house expertise to choose the right companies
and manage the relationships. 'We do not have these skills. It is an
expensive business and you can waste a lot of money,' he says.
Japan's weakness in biotechnology would not be so important if the drugs
groups' traditional R&amp;D were stronger. The main problem is lack of
investment. The industry spends a reasonable proportion of sales on R&amp;D.
Fujisawa invests 14.8 per cent of its sales, Takeda 8.2 per cent, Sankyo 9.6
per cent, Eisai 13.2 per cent, Shionogi 11.8 per cent and Daiichi 12.3 per
cent. But because the groups' sales base is so small, the actual amounts
available for R&amp;D remain pitiful compared with western organisations. Only
one Japanese company, Takeda Chemical, is rated in the world top 20 drugs
groups by sales, and only four Japanese pharmaceuticals companies are in the
top 30.
Takeda spent about Dollars 600m (Pounds 410m) last year on R&amp;D, and not all
on pharmaceuticals. That compares with Roche of Switzerland, which invested
Dollars 1.2bn, and Glaxo of the UK which spent Dollars 1.1bn. Sankyo
invested Dollars 375m, while Eisai, Shionogi and Daiichi all spent less than
Dollars 300m.
Moreover, Japanese companies' R&amp;D funds are not always spent productively.
In the past, much of the money was allocated to developing 'me-too'
compounds that cannot be marketed internationally. This is partly the result
of the system of biennial price cuts set up by the Japanese ministry of
health.
Kunio Takeda, president of Takeda Chemical, explains that in order to
counter the cuts: 'Manufacturers resorted to launching modified
(non-innovative) compounds to conserve development costs and time. Such
policies are likely to damage the industry.'
This syndrome led to a massive rise in the number of new chemical entities
developed in Japan in recent years. The increase was mistaken by some
observers as an explosion in innovative research. Between 1975 and 1989,
Japanese companies launched 212 new chemical entities. But only 42 were sold
in five or more important overseas markets. Just four Japanese drugs were in
the world's top 50 medicines sold in 1990, according to Donald Macarthur,
author of Japanese Pharmaceutical Expansion into Europe, a Financial Times
management report.
'Although the number of new chemical entities coming out of Japan has
expanded rapidly in recent years, most were 'me-toos' - without any great
additional benefit in safety and efficacy. The Japanese companies have real
problems selling most of their compounds overseas,' says Jacques Racloz,
president of Sandoz Pharmaceuticals in Japan.
The 'me-too' syndrome may be changing, however. 'Japanese opinion formers
say we have to create new original compounds - that is the only way to
overcome the price-cutting system. Innovative compounds won't be subject to
the discounts that lead to the price cuts,' says Ohno.
Hitoshi Oyashu, managing director of R&amp;D at Fujisawa, agrees: 'Like it or
not, 'me-too' drugs will no longer prosper - either in Japan or
internationally. We have to adopt a high-risk, high-reward strategy.'
Nevertheless, in spite of the rhetoric of innovation, Japanese companies'
discovery efforts remain woefully unfocused. While most European groups of a
comparable size are narrowing their attention to three or four therapeutic
areas, many Japanese groups remain committed to a large number.
Baba disputes that this lack of focus is a weakness.
'There are two ways of conducting discovery. Either you focus from the very
start or you look at a wide range of areas and then concentrate. We follow
the second school. We like to have as wide a range of leads as possible.
It's very risky to concentrate on only a few fields,' he says.
Even when Japanese drugs groups do have good compounds capable of competing
internationally, they lack development resources overseas to exploit them
properly. Daiichi, for example, has only 11 development scientists in the
UK, none in Germany and four in the US.
Sankyo is one of the most advanced groups in this field, with about 15
development staff in the US and 150 based in Munich. The company is
conducting clinical trials on an anti-depressant in Germany independently of
Japan.
In the past, Japanese groups have missed the opportunity of using their
breakthrough compounds to create an international development and marketing
network. Rather than using the prospects of large sales from a breakthrough
drug to construct an international presence, as SmithKline French did with
its top-selling drug Tagamet in the 1980s, the Japanese tend to license the
medicine to other groups.
Sankyo, Japan's biggest drugs group, licensed Mevalotin, a cholesterol
medicine which during 1992 was the world's 18th best-selling medicine, in
most countries and so has only limited international sales. Fujisawa says
its experience with the antibiotic Cefamezin, sold in 70 countries, was
'extremely painful'. The highly successful drug generated limited income for
the company because lack of an international marketing organisation meant it
had to license the drug out.
One route used by Japanese companies to by-pass this problem is contract
research organisations. Mitsuhiko Sentoku, board director of planning and
development at Daiichi, explains that Cravit, an antibacterial agent, and
one of the group's most promising drugs, is being developed by contract
research organisations in Europe.
A few companies are now trying to use their innovative compounds to begin
building an international development and marketing capability. Fujisawa,
for example, is attempting to develop its immuno-suppressant, Prograf,
internationally at its own facilities in Chicago and Munich.
The future for most Japanese pharmaceuticals companies remains grim.
Analysts forecast the domestic market will be stagnant for the rest of the
decade. The ability of Japanese drugs companies to export their way out of
difficulties is restricted. And with a lack of innovative compounds and
limited international infrastructure, Japan's global reach in
pharmaceuticals looks likely to remain severely limited.

Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile group, has reorganised
itself to take account of the closure announced last month of its fleece and

Philip Kemp, who built up the company's US operations and ran them as Dawson
Consumer Products, has resigned and leaves the board.
Nick Kuenssberg (right), formerly ceo of Dawson Premier Brands, the other
division which handled the company's knitwear and yarn operations, becomes
md of the entire company under executive chairman Sir Ronald Miller. The two
division structure, which was only introduced two years ago, disappears and
the remaining US operations will report to Kuenssberg.
Kuenssberg, 51, joined Dawson in 1991 from Coats Viyella. Peter Forrest, 55,
md of premier fibres and yarns, becomes a director. He joined Dawson in 1991
after working for the Legler Stoffel textile group in Italy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Health Service Executive has for the first time appointed an
insider as director of finance. Colin Reeves, finance director for the North
West Thames regional health authority since 1986, will succeed Gordon
Greenshields whose secondment from Coopers and Lybrand, the accountants, is
due to end this month.
Reeves, 45, has an economics degree from Clare College, Cambridge, and a
doctorate in monetary economics from Bangor University. He qualified as an
accountant in local government, joining the health service in 1984 as deputy
finance director for North West Thames. In the past two years he chaired a
group on costing.
In his new role, Reeves will be responsible for the financial management of
the health service. His priority will be to ensure that health authorities
and trusts have sound financial plans and systems to deliver the improvement
in services the government wants to see from its reform programme.
At North West Thames, Reeves worked under Alan Langlands, who was general
manager of the region before becoming NHS chief executive at the beginning
of the month. His appointment follows an open competition which attracted a
wide field of candidates from the public and private sectors.

Two senior members of the Perkins family, mainstays of Sandell Perkins, the

stepping down having reached retirement age.
David Perkins, 57, is retiring as managing director of the merged Travis
Perkins group at the end of June. His brother Timothy Perkins, who is 60 in
June, is also retiring as an executive director of the group although he
will remain non-executive chairman. Company policy is that senior executives
should retire between the ages of 57 and 60; between them the two brothers
hold less than 5 per cent of Travis Perkins shares.
David Perkins will be replaced as managing director of the group by Ted
Adams, 53, who will remain managing director of Travis Perkins Trading, the
company's main subsidiary, a position he has held since 1990.
Adams, a chartered accountant, joined timber merchants Sandell, Smythe and

FT  19 APR 94 / People: Harrison builds on his career at Tarmac
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roy Harrison, 46, has been appointed chief executive of Tarmac's housing
division, Britain's biggest housebuilder. He will take over from Sam
Pickstock who reaches 60 in August, the normal retirement age for Tarmac
directors.
Harrison, who joined Tarmac in 1971, was previously managing director of
Tarmac's building materials division. He replaces the man who was the
architect of Tarmac's rapid growth as a housebuilder during the 1980s.
The housing division, however, was strongly criticised when it failed to
react early enough to the collapse of the UK housing market. The company
continued to buy expensive housing land when prices of homes were starting
to fall. As a result, Tarmac was required to make substantial provisions
against its housing operations, but, along with other UK housebuilders, the
division is currently enjoying a resurgence.
Harrison will be replaced as managing director of the building materials
division by Anthony Hopkins, until recently vice president Tarmac America,
responsible for the group's Florida operations. John Carr, formerly md of
Tarmac Mid-Atlantic, has been appointed ceo of Tarmac America.

FT  19 APR 94 / Business and the Law: Coal and Steel Treaty clarified -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The competition rules in the European Coal and Steel Treaty may not be
enforced in national courts without a prior decision by the European
Commission, the European Court of Justice ruled last week.
The ECJ gave its ruling in the context of an action for damages by Banks, a
private coal company, against British Coal for infringement of the Coal and
Steel Treaty and/or Rome Treaty competition rules.
Banks produces coal under extraction licences granted by British Coal.
British Coal has the sole right to extract coal and to grant licences. There
are two kinds of licence. One, a 'royalty licence', obliges the licensee to
sell the coal produced to British Coal at a price specified in the licence
agreement.
In March 1990, the National Association of Licensed Open Cast Operators
(NALOO), of which Banks is a member, lodged a complaint with the European
Commission under the Coal and Steel and Rome Treaty competition rules.
First, it challenged the fairness of long term supply contracts at fixed
prices made between British Coal and the electricity generators, National
Power and PowerGen. Second, it attacked the extraction licence system as
regards both the criteria for granting licences and the level of royalty
imposed.
On May 23 1991, the Commission rejected NALOO's complaint. NALOO appealed to
the Court of First Instance which has stayed the proceedings pending the
outcome of the present case started by Banks in February 1991.
In the action for damages, Banks argued that the licence royalty level was
excessive and that the price paid under delivered licences was unreasonably
low.
In answer to the first two of six questions asked by the English High Court,
the ECJ said that only the Coal and Steel Treaty competition rules were
relevant to the case as both the extraction of unworked coal and the
businesses concerned fell within the scope of the Coal and Steel Treaty.
The general rules prohibiting restrictive agreements and misuse of a
dominant position applied. The Court said a specific rule relating only to
unfair and discriminatory product pricing practices did not apply. British
Coal could not be regarded as engaged in the sale of products where it
granted licences to extract coal.
The ECJ then said that the competition rules in question did not confer
rights which were directly enforceable by private parties in national
courts. In the case of restrictive agreements, the Treaty rule gave the
Commission sole jurisdiction to rule on the compatibility of an agreement
which would otherwise be prohibited.
As long as such incompatibility had not been established by the Commission
itself, individuals could not contend in national proceedings that an
agreement was incompatible.
Similarly, in the context of misuse of a dominant position, the Treaty rule
reserved to the Commission the power to verify whether a dominant position
was held or acquired and being used for prohibited purposes. The ECJ said
that the sole jurisdiction of the Commission precluded individuals from
relying directly on that provision in national courts.
The fourth question was whether national courts could or must award damages
for breach of the competition rules in question. The fifth asked whether
that power or obligation depended on a prior decision of the Commission, the
exhaustion of remedies available under the Coal and Steel Treaty and/or
completion of the steps or procedures indicated in the relevant provisions.
The ECJ said that since the Commission had sole jurisdiction subject only to
review by the CFI and ECJ, the national courts may not entertain an action
for damages in the absence of a Commission decision.
The Court ruled that the decisions taken by the Commission were binding in
their entirety on the national courts in accordance with the Coal and Steel
Treaty rule to that effect. However, the national courts may still ask the
ECJ to rule on the validity or interpretation of those decisions.

FT  19 APR 94 / Business and the Law: Fortune in VAT rests on company car
rule - An appeal to lift a Customs &amp; Excise order may involve a government
bill of up to Pounds 15bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A British Customs &amp; Excise 'blocking order' which prevents businesses from
recovering Value Added Tax on the purchase of company cars is illegal and
should be lifted, according to several UK clearing banks.
The banks, led by Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, have lodged an appeal
with the VAT Tribunal which claims the blocking order is incompatible with
the European Sixth Directive on VAT. That forms the principal measure for
the harmonisation of VAT in the European Union.
If they win their case, the banks stand to recover hundreds of millions of
pounds in VAT paid by their leasing operations on the purchase of cars for
leasing since 1978 when the Sixth Directive came into effect in the UK.
That may be only the tip of the iceberg. Since news of the appeal first
leaked out, some of the 'Big Six' accountancy firms have been advising their
leasing company clients to lodge claims for repayment of VAT with the VAT
tribunal as a precautionary measure.
According to Mr Dominic Taylor, a VAT specialist with City solicitors
Ashurst Morris Crisp, who has been advising the banks on the issue, six
weeks ago a total of 37 companies had lodged protective claims involving
amounts up to Pounds 1bn. Since then, claims have been coming in on a daily
basis.
Customs &amp; Excise estimates that if the blocking order is declared unlawful
and the government has to repay VAT on the purchase of cars back to 1978, it
may face a repayment bill of up to Pounds 6bn for the leasing companies
alone. If it has to repay all the UK companies who have purchased cars for
business use during the same period, the total bill could be as high as
Pounds 15bn.
Sources at Barclays indicate that the appeal was lodged in order to force a
change in the law, not to recover huge sums in VAT repayments. Other leasing
companies are thought to feel the same way. But Mr Taylor says many of
Britain's companies operating large company car fleets will have no such
qualms. In either case,the government faces a significant tax problem.
By the VAT regime, businesses which make goods or provide services subject
to VAT are allowed to deduct the VAT or 'input tax' on goods and services
which they buy-in. This ensures that VAT is not paid on more than the full
value of the finished product.
The UK has had a blocking order in place since 1973 which generally prevents
deduction of input tax on cars. The order does not apply to car dealers, who
re-sell cars as new, to taxis, or to cars bought for short term hire by
companies such as Hertz. The impact of this blocking order on cars bought by
leasing companies for leasing purposes is dramatic.
If a leasing company buys a car for Pounds 10,000, it pays VAT at 17.5 per
cent on the purchase price which it is not allowed to deduct. The total cost
of the car is thus Pounds 11,750. If it then leases the car on a three-year
lease to another company, the leasing charge will be calculated on a base
cost of Pounds 11,750, to which will be added interest over three years plus
charges for maintenance and so-on.
That figure is divided by 36 to give the monthly charge of the lease, on
which a further 17.5 per cent VAT is payable by the lessee. 'This clearly
represents a form of double taxation which is contrary to the principles of
the European Sixth VAT directive', says Mr Taylor.
The impact of the blocking order on companies which make goods or provide
services subject to VAT is not so significant, as they can deduct the 17.5
per cent VAT on the actual leasing payments, he adds.
But the order has the effect that it raises the base cost of leasing cars,
thereby putting UK company fleet hirers at a disadvantage to other EU member
states where the deduction of VAT on the purchase of cars is allowed.
That is of concern to the UK leasing industry, which is worried that, as the
European single market becomes more firmly established, it may lose the
custom of UK company fleets to the more competitively priced European
market.
But their real concern is that the blocking order severely restricts the car
leasing market in the UK by making leasing prohibitively expensive for
businesses such as banks and insurance companies, which do not supply
taxable goods or services, and which therefore can not deduct VAT on lease
rentals.
A bank which wanted to lease a car for an employee would effectively be
taxed on the lease at a VAT rate equivalent of between 38-40 per cent, Mr
Taylor says.
The net result is that banks and insurance companies, the Post Office, the
health service, educational establishments, and other big business users of
cars, do not lease cars. Perhaps more importantly, neither do private
individuals, who tend instead to opt for hire purchase agreements where
there is only one charge to tax.
For companies which buy rather than lease their cars, there is arguably an
element of double taxation in the VAT paid by consumers on the final value
of their goods and services. Most would be happy for the blocking order to
be lifted so that the cost of purchasing company cars for business use could
be reduced.
Why, if the blocking order was outlawed in 1978 by the Sixth Directive, has
it taken so long for the leasing companies via their parent banks to
challenge its legality?
Mr Taylor says that, until recently, they had assumed the order was legal
and that there was little they could do to change it. The directive allows
states to retain some blocking orders if they were in place before it came
into force. But it now appears that the UK cars order does not fall into the
category of allowable blocking orders.
The banks made a complaint two years ago to the European Commission in
Brussels against the UK as they recognised that the approaching Single
market could further undermine their position in the leasing market. That
took place under article 169 of the Rome Treaty, for failure to implement
properly the directive.
The Commission took it up and began discussions with the UK government,
which has until June to remedy the situation or face proceedings in the
European Court of Justice.
The banks then challenged Customs about the blocking order, asking them to
lift it. Customs refused, so they lodged an appeal with the VAT tribunal and
put in claims for repayment of tax not deducted going back to 1978.
Barclays insists that was done purely 'to gain Customs' attention', not to
recover the tax. It appears to have worked. Mr Taylor says that although
Customs is believed to have been aware that the order might be illegal for
more than five years, it has now responded positively. It has carried out a
review of the blocking order and put a paper to ministers. The likely
outcome is that the blocking order will be abolished in next year's finance
bill.
There will be a quid pro quo however. Part of the reason for not allowing
VAT deduction on cars is the high proportion of private use of company cars.
Leasing companies do not use cars at all for private use, so they should get
the full VAT deduction once the order is lifted. But in companies where
there is a degree of private as well as business use, Customs wants a charge
to VAT to reflect the extent to which cars are used for private purposes.
It is considering introducing a VAT scale charge along the lines of the
Inland Revenue's scale benefit charge to income tax paid by individuals on
their company cars. The VAT charge would be payable by companies, but there
would still be a saving to the extent that the charge would not be payable
on business use. Companies such as British Telecom, which only allow company
cars to be used for business purposes, should escape the VAT charge
altogether.
If these changes are made, the only outstanding issue will be the extent of
the government's liability to repay VAT going back to 1978.
When the VAT tribunal considers the appeals later this year, Mr Taylor
considers it nearly certain to refer the issue to the European Court in
Luxembourg. It is likely to be at least two years before the issue is
resolved. Even were the court to rule the blocking order illegal, it is not
certain to order that all the tax should be repaid. There is a principle of
'unjust enrichment' to be tested, Mr Taylor says.
Whatever the outcome, the government will not escape scot-free. Customs
estimates that the cost of transition to a new system of charging private
use will be Pounds 1bn in the first year - representing the shortfall
between what it would have received in VAT on the sale of cars to businesses
and what it will receive under the new scale charge. That is estimated to
reduce to Pounds 600m in the second year and to zero by the third year. But
Mr Taylor believes that these 'back of the envelope' calculations may yet
prove wildly optimistic.

FT  19 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Inventing a hybrid -
Richard Gourlay reports on plans to make the UK Companies Act more relevant
to smaller concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week the UK government asked the Law Commission to carry out a
feasibility study on whether company law could be made more relevant for
small and medium-sized companies.
In granting the Commission wide terms of reference, Neil Hamilton, the
corporate affairs minister, said he wanted to ensure company law achieved
its aims in the simplest way while imposing the 'minimum burdens on
business'.
To some this review is long overdue. As it stands, the Companies Act covers
every incorporated company from the multinational with thousands of
employees to the family-owned company employing a handful of people.
Large parts of the law define the responsibilities of directors in PLCs
where management is divorced from the shareholders who control the company.
Yet for many smaller companies, the separation of ownership and control is a
fiction only recognised by the Companies Act.
Many requirements, like holding annual shareholders meetings, circulating
agenda and even board meetings are not relevant and either do not happen or
are time-wasting formalities. Owner-managers are more likely to discuss
important business matters over breakfast than in a board meeting.
One option the Department of Trade and Industry wants the Law Commission to
examine is the feasibility of a hybrid limited liability partnership that
would fall somewhere between an incorporated company and the sole trader or
partnership.
Yet despite the apparent need for a review, the announcement of the Law
Commission's study has provoked a less than overwhelmingly positive
response. Some small business groups say it is 'an example of government
tendency to focus on the wrong issues'.
If the DTI had really wanted to cut what the corporate affairs minister
called the 'burdens on business', they add, it would have focused on cutting
the cost businesses incur complying with government regulations.
Graham Bannock and Partners, the private-sector research group specialising
in the smaller business sector, estimates 2 per cent of gross domestic
product is spent by UK companies on compliance - that is understanding and
compiling PAYE, VAT and National Insurance returns and dealing with their
respective inspectors.
Business spends an amount equal to a further 2 per cent complying with other
business regulations such as health and safety requirements, and sick pay.
And smaller companies bear disproportionately more of this compliance cost
relative to their turnover because of diseconomies of scale - it takes a
bookkeeper almost as much time understanding and compiling a payroll for
five people as it does for 25 people.
While changes to company law might bring modest benefits compared with a
move to allow companies to file all their tax returns on one form and
subsequently deal with one government inspector, the Law Commission's
feasibility study is nevertheless a valuable exercise.
'I could probably take you through a large part of the Companies Act and
pick holes in it in terms of its relevance to smaller companies,' says Diana
Faber, the Law Commissioner in charge of the study. 'However, the interests
of creditors in businesses are as important to the economy as the interests
of small businesses.'
In examining the feasibility of the hybrid limited liability partnership,
the Law Commission will be able to draw on the Gower Report laid before
Parliament in a green paper in 1981. Professor Jim Gower's recommendations
were not taken up because of lack of support from business at the time but
his proposals are nevertheless instructive.
Gower proposed a limited liability partnership designed for small family
concerns where there were fewer than 10 partners or 'members'. Unlike the
widely used ordinary partnership, the limited partnership would have a legal
personality. This would mean it could contract to take on debts by giving
banks a floating charge over its assets.
As one of the main reasons for incorporating is to raise finance via
floating charges, the limited partnership could help many family-owned
businesses avoid incorporating. Gower suggested this partnership would have
to file accounts - presumably to provide some protection to unsecured
creditors who could not take legal action against the assets of the
'members' whose liability would be limited.
And in an attempt to avoid reinventing the wheel, the Law Commission is also
likely to look at the experience in countries such as Canada, the US and
South Africa where new corporate structures have been established.
Lastly, the Commission could recommend no changes to company law, on the
grounds that no reform would help. One problem the Law Commission faces is
identifying exactly why owner-managed businesses incorporate. The status of
limited liability is one factor. Tax is another and probably the single
issue that will make or break any recommendations for change.
The Law Commission will have to steer a path that makes any new hybrid legal
entity acceptable both to the Treasury and to the owner-manager's pocket.

FT  19 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Help when you're all at
sea - Exporting / Ian Hamilton Fazey offers a run-down of places offering
advice to traders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British government help for UK exporters used to come from the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, scattered through embassies around the world, along
with the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK. But for the last two
years government initiatives have been run by a joint directorate known as
Overseas Trade Services.
Industrial leaders, senior civil servants and export lobbyists say services
are improving;
nevertheless, where to go for advice has always been a problem for small
businesses. The latest attempt to solve it, a planned nationwide network of
200 one-stop shops called Business Links, is supposed to end the confusion
presented by an array of enterprise agencies, chambers of commerce, training
and enterprise councils and other initiatives.
However, there are only a handful of experimental ones at present - and
probably only about 60 or 70 will play a 'hub' role.
For the moment, one way of tapping into overseas trade services is to
telephone the nearest regional DTI office, or the Welsh Office, Scottish
Office or Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board.
Information is the prime tool available, much of it generated by the
government at taxpayers' expense. Indeed, the Treasury is making the DTI
justify the Pounds 173m annual cost. This annoys the CBI and people like Ian
Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export, who say the UK's
foreign competitors do similar things and the UK cannot afford not to.
A quarter of the staff of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are in
commercial posts. There are 203 sections around the world, of which 12 are
in the US, seven in Germany and five in France. British staff in each
section do a four-year tour of duty, supported by local staff. About 6,000
market information reports are produced each year, so the information base
is vast and should be helpful, if only as a starting point. It can be
supplemented by other services.
The Export Market Information Centre in London (071 215 5444/5445) allows
you to do your own desk research from government databases, published
directories, trade statistics and market reports.
There is an automated service matching companies to new export intelligence
received daily by DTI. This is available through Prelink (081 900 1313).
The government offers online access from your office computer to all its
export intelligence through FT Profile (0932 76144), the electronic database
owned by the Financial Times.
Market Information Enquiries will assemble a tailor-made package of
information on export opportunities for products, processes or services. It
charges Pounds 35 for basic information and then in four-hour units for more
complicated inquiries ranging from an initial Pounds 70 up to Pounds 355 for
between 16 and 24 hours' work.
The Export Marketing Research Scheme is more specific and detailed,
providing professional advice and financial support, whether the work is
done in-house or by a professional consultant.
The Export Representative Service will help find a representative overseas
through the government's own experts in the market concerned. The charge is
Pounds 355 for up to 24 hours' work, Pounds 710 for up to 48 hours and
Pounds 1,065 for longer.
Overseas Status Reports provide assessments of the suitability of potential
representatives or companies you want to do business with, but not
creditworthiness. Charges are similar to those for Market Information
Enquiries.
Trade Fair Support pays for half the space and gives a fixed construction
grant for up to three exhibitions in each market, but up to five in Japan
and some parts of Germany and the US.
New Products from Britain is a media relations service; Pounds 60 buys a
professionally written news story aimed at securing editorial coverage in
appropriate media in target markets.
Trade Missions, organised by chambers of commerce or trade associations, are
subsidised. Many companies find them a cheap way of sampling a market at
first hand and for making contacts for subsequent visits. Reciprocal social
obligations will usually involve attending a couple of receptions.
The Programme Arranging Service usually builds on market information
obtained through Market Information Enquiries, the Export Marketing Research
Scheme or the Export Representative Service. It helps arrange appointments
and gives advice on local business and culture in your target market.
In-Market Help goes one step further, offering accompanied visits by local
commercial experts and a de-briefing afterwards to help you consider your
next steps.
This concludes the series. Previous articles have appeared on February 1, 8,
22, March 8, 22, April 5.

Pounds 1.4bn - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK venture capitalists invested Pounds 1.4bn in 1,202 companies worldwide in
1993, almost the same amount as the previous year, according to the British
Venture Capital Association.
Nineteen per cent of the number of financings were in start-ups and early
stage businesses. By value management buy-outs and buy-ins accounted for
Pounds 769m, or 62 per cent of the amount invested. The average size of
MBO/MBI increased by 38 per cent to Pounds 3.3m.

FT  19 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Report on the future of
the USM - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On Thursday the board of the London Stock Exchange will catch a glimpse of
findings from a Mori survey gauging whether or not the Unlisted Securities
Market should be replaced.
The survey conducted among a wide range of stock market practitioners,
venture capital houses and the directors of unquoted businesses was
delivered to the Stock Exchange in March. But the Exchange is unlikely to
release the raw survey material or any recommendations to the board for at
least a month.
When the Stock Exchange's Smaller Companies Working Party finished
discussing the case for an 'enterprise market' last year, market
practitioners sensed hostility towards the idea from the Exchange.
Since then Michael Lawrence, the Stock Exchange's new chief executive, has
been taking soundings from advocates of a new enterprise market, some of
whom now sense a greater degree of support.
The USM closes at the end of 1996 but no new listings will be accepted after
this year. Those who support a replacement argue that if investors cannot
see an exit route for their investments they are less likely to provide
capital at an early stage to small but potentially rapidly growing
companies.

FT  19 APR 94 / Early tax cuts unlikely, says Tory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the Commons Treasury committee,
warned yesterday that tax cuts in the 'very near future' were unlikely.
Mr Watts said there were no inflation or exchange rate constraints that
would prevent Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, from making a further
reduction in interest rates if he thought it necessary to stimulate the
economy.
The Treasury has already opened this year's public-spending battle with its
own warning that there will be no room for tax cuts before the general
election unless ministers rein back a threatened overshoot in Whitehall
budgets.
'Mr Watts' comments underline what ministers have been saying privately for
some time - that there is no scope for tax cuts for the foreseeable future,'
a Whitehall official said.
While Mr Watts would like Mr Clarke to cut taxes as soon as possible, he
made clear he did not think 'that means in the very near future.
'After taking the political flak for bringing the deficit under control we
would not have much credibility if we decided to cut taxes because the
government is not very popular,' Mr Watts continued. 'Just because the
public sector borrowing requirement is not as bad as we think does not mean
we can start to cut taxes.'
However, he argued that if the government made faster progress in
eliminating borrowings then tax cuts would come return to the political
agenda.
Mr Watts argued that there was neither an inflation constraint nor an
exchange rate constraint that would prevent the chancellor from making a
further reduction in interest rates if he thought that was necessary.
Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary, said the issue of tax had
destroyed the government's credibility in the run-up to next month's local
government elections.
'The issue of tax has destroyed the Tories' credibility,' she said. 'In
1992, they told the electorate that they would cut taxes,' she said. 'Now,
as we approach the local elections of 1994, up and down Britain, people are
seeing this promise betrayed with the biggest tax hike in history.'

FT  19 APR 94 / Consumer hopes 'near record low'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers' confidence about their financial prospects is close to an
all-time low, says a survey released by Gallup yesterday.
The survey, conducted by Gallup for the European Commission, follows a
relatively downbeat survey on retail sales from the Confederation of British
Industry and offers further evidence that this month's tax increases may
dent consumer spending.
Gallup asked people how they thought their households' financial position
would change over the next 12 months. Of those interviewed, 45 per cent
think their position will become slightly or much worse while only 15 per
cent think things will improve. The negative balance of 30 percentage points
is the worst since March 1990.
Gallup says the figures indicate that the tax increases are having 'an acute
adverse effect on consumer confidence and give rise to concerns that
economic recovery might be stalled'.
But it adds that confidence is approaching historically low levels, and is
therefore unlikely to fall significantly further.
Consumer views of the UK's economic prospects have also deteriorated, with
43 per cent of those surveyed pessimistic compared with 21 per cent who are
optimistic. The negative balance of 22 percentage points compares with the
position in January, when the number of optimists equalled the number of
pessimists.
However, consumers have become relatively more upbeat about the prospects
for employment since March - although pessimists still outnumber optimists
by 37 percentage points.
A balance of 12 percentage points regard the present as the right time to
make a substantial purchase, the highest level recorded for three months.
Gallup interviewed 1,991 adults between March 30 and April 12.

FT  19 APR 94 / Curry's guilty of race bias
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A black salesman for electrical retailers Curry's, sacked after swearing at
a company race equality executive he mistook for a waitress, was a victim of
racial discrimination, an industrial tribunal ruled today.
Tribunal chairman Ms Barbara Calvert QC said Mr Dion Deleon would not have
been dismissed for gross misconduct if he had been white.
She said part of the reason for his sacking was his rowdy behaviour, but
noisy white employees with him were not even given a warning.
Company claims that his rowdy behaviour had brought them into disrepute,
because he was wearing a tie with 'Curry's' written on it, had not been
proved.

FT  19 APR 94 / Directors' training priorities revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equal opportunities, foreign languages and international competitiveness are
the three topics on which newly appointed senior managers and directors are
the least likely to receive training, says the Industrial Society, Lisa Wood
writes.
Business planning and people management are the two top training topics in
the society's latest training trends survey of 458 managers.
Some 44 per cent of senior managers, for example, said that management of
people was their current priority for the training of senior staff. By
comparison, international competitiveness came at the bottom of the list.
Board level directors expressed slightly more interest in international
competitiveness, although it still came at the bottom end of their list.

FT  19 APR 94 / Output prices inch upwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Official figures released yesterday show that inflationary pressures remain
subdued.
The Central Statistical Office reported a monthly increase of just 0.1 per
cent in producer output prices - the price of goods leaving factory gates -
in March. In the year to the end of the month output prices increased by 2.7
per cent, which compares with a an annual rise of 3.4 per cent in February.
The annual rate was last as low as this in September 1992, when the UK left
the European exchange rate mechanism, and has not been lower since February
1987.
The underlying measure of output price inflation, which excludes food,
beverages, tobacco and petroleum, increased by 2.5 per cent in the 12 months
to March, unchanged from the annual rate of growth in February and in line
with expectations. In the three months to March, underlying output prices
grew at an annualised rate of just 0.8 per cent.
The CSO said an important reason for the slowing in the annual rate of
output prices is that there was no spring Budget this year and therefore no
new excise duty rises feeding into the figures.
Producer input prices - the cost of materials and fuels purchased by
manufacturers - increased by 0.3 per cent in March compared with February,
but fell 2.6 per cent in the year to March. It was the fifth consecutive
month in which the annual rate was negative, but the rate of decline was
slower than February's 2.9 per cent. Analysts were expecting on average a
3.7 per cent fall.

FT  19 APR 94 / Race body prefers carrots to sticks: Employers play a big
part in the plans of CRE's chairman Herman Ouseley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Calls from the Commission for Racial Equality for stronger powers to combat
racial discrimination may be answered by government action later this year.
The commission conducted a formal review of the 1976 Race Relations Act two
years ago and presented the government with more than 30 proposals for
change.
There was no immediate response and Mr Herman Ouseley, the statutory
commission's first black chairman, took on his post a year ago this week
aware that the government was unlikely to agree to the proposed reforms.
Mr Ouseley said in an interview with the Financial Times, however, that
discussions with the Home Office on possible changes have continued during
his first year in office. The commission had to recognise, he said, that
some changes it would ideally like to see remained unacceptable to the
government. In such circumstances, the discussions had tried to find
different ways of addressing concerns raised by the commission's review of
the act.
'I am confident that some time during the course of this year we will get a
result,' he said. 'I don't know what that will be yet, but I have to remain
hopeful. I should be extremely disappointed if we did not get something out
of it.'
The commission's review resulted in calls for statutory ethnic monitoring of
employees, with a duty on employers to adopt goals and timetables for
improving equality of opportunity in the workplace; powers for the
government to require ethnic record-keeping in housing, education and other
services; wider powers for the commission to conduct formal investigations;
a new definition of indirect discrimination; and a specific law against
incitement to religious hatred.
Since becoming chairman Mr Ouseley has restructured the commission to enable
it to work more closely with other agencies. While retaining its
law-enforcement role, he wants the commission to give support to employers
and others and to encourage good practice.
'I want us to work positively, but unless people know we have the law as a
weapon in our armoury, and that there are penalties to be paid for
discrimination, we are tooth-less.'
Ministers are believed to be particularly concerned that race-relations law
should not hamper employment prospects and economic growth. Against this,
however, there are pressures for tougher action - the recession has
increased the already disproportionate levels of unemployment among
Britain's ethnic minority communities, while racial harassment and attacks
and the political activities of the far-right British National Party have
grown.
The BNP won its first local authority seat in a by-election at Tower
Hamlets, east London, in September and is fighting hard to strengthen its
position in Tower Hamlets and neighbouring Newham in next month's council
elections. Both boroughs have high levels of racial violence and other
incidents.
Mr Ouseley said the commission wanted national and local politicians to give
a stronger lead in condemning the activities of groups like the BNP,
combined with action to tackle the social conditions in the inner cities
which provided breeding grounds for extremist organisations.
'We do not believe enough is happening except on the odd occasion when there
is a major event like the BNP by-election victory, when all the leaders come
out and say 'this is unfortunate', 'this is unacceptable', 'something has
got to be done', 'how awful it is'. And then we hear no more. There has got
to be a sustained attack on extremism, racism and racial hatred in our
society.'
The commission plans new ways of rewarding employers who pursue successful
equal-opportunities policies. Introduction of an accreditation scheme is
being considered. The commission is also supporting the work of a group of
leading companies, co-ordinated by Business in the Community, which is
examining ways of adding a racial-equality dimension to Opportunity 2000,
the campaign to enhance equal opportunities in the workplace for women.
'There are many successes,' Mr Ouseley said. 'We can spread good practice
and accelerate progress by giving accolades to organisations and individuals
who contribute to better race relations.'

FT  19 APR 94 / Tightening of export rules may pre-empt Scott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has been tightening export regulations in a move that may
pre-empt some of the recommendations of the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
The DTI has briefed companies in recent weeks on the new regulations, which
mainly involve applications for licences on potentially defence-related dual
use goods. The regulations particularly affect machine tool companies.
The Department of Trade and Industry has revised and updated licensing forms
to include detailed questions about the final user and use of goods.
Companies are being asked whether machine tools for export can be used in
nuclear or chemical warfare manufacturing. They are also being asked for
detailed statements from customers on the final destination of exports.
Lord Justice Scott is thought to be considering recommendations on reforming
export and licensing procedures. His inquiry has heard evidence that
ministers, officials and executives connived in exploiting loopholes in
licensing procedures.
Britain sold nearly Dollars 93m in machine tools to Iraq between 1987 and
1989 - more than manufacturers in the US, Italy, and France put together,
according to official UK figures.
Last night the DTI denied that it was reacting to or pre-empting the Scott
inquiry. It said tighter licensing procedures had been introduced in the
aftermath of seizure of long-range parts for the Iraqi supergun in April
1990. Three weeks ago the DTI launched a new code of practice and an export
control training initiative which it claims is aimed at making it easier for
companies to understand the licensing system.
Within the machine tool industry reactions to the new government initiatives
have been mixed.
Mr Malcolm Taylor, managing director of Bridgeport Machines, said a
licensing system that aimed to control the movement of machine tools was
'totally impracticable'. At the industry's annual trade fair in Birmingham
last week, Mr Taylor said the end-use and end-user of a sophisticated
dual-use machine tool was a 'moving target' which the exporter could not
control.
'Machine tools can be used to make whatever the end user chooses. A transit
van can be used to carry milk or munitions,' he said.
He was also critical of the impact on the machine tool industry of the Scott
inquiry. 'I would have preferred it if the Scott inquiry had never happened.
We are washing our dirty linen in public and hanging it out for all the
world to see. There is not a country in the world that punishes its
exporters in the way we do.'
However, Mr Keith Bailey, chairman of BSA Tools, one of the companies most
directly affected financially by the Iraq affair, said the Scott inquiry had
forced the DTI to be clearer in describing its policy to business leaders.
It had also made companies more diligent in pursuing potentially sensitive
dual-use contracts.
Mr Bailey said: 'In the pre-Scott days it was very much a nod and a wink
with the DTI saying, 'We don't want to know about your goods, so don't tell
us, carry on'. Now the DTI is in effect saying, 'You tell us everything and
we'll tell you what you can do and how far you can go'. Policy is
understood.'

FT  19 APR 94 / Recovery is hesitant, say Yorkshire area chambers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery is 'hesitant and unexciting', says the latest quarterly survey
by the Yorkshire and Humberside region's 13 chambers of commerce and
industry.
A similar picture was revealed in the north-west last week with results from
11 chambers suggesting the recovery was uneven and faltering.
Some 1,221 companies took part in the Yorkshire and Humberside survey. The
results showed slowly rising sales in home and export markets since the
third quarter of 1992.
The overall picture is healthy with nearly a third of companies working at
full capacity, said Mr Ian Kelly of Leeds and Bradford Chamber Services,
which co-ordinated the survey. However, orders are faltering slightly, Mr
Kelly warned.
Service companies showed faster sales growth than manufacturers in home
markets in the first quarter of the year while manufacturers did better in
exports.
Confidence remained generally high, with most companies expecting
profitability to improve in the next 12 months.
On balance, manufacturers continued to shed labour in the last quarter;
however most manufacturers expected to enlarge their payrolls in the coming
quarter. Most companies also had trouble recruiting qualified or trained
staff.

FT  19 APR 94 / Shortage of homes 'inhibits market'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Too few people are putting homes on sale at realistic prices and this is
inhibiting a full recovery in the market, says a survey of more than 100
estate agents today.
The survey, conducted by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, says
a shortage of homes for sale is holding back the market even though sales
rose last month.
Mr Michael Pattison, institution chief executive, said: 'While buyer
interest grows as the house-hunting season proceeds, purchasers remain
hard-headed about price, frustrating the hopes of vendors who, although,
keen to sell, wait for significant rises in values.'
'We are encouraged by the evidence that there has been some upward movement
in prices. But . . . would-be sellers should be warned against expectations
of dramatic increases in prices.'
The survey says 77 per cent of agents in England and Wales said prices had
remained static in the three months to the end of March while 18 per cent
said prices had risen.

FT  19 APR 94 / Lord Scott will resist restrictions on Iraq enquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Justice Scott has told Whitehall officials that he will resist any
attempt by the government to place unjustified restrictions on his
arms-for-Iraq inquiry, Jimmy Burns writes.
The judge told a meeting of officials last week that he was determined 'to
make available to the public as much information' as he could in his report,
which is due to be published before the end of the year.
The judge states in a memorandum for the meeting: 'This inquiry was
established because of public concern about the way in which government
policy operated in relation to defence and defence-related sales to Iraq. It
would be impossible to allay public concern if material were unnecessarily
withheld.'
The judge will halt publication of the whole or parts of a document only if
he feels public disclosure might cause 'serious injury to the interests of
the nation', might create a serious risk of harm to an individual or if
there was a risk of serious prejudice to legal proceedings.
He intends to seek written evidence from ministers and officials. He also
plans to ask permanent secretaries to comment on the performance of their
departments.
The government has been encouraging officials and ministers to co-operate
with the probe. But an official said last night the judge's procedures for
publishing the report would need to be discussed.

FT  19 APR 94 / Power group wins supply contract
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Electricity has secured a contract to supply power to BOC, the
large industrial gas producer with 23 sites in the UK.
The contract was made possible by the easing of the electricity market which
allows users of more than 100KW a year to shop around for suppliers.
BOC said Yorkshire won the business 'on the lowest price in what turned out
to be a complex shifting market'.

FT  19 APR 94 / Scots bank starts direct service
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday became the latest bank to enter the
telephone banking market as it launched its national Direct Banking service
to run in addition to its branch network.
The launch of the 24-hour service follows three pilot projects which have
been running since last April involving 30,000 customers. The bank aims to
have 300,000 customers using the new service by the end of this year.
The service, available to all personal customers, is free apart from the
cost of the calls, which are charged at local rates.
Midland Bank offers telephone banking through its independent offshoot,
First Direct, which was launched in 1989, while National Westminster also
offers a telephone service in which the customer talks to a person rather
than a computer. Barclays, Lloyds and TSB are among the other banks
developing personal-contact telephone banking projects.

But the number of passengers passing through Aberdeen fell 6 per cent.
Cargo traffic through BAA airports rose 17 per cent in March compared with
the same period last year, taking annual traffic in the financial year to
1.2m tonnes, 13 per cent higher than the previous year.

FT  19 APR 94 / Revival of US airline talks urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Airlines, the largest US carrier, yesterday urged the US and UK
governments to link their approval for the proposed partnership between
Virgin Atlantic Airways and Delta Air Lines of the US with the revival of
broader negotiations on a new transatlantic aviation agreement between the
two countries.
Mr Stephen Wolf, United's chairman, yesterday said the proposed Virgin-Delta
deal required changes in the bilateral aviation agreement between the US and
the UK.
The Virgin-Delta ticket code-sharing partnership, which requires the
approval of both the US and UK governments, should provide the impetus to
produce 'substantive amendments' to the bilateral agreement to correct 'a
variety of long-standing deficiencies in the agreement', Mr Wolf told the
Aviation Club of Great Britain.
United's position is likely to strengthen the UK government's efforts to
revive the bilateral talks after the US walked away from the negotiations
earlier this year.
The US has insisted on greater access immediately for all US carriers into
London's Heathrow Airport as part of any new 'open skies' agreement with the
UK.
The UK, which is seeking further access to the US domestic market for UK
carriers as well as the lifting of restriction on foreign ownership of US
airlines, proposes a three-stage approach to 'open skies' and access for US
carriers to Heathrow.
United in particular wants changes to to allow it to serve its main US hub
of Chicago from Heathrow. But it also favours the UK's gradual approach to
liberalisation.
Mr Wolf stressed that United did not favour an 'all-or-nothing approach' but
was urging the two governments to identify 'discrete areas in which progress
is clearly possible and focus their immediate negotiating efforts on those
areas'.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, hopes to hold preliminary talks
with Mr Federico Pena, his US opposite number, in the next few days to
follow up on the opportunity the Virgin-Delta deal has given the two
governments to reopen negotiations.
Before its alliance with Virgin, Delta had urged the US government to
renounce the bilateral agreement.

FT  19 APR 94 / Engineers set to cut 40,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The engineering industry is likely to shed a further 40,000 jobs in the next
12 months in spite of a forecast rise in output, the Engineering Employers
Federation said yesterday.
The cuts will come on top of 400,000 in the industry since 1990, reducing
the workforce by 19 per cent to 1.7m. The federation says 30,000 jobs went
last year, but the underlying trend is down sharply from cuts of 120,000 to
130,000 in each of the three previous years.
The employment forecast was part of a cautiously optimistic assessment of
the outlook in the federation's twice-yearly economic trends report. After a
temporary dip at the end of 1993, engineering output is set to rise again at
a gradually accelerating rate, it says.
Mr Graham Mackenzie, the federation's acting director-general, said the
engineering sector was at a turning point after the recession. The
federation's statistics, along with other evidence, were all 'pretty
positive'.
The federation's forecast coincided with an upbeat report from the Machine
Tool Technologies Association following last week's Metcut '94 exhibition in
Birmingham.
Mr Stan Vaughan, president of the association, said: 'Recovery in the
machine tool industry is clearly taking place.'
The Engineering Employers' Federation makes clear that, although output is
beginning to recover, the forecast growth will not be sufficient to maintain
employment levels in the industry.
It predicts that engineering output will rise 3 per cent in the 18 months
from the second half of 1993 to the first half of 1995. But, with
productivity increasing by 4 per cent to 5 per cent a year, output would
have to rise by the same amount just to keep employment stable.
For engineering employment to grow, output would need to rise by 6 per cent
to 7 per cent a year, which would not be sustainable for any length of time,
said Mr Mackenzie.
Within the engineering industry, the federation expects a similar pattern in
the next 18 months as in the period from the first half of 1992 to the
second half of 1993, with strong growth in electronics and vehicles offset
by a continuing fall in aerospace output.
Mr Ian Thompson, economic adviser, also warned that the UK trade deficit
might worsen if the UK began a recovery led by consumer spending, while
continental Europe, which accounts for 60 per cent of UK trade in
engineering products, is recovering only slowly from the recession.
He said an upturn in UK investment spending would be the key to cyclical
recovery for the engineering industry. Fixed investment fell 26 per cent
from the beginning of 1990 to the end of 1993, and based on historical data
a recovery is long overdue.
Mr Thompson forecasts a steady rise in fixed investment in manufacturing and
non-manufacturing sectors over the next 18 months. This had been borne out
by the improved sentiment at Metcut. Mr Vaughan said manufacturers were
taking new orders all week and the level of genuine inquiries had been
'almost overwhelming'.

FT  19 APR 94 / City seeks mediation work: London body aims to offer fast
arbitration of financial disputes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A City body to settle disputes among banks, brokers and large companies over
financial transactions was launched yesterday in an attempt to establish
London as the world centre for financial services arbitration.
The City Disputes Panel, founded by law firms, professional bodies and QCs
with the backing of several banks, aims to provide arbitration and mediation
services similar to those supplied in London to the world maritime industry.
The founding members said the panel, which will offer arbitration on
financial disputes involving share underwriting and over-the-counter
financial derivatives, would provide a counterpart to conciliation schemes
for small investors.
They said it would be able to settle disputes far more quickly than the
Commercial Court in England and the Court of Session in Scotland. Its
tribunals of three members would also be able to operate at a fraction of
the cost of courts.
The panel, which is being supported by the Corporation of London, will
attempt to establish a reputation for efficient arbitration with the aim of
attracting banks in other world financial centres to London to settle their
disputes.
Lord Kingsdown, the former governor of the Bank of England who is president
of the panel, said the specialist knowledge of panel members would allow
'the speedy dispatch of disputes'.
Mr Richard Freeman, the panel's chief executive, said the panel would try to
attract banks, fund managers, insurance companies and stockbrokers to join
at an annual cost of Pounds 400. Only members would be allowed to refer
disputes.
He said the panel would also like to recruit large companies, which are
involved with banks and investment banks in many transactions on wholesale
financial markets. 'We think that is a realistic aspiration,' he said.
Lord Ackner, a member of the working party that drew up a set of model
arbitration rules, said he expected banks to seek arbitration where the law
was well-established and the issues involved were not too financially
complex.
He added that he did not believe cases such as the dispute between local
authorities and banks over interest-rate swaps would have been suitable for
arbitration because they involved areas where law was uncertain.
Mr Freeman said he hoped the panel would arbitrate on disputes involving
developing areas of wholesale finance, including financial derivatives and
electronic banking for corporate customers.
Awards of the arbitration panel would be enforceable by law, although both
parties would have to agree to arbitration before its use. The panel hopes
to be able to examine issues within hours if required.

FT  19 APR 94 / Hopes rise over Malaysia trade ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British defence companies seeking contracts in Malaysia hope that a ban on
business with companies from Britain will soon be lifted.
Malaysia announced the ban in late February in retaliation for unfavourable
British press reports - in particular about Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime
minister.
Malaysia has been a big buyer of British defence equipment in recent years,
and British companies form the largest contingent at a defence exhibition
which opens in Kuala Lumpur today.
General Borhan Ahmad, head of Malaysia's defence forces, said the country
would continue to use British-made equipment and hinted at further purchases
from the UK. 'We can't just throw our British equipment into the river and
forget about it,' he said.
Some British companies saw the general's comments as evidence of a shift in
Malaysian policy. Others point out that Malaysia seems to be asking either
for an apology from The Sunday Times, which suggested that bribes had been
offered to Dr Mahathir in exchange for a government contract, or an official
British statement condemning the media's actions.
Lord Cranborne, a junior defence minister, is due to meet Mr Najib Abdul
Razak, Malaysian defence minister, in Kuala Lumpur today.
The cost of the Pergau dam project in Malaysia to the UK is Pounds 256.3m,
according to a parliamentary written answer last night. This compares with
the National Audit Office's estimate in its October report of Pounds 234m
but some recent estimates have put the total cost as high as Pounds 280m.
Mr Alan Williams, a Labour member of the foreign affairs committee, said:
'The poor British taxpayer will have to meet the bill for a record bad
deal.'

FT  19 APR 94 / Virgin outlines scheme for County Hall hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group is exploring with Japanese partners the
possibility of launching an international trade centre near the Houses of
Parliament in London.
The possibility emerged yesterday as Virgin Hotels and Shirayama Shokusan,
the Japanese property company, outlined plans to develop County Hall on the
south bank of the Thames into a hotel and entertainment complex.
Shirayama Shokusan bought the listed County Hall - seat of the London County
Council and its successor, the Greater London Council, for more than 60
years - and with Virgin will turn it into a hotel with 570 bedrooms. This
could later be extended to 1,250 bedrooms. There will also be a
virtual-reality entertainment centre, a large 'walk-through' aquarium and
sea-life centre, conference centres, full check-in facilities 'for Virgin
Atlantic and other selected airlines' and a wedding chapel and reception
facilities.
Shirayama Shokusan has now been offered a building adjacent to the County
Hall complex by the body carrying out residual services there for the
scrapped Greater London Council.
The more modern building, designed in the style of County Hall, does not
have a preservation order on it and could be demolished.
Mr Branson confirmed yesterday that the Japanese company is now considering
a proposal to buy the adjacent building and operate it with Virgin as an
international trade centre.
Shirayama Shokusan, a private property development company based in Osaka,
will spend around Pounds 150m in the purchase and development of the County
Hall complex.
Virgin will invest about Pounds 5m and be a 50 per cent shareholder in a new
company which will lease the centre from the owners for 30 years and manage
it on their behalf.
Mr Branson said yesterday there were plans to link County Hall - a national
competition is being launched to find a more appropriate name - by bridge to
the nearby Waterloo international rail centre where trains will depart for
the Channel tunnel.
To complete the link, Mr Branson is also interested in managing rail
services through the tunnel itself.

FT  19 APR 94 / Healthcare rationing under fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Moves to make district health authorities responsible for rationing hospital
treatment are likely to be politically unacceptable, the Office of Health
Economics said yesterday.
The health think-tank said people would see local variations in health care
as inconsistent with the concept of the National Health Service.
Author Mr William Laing said the government may be forced to set national
standards spelling out access to certain medical treatments. This would mean
acknowledging rationing of healthcare - 'which they have been unwilling to
do in the past'.
He said the NHS would face a 'crisis of legitimacy' as unelected district
health authorities took decisions.
One possible solution was to allow GP fundholders - who were accountable to
their patients - to buy a wider range of treatments. Alternatively, he said,
authorities should be locally elected.

FT  19 APR 94 / PowerGen launches Rye House power station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PowerGen, the electricity generating company, will today launch the first
large power station to be built in the south-east of England for more than a
decade when it opens its Rye House plant near Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire,
Michael Smith writes.
Like most other plants recently opened or under construction in the UK, Rye
House generates electricity from gas. The arrival of combined-cycle gas
stations is one of the main factors in the decline in demand for coal and
the subsequent pit closures.
PowerGen alone has a programme to build 3,000MW of combined-cycle gas
turbine plants. Rye House, built at a cost of Pounds 240m, provides about
700MW.
The company has already opened a plant in Killingholme, Humberside, and a
third station, at Deeside, north Wales, is due to open in 1996.
Both PowerGen and National Power, the other large generator, point to
reduced carbon dioxide and sulphur emissions as an incentive to build gas
stations.
Electricity privatisation critics say generators also want to obstruct
independent companies from generating power from gas.
Lord Wakeham, former energy secretary, will open the the Rye House station
today.

FT  19 APR 94 / Hopes rise over Malaysia trade ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British defence companies seeking contracts in Malaysia hope that a ban on
business with companies from Britain will soon be lifted.
Malaysia announced the ban in late February in retaliation for unfavourable
British press reports - in particular about Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime
minister.
Malaysia has been a big buyer of British defence equipment in recent years,
and British companies form the largest contingent at a defence exhibition
which opens in Kuala Lumpur today.
General Borhan Ahmad, head of Malaysia's defence forces, said the country
would continue to use British-made equipment and hinted at further purchases
from the UK. 'We can't just throw our British equipment into the river and
forget about it,' he said.
Some British companies saw the general's comments as evidence of a shift in
Malaysian policy, but others were less hopeful.
They point out that Malaysia seems to be asking either for an apology from
The Sunday Times, which suggested that bribes had been offered to Dr
Mahathir in exchange for a government contract, or an official British
statement condemning the media's actions.
Some British ministers have criticised the British press, but Mr John Major,
the prime minister, has described the Malaysian move as 'not remotely
justified'.
Mr Najib Abdul Razak, Malaysian defence minister, has repeatedly said that
his country would not consider buying any more British defence equipment
until the row is settled. Dr Mahathir has said Malaysia will not change its
policy 'until the British press stops telling lies'.
Lord Cranborne, a junior defence minister, is due to meet Mr Najib in Kuala
Lumpur today.

FT  19 APR 94 / More rail franchises likely to be announced this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A second round of British Rail franchises is expected to be announced later
this week as the government steps up its campaign to privatise the BR
network.
Eighteen of the 25 passenger franchises have still to be announced although
it is understood that only between five and 10 will be included in this
week's statement.
Labour yesterday revealed that the Office of the Franchising Director was
looking to appoint marketing consultants to help with the sale of
franchises. Dewe Rogerson, the public relations consultancy, is already
advising the transport department on rail sell-offs.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, said: 'This is a desperate
measure which reveals they are not getting much interest in buying.'
The franchising director's office confirmed that it was seeking professional
marketing advice on how to approach potential franchisees. 'This is a normal
appointment,' said Mr Peter McDermott, head of public affairs.
The first seven franchises, including East Coast Main Line, Gatwick Express,
London-Tilbury-Southend and ScotRail, were announced in February 1993.
Responses to the invitation to bid must be in by the end of this week.

FT  19 APR 94 / BNF pays worker Pounds 16,661 for idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels has paid out what is believed to be the largest ever
award in the UK to an employee for an idea.
The industrial worker at BNF's Sellafield reprocessing plant won Pounds
16,661 for a plan to increase efficiency, the company's staff newspaper
reports.
'Under our suggestion scheme workers receive 35 per cent of the first year's
savings if we put their idea into practice,' Mr Les Carrick, a senior
manager at Sellafield, told the magazine Personnel Today. A few other
workers have received several thousand pounds. Rewards of up to Pounds 100
are routine.
A survey by the UK Association of Suggestion Schemes says the average
savings generated by suggestion schemes is Pounds 265,000 a year per
workplace.
However the schemes at the social security department, Rover, British Rail
and the Inland Revenue have all regularly generated savings of more than
Pounds 1m. Rover also has one of the highest payout levels, making awards of
Pounds 1.25m last year for suggestions.
The average annual response to a suggestion scheme is 5 per cent of
employees, and an average of 22 per cent of suggestions are used by the
company.
The value of payments for suggestions used varies between about Pounds 15
and 50 per cent of any savings made in the first year of operation.
Mr Carrick told Personnel Today that BNF wants to upgrade its scheme and
involve more workers. 'Under the old scheme the bulk of suggestions were
from industrial workers,' he said. 'Under the new scheme we want everyone to
be involved.'

FT  19 APR 94 / Union adverts to cost Pounds 1.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unison, Britain's largest union, is to spend Pounds 1.25m on an advertising
campaign in the run-up to the council elections, highlighting the
government's 'mismanagement' of public services, David Goodhart writes.
The decision will be controversial as the money is coming out of the general
political fund which covers the entire union, including the former Nalgo
local government union which was not affiliated to Labour.
Nalgo had been taken to court in the past by members objecting to its
campaigns which were alleged to have been too political, but at national
level the union was usually found to be on the right side of the law.
Unison has booked almost 1,000 poster sites and has taken advertising space
in national newspapers.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, Unison general secretary, launching the campaign at the
start of the Scottish TUC conference in Dundee yesterday, said: 'We want to
turn the local elections into a referendum on those government policies
which are destroying our public services.'
The advertisements 'won't pull any punches,' he added. The government had
'systematically neglected and starved those vital services for narrow
political objectives'.

FT  19 APR 94 / Confident Lib Dems predict more gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday underlined their confidence of making
headway in next month's local elections, predicting that they alone among
the three main parties would gain seats in areas they already control.
As the Conservatives and Labour traded punches over the relative cost and
efficiency of councils they control, Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat
campaign chief, said his party's 'revolutionary' approach to local democracy
would be reflected in the results of the May 5 elections.
Mr Taylor said the party would advance not only in areas where 'Labour and
Conservatives have been too long in control', but would be 'the only party
that advances in areas where we do have control and influence'.
The Liberal Democrats' confidence is in marked contrast to the attitude of
the other two leading parties which have tended to play down their election
prospects.
The Tories yesterday trained their fire on Mr Jack Straw, the shadow
environment secretary, with Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, accusing
him of 'making evidently bogus claims' and 'statistical gerrymandering'.
Sir Norman was supported by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, who said
Labour councils were not up to scratch, whether the yardstick was price,
priorities or competence. 'No matter how Jack Straw flannels, it's obvious
to all that Labour councils cost you more,' he added. Mr Straw accused his
opposite number of getting some of his facts 'badly wrong'.
The Liberal Democrats yesterday launched a document detailing the changes
Liberal Democrat councils were making to give people greater involvement in
the running of their local communities.
Mr David Rendel, local government spokesman, said his was the only party
doing this because 'the principle of devolution is more important than
playing political games'.
Speaking at the Scottish TUC, Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish
secretary, said the elections for Scotland's nine regional councils and
three island authorities could 'go down in history' as a verdict on the
government.
He said: 'This government deserves to be judged harshly, and I believe that
the people will do just that.'

FT  19 APR 94 / Labour launches funding plan for training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A temporary cut in National Insurance contributions as an incentive to
companies to train workers is being proposed by the Labour party as part of
a new package to improve skills.
The party would also encourage 'investment agreements between companies and
financial institutions to encourage the funding of longer-term projects,' Mr
Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, told the annual conference of the AEEU
engineering and electrical union in Llandudno yesterday.
The package includes the party's proposals for a university of training, on
the model of the Open University, to provide opportunities for workers to
learn new skills.
Mr Brown called for reform of the National Insurance contribution system for
pensioners as part of a plan to integrate tax and benefits.
He told delegates that he favoured a statutory national minimum wage, but no
decision on the figure would be made before next year, when Labour's new
economic policy will be decided. This follows the call at the weekend by Mr
Bill Morris, TGWU general union leader, for a national minimum wage of
Pounds 4 per hour. This demand looks likely to be raised at the Labour
conference this autumn to the embarrassment of the party leadership.
Mr Brown was joined by Mr Bill Jordan, AEEU president, in calling on Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to cut interest rates immediately. In his
presidential address to delegates Mr Jordan said that the economy was 'on
the move'. Even if it was not 'steady or confident growth', it was 'growth
nevertheless'.
In a wide-ranging address at what will be the AEEU engineering section's
last conference, Mr Jordan called for a reform of trade union structures. If
unions want a basic right to representation in the workplace, they must be
prepared to guarantee the 'single co-ordinated voice of employees'
aspirations in each workplace'.
He added that his own union had begun discussions with seven leading British
companies over establishing European works councils in them in line with the
forthcoming European Union directive on the subject. The companies are
Lucas, GKN, Smiths Industries, AC Delco, Phillips, Electrolux and Kvaerner.
David Goodhart writes: two of Britain's largest multinationals, ICI and
Zeneca, which have generally co-operative industrial relations, have refused
to talk to their main union about establishing a European works council,
according to Mr Keith Standring, national secretary of the GMB general
union.
Following the breakdown of negotiations between the European Trades Union
Confederation and Unice, the European employers' body, the European
Commission is pressing ahead with plans to impose a works council directive
on large European Union companies which operate in at least two EU
countries.
Many large companies such as ICI will be affected through their continental
operations, and it is widely assumed that they will not exclude UK employees
from such European forums for consulting with workers.
Mr Standring yesterday accused the chemical companies of a 'head in the
sands' approach.

FT  19 APR 94 / Investors vent anger over late tax concession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investors and private client investment managers yesterday expressed
anger over the timing of last week's government concession on capital gains
tax, which could benefit higher-rate taxpayers by up to Pounds 4,000.
The proposal - to allow taxpayers to continue temporarily to take account of
inflation when calculating losses for capital gains tax purposes - is
expected to be debated in today's Commons report stage debate on the Finance
Bill.
Investors and investment managers welcomed the concession, which followed
pressure from Conservative backbenchers and angry private investors. But
they said they might have acted differently had they known of the
government's proposal before the end of the tax year.
The announcement came on Friday - nearly two weeks after the end of the
1993-94 tax year on April 5. The relief is applicable to the 1993-94 tax
year as well as to the current 1994-95 year.
'It is a disgrace that they couldn't make their minds up a fortnight ago,'
said Mr Foster Swetenham, investment manager at Williams de Broe, which
manages around 1,100 portfolios totalling Pounds 300m-Pounds 350m.
Some investors may have sold shares unnecessarily in order to keep net
1993-94 capital gains down to the Pounds 5,800 exemption limit. In his
November Budget, the chancellor said indexation could not be used to
increase capital losses or to turn nominal profits into losses.
The delay in the decision has also created for managers what Mr David
Rosier, chairman of Mercury Asset Management, described as an administrative
'nightmare'.
The firm, which handles about Pounds 2bn of UK private client money, was
about to send its 2,000 clients details of their investment portfolios and
capital gains tax liabilities as at April 5. It must now either reprogramme
its computer or go through all 2,000 accounts manually to check what
difference the transitional relief may have made.
The Treasury said the subject had been debated in committee on March 15, and
the timetable may have been too tight for the announcement to be made in
time for investors to respond before the tax year ended.

FT  19 APR 94 / BBC may resume Far East TV link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC World Service Television hopes to resume its satellite television
service to the Far East from London within the next few months.
The service on the northern beam of the Star satellite system covering areas
such as China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines was switched off at
midnight last night following a deal with Mr Rupert Murdoch's Star TV.
The BBC said it had received several hundred faxes and a large number of
telephone calls expressing disappointment at the ending of the service.
The BBC decided to give up the northern beam of the satellite system early
in order to win an extension for the service carried on the southern beam to
India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Mr Murdoch wanted the channel capacity ahead of the break point in the
contract with the BBC at the end of this year to launch a Chinese language
film service aimed at Taiwan.
When the BBC went off the air to the Far East on Sunday night it was with
the promise to viewers: 'We will be back.'
The BBC has since been offered the possibility of a number of satellite
transponders which could carry its service to much of the region.
The corporation is also talking to cable operators in two of its main
markets, Hong Kong and Taiwan, about carrying World Service Television.
Mr Chris Irwin, chief executive of World Service Television, has not yet
decided whether to try to restore his service on a piecemeal basis or to
wait for a satellite with the same broad coverage as that provided by the
Star system.

Two women office workers yesterday asked the High Court to rule that the
1985 legislation raising the qualification period for unfair dismissal
claims from one to two years' employment was illegal.
Mr Robin Allen, their counsel, claimed the law was in breach of the European
equal treatment directive as the proportion of women disadvantaged by the
changes was significantly larger than the proportion of men.

FT  19 APR 94 / Problems found with 400 law firms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Law Society, which set up a special investigations bureau last year as
part of its 'Operation Crackdown' on fraud, has identified nearly 400
'problem firms' of solicitors. It said 34 firms were under investigation and
19 problem firms had been investigated in detail.
Its monitoring unit, which visits firms to check they are complying with
solicitors' accounts rules, last year found that more than 300 firms were
either 'unstable' or 'inherently unstable'.
In the 120-plus unstable firms compliance was judged to be particularly poor
or there was severe financial difficulty to the extent that clients' money
was considered at risk. Inherently unstable firms have unsatisfactory
compliance systems but no immediate risk to client money.

to run in addition to its branch network.
The launch of the 24-hour service follows three pilot projects which have
been running since last April involving 30,000 customers. The bank aims to
have 300,000 customers using the new service by the end of this year.
The service, available to all personal customers, is free apart from the

FT  19 APR 94 / NVQ pioneer to quit scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BHS, one of the UK's largest retailers, is to stop using the new
industry-wide National Vocational Qualifications and replace them with an
in-house training scheme, Lisa Wood writes.
Mr Kevin Heald, BHS national retail manager, said: 'There is nothing wrong
with NVQs, but they contain a set of generic skills. We want to develop
skills that are tailor-made to our own needs.'
The NVQ system seeks to establish a nationwide system of competence-based
qualifications. Some employers complain about the costs, some see NVQs as
too broad and others say they are too narrow.
The BHS move casts doubt on the training the industry itself helped to set
up, and the withdrawal of one of the qualifications' pioneers will concern
NVQ standard-setters.
BHS said about half its staff had the level one NVQ - the basic
qualification.

FT  19 APR 94 / Revival of US 'open skies' talks urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Airlines, the largest US carrier, yesterday urged the US and UK
governments to link their approval for the proposed partnership between
Virgin Atlantic Airways and Delta Air Lines of the US to the revival of
broader negotiations on a new transatlantic aviation agreement between the
two countries.
Mr Stephen Wolf, United chairman, said yesterday that the proposed
Virgin-Delta deal required changes in the bilateral aviation agreement
between the US and the UK.
The Virgin-Delta ticket code-sharing partnership, which requires the
approval of both the US and UK governments, should provide the impetus to
produce 'substantive amendments' to the bilateral agreement to correct 'a
variety of long-standing deficiencies in the agreement', Mr Wolf told the
Aviation Club of Great Britain.
United's position is likely to strengthen UK efforts to revive the bilateral
talks after the US walked away from them earlier this year.
The US has insisted on greater access immediately for all US carriers into
London's Heathrow Airport as part of any new 'open skies' agreement with the
UK. The UK, which is seeking further access to the US domestic market for UK
carriers as well as the lifting of restriction on foreign ownership of US
airlines, proposes a three-stage approach to 'open skies' and access for US
carriers to Heathrow.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, hopes to hold preliminary talks
with Mr Federico Pena, his US opposite number, in the next few days to
follow up the opportunity the Virgin-Delta deal has given the two
governments to reopen negotiations.
Passenger traffic at BAA's seven airports reached a record 82m in the
financial year to April 1, up 5.6 per cent on a year earlier. The highest
growth was at Stansted Airport, up 42 per cent on the previous year.
Cargo traffic through BAA airports rose 17 per cent in March compared with
the same period last year, taking traffic in the financial year to 1.2m
tonnes, 13 per cent higher than the previous year.

FT  19 APR 94 / Curb on lookalike brands opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs on both sides of the Commons last night urged the government to refuse
trademark protection for brand-name goods facing competition from lookalike
products.
The dispute has come to a head this week as J. Sainsbury launched a cola
designed to compete with Coca-Cola, the brand leader.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, junior trade minister, said the government was still
consulting brand owners and producers as well as retail interests, and had
not yet been convinced that the issue should be dealt with through the Trade
Marks Bill, which is now before the Commons.
The bill, which follows a European Union directive rationalising national
laws on trademarks, was given a Commons second reading. It has already been
approved by the Lords.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, said the
Consumers' Association had estimated that lookalike products were 20 per
cent to 25 per cent cheaper than branded goods.
Mr Griffiths urged the government to refuse to amend the bill to extend
trademark protection to brand name goods. He said if it did so it would be
pandering to companies with 'near-monopolistic' shares of the market.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, trade and industry spokesman for the Liberal Democrats,
said it would be against the interests of the consumer to provide additional
protection for brand name goods.
Dame Peggy Fenner, Conservative MP for Medway, said there would be
considerable relief that the government had not been persuaded to use the
bill to give added protection to brand-name goods. Recent opinion polls had
shown that 78 per cent of consumers were not confused when choosing between
lookalike products and their brand name rivals.
Sir Dudley Smith, Conservative MP for Warwick and Leamington, called on the
government to give further consideration to what was a 'relatively new
subject'.
The bill, which has been widely welcomed by the CBI and other business
organisations, was given an unopposed second reading.

The government yesterday fiercely denied suggestions that it was
politicising the 50th anniversary of D-Day to maximise its vote in the
European elections in June.
Downing Street said: 'The idea that Operation Overlord was launched 50 years
ago to help the Conservatives win the European elections in 1994 is
ridiculous.' The prime minister was said to be confident that the government
had struck the right balance 'of seriousness and fun' in commemorating
D-Day.

Miss Wilel McKenzie told an industrial tribunal in Croydon, south London,
that she was excluded from work in the office, and had clients taken away.
She was a higher executive officer and is claiming constructive dismissal

Miss Rona Thompson, Miss McKenzie's boss, denied there had been racial
discrimination. She said: 'She looked very uncomfortable and anxious in some
situations in front of clients. I was worried about her general health.'
The hearing is expected to end by Friday.

FT  19 APR 94 / Think-tank warns against health care rationing move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Moves to make district health authorities responsible for rationing hospital
treatment are likely to be politically unacceptable, the Office of Health
Economics said yesterday.
The health think-tank said people would see local variations in health care
as inconsistent with the concept of the National Health Service.
The report added that one of the biggest challenges facing the NHS was not
the ageing population but capital investment. Author Mr William Laing
predicted that the government may be forced to set national standards
spelling out access to certain medical treatments.
This would mean acknowledging the reality of rationing healthcare - 'which
they have been unwilling to do in the past'.
He said the NHS would face a 'crisis of legitimacy' as decisions would be
taken by unelected district health authorities which did not represent their
local communities.
Tensions were likely to arise between Patient's Charter objectives and the
priorities of budget-holding family doctors.
One possible solution was to allow GP fundholders - who were directly
accountable to their patients - to buy a wider range of treatments.
Alternatively, district health authorities should be locally elected, he
said.

FT  19 APR 94 / Israel to offer package to Syria: Return of Golan seen as
crux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel has formulated a comprehensive package for negotiations with Syria on
a withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights which it wants Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, to deliver to Damascus later this month.
Israeli officials said the US had told Jerusalem that, if the Christopher
mission succeeds, Syria had promised to upgrade current peace talks to
foreign minister level and enter direct military-to-military talks.
Mr Dennis Ross, US Middle East peace envoy, is expected in Israel on Friday
before flying to Damascus to prepare for Mr Christopher's Middle East
shuttle next week.
The success of the US mission, however, will depend on Israel's commitment
to a full withdrawal from Golan, a key Syrian demand. A Syrian spokesman
said: 'Syria will never accept anything less than full Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan. . . Is Israel ready to return the land, the whole land? This
is the question that needs to be answered.'
One option being considered by Israel is to make an early formal
renunciation of its claims to sovereignty over the Heights as a
confidence-building measure. Mr Yossi Sarid, environment minister, said
yesterday: 'Without giving up sovereignty on the Golan it will not be
possible to push forward the peace process and reach a positive result.'
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, has confirmed newspaper reports of
a new Israeli peace plan. Mr Rabin said Maj Gen Ilan Biran at Central
Command had presented a document detailing Israel's security requirements in
any Golan withdrawal.
The new peace plan deals with what Israel sees as the four fundamental
issues of any agreement - the extent of withdrawal, the nature of peace,
security arrangements and the timetable of phases of withdrawal. Israeli
newspapers said the plan included:
An Israeli declaration of withdrawal.
Full diplomatic relations with open borders and trade.
Israeli withdrawal to be implemented in phases over a period of years.
Normalisation of relations and establishment of diplomatic ties after the
first phase of withdrawal which would leave Israel still controlling most of
the Heights.
Security arrangements including substantial force reductions, early warning
stations, confidence building measures, international observers and
demilitarised areas.
Mr Rabin has promised to take any peace deal with Syria to a referendum.

FT  19 APR 94 / South African Elections (April 26-28): The new S Africa
rises in Boer heartland - Patti Waldmeir finds Afrikaner and ANC learning to
live together even before the poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I told my friends at the golf course on Saturday, 'Mark my words, on the
26th of May (a month after South Africa's election) we will be sitting here,
having a beer, nothing is going to disappear'.' Mr Kobus Botha, golfer,
lawyer, and right-wing town councillor in Viljoenskroon, one of the
country's most conservative towns, has made his peace with the new South
Africa.
He still believes in apartheid, he still thinks Afrikaners should have their
own homeland - but he is preparing to live under the African National
Congress government which will almost certainly be elected in the all-race
poll on April 26-28. And the ANC in Viljoenskroon, which will soon control
the council of this small Orange Free State town, is not only willing but
eager to learn to live with Mr Botha.
On the face of it, little has changed in this classic town of the Afrikaner
platteland, the rural hinterland where white hostility to black is
supposedly at its highest. Road signs marking the entry to Viljoenskroon are
plastered with right-wing stickers declaring 'This is our volkstaat
(homeland)'; and the wide, impeccably maintained streets of the white town
still contrast sharply with the rutted, near-impassable dirt roads of
Rammulotsi township, where nightsoil buckets provide the only sewerage for
many residents.
Yet Viljoenskroon is about to experience its own local revolution to rival
any that the national politicians can deliver. By election day, the town's
all-white council (dominated by the ultra-right Conservative party by a
ratio of six to one) will in effect be replaced by an interim body in which
whites and blacks will split the seats between them.
Though this body is merely a 'negotiating forum' charged with hammering out
a new local government structure before local elections later this year, it
marks the first step to integrated local government, and crucially, the
first move toward sharing Viljoenskroon's (white) tax base between its
30,000 to 40,000 black and 2,500 white residents.
Other, less conservative towns, took steps months or years ago to integrate
local government. Viljoenskroon held out. Even the decision to set up the
new 50-50 body was not voluntary: under new legislation, the white council
would have been removed if it had not accepted this option.
But if the white council's public stance is reluctant, even obstructive,
local ANC officials say there is considerable co-operation behind the
scenes. The head of the ANC's local government section in Rammulotsi, Mr
Lucky Phooko, says he believes four out of the seven white councillors will
co-operate with the ANC. Some are already offering advice, in a clandestine
fashion, by telephone.
'The CP (Conservative Party) guys have acclimatised with the law. It's now
that they respect us and treat us as human beings,' Mr Phooko says, adding
that the ANC wants to draw on the expertise of white councillors, especially
in budgetary matters.
'We're going to utilise these guys, the Boers (right-wing Afrikaners),
because of their expertise in local government. Most of the Boers have been
misinformed about the ANC. If we explain clearly to them . . . if we can
work together . . . you will see a transformation in our township,' he says
with the enthusiasm of a man who believes that all of Viljoenskroon's people
 -white and black - will be happier, more prosperous and more secure living
together than living separately under apartheid.
Mr Phooko knows that, even after the elections, whites will still have a
statutory 30 per cent share of the council (though they make up less than a
tenth of the population). This will give them what will in effect be a veto
over the budget. But he seems happy with the compromise, which was offered
by the ANC in the last stages of constitutional negotiations to calm white
fears.
He seems more concerned at persuading Rammulotsi residents to resume rent
and service payments after a long boycott: 'For one to get something you
have to give something up - that is what we are going to teach our people,'
he says.
Things could still go badly awry. Kobus Botha draws a bottom line below
which he will not compromise. 'Religion, a basic education for my kids, a
chance to do a job, a decent living - not necessarily in the same luxury,
we've lived like kings] - personal safety.
'If you can't go on holiday without running into an impi (Zulu war party) at
Pietermaritzburg . . . then you have to say, is it worth it? Perhaps you'd
be better off in a bachelor flat in New Zealand.'
Ironically, Mr Botha says he hopes the ANC scores a big win at the polls.
'I'd like the ANC to win 75 per cent and immediately restore law and order:
get back capital punishment, get out the army and shoot them (perpetrators
of violence and crime) to pieces.'
He has an unlikely ally in Mr Louis Botha (no relation), the local chairman
of the ruling National party, who also hopes for an ANC triumph. 'We need a
very strong government which must have the ability to rule in a very strict
way,' he says, adding the ANC must wield even more power than the National
party.
But if this seems an unlikely fan club for the ANC, some Viljoenskroon
residents provide a more predictable response to the upcoming elections. Mr
Kerneels Dercksen, a local farmer and militant member of the Afrikaner
Volksfront, is always ready with the cliches of the right: 'The Afrikaner
will not tolerate the ANC to govern. This country will go up in smoke.'
He says he will not pay taxes to the new government, has installed a large
generator to cope with retaliatory interruptions in electricity supply and
has erected a formidable security fence around his farm to keep out the ANC.
He says his phone and home are bugged by the security forces which used to
serve apartheid and which are now preparing to serve the ANC.
Will he disrupt the elections? Not personally, he says. Will he move to a
volkstaat? No, but he will buy a plot there as insurance against the future.
Lawyer Kobus Botha probably comes closest to summing up the local mood:
'It's business as usual here. People are worried, they're concerned, but
they're not nervous. They're buying tractors, not Krugerrands.'

FT  19 APR 94 / Officials act to quell bank sale worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli officials yesterday sought to deflect concern about the country's
privatisation programme after the government delayed selling a controlling
stake in Bank Leumi, Israel's second largest bank, Julian Ozanne reports.
Mr Gil Leidner, a senior privatisation official, said the government had
delayed by 30 days closing the tender for the sale of 20 to 40 per cent of
Bank Leumi because of substantial investor interest. Mr Liedner said three
new foreign investors had come forward late in the tender process. Sale of a
controlling stake in Bank Leumi, worth between Dollars 360m and Dollars 720m
(Pounds 244m and Pounds 488m), will be the government's biggest divestiture
so far.
The Finance Ministry has budgeted revenue of Dollars 1.5bn this year from
its sell-off programme which includes controlling stakes in Bank Leumi, Bank
Hapoalim, Bank Mizrahi, Israel Chemicals and El Al, the state-owned airline.
However, some financial analysts speculated that the sale of Bank Leumi was
in trouble and would affect the government's privatisation hopes.

FT  19 APR 94 / Watanabe wavers on bid to become prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michio Watanabe, a faction chief in Japan's opposition Liberal Democratic
party, yesterday voiced second thoughts over his campaign for the prime
ministership.
A tired looking Mr Watanabe said he needed more time to consider. He
appeared on the brink of dropping out of the power struggle unleashed by the
recent resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister, so leaving the
way clear for the coalition's likely candidate - Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign
minister.
The alliance hopes to stage a parliamentary vote on its prime ministerial
candidate tomorrow or later, said Diet officials. A parliamentary committee
is due to decide the timing today, a day later than planned because of
uncertainty created by Mr Watanabe's ambiguous bid for power. However,
coalition members want to finalise a policy accord before proposing Mr Hata
as prime minister, in an attempt, seen by many analysts as optimistic, to
avoid the unscheduled rows that dogged the previous government.
Party representatives were yesterday discussing a draft accord, prepared
over the weekend.
Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president, yesterday met Mr Watanabe in a second attempt
to persuade him to stay in the party, but failed to stop a trickle of
defections. Nearly 30 politicians have left both the government and
opposition camps over the past 10 days, mainly to stand as independents, in
the upheaval provoked by Mr Hosokawa's resignation.
By yesterday evening 11 of the LDP's 219 members of parliament had announced
their resignations. Of the total, five have formed a new party, the New
Future party, which says it might work with the coalition. Under new laws,
parties with a minimum of five members of parliament qualify for state
subsidies.
Another five LDP defectors are supporters of Mr Watanabe, who have not yet
declared their intentions, while one defector has said he will join one of
the coalition parties.
One member of Mr Watanabe's faction said Mr Watanabe could bring a total of
11 followers with him if he did leave the LDP. He likened Mr Watanabe to the
second world war battleship Yamato, a supposedly unsinkable vessel which was
sent to the bottom after it went to meet the US fleet in 1944 with a one-way
supply of fuel.
Separately, three members of the parliament left Mr Hosokawa's Japan New
party to stand as independents yesterday, in protest at his growing
closeness to Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's backroom power-broker. This
follows last week's decision by another group, the New Harbinger party, to
distance itself from the coalition.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese investors financially restructured, sold or announced sales of a
total Dollars 17.6bn (Pounds 11.95bn) in US property investments last year,
according to Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Company, US accountants, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo. While US banks and life assurers have the real estate
lending problems behind them and expect to post record profits this year,
Japanese institutions, which have only recently started to tackle their
domestic bad property investments and loans, have been slow in dealing with
investments in the US market made in the asset boom of the late 1980s.
The 1993 figure amounts to 23 per cent of the Dollars 77.3bn in US real
estate investments by Japanese investors, including banks, property
companies and construction companies, made in 1985-93.
The New York and Chicago office markets, the New York hotel market and the
Orange County and San Diego industrial markets, which make up a quarter of
Japanese investments, are not expected to recover for three more years.
Another 25 per cent is in the Los Angeles office and Hawaii hotel markets,
where recovery is not expected for at least five years.
Japanese institutions have traditionally taken the 'hold and wait' strategy
in dealing with problem US real estate assets in the hope that US property
markets will would recover.
Of the Dollars 17.59bn liquidated or restructured last year, 45 per cent has
been in hotels and resorts.

<TEXT>
Mr Prasong Soonsiri, Thailand's foreign minister, flies to Burma today to
invite Rangoon's military regime to attend the Association of South-East
Asian Nations ministerial meeting in July, William Barnes writes from
Bangkok.
Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines have been persuaded to set aside
'reservations' that such an invitation to a widely reviled administration
could disrupt the organisation's relations with its western trading
partners.
Asean ministerial meetings are followed by a regional forum and then
meetings with its seven 'dialogue partners' - the US, European Union,
Australia, Canada, South Korea, Japan and New Zealand. Burma will probably
be invited as a guest of the host, Thailand, rather than - more
significantly - as a guest of Asean.

<TEXT>
The US will not hold new high-level discussions with North Korea unless it
accepts full international nuclear inspections by early May, US and South
Korean officials agreed yesterday.
South Korea meanwhile received its first shipment of Patriot missiles to
defend military bases against possible attacks by North Korean Scud
missiles. The missiles, which arrived in the port of Pusan, will be deployed
by the end of the month.
Mr Robert Gallucci, who heads the US policy group on North Korea, reaffirmed
the condition for talks with Pyongyang during a meeting in Seoul with Mr Kim
Sam-hoon, his South Korean counterpart.
North Korea has claimed direct talks with the US would solve the dispute
over nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Pyongyang is believed to be seeking US diplomatic recognition in return for
accepting inspections.
South Korea on Friday withdrew a demand for an exchange of envoys with North
Korea, clearing the way for renewed talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
The special envoys would have discussed inter-Korean nuclear inspections,
which would be more intrusive than those conducted by the IAEA.
The decision was meant to break a diplomatic impasse by separating
inter-Korean talks from US-North Korean negotiations. South Korea had
previously insisted the two sets of negotiations be conducted
simultaneously, but North Korea has refused to do so.

<TEXT>
Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, has begun a four-nation tour of Central
Asia aimed at promoting Beijing's political and commercial interests in an
unstable region on its troubled western frontier.
Mr Li, who last year deferred a visit to the former Soviet republics because
of heart problems, is certain to seek assurances that Central Asian leaders
will not help Moslem separatists in China itself. China has a Moslem
population of about 10m, with most in the under-populated western province
of Xinjiang.
He arrived in Uzbekistan yesterday and will visit Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan
and Kazakhstan before returning home via Mongolia. For the first time, a
Chinese leader travelling abroad has included businessmen and traders in his
party.
Mr Zheng Hongye, president of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade, said businessmen would sign a 'range of agreements' in
construction, textiles, electronics, telecommunications, petrochemicals and
mineral resources.
Beijing is anxious to extend its commercial reach into Central Asia as a
means of strengthening its political influence in a region that
traditionally it has regarded as important to its security and well-being.

FT  19 APR 94 / Australian coal miners to strike over export prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australian coal miners are to stage a 48-hour strike from today in protest
at the contract prices for steaming coal agreed between the country's coal
companies and Japanese power industry buyers.
In March, mineworkers staged similar industrial action, that time in protest
at the coking coal price cuts which coal companies had accepted in the
annual negotiations with the Japanese steel mills. The government has
instigated a six-month review of the nation's export coal industry as a
result.
The latest bout of industrial action will start with the first shift today
and work will resume with the first shift on Thursday. Over 20,000
mineworkers will be involved, and the action is expected to close production
in Queensland and New South Wales. Coal is Australia's largest single
export.
The outcome of the steaming coal contract negotiations, announced at the end
of March, was closely watched because of the political furore which had
followed an unexpectedly large cut in coking coal prices agreed earlier in
the year. In the event, the steaming coal price was reduced by 5.8 per cent,
while the coking coal reduction was around 8 to 9 per cent.
However, it had always been felt the underlying market conditions for
thermal coal were better. While the coking coal market has been severely
affected by the Japanese steel mills' problems and by changes in
steel-making technology, steaming coal demand stands to benefit from the
growth in Asian power station users.
The Queensland Mining Council said the strike would cost up to ADollars 52m
(Pounds 25.5m) in lost production. Mr David Beddall, federal resources
minister, also condemned the strike.
News of the mineworkers' action came as Mr Lee Kuan Yew, former Singapore
prime minister, blasted Australian work ethic problems. At a business lunch
in Sydney, he warned that, if the country wanted to compete in Asia,
'Australians must be weaned from welfare dependency and become self-reliant
and competitive'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's, the US-based rating agency, said yesterday that it believed the
impact on Western Australia of the new federal native title legislation 'may
prove to be less than feared', Nikki Tait writes from Sydney.
The new legislation, which came into force on January 1, acknowledged that
Aboriginal people could possess native title rights over land in Australia
and set up a system for deciding land claims, and deciding on appropriate
compensation where the land had been allocated for other purposes. Western
Australia is thought to be the state most affected.
Mr Laurie Brereton, Australia's federal transport minister, said yesterday
that he was in favour of selling 'a very limited number' of the nation's
airports, currently under the control of the Federal Airports Corporation,
into the private sector. He put Melbourne's Tullamarine airport at the top
of the list of airports which might be sold.

FT  19 APR 94 / World Trade News: First direct UK client for Intelsat - US
eyes only contract of its kind in west after BT relinquishes monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intelsat, the world's largest commercial satellite system, has signed up its
first direct customer in the UK, in the only contract of its kind in western
Europe or the US.
Mr Charles Ross of Beednet, the Bravo Eastern Europe Digital Network, last
week agreed a deal with Intelsat to use its satellites to offer voice, data,
fax and TV services between the UK and the Czech and Slovak republics -
where in 1992 Beednet won the first satellite-user licence.
Until now, Intelsat capacity has had to be purchased through the signatories
to the international treaty governing the organisation. However, the UK last
month ended the monopoly of its Intelsat signatory, British Telecom.
This liberalisation has been made more important by the fact that, together
with Hong Kong, the UK accounts for around 11 per cent of Intelsat traffic,
second only to the US, at 22 per cent.
UK companies can now buy satellite capacity directly from Intelsat and take
part in the organisation's user and policy meetings up to board or governor
level.
Intelsat is delighted at the deregulation. 'It is absolutely in our interest
to open up access,' said Mr Irving Goldstein, Intelsat director-general and
chief executive officer. 'Companies don't have to go through a third party
when dealing with our competitors.'
But the UK move is being closely watched by the US signatory, Comsat, which
is resisting pressure to relinquish its own monopoly. Comsat already faces
an anti-trust suit filed with the US Federal Communications Commission by
Panamsat. A clear shift in business to a more open UK market would further
raise the pressure for an end to its special status.
However, the UK move is an isolated one. Although Chile was the first to
break away from signatory-only access to Intelsat, followed last year by
Argentina, both countries account for less than 2 per cent of Intelsat
traffic.
The UK's Department of Trade and Industry, which says it will be 'as
encouraging as possible' in issuing licences to direct users, is also
pushing for users to be allowed direct access to Intelsat's pan-European
cousin, Eutelsat.
'It is to the UK's credit that they have forged ahead with opening this
market,' Mr Ross said yesterday. 'Everyone wants this access and it can only
bring end-user prices down.'
Moreover, the UK banking sector will be a big beneficiary of the Beednet
service, according to Mr Ross, with financial services at a premium in a
rapidly privatising region.

FT  19 APR 94 / World Trade News: Canada warns US in wheat dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada has warned it will retaliate against US products if the Clinton
administration goes ahead with threats to restrict imports of Canadian wheat
at the end of this week.
The Canadians' response follows concern in Ottawa that US agribusiness
interests are using the wheat dispute as a lever to wring concessions in
other areas of US-Canada farm trade. Mr Jack Wilkinson, president of the
Canadian Federation of Agriculture, said US demands had grown 'even more
onerous' in recent weeks.
In particular, the US has recently indicated dissatisfaction with the high
tariffs which Canada plans to impose on poultry, eggs and dairy products.
Under the Uruguay Round these tariffs are due to replace quotas and other
non-tariff barriers.
The US contends that Ottawa is required to dismantle the tariffs quickly
under the US-Canada bilateral free trade agreement, which stipulates that
neither country can impose new customs duties. Canada maintains the FTA and
the North American Free Trade Agreement grant specific exemptions for
'supply-managed' products.
Talks between US and Canadian ministers on the wheat dispute broke down in
Marrakesh last week. Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, said if no
agreement was reached by Friday the US planned to raise tariffs on wheat.
Mr Ralph Goodale, his Canadian counterpart, indicated that retaliatory
action would be taken against California wine and rice, chicken products,
apples and baked goods.
The dispute stems from a sharp increase in sales of Canadian wheat,
especially durum, in the US. Shipments are expected to reach 2.5m tonnes in
the current crop year, compared with the usual 1.3m-1.5m tonnes.
Washington complains that the wheat is excessively subsidised, and has
proposed a cap on wheat imports from Canada of about 1.5m tonnes a year.
Ottawa counters that the US's export enhancement programme has created a
wheat shortage in the domestic market, prompting buyers to turn to
high-quality Canadian grain. The Canadians also point out that US exports to
Canada of processed farm products - such as pasta and flour  - have risen
sharply in recent years.

FT  19 APR 94 / World Trade News: Local finance fuels Malaysia energy
projects - Kieran Cooke on ambitious domestic financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are interesting times for Malaysia's banking community. Financiers
have just had to digest the news of further travails at Bank Negara, the
central bank, in the aftermath of multi-billion dollar foreign exchange
trading losses.
Now Kuala Lumpur's banking boardrooms are abuzz with talk about the
country's largest ever internally generated debt financing package - a
MDollars 3bn (Pounds 820m) loan signed last week for the construction of a
power station.
Malaysia, whose economy has grown by more than 8 per cent in each of the
past six years, has been suffering power shortages. To speed up the
implementation of power projects and spread the financial burden involved,
the government is privatising a large chunk of the power sector.
So far five licences to generate power have been given to independent power
producers (IPPs) on a build, operate, transfer (BOT) basis.
A local company and recipient of last week's record loan, Sikap Energy
Ventures, won the licence to build and operate a 1,300MW combined cycle
plant at Lamut on peninsular Malaysia's west coast. YTL, another local
company, signed a MDollars 2.66bn domestic loan agreement late last year for
financing of a similar IPP project.
The Sikap loan is made up of a MDollars 1.5bn fixed rate bond facility from
the state run Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and a MDollars 1.5bn floating
rate loan jointly underwritten by Bank Bumiputra, the Malaysian state-owned
bank which in the past has been dogged by controversy and bad debts, and
Maybank, the country's biggest financial institution, also government
controlled. Details of the interest rates on the loan were not disclosed.
Mr Abdul Aziz Othman, Bank Bumiputra's chief executive officer, said many
had expressed reservations about the capacity of the local capital market to
fund such a large project.
'For a project this size, it is remarkable that only three institutions are
involved at this stage,' said Mr Abdul. He said that both the YTL and Sikap
loans showed that Malaysia's capital markets were maturing.
Bank Bumiputra Bank and the EPF also played a leading role in the YTL loan.
YTL is one of Malaysia's largest construction companies but has little
experience at managing power projects. It has brought in Siemens of Germany
and John Laing of Britain to carry out much of the work on its power
stations.
Sikap is controlled by a subsidiary of the Malaysian Resources group (MRCB),
a fast expanding conglomerate controlled by a group close to Mr Anwar
Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister. MRCB controls Malaysia's biggest
publications group and a privately run TV station but has no track record in
the energy sector. Asea Brown Boveri, which will build the Sikap plant, has
a 20 per cent stake.
Banking debate is focused on two questions: whether it is wise for domestic
banks to be so exposed to one sector and why foreign institutions were not
involved in such large lending exercises.
Malaysia's banks have benefited from Malaysia's strong economic growth of
recent years. They are flush with funds. Some bankers say that in the
circumstances it makes sense for as much project financing as possible to be
generated locally. They say foreign banks have tried and failed to get a
piece of the action. 'It's all sour grapes,' said one local financier.
But this is by no means a generally held view. Malaysia is embarking on a
wide ranging programme to build up its infrastructure. A new international
airport is being built outside Kuala Lumpur. A mass transit system is being
planned for the capital. Multi-million dollar facilities are being built for
the Commonwealth Games, due to be held in Malaysia in 1998. Nationwide water
and sewerage schemes are under way. Domestic funds could be severely
squeezed if more recourse is not made to foreign borrowings.
Some financiers say that by diversifying fund sources the IPPs would
probably have won better terms. But foreign institutions decided against
participating.
'The whole area of IPPs is still very new,' said a Singapore-based merchant
banker. 'BOT arrangements are also largely untried. I think foreign
institutions got cold feet about getting involved.'

FT  19 APR 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan power deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KWU, the Siemens power generating equipment business, has won a contract
worth almost DM1bn (Pounds 400m) to equip the Hsinta power station, to be
built near the city of Tainan on Taiwan's south-west coast.
The contract, won against stiff international competition, is for a 2,364MW
gas-fired combined cycle power station, which Siemens says will be the
largest plant in countries with 60-cycle (Hz) networks - North America and
parts of Asia.
Siemens said the contract, from the Taiwan Power Company (TPC), made it the
leading supplier of combined-cycle technology to Taiwan. It was a result of
its increased orientation towards the south-east Asian market.
The Hsinta plant, due for completion in 1998, will have 15 gas and five
steam turbines, 20 generators, and 15 heat-recovery steam generators.

<TEXT>
GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering and transport group, yesterday
clinched a Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.43bn) contract to supply locomotives and
electrical equipment for South Korea's high speed railway.
Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel-Alsthom, GEC's French partner, said the
group had signed a letter of intent to supply the equipment and technology
for the 430km high-speed line which will link Seoul with the southern port
of Pusan. The total cost of the project, due to be completed by 2001, is
estimated at about Dollars 13bn.
The conclusion of negotiations marks the end of a protracted battle over the
past four years between GEC Alsthom and international rivals, including a
German consortium headed by Siemens and the Japanese Mitsubishi group. The
South Korean contract, one of the largest to be awarded in the industry, is
regarded as a strategically important project which can serve as a
bridgehead for further high-speed railway ventures in the region.
It is the first time that TGV technology has been transferred outside
France.
The South Korean companies will be allowed to sell the TGV to other Asian
countries once they assume full control of the transferred technology and
production in 2002.
GEC Alsthom had been granted sole negotiating rights for the contract last
August. But negotiations were extended as South Korea sought to lower costs
and increase the level of technology transfer.
The final contract price is about Dollars 270m lower than the bid offered
last August. The proportion of local manufacturing has also been increased
from about 44 per cent to 50 per cent, GEC Alsthom said.
The deal will be financed by a consortium of French banks, led by Banque
Indosuez.
Mr Suard said the competition for the contract had been fierce, but it
remained a profitable venture for GEC Alsthom. The project would guarantee
800 jobs for the group and its suppliers for four years.
According to Mr Suard, the price cut had been achieved through the effects
of exchange rate movements, and greater input from the Korean partners.
These include Hyundai Precision Industries, Daewoo Heavy Industries and
Hanjin Heavy Industries.
GEC Alsthom and its Korean partners will supply 46 high speed trains, 34 of
which will be built in South Korea.

A poll published in the state-owned El Nacional newspaper this week showed
the Mexican ruling party's presidential candidate leading by a wide margin,
backed by nearly a third of those surveyed, Reuter reports from Mexico City.
The poll showed Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the new candidate of the Institutional
Revolutionary party (PRI) since last month's assassination of Mr Luis
Donaldo Colosio, was favoured by 32 per cent of the 1,100 people surveyed.
The presidential candidate for the left-leaning Democratic Revolutionary
party, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, was supported by 12 per cent while Mr Diego
Fernandez de Cevallos, conservative National Action party candidate, was
favoured by 10 per cent of those surveyed.
The figures show a slight dip in the popularity of the PRI candidate since
Mr Colosio was shot dead on March 23 while campaigning in the northern city
of Tijuana.

FT  19 APR 94 / Greenspan plays an early hand: US rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
When a senior politician gives you cover, use it. That seems to be the
motivation for the unexpected quarter point increase in short-term rates
signalled by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, yesterday.
The Fed's move followed tacit approval by the Clinton administration at the
weekend of a further tightening of monetary policy. Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
Treasury secretary, said he expected short-term rates to rise another half
point, to 4 per cent, by the end of the year. His remarks make it virtually
certain that rates will rise at least that much, probably by early summer.
Mr Greenspan was doubtless also keen to respond to stronger-than-expected
economic data in recent weeks. Adjusted for the effects of severe winter
weather, recent figures indicate the pace of economic growth slowed little,
if at all, in the first quarter from the unsustainable rate of about 5 per
cent registered in the second half of last year.
In the first quarter, industrial production grew at an annual rate of 7.7
per cent compared with 6.7 per cent in last year's final quarter. The pace
of vehicle sales was stronger than at the end of last year and consumer
confidence was significantly higher. The main factor pulling down overall
growth was a sharp fall in construction, which reflected factors such as bad
weather and the Californian earthquake.
The view at the Fed is that unless further steps are taken to slow growth,
the economy will hit capacity constraints later this year. Yesterday's move
was thus intended to help prevent inflationary pressures, already visible in
rising commodity prices, eventually translating into broader upward pressure
on wholesale and consumer price inflation.
But although long bond yields have risen steeply in anticipation of further
rate increases, few analysts expected another rate increase so soon. Because
the previous two increases had been announced after meetings of the
policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, most were convinced the Fed
would not move again until a meeting scheduled for May 17. Fed officials
fuelled such speculation by indicating another increase in rates was
unlikely while markets remained in turmoil.
However, by moving yesterday, after a conference call with the Fed's
regional presidents, Mr Greenspan was able to quash rumours that his own
authority within the Fed had been eroded. Some US commentators had
speculated that the FOMC was no longer giving the chairman his customary
discretion to raise or lower rates between meetings, if economic conditions
seemed to warrant action.
The increase in short rates to 3.75 per cent takes the Fed closer to its
goal of re-establishing a 'neutral' monetary policy. But it has clearly not
reached its destination. Yesterday most analysts were betting that the Fed
would raise rates by another quarter point at the May 17 meeting. A further
quarter or half point increase is then probable in ensuing weeks, taking
short rates to about 4.5 per cent by mid-year.
What happens thereafter will depend on the pace of economic growth and
inflation trends. Analysts expect the growth rate to decline from 4-5 per
cent at an annual rate now to about 3 per cent towards the end of this year,
partly as a result of the increase in short and long-term rates that has
already occurred.
Monetarist-leaning economists also point out that increases in short rates
have already sharply reduced the rate of growth of bank reserves and other
narrow monetary aggregates. They expect this to result in slower growth of
nominal spending later this year. Taking all these factors into
consideration, optimists believe the Fed might not need to raise rates much
beyond 4.5 per cent.
History, however, suggests that business cycle upswings are quite hard to
control once they gain momentum. Later this year the US could begin to get a
boost from economic recovery in Europe and other trading partners. The Fed
may thus face irresistible pressure to raise short-term rates to 5 per cent
or higher - well above the levels so far sanctioned by senior Clinton
administration officials.

A second US congressman has raised the issue of an American military
invasion of Haiti, but only after first tightening sanctions against the
troubled Caribbean state, Reuter reports from Washington.
Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, said on Sunday: 'I don't think
it is the first step, but it is certainly high on my list of options,
depending on what the scenario afterwards would be.'
Representative David Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat, said in a newspaper
interview last week that US forces should invade Haiti to remove its
military government, which ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide shortly
after he became Haiti's first democratically elected head of state. Mr
Aristide should then call for new internationally supervised elections, Mr
Kerry said.
The State Department had said that it would look at the call for an
invasion, but that Washington would meanwhile continue to pursue a
diplomatic solution.
The invasion calls came as Mr Aristide criticised US policy on Haiti and
urged Washington to increase sanctions against the military rulers.
He said during a visit to Berkeley, California, that he was unhappy with
President Bill Clinton's policy on Haiti, which he described as 'racist' and
'a clear violation of human rights'.
He condemned the US for forcibly repatriating Haitian refugees trying to
flee the island where, according to news reports, a new wave of political
terror has been launched against his supporters.

FT  19 APR 94 / Health options for Clinton: Mitchell outlines less costly
alternatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton left Washington for Milwaukee yesterday on yet
another drive to promote healthcare reform amid signs that he is willing to
back more modest alternatives advanced by Senator George Mitchell, the
Democratic majority leader.
Mr Mitchell, who last week turned down a chance to serve on the Supreme
Court in order to lead the fight for healthcare reform, laid out his ideas
at a weekend party policy retreat in Virginia. Mr Clinton attended the
session, as did Mr Ira Magaziner, the White House adviser who is one of the
principal architects of the administration's bill.
According to the New York Times, Mr Mitchell's suggestions preserve the
essentials of the president's goals - universal uncancellable coverage, with
employers bearing a share of costs for workers.
But each of his variations would be less costly to both the government and
companies. For example, Mr Mitchell raised the idea that employers should be
asked to bear only 50 per cent of the insurance bill, rather than the 80 per
cent in the administration proposals, with companies with more than 1,000
staff retaining the option to provide their own healthcare programme. The
Clinton plan confines this option to those with more than 5,000 employees.
He also suggested a more limited package of insurance benefits and different
ways of subsidising small businesses by basing such payments not on total
payrolls but on the age of each worker. This, he argued, would spread
subsidies more evenly to make easier coverage for the lower paid.
Mr Mitchell calculated that his approach could reduce the average employer
premium for each family by about 16 per cent and cut the government bill by
about Dollars 150bn-Dollars 165bn (Pounds 103bn-Pounds 113bn) by the end of
the century. Earlier this year the Congressional Budget Office, the
independent watchdog, reported that the Clinton plan would increase federal
spending, not cut it, by Dollars 74bn by the year 2000.
The senator did not portray his ideas as a concrete plan but he recognises
the importance of making legislative progress in the weeks ahead, given the
assumption that the Clinton plan, as drafted, cannot pass.

FT  19 APR 94 / Fears that Brazil debt deal may fail to end uncertainty:
Angus Foster and Stephen Fidler wonder if the slips 'twixt cup and lip are
over after years of uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Rhodes, chairman of the steering committee of banks which on
Friday completed the restructuring of Brazil's Dollars 49bn (Pounds 33.5bn)
of commercial debt, is fond of the saying 'many a slip 'twixt cup and lip'
to refer to the unpredictability of debt deals.
He and Mr Pedro Malan, the Brazilian central bank governor, were at last
able to toast the deal after a rush to meet the deadline of Friday midnight
in New York. But both men may have wondered, after more than a decade of
uncertainty about Brazil's debt, whether the slips were really over.
Legally, the restructuring is finished and most participants probably hope
its long and at times acrimonious negotiations can be forgotten.
The deal will help restore Brazil's standing with the international
financial community. However, the country's political and economic
uncertainty probably prevents the type of sudden rush of confidence seen
after other Latin American deals.
But there are two problems. First, the Dart family of the US, who hold about
Dollars 1.4bn of debt, refused to take part in the restructuring and may try
to challenge it through legal action. Secondly, Brazil holds presidential
elections in October and the front-runner in the polls, the left wing Mr
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, leads a party committed to seeking better terms
from its bank creditors.
'Completion is a cause for a good deal of celebration, but some trepidation
also,' a Brazilian banker remarked.
The restructuring agreed on Friday was the longest in the 14 years of the
debt crisis with negotiations beginning in October 1990.
The deal was also the most complicated of the 'Brady' restructurings - named
after the 1989 initiative by then US Treasury secretary Nicholas Brady -
since it offered creditors a complicated package of six options. These
involved a range of securities and interest rates and rescheduled debt
principal for up to 30 years.
Under the deal agreed on Friday, Brazil issued Dollars 7.3bn of
collateralised discount bonds; Dollars 8.4bn of collateralised par bonds;
Dollars 8.5bn in debt conversion bonds; Dollars 2.1bn of new money bonds;
Dollars 1.7bn in interest reduction bonds; Dollars 7.3bn of interest
reduction bonds with capitalisation; and Dollars 5.6bn of past due interest
bonds.
A further Dollars 2.1bn will be converted into discount and par bonds once
collateral is delivered in the next two years. Brazil delivered Dollars
2.8bn of the Dollars 4.6bn due as collateral on Friday and drew down Dollars
353m under the new money option. The central bank estimated the agreement
would reduce by Dollars 4bn Brazil's external debt. It will also lead to
further savings of Dollars 4bn in reduced debt servicing costs.
Brazil is the last of the big four Latin American debtors to secure a Brady
restructuring. Mexico led the way, followed by Venezuela and Argentina.
Brazil's deal broke new ground because interest arrears of some Dollars 17bn
were negotiated separately and before the restructuring of some Dollars 31bn
of principal debt.
It was also the first debt agreement to be concluded without an accord in
place with the International Monetary Fund, although Nigeria completed a
deal while out of compliance with the targets of its Fund programme. Brazil
failed to win an IMF accord last month, mainly because the IMF was concerned
about the stability of the country's economic reforms.
Mr Michael Atkin of the Institute for International Finance, a study group
in Washington owned mainly by international banks, said before the deal's
closing: 'The completion of the deal without the IMF seal of approval would
break new ground and signals a shift in the importance attached by the
markets to the Bretton Woods institutions.'
The lack of an IMF accord meant the Brazilian government could not secure a
special issue of zero coupon US Treasury bonds to act as a guarantee in the
restructuring. Instead, Brazil was forced to buy those bonds directly from
the market. Brazil has admitted it started buying zeros in October in case
the IMF accord was not granted.
In spite of the IMF setback, the banks remained keen to complete the deal.
They feared a further delay would lead to the deal being shelved before the
elections.
Lawyers for Brazil's central bank and the country's bank creditors will now
be waiting to see what action, if any, the Darts will take. The family - led
by Mr Kenneth Dart who was recently reported to have become a Belize citizen
 -is likely, along with other investors, to have taken sharp losses with the
declines in recent weeks of sovereign debt prices.
While the banks wait for the Darts, there was good news last week from Mr da
Silva. He and fellow moderates won a fierce debate about foreign debt in the
Sao Paulo branch of his Workers' Party (PT).
This may mean his party's election stance will be to seek renegotiation of
Brazil's foreign debt rather than a debt moratorium, as many PT radicals
demand.
Mr Alozio Mercadante, another PT moderate and possible finance minister if
Mr da Silva wins, said: 'The present government is at the end of its mandate
and is weak, so cannot be the best interlocutor of our foreign debt. This
new debt agreement can therefore only be temporary.'
The bankers' hope must be that either the PT's poll lead drains away or that
an incoming PT government will have many other domestic priorities before
that of fighting its bank creditors. Otherwise, the banks may start
reminding Mr Rhodes of his favourite saying.

FT  19 APR 94 / Serbs rob west of Russian prize: John Lloyd on a setback to
hopes for a Partnership for Peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no constituency of any weight in Russia which would agree that
Serbs should be punished militarily for their aggression in Bosnia. If the
west agrees further use of force there, it will lose Russia.
The west wants to draw Russia into a broad security alliance, through the
initial medium of the Nato-inspired Partnership for Peace: and it is this
desire which the Russians are using as a bargaining card in Bosnia.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, the special envoy to former Yugoslavia, said in a radio
interview earlier this month that the choice before Russia was whether to
continue partnership and co-operation with the European countries and the
US, 'or whether we need to return to the past and attempt to retire into
ourselves and somehow gather the Commonwealth of Independent States under us
as a hen does her chicks and in this self-imposed isolation attempt to work
out our problems'.
But that was before the Nato bombardment a week ago of Serb armour around
Sarajevo without consultation with the Russians. Immediately after that,
President Boris Yeltsin made clear that Russia's line was unswervingly
against force. 'It would mean war forever,' he warned, adding that the
Partnership for Peace was no longer a priority issue because of the lack of
consultation.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia foreign minister, despatched at the weekend to try
to broker yet another agreement from the Serbs on a ceasefire, came back on
Sunday saying Russia would not sign the Partnership unless its scope was
considerably extended. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister and
another former enthusiast for the Partnership, also pulled away, saying of
Nato: 'I don't like it when people tell me one thing and then do another. It
seems we have to think again.'
Mr Kozyrev should have gone to Brussels this week to sign up for the
Partnership deal but called off his visit. He has since said Russia wants
something broader than a planned framework agreement that would allow it to
have notice of 'unilateral actions' by its former enemy.
'The problem is that . . . there should be close co-ordination and we become
partners,' he said in a Russian television interview yesterday. 'People take
signing of those three pages (framework agreement) as marriage and in effect
it is at best a date.
'We want real marriage and we stick to this,' he added.
In the state duma (lower house of parliament) yesterday Mr Sergei Yuzhenkov,
chairman of the House defence committee (and himself a member of the liberal
Russia's Choice party) struggled to keep the possibility of signing the
Partnership alive.
However, even he said it was impossible without a series of conditions,
including a recognition of Russia's special status (though this could be
done after Russia joined the Partnership), an agreement not to use force in
Bosnia and a commitment from Nato that Russia would not lose its traditional
armaments markets.
'It would be a courageous move by the president and General Grachev to say
again that they support the Partnership for Peace and that they intend to
join it, no matter what happens in the former Yugoslavia,' said Mr Yuzhenkov
yesterday.
However he admits that this is unlikely, though he insists that the basic
calculations in the foreign and defence ministries remain unchanged. 'They
do not want for Russia to again be isolated,' he said.
Both Mr Kozyrev and Mr Churkin yesterday voiced extreme displeasure at the
Bosnian Serb forces, both with their actions in Gorazde and with their
attacks on Russian peace keepers around Sarajevo. However, both are now
pressing for an end to the sanctions on Serbia as a prelude to the Serbs
lifting their siege and getting down to talks again.
To the west, this may seem like aggression rewarded: to the Russians, with
their quite different view of the Serbs, it is lifting the pressure to
encourage reasonable behaviour.
Russia is again emerging as a geo-political player after nearly two years of
restrained diplomacy and adopting the posture of agreeing with the US on
most matters. It has now fully emerged as the leader of the CIS, some half
of which states have already indicated they wish to join the Partnership -
another reason for Russia to want to do so.
If Russia succeeds in reaching a working relationship with Nato, it will do
so only by curbing what it sees as the latter's excesses and by gaining
recognition of its special status within the CIS - both of which could be
hard for the western states to swallow.
The internal resistance within Russia to close co-operation with the west
has risen, and remains high: parties such as the extremist Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats, the Communists and many of the so-called
centrists are hostile, or at best sceptical, making the passage of Russia's
accession to the Partnership through parliament far from automatic.
If it is agreed, continuing hostility - the legacy of centuries of relative
isolation - will make it an awkward and capricious partner. But partnership
with Russia is the prize: and for that, sacrifices in Bosnia must apparently
be endured.

FT  19 APR 94 / EBRD chairwoman gives warning on gradualism in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Western bankers and economic policymakers yesterday used the relaunch of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to reinforce the Russian
leadership's commitment to the structural reform needed to underpin moves
towards a market economy and improve access to foreign finance, write
Anthony Robinson, Leyla Boulton and Chrystia Freeland in St Petersburg.
Citing the example of 'fast-track' Central European countries like Poland
and the Czech Republic, Mrs Anne Wibble, chairwoman of the bank's governors,
warned that gradualism would not ease the pain of transition but lead to a
'vicious circle of prolonged high inflation, capital flight and economic
stagnation with high social costs'. A similar message was relayed by G7
deputies at an earlier closed session meeting with Mr Victor Chernomyrdin,
Russia's prime minister who was encouraged to continue the tight monetary
policies inherited from Mr Boris Fyodorov, the ousted finance minister, and
create a more welcoming legal and fiscal environment for foreign investors.
In his opening speech at the EBRD conference Mr Chernomyrdin said 'Russia's
commitment to reform and structural adjustments remains the linchpin of
Russian economic policy'. But he called on the EBRD and other western
institutions to co-ordinate their efforts and proposed a specialised
international agency to insure investment projects in Russia against
non-commercial risk. He warned that without new factories built with the aid
of foreign investment, reforms would be vulnerable.
Reuter adds: Mrs Wibble is expected to be succeeded after her one-year term
in the chair by Mr Pedro Solbes, Spanish economy minister.

A Netherlands crematorium has been chosen to co-ordinate an EU-subsidised
investigation into the environmental effects of cremation. Ms Romea Fenster,
head of Amsterdam's Westgaarde burial ground and crematorium, said that the
study will focus on the impact of strewing ashes and of gases released
during cremation. The European Union is providing half the project's
Ecu350,000 (Pounds 269,000) cost. The study, by crematoria in the
Netherlands and Italy, may lead to EU guidelines, Ms Fenster said. 'We
should be thinking about it now or it could become a problem,' she said.
Nearly half the Dutch dead are cremated, compared with about 70 per cent of
Britons.

The Netherlands' ruling coalition of Christian Democrats (CDA) and Labour
looks set to lose its majority in parliament in the national elections on
May 3, according to an opinion poll released yesterday. The coalition,
currently led by Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, won 103 seats in the 1989
election, but the poll predicts it will muster only 61 seats in the 150-seat
lower house of parliament in May. The CDA has been hit by Mr Lubbers'
impending departure from politics, and its share of the vote is forecast to
plummet to 28 seats from 54 in 1989. Labour is expected to win 33 seats,
down from 49 but better than earlier forecasts of 25 seats. The poll,
conducted by the Nipo polling company, shows that the next coalition would
have to consist of at least three parties to rule effectively.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's road transport is expected to suffer serious disruptions from a
three-day strike by petrol station operators. The strike, which began at 7pm
yesterdayand is due to end at 7am on Friday,is the product of a long-running
dispute between petrol station operators and the oil companies. The
operators claim they are inadequately protected against price changes, but
the oil companies claim the strike is a disguised protest against efforts to
liberalise opening hours and operating conditions. The strike also reflects
the problems petrol stations operators foresee in dealing with full price
liberalisation and the introduction of discount pricing in May. Strikes
which inconvenience the public and cause economic loss are likely to come
under scrutiny by the new right-wing government pledged to greater
liberalisation.

Russia does not have the technical or financial capacity to process the

Vishnevsky, president of the state committee for the supervision of nuclear
and radiation safety, said yesterday. Mr Viktor Gubanov, head of the
committee for safety and ecology at the ministry for atomic energy, said
Russia was finalising a federal programme to process nuclear waste but cash
shortages could prevent the programme being implemented in full. Mr Gubanov
said the ministry was ready to pay Rbs520m towards the project but it would
actually cost five or six times that.

FT  19 APR 94 / Backing for tighter air aid rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday won firm backing from transport ministers
to draw up clearer guidelines on government subsidies to state-owned
airlines. Brussels is expected to tighten the rules by June  - before
deciding on a controversial request by the French government to inject up to
FFr20bn (Pounds 2.34bn) into Air France. In spite of French misgivings
yesterday, and fierce lobbying by Paris, ministers agreed that 'new, clearly
defined rules on state aids. . . . should be drawn up by the Commission'.
Until now, Brussels has cleared most state aids to flag carriers on the
understanding that it was a 'last time' injection linked to restructuring.
This approach was endorsed in February by a Commission-sponsored 'committee
of wise men' drawn from the industry. But civil aviation liberals are on the
offensive, complaining that Air France, which has already had capital
injections approved by Brussels, was coming back for more.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union transport ministers yesterday opted to do more to open up
Europe's national railway monopolies, and put in place later this year
further measures to encourage independent and cross-border rail operators.
Ministers gave an initial green light to two proposals designed to build on
the seminal 1991 decision to open up Europe's fragmented rail network to
private and transnational train services.
That gave joint ventures between companies of more than one member state
access to all EU rail networks needed to provide the service, and the right
to the entire EU network to companies operating 'combined transport' freight
services - shifting cargo through a combination of rail and road. Fifteen
months after the start-up of the single market, however, the 1991
legislative breakthrough has had no practical result. Brussels has therefore
come forward with two supplementary laws on access and charging for
companies that want to take up their right to use rail infrastructure.
The national monopolies have to account separately for infrastructure and
operating costs, in order to be able to set charges for new entrants using
state-owned networks. The EU will now work to systematise this, and to agree
on a system whereby a licence to operate granted by one member state is
valid throughout the EU.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union tried to pick up the pieces of its Bosnia policy
yesterday with an Anglo-French appeal for a new united diplomatic front
against the Bosnian Serbs.
The initiative aims to co-ordinate US, Russian, European and United Nations
efforts to achieve a peace settlement in Bosnia after the humiliating
weekend reversal in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde.
EU foreign ministers discussed the proposal at a meeting in Luxembourg
yesterday, amid much hand-wringing in the face of the Serbian assault on
Gorazde, which had been declared a UN-protected safe area.
However, there were signs of reservations within the Clinton administration
about the wisdom of streamlining western and Russian diplomatic efforts
through a new UN Security Council resolution.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, failed to persuade Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, to agree to the plan during a telephone
conversation yesterday, though he said Mr Christopher supported the
principle of streamlined diplomacy.
Mr Hurd, who described the Serb assault on Goradze as a 'serious setback',
said it made no sense to have three separate diplomatic efforts. Mr Alain
Juppe, French foreign minister, said the separate European, Russian and US
diplomatic tracks had made it easier for the Bosnian Serbs to play a 'double
game'.
Despite evidence of disarray in UN and Nato policy toward Bosnia, Mr Hurd
said ministers were not inclined to despair.
He pointed to recent 'successes' such as the ceasefire in Sarajevo, the
takeover of Tuzla airport, and the relief mission in Vitez.
Ministers agreed that it would be wrong to withdraw UN forces at this stage,
or to lift the UN arms embargo so that Bosnian Moslems could defend
themselves. It was not possible to impose a solution by force, Mr Hurd
insisted.
Instead, ministers were working on a declaration calling for a ceasefire in
Gorazde, to be followed up with deployment of extra UN forces in Bosnia.
Britain was prepared to contribute, while not increasing its present
contingent in former Yugoslavia.
The aim would be to achieve a general ceasefire, coupled with a stepped-up
effort to achieve a territorial settlement between Bosnian Moslems, Serbs
and Croats.

FT  19 APR 94 / Strauss's ghost returns to haunt Bavaria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Something is rotten in the proud and prosperous Free State of Bavaria, once
a byword for the post-war success story of the German federal republic.
The reputation of the late Mr Franz Josef Strauss - political godfather of
the southern German state, several times premier in Munich, unsuccessful
candidate for federal chancellor and formerly both finance and defence
minister in Bonn - is under attack as never before.
It is not so much his political stance as Germany's most articulate and
controversial post-war conservative which is under fire, but his links with
wealthy Bavarian entrepreneurs. Now his successors at the head of the
conservative Christian Social Union in Bavaria, sister party of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union in the rest of the country, are
fighting a rearguard action to save their absolute majority in the state
parliament, their seats in the European parliament, and ultimately their
place in the Bonn coalition.
Latest in the firing line is Mr Edmund Stoiber, current Bavarian premier,
CSU strong man and formerly chief personal aide and minister of state in Mr
Strauss's chancellery.
The irony is that he has sought to present himself as Mr Clean, presiding
over a regime free of the whiff of corruption which always accompanied the
rule of the flamboyant Mr Strauss, who died in office in 1988. Yet the 'back
to basics' moral crusade he has launched now threatens his own position.
Mr Stoiber was last week forced to release a formal government statement on
a welter of accusations from the press and opposition Social Democrats about
alleged wrongful intervention by Mr Strauss in the tax affairs of Mr Eduard
Zwick, a multi-millionaire businessman and close friend now living in
Switzerland.
Mr Strauss is alleged to have sought to have either the prosecution against
Mr Zwick - for alleged tax evasion totalling more than DM70m (Pounds 28m) -
quashed, or a compromise negotiated allowing him to return to the country.
Although Mr Stoiber, who was finance minister under Mr Strauss, has denied
any personal involvement in the Zwick saga, both Spiegel magazine and the
Suddeutsche Zeitung in Munich have published detailed allegations suggesting
they were involved.
This week Mr Zwick's son, Johannes, who has been held on remand since
January, accused of involvement in the tax evasion, is due to give evidence
before a parliamentary inquiry in Munich. Bavaria is waiting with bated
breath to see if he will provide more evidence to back up his father's
bitter claims - in an interview with Spiegel - about the close financial
ties he had with both Mr Strauss and the CSU.
Already, however, the saga has taken its toll of the political fortunes of
Mr Stoiber and the CSU. The former is now trailing his SPD rival in Bavaria,
Ms Renate Schmidt, by 47 per cent to 41 per cent, in a popularity poll
published by Spiegel. As for their parties, the CSU is still in front with
43 per cent, but the SPD (with 36) could possibly form a governing coalition
with the Greens (8 per cent) if the figures hold true in the September poll.

'I hate to do this - please excuse me,' murmured Mr Jacques de Larosiere as
he jumped the milling queue of bankers, consultants and lawyers forced by
the rigidity of Soviet-trained security men to wait outside St Petersburg's
Manezh palace on Sunday night.
This quiet apology from the courtly president of the European bank for
Reconstruction and Development on his way to an official reception neatly
underlined the change of style at the bank since the ousting of its
mercurial founding president, Mr Jacques Attali, nine months ago.
The former managing director of the IMF and chairman of the Bank of France,
yesterday pleased shareholder governments at the bank's annual meeting by
unveiling a more pragmatic approach to its activities and promising closer
co-operation with other investors and international financial institutions.
He also pleased the bank's east European clients by promising to increase
the EBRD's presence on the ground in post-communist Europe and the central
Asian states.
'It's a leaner, more hard driving organisation,' commented Mr Laurence
Summers, the US representative, who added he was now more confident the US
Congress would be more amenable to approving Washington's Dollars 73m
contribution to the bank's capital.
Speaking in the historic Tauvrichisky palace, which housed pre-revolutionary
Russia's parliament before being turned over to Lenin's Petrograd Soviet, Mr
de Larosiere outlined a more clearly focused strategy for assisting the
region's fledgling private banks and businessmen and raising the bank's
leverage with co-investors.
To date, the bank's financial commitment of Dollars 3.7bn to 156 projects
has attracted co-financing which pushes the total value of EBRD-linked
projects to Dollars 11.7bn. This is around 15 per cent of foreign direct
investment in the region, he added.
The symbolic decision to hold the bank's third annual meeting in the former
Russian capital, built by Peter the Great as Russia's 'window on the west',
was pushed through at Mr Attali's insistence two years ago. That decision
has been vindicated. Apart from attracting potential investors it justified
a meeting between ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial
countries and top Russian economic decision makers which provided an
opportunity to focus on Russia's problems and opportunities.
At their meeting with Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister,
the G7 leaders emphasised the virtues of currency stability, the key role of
positive real interest rates and the need for the Russian authorities to
convince potential foreign investors that they were really wanted.
Above all, the G7 sought to impress upon Mr Chernomyrdin, the former 'Czar'
of the Gazprom gas utility that is Russia's most jealously guarded economic
'crown jewel', that western investors would seriously invest in energy
projects only if they were allowed to take equity stakes and a satisfactory
degree of managerial control.
Yesterday, Mr Chernomyrdin acknowledged that 'not all Russian enterprises
welcome foreign investment' and promised his government would 'do all it can
to bolster the psychological aspects of foreign investment'. It would also
continue the tighter money policies introduced by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the
former finance minister, which had reduced inflation to around 10 per cent a
month, he added.
But, in one of the dozens of seminars and presentations over the past four
days, the Institute of International Finance (IIF), the banking fraternity's
own think-tank, revealed with brutal clarity the cost of Russia's past
policy errors.
The IIF calculates that Russia exported oil, gas and other products worth
Dollars 90bn over the past three years. But Dollars 40bn was never
repatriated, largely because of negative rouble interests rates, failure to
control inflation and the same lack of a proper legal framework for business
and investment which deters foreign investors.
This capital flight is virtually identical to the inflows of foreign, mainly
governmental and institutional, money, which has flowed into Russia over the
same period. The outflow means Russia has had virtually no practical benefit
from western financial assistance.
But it also shows the potential role which Russian capital, however dubious
its origins and legal ownership, can play in reconstructing the Russian
economy, provided Moscow adopts the policies and creates the institutions
which have already proved successful in central Europe, and which have been
pressed on Moscow with such insistence at the EBRD conference.

FT  19 APR 94 / Berlusconi looks to centre for support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's right-wing Freedom Alliance, victorious in last month's general
election, has turned to the centre parties to broaden its parliamentary
support and widen the choice in forming a government.
The outcome of these talks, which began last weekend, will determine the
complexion of the next government and the fate of the two small centre
parties. Initial reactions suggest the centre is deeply divided on the
issue; there are also reservations about the move within the Freedom
Alliance.
The charm offensive is being conducted by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media
magnate and likely next prime minister. It is being directed at the Popular
party (PPI), formed in January from the mainstream of the former Christian
Democrats, and the Pact for Italy of reformist Mr Mario Segni, who is also
an ex-Christian Democrat.
These two parties were the chief victims of the new first-past-the-post
voting system in the election. They were squeezed between the Freedom
Alliance on their right and the Progressive Alliance, headed by the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), on the left.
Mr Berlusconi's offer is based on three considerations. He is mainly
concerned to ensure the stability of his prospective government by having a
clear majority in the senate. At present the Freedom Alliance - composed of
Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the populist Northern League, the neo-fascist
MSI/National Alliance and the Christian Democrat Centre - is at least six
seats short of a majority there.
Since both houses perform duplicate functions, a Freedom Alliance government
permanently risks legislation not passing through the senate. This situation
was underlined by the tense vote electing Mr Carlo Scognamiglio as speaker.
He won on Saturday by one vote on the fourth round against Mr Giovanni
Spadolini, the outgoing speaker.
A second consideration is Mr Berlusconi's desire to pull his government more
towards the centre and so soften the impact of having the MSI on board. His
original overtures, even before he formally entered politics in January,
were towards the Christian Democrats and Mr Segni.
Only after both rejected him did he forge deals first with Mr Umberto
Bossi's League and then with Mr Gianfranco Fini's MSI. He was also able to
pick up the small right wing of the Christian Democrats who reformed into
the Christian Democrat Centre.
Linked to this opening to the centre is a desire to balance the
unpredictable presence of the League. From previous experience, Mr Bossi is
likely to use the threat of withdrawing his support as a way to increase
political leverage.
The final reason is to expand the reservoir of people on whom Mr Berlusconi
can draw to form a government.

<TEXT>
Greek doctors began a nationwide five-day strike yesterday in protest at the
government's decision to tax them under a new system which tells them how
much they earn and how much tax they should pay. They say that the system is
harsh on doctors earning less than the set level and soft on those earning
more. Doctors claim that the new system may lead to many giving up the
profession. Lawyers have been striking for the same reason for seven weeks,
leading to postponement of 60,000 court cases. Dentists plan a one-day
strike tomorrow, and truckers have announced an indefinite strike.
Parliament is to start debating the new tax system today and may vote by the
end of the week.

The Netherlands' ruling coalition of Christian Democrats (CDA) and Labour
looks set to lose its majority in parliament in the national elections on
May 3, according to an opinion poll released yesterday. The coalition,
currently led by Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, won 103 seats in the 1989
election, but the poll predicts it will muster only 61 seats in the 150-seat
lower house of parliament in May.
The CDA has been hit by Mr Lubbers' impending departure from politics, and
its share of the vote is forecast to plummet to 28 seats from 54 in 1989.
Labour is expected to win 33 seats, down from 49 but better than earlier
forecasts of 25 seats.
The poll, conducted by the Nipo polling company, shows that the next
coalition would have to consist of at least three parties to rule
effectively.

FT  19 APR 94 / Economic Watch: Construction equipment dip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   London
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of construction equipment in Europe fell by 11 per cent last year  -
the biggest annual fall for more than a decade - and could drop a further 5
per cent this year because of a sharp decline in demand in the biggest
market: Germany. The forecast, from the London-based Corporate Intelligence
Group, provides a gloomy backdrop to Intermat, the construction equipment
exhibition, which opens today in Paris. The research group says unit sales
of equipment fell last year for the third year running, to 88,177 from
98,669 in 1992, and predicts they will decline to 83,500 units this year.
Post-reunification Germany accounted for 46 per cent of European sales last
year, compared with just 18 per cent in 1989. This rise was fuelled by the
building boom and demand for equipment in eastern Germany, but the peak
passed in 1992. Overall German sales fell 12 per cent last year, and another
15 per cent fall is expected this year before stabilising in 1995.
Poland's first-quarter industrial output grew by 10.6 per cent year-on-year,
the central statistical office said. This is almost double the 5.6 per cent
for the whole of 1993.
Capital flows into the Czech Republic rose 37 per cent in 1993 from a year
earlier to nearly Dollars 2.9bn, according to the Czech national bank.
Portugal's industrial production index fell 1.3 per cent in December after
rising 5.5 per cent in November, the national statistics institute said
yesterday.
Norway's current account surplus rose to NKr4.24bn (Pounds 387m) in January
from NKr3.39bn (Pounds 310m) a year earlier, according to the central bureau
of statistics.

FT  19 APR 94 / Factory gate price rises slow to 2.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inflationary pressures remain subdued in the UK, while consumer confidence
has been hit by this month's tax rises, according to reports published
yesterday.
The news appeared to strengthen the domestic case for a cut in interest
rates, but the authorities might be restricted by the Federal Reserve's move
yesterday to raise US rates.
Producer output prices - the price of goods leaving factories - rose by 2.7
per cent in the year to March, the lowest annual increase since September
1992, according to the Central Statistical Office.
Producer input prices - the cost of raw materials and fuels - fell by 2.6
per cent in the year to March, compared with a fall of 2.9 per cent in
February.
Figures for producer prices are seen as a leading indicator for trends in
the retail prices index. Last week, the CSO reported that the annual rate of
underlying inflation had fallen to 2.4 per cent in March.
Meanwhile, the latest Gallup survey of consumer confidence, conducted for
the European Commission, showed UK consumers more pessimistic than at any
time since March 1990. The Gallup survey is watched closely by the
government and is regularly commented on by the Treasury.
The Gallup survey has shown a steady decline in confidence this year. The
balance of those expecting a decline in their financial position over the
next 12 months, as against those expecting an improvement, was 30 percentage
points in April, compared with 25 points in March.
Minutes of monthly monetary meetings, published last week, showed that Mr
Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, appeared to agree on March 2 that a further cut in base rates might
be justified if signs of economic weakness were accompanied by evidence that
inflation was under control.

FT  19 APR 94 / Rate rise hits US bonds and shares: Markets surprised as Fed
signals fresh increase in short-term interest levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, surprised financial
markets yesterday by signalling another rise in short-term interest rates in
an effort to prevent rapid economic growth fuelling inflation.
The quarter-point increase in short-term rates to 3.75 per cent prompted
sharp falls in bond and share prices. Late in the afternoon, the benchmark
long bond had plunged nearly 1 1/2 points, pushing the yield to 7.41 per
cent.
Share prices followed the pattern set by bonds, as they have in the wake of
previous rate rises. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 41.05 lower
at 3,620.42, as declining issues overwhelmed advances by an eight-to-three
margin.
The rate increase, the third since the Fed began to tighten monetary policy
on February 4, came sooner than expected. On Wall Street most analysts had
been confident the Fed would not move again until May 17 when its
policy-making open market committee is due to meet.
Mr Greenspan, however, may have decided to take advantage of political cover
extended by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, who said at the weekend
that he expected short-term rates to rise by another half-point before the
end of the year.
Senior Clinton administration officials believe there is little or no risk
of a significant increase in inflation but, so far, have opted not to force
an overt confrontation with the Fed.
Ms Laura Tyson, chief White House economist, yesterday reiterated her
support for Fed independence, but argued that short-term rates were rising
in response to faster economic growth rather than expectations of higher
inflation.
The Fed believes rate increases are necessary to re-establish a 'neutral'
monetary policy after a period of deliberate stimulus during the credit
crunch of the early 1990s.
Yesterday's move reflected continuing concern at the Fed that the economy is
expanding at a rate well in excess of its long-run potential rate of growth.
Recent figures have pointed to economic growth at an annual rate of 4-5 per
cent in the current quarter, if not higher. If growth is not checked,
officials fear the economy could hit capacity constraints, putting upward
pressure on inflation.
The quarter-point increase in rates, although intended to bolster the Fed's
anti-inflation credentials, was seen as only an interim measure. Most
analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by another quarter-point at the May
17 meeting. Further rate increases are likely during the summer if economic
growth shows no signs of subsiding.
'The bond market is facing a black hole,' said Mr Robert Giordano, chief
economist at Gold man Sachs in New York. He said bond prices would stabilise
only if there was clear evidence of an economic slowdown or if short rates
were significantly higher. Neither was likely in the next two to three
months.
European government bond markets also tumbled in the wake of the rate rise,
with bond futures prices dropping between 1 and 2 points on the day.
The markets had opened in a sombre mood, digesting the small, rather
disappointing cut in German interest rates from last week.
However, the dollar rose more than a pfennig on the Fed announcement to a
high of DM1.7220, but then fell back slightly to close in London at
DM1.7202. Against the yen it was slightly weaker at Y103.625 from Y103.645
at Friday's close.

Foreign ministers of the European Union pledged to restore the west's
shattered credibility over Bosnia yesterday as the Serbs consolidated their
newly established position in the enclave of Gorazde.
The UK and France pressed for a streamlined approach uniting the US,
Russian, United Nations and European peace efforts in Bosnia. It was also
aimed at avoiding fresh tensions between Europe and the US over Bosnia,
while preventing Russia from siding more closely with the Serbs.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton insisted that a negotiated settlement
was still possible. 'I do think that the big things are still working in the
long term in favour of peace,' he told reporters, while acknowledging that
recent news from Gorazde was 'grim and disappointing'.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary general of the UN which has seen its
'safe haven' policy thwarted by the Serb advance, last night said he was
seeking more effective protection for all such enclaves in Bosnia. He has
asked Nato for stand-by authority to request air strikes  - as distinct from
the close air support for peacekeepers currently authorised - but Mr Yuli
Vorontsov, the Russian UN ambassador, said he opposed automatic use of air
strikes.
The Bosnian Serbs yesterday put forward their terms for the effective
partition of Gorazde as General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia,
warned of a 'major humanitarian catastrophe' for tens of thousands of
Moslems trapped in the enclave.
The Serbs reiterated promises, first voiced on Sunday night, to keep their
guns out of a 3km exclusion zone on the west bank of the river Drina, which
runs through Gorazde. That would formalise the existing situation.
The Serbs pledged to allow deployment of 300 UN soldiers in the exclusion
zone, which would effectively leave the eastern part of Gorazde under Serb
control. 'We will make a Serbian municipality on the east bank of the Drina.
We can discuss the fate of the other part of the city in peace talks later,'
said Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader.
In Luxembourg, EU foreign ministers tried to salvage something from the
wreckage of western policy toward Bosnia with an Anglo-French appeal for a
united diplomatic front to halt further Serb territorial aggression. The EU
called for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire in Gorazde and appealed to
the Bosnian Serbs to 'honour their word' in the UN-brokered peace talks.
Lord Owen, the EU mediator, said the strategy was to achieve a ceasefire,
deploy extra UN forces and quickly resume negotiations on a new map for
Bosnia.
European delegations expressed frustration that the US was holding back
funding to the UN, hampering efforts to provide extra forces. In London Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said that of 8,000 additional troops
pledged to the UN force only the UK's battalion group and 300 other troops -
totalling 1,200 - had arrived.
The EU initiative came as Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian peace envoy,
attacked the Bosnian Serbs for breaking their promises to him. 'A group of
Bosnian Serb extremists have fallen ill with the madness of war,' he said.

FT  19 APR 94 / Kidder fires senior trader over Dollars 350m fake profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, has fired its chief government bond
trader - a man who was paid Dollars 9m (Pounds 6.1m) in salary and bonuses
in 1993 - for fabricating Dollars 350m in trading profits over the past
year.
It was still unclear yesterday whether Mr Joseph Jett had fabricated the
trades in an attempt to cover up losses incurred elsewhere, or whether the
scheme was designed primarily to boost his own pay packet, the size of which
is closely tied to the profits he generates as a trader.
Mr Jett, 36, had worked at Kidder for almost three years.
Six other employees were 'placed on special assignment' pending an
investigation into what Kidder said was a scheme to create phantom trades
and profits in the trading of government bond 'strips'. Strips are widely
traded financial instruments that represent the interest payments
accumulated over the life of a bond.
General Electric, Kidder's corporate parent, will today report an after-tax
charge of Dollars 210m against its first-quarter earnings to cover the
Dollars 350m in non-existent profits.
Kidder was quick to point out that none of its customers was affected by the
scheme, which will leave the firm nursing a first quarter loss of about
Dollars 140m.
The disclosures were greeted with astonishment on Wall Street, where the GE
share price was Dollars 1 1/2 lower at Dollars 95 1/4 in heavy trading.
Ms Helen Keehner, a Kidder official, said yesterday: 'We believe that this
was essentially an individual action by someone on his own who came up with
a very sophisticated scheme which our normal systems operations and audit
procedures would not have caught.'
According to sources close to the firm, the complex scheme involved Mr Jett
entering into millions of dollars of 'forward' contracts that would allow
him to convert the government strips he held back into regular bonds at a
later date. However, each time the forward contracts were due to be settled,
Mr Jett allegedly kept renewing them.
By doing so, he was apparently able to fool Kidder's computerised trading
system into thinking that he had made a profit on the unconsummated trades.
Kidder said the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock
Exchange had been informed of the affair and that it would be up to the
regulatory authorities to decide whether any criminal action should be taken
against Mr Jett.

FT  18 APR 94 / Takemura, role for ideals: The personalities sharing Japan's
search for a new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Policy has largely been neglected in the power struggle that has paralysed
Japanese politics. But policy differences are at the heart of the rift that
has threatened the fragile coalition government.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and leader of the New
Harbinger party, or Sakigake, is a central figure in the unfolding drama,
with his uncompromising rejection of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of the Japan
Renewal party and the figure behind many of the coalition's accomplishments.
Both Mr Takemura, a member of the left-leaning faction of the coalition, and
Mr Ozawa, a right-winger, broke away from the Liberal Democratic party last
year, but they have serious policy and personal differences.
On the surface, the crack has seemed to stem from personal enmity. Mr
Takemura's idealism and low-key style have been seen as the antithesis of
the cold pragmatism and abrasive manner of Mr Ozawa.
As chief cabinet secretary, Mr Takemura has been embarrassed by moves within
the coalition to undermine him which, it is widely believed, were initiated
by Mr Ozawa. The former prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, had been close
to Mr Takemura when the coalition was formed last year but appeared unable
or unwilling to protect him.
While Mr Takemura frequently stresses the importance of transparent
government, Mr Ozawa's forte is cutting deals in smoke-filled rooms. On
several occasions, Mr Takemura has criticised Mr Ozawa's tactics as opaque
and undemocratic.
Mr Takemura persistently refused to enter discussions last week after
indications that the coalition would be dominated by Mr Ozawa's JRP. This
personal dispute made it impossible to paper over differences the two have
in policy direction and highlighted the fragility of a coalition formed more
for political convenience than out of shared interests. The squabbling of
recent months is in contrast to expectations of more open government when
the coalition took office last year.
While Mr Ozawa favours a more active role in maintaining international
security, Mr Takemura believes Japan should stick to its pacifist
constitution.
Japan's contribution to world peace can be made through non-military means,
such as environmental protection, he writes in a recent book, 'A Small but
Sparkling Country, Japan'.
He spent a year in his youth at a Zen temple and urges Japanese to focus on
the quality of their lives rather than the quantity of goods in their lives:
'Even if Japan is an economic power, it should not become a country that is
called proud, shallow and greedy.'
But with Mr Takemura having staked his role in the coalition government on a
showdown with Mr Ozawa, it looks as though his idealistic views were no
match for Mr Ozawa's manoeuvrings.
As other members of the coalition look increasingly keen to discard ideology
in their quest to remain in power, Mr Takemura and his fellow Sakigake
politicians have been left on their own.

FT  18 APR 94 / Ozawa, the shogun confined to shadows: The personalities
sharing Japan's search for a new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ichiro Ozawa could not be called one of Japan's more folksy politicians.
But on a morning variety show, Mr Ozawa tried to reach out to an audience of
middle-aged housewives, revealing that he loves showbiz gossip, takes care
of budgies in his spare time and, although like any husband he has lied to
his wife a few times, as a politician he has always told the truth.
His congenial manner and wide smiles, however, have failed to convince
residents of Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district, who have been watching
Mr Ozawa and his backroom manoeuvrings over the creation of the next
government. To them he is no ordinary Japanese husband, but the shadow
shogun - the backroom fixer of Japanese politics.
Immediately following Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation as premier, the
coalition looked likely to split along its two ideological lines: the right,
including Mr Ozawa's Japan Renewal party, and the Buddhist-backed Komeito,
or Clean Government, party; and the left, consisting of the New Harbinger
party, Socialist Democratic party and the Democratic Socialists.
Mr Ozawa had initially considered cutting off the coalition's left, and
filling the gap by teaming up with Mr Michio Watanabe, a Liberal Democratic
party elder and a former foreign minister. Mr Watanabe is close to Mr Ozawa
in his beliefs, asserting that Japan should take on a more active role in
international affairs.
However, the situation has boiled down to a battle for numbers. Once it
become apparent that Mr Watanabe could not bring enough followers from the
LDP, and Mr Masayoshi Takemura of the NHP was trying to join the coalition's
left with LDP liberals, Mr Ozawa quickly changed his course.
Although a self-proclaimed reformer of Japanese politics, Mr Ozawa has had
to resort to tactics nurtured under Mr Kakuei Tanaka, Mr Noboru Takeshita,
and Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former powerbrokers of the LDP. 'Mr Ozawa knows
too well that political power only lies in numbers,' says Mr Takao
Toshikawa, editor of Tokyo Insideline.
But during the TV appearance in front of housewives, Mr Ozawa denied wanting
to become prime minister. As much as he would like to stand at the helm, Mr
Ozawa realises he must remain the shadow shogun. He knows that, once he
steps into political limelight, his days of power and 'money' politics
alongside Mr Takeshita and Mr Kanemaru will come back to haunt him.

FT  18 APR 94 / Santa Fe to float gold subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Santa Fe Pacific, the US railroad and pipeline group, is to float its gold
subsidiary on the New York Stock Exchange on terms which value Santa Fe Gold
Corporation at between Dollars 1.76bn and Dollars 2.1bn.
The gold business includes some of the US assets Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate, acquired with Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK and swapped
last year for Santa Fe's coal and aggregate operations. That deal
transformed Santa Fe Gold into the sixth-largest North American gold
producer with an anticipated 1994 output of 900,000 troy ounces. It also has
one of the biggest gold reserves in North America, amounting to 14.1m
ounces.
Santa Fe Gold said at the weekend it would initially offer newly-created
shares to raise between Dollars 243m and Dollars 279m which will be used to
pay down debt of about Dollars 340m.
The parent group's holding will be diluted to 86.2 per cent as a result. It
has received notification from the US Revenue Service that it can distribute
the rest of Santa Fe Gold to shareholders tax free.
Analysts expect this to happen before the year-end, qualifying Santa Fe Gold
for inclusion in the new Financial Times Gold Mines Index.
A syndicate of underwriters led by Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and SG
Warburg will offer 12m Santa Fe Gold shares in the US while a further 6m
shares will be offered internationally by those three underwriters plus JP
Morgan, and Union Bank of Switzerland.
Shares will be priced between Dollars 13.50 and Dollars 15.50 each.
Santa Fe Gold has three mines in northern Nevada: Lone Tree, Mesquite and
Twin Creeks (a combination of Hanson's Chimney Creek and Santa Fe's Rabbit
Creek). It is one of the biggest holders of mineral rights in the western US
 -7.2m acres in some of the most prospective regions, inherited from its
parent.
Ms Lindsey Falconer, analyst at Ord Minnett, an affiliate of Jardine
Fleming, said the market expects the offering to be priced at the top end of
the indicated range. Santa Fe Gold was 'a top quality North American senior
producer and will be seen as a core holding in this group,' she suggested.
Mr Richard Zitting, chairman and chief executive of Santa Fe Gold, said:
'This step enables (the company) to access the gold equities market, an
important source of capital which is available to other major gold
companies.'
Santa Fe is the second big gold offering to international investors this
year; Ghana's Ashanti Goldfields is floated in London this week on terms
expected to value it at Dollars 1.67bn.

<DATELINE>
   LILONGWE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Serious anomalies in the run-up to Malawi's elections on May 17 are noted in
a report published today by a UN Joint International Observer Group,
reinforcing earlier findings of the national Electoral Commission.
Both bodies report intimidation, violence, bribery and theft or confiscation
of voters' registration cards. The ruling Malawi Congress party emerges as
the main culprit, but some opposition parties are also said to be engaged in
turf wars and violent disruption of opponents' rallies.
The UN report suggests that government ministers have used the civil service
apparatus for campaigning purposes, and note that one MP registered himself
and his family at two separate centres.
Concern is also expressed about police Inspector General MacWilliam
Lunguzi's assertion that policemen are not allowed to engage in politics,
and therefore may not vote. The UN observers see this as a contravention of
the electoral law and the Electoral Commission is threatening to prosecute
him.
The Electoral Commission estimates that 80 per cent of those eligible to
register have done so. This figure is described as 'respectable' by the UN
group, which does not consider the abuses it has found to be an insuperable
barrier to free elections.

FT  18 APR 94 / Cane opens up east-west divisions: A look at the
international row over a Singapore vandalism sentence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There may be some people in the US still unsure where Singapore is on the
map, but probably considerably fewer than six weeks ago.
In early March Michael Fay, an 18-year-old US citizen, was sentenced by a
Singapore court to six strokes of the rotan - a heavy bamboo cane - four
months in jail and fined SDollars 3,500 (Dollars 2,200) for spray-painting
cars and other vandalism offences.
The punishment is no schoolyard caning. It is administered by a specially
trained officer with considerable force. The prisoner is strapped to a
trestle. 'The skin at the point of contact is usually split open and, after
three strokes, the buttocks will be covered in blood,' said one official
account. The canings usually leave permanent scars. The Singapore
authorities say a doctor is always in attendance.
Next week Singapore's President Ong Teng Cheong is due to decide whether to
grant clemency to Fay. Despite personal appeals for mercy from President
Bill Clinton, most people in Singapore say the teenager has little chance of
clemency - before the end of the month he will be receiving his punishment.
Singapore's leaders, with support from many other Asian governments, are
mounting an increasingly strident campaign against what they consider to be
the decadence of the west and the importance of what they call Asian values.
In Singapore the Fay case - and the west's reaction to it - is seen as
symptomatic of the clash between two very different value systems.
From the outset Singapore has made its position clear. 'We do not have a
situation where acts of vandalism are commonplace as in cities like New
York, where even police cars are not spared the acts of vandals,' said the
Singapore Home Affairs Ministry.
In the Singapore catechism of Asian values, the west stands accused of
putting too much emphasis on individual rights and not enough on society's.
Elder statesman Mr Lee Kuan Yew has said that without its tough criminal
laws Singapore would have descended into the 'chaos' found on the streets of
the US.
'If you like it that way, that is your problem,' said Mr Lee. 'But that is
not the path we choose. They always talk about human rights. I think it is
just a convenient slogan.'
The White House, Congress and much of the US media have been strongly
critical of Singapore. But a large section of the US public, tired of
violence and a justice system which they feel often favours the culprit more
than the victim, is giving its support to Mr Lee.
Singapore has no hesitation about attacking the US. Foreign ministry
officials list what they consider to be the failures of US foreign policy,
and are particularly forthright about what they judge to be Washington's
mistakes on China.
Yet Singapore is dependent on the US for much of its continuing economic
growth. US companies are the biggest investors there, with cumulative
investments of nearly Dollars 19bn, according to official US figures. The US
is Singapore's biggest export market. The island republic is also an ardent
supporter of continued US military presence in Asia.
Initially US business in Singapore reacted strongly to the Fay sentence. The
local American Chamber of Commerce said it could not understand how the
government could condone the permanent scarring of any 18-year-old; the case
could 'cast a cloud over Singapore's international reputation'.
But some US residents of Singapore have supported the caning, while US
multinationals continue to invest.
Fay's family - his stepfather is the Singapore-based regional executive of
Federal Express - and his defenders in the US have argued that because of
all the publicity surrounding the case, the teenager has not been treated
fairly. They say he is the first person to be sentenced for caning for
vandalism of private property. He is also the first youth to be given a
caning for damaging cars. The authorities say the law makes no distinction
between public and private property.
Singapore's leaders are adamant that it will allow no outside interference
in its internal affairs. Nor do they show any sign of altering a system of
punishment which has been done away with in many parts of the world.

FT  18 APR 94 / Bangladesh to be urged to spend more pledged aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bangladesh is this week expected to secure about Dollars 2.1bn in pledges of
foreign aid from its donors at its annual aid consortium meeting in Paris.
The funds, in loans and grants for the year starting in July 1994, will help
pay for food and the development of infrastructure and social services in
Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries. The promised funds will be
about the same as in the past two years.
However, officials from donor governments and organisations led by the World
Bank are likely to press Bangladesh to use more of the aid it is pledged.
The Bangladeshi government has consistently failed to absorb all the
promised aid and has allowed a backlog of some Dollars 5.5bn in unspent
pledges to accumulate.
Aid dispersement has been held up mainly because government officials have
been unable to implement rapidly the construction and other projects to
which much aid is dedicated. Despite efforts to accelerate public
investment, there will be little progress in this regard in 1993-94. The
government's annual development programme budget has already been cut from
Tk97.5bn to Tk85bn (Dollars 2.16bn) because of delays.
Mrs Khaleda Zia, the prime minister, said in an interview that she was
trying to accelerate public investment. 'Steps are under way to remove
procedural bottlenecks and speed up both public investment and aid
utilisation.'
The World Bank sees the lack of public investment as a drag on economic
growth. In the year to the end of June 1994, bank officials expect to see
GDP growth to be a modest 5 per cent or less. The country is unlikely to
improve rapidly the lot of its poor unless it achieves growth of 6-7 per
cent, say bank officials.
This growth rate can be reached, they add, only if investment rises from
last year's level of 13 per cent of economic output to 18-20 per cent.
Government officials accept this argument and are trying to raise the ratio
to 14.5 per cent this year and 15.5 per cent in 1994-95 by increasing public
investment. The public works programme should get a boost from the start of
construction on a Dollars 700m bridge across the Jamuna river in central
Bangladesh - the country's largest investment scheme.
To stimulate private investment, the government is extending the
liberalisation of foreign trade and investment it has carried out since
taking power in 1990. Last year the taka was made fully convertible on the
current account. Exports, led by garments, are forecast to grow by nearly 20
per cent this year and next, extending recent rapid rises.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (18): Long-life engines
keep the costs down - Alan Bunting studies trends in truck making
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN BUNTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many of Britain's road transport operators, fleet renewal is being
considered for the first time this decade. Vehicle replacement programmes
which were effectively frozen in 1990-91 as the recession took hold, are now
being reinstated.
Trucks bought in 1986/7, which in normal times would have been traded in two
or three years ago, are only now being replaced. Some of the long-haul
38-tonners among them have 800,000 kilometres (500,000 miles) of fleet
service behind them.
Received wisdom has repair and overhaul costs of heavy chassis rising
unacceptably beyond about 500,000km. But the recession's enforced stretching
of service life by 60 per cent or more has brought some pleasant surprises.
Fleet engineers have become aware of the remarkable improvements in
durability, as well as in day-to-day reliability, achieved by commercial
vehicle and component manufacturers.
Thanks to new, often computer-aided, technology, vital components are giving
less trouble and lasting longer, while proving at the same time more
efficient. Heavy-duty diesel engines built by companies such as Volvo,
Cummins and Mercedes bear witness to a progressively greater understanding
of why engines wear and fail and how to slow down ageing.
Remarkably, those demonstrable improvements in life and quality have been
achieved by engine makers who, at the same time, have had to meet the
technical challenges of ever tougher legal exhaust emission limits. The
regulations now effectively limit consumption of lubricating oil, which if
allowed to get past the pistons or valves into the combustion chamber is
burned, adding to particulate (soot) emissions.
DAF, Mercedes, Cummins, Volvo, MAN and Scania are now offering engines which
meet so-called Euro 2 emission laws some 2 1/2 years ahead of the October
1996 deadline. By so doing they score environmental 'Brownie points', though
there are more commercial motives at work. In Holland and Germany financial
inducements encourage the purchase of Euro 2 compliant trucks ahead of time.
Some of these 'cleaner' trucks are being offered in the UK, but the price
premium, of Pounds 1,500-plus, is expected to deter all but the most
public-spirited or image-conscious buyers.
For the truck industry's diesel engineers, the competitive challenge is not
so much to reduce pollutant emissions to regulated levels, but to do so with
the least possible effect on fuel economy and performance.
Volvo's new-generation FH12 chassis, introduced last year, powered by the
first European-designed engine with full electronic injection control, is
already showing its meanness on fuel against key rivals. The latest
technically-similar Cummins Celect engines, built in Scotland and fitted in
ERF, Foden and now DAF chassis, are also proving to be significantly more
economical than their non-electronic predecessors.
Evidence of new technology is apparent in other benefits for fleet operators
 -and their drivers. For example, gearshift systems have in the past five
years become a more critical area of competition between truck
manufacturers. In the 1980s, the choice was straightforward: between
American-style constant mesh, which called for driver skill, and continental
syncromesh which demanded strength from the driver's arm.
But transmission development has moved on apace, with gear changing made
easier in skill and strength senses by the proliferation of compressed
air-assisted but electronically-controlled shifting. Life is made easier for
the driver, and the electronics block the kind of potentially
gearbox-wrecking changes caused by inexperience or carelessness.
All the systems seen so far feature conveniently-placed finger-tip switches,
replacing manual 'brute force' gear levers.
But from the driver's standpoint, the Eaton, Mercedes, Scania and Volvo
systems' shifting techniques vary considerably. If you can handle one, it
will not help you to cope with the others. A degree of training - or at
least familiarisation - is needed to be sure of fast, smooth shifting, both
up and down through the box, in different road and traffic conditions.
Transfleet, the Lex Group truck rental company, has recently commissioned a
batch of new 38-tonne trucks equipped with Eaton's SAMT (semi-automated
mechanical transmission) for its London-based spot hire operation. A finger
switch on the steering column effects gear changes and clutch release and
re-engagement is automatic other than for starting away and stopping.
Even in the hands of drivers who, by definition in a rental operation are an
unknown quantity, premature gearbox and/or clutch failures have largely been
eliminated. The timing of shifts remains in the driver's hands, so he can
practise traditional anticipation in the light of changes in gradient or
traffic conditions ahead.
As a result, fuel consumption is not adversely affected, as it tends to be
with fully-automatic transmissions, either of the familiar torque
converter-based type or more recent derivatives of manual boxes.
Though their numbers are declining, many truck buyers in Britain reflect the
still prevalent attitude among their North American counterparts, of deep
suspicion about new technology in general and electronics in particular.
They equate technical simplicity in a truck with reliability and are
reluctant to specify 'new fangled' equipment until it has proved
trouble-free - in someone else's hands - for some years.
They nevertheless welcome less newsworthy but evolutionary change in vehicle
specifications. Better corrosion resistance in cabs is an example. New tough
plastics are now widely employed instead of steel for bumpers, wing valances
and other non-structural parts, with Mercedes and Fiat's Iveco truck
division leading the way. Elsewhere, galvanised steel is now widely used for
load-bearing cab panels exposed to moisture and salt spray.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (17): Biggest is not
always best - Test Drive Review of the 1994 offerings for Fleet Purchasers /
Stuart Marshall finds little to choose between the best new medium size
models and says they are challenging big executive cars for heavy business
use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Look at the models now available and a message comes through loud and clear
 -the business driver looking for comfortable, reliable and mile-eating
personal transport no longer needs a big executive car.
Having driven all of the latest crop of medium-sized cars on offer to fleet
buyers or user-choosers, I reckon they are the equal of vehicles the next
size up in everything but bulk.
Prominent among these comprehensively equipped and moderately priced cars
are the Audi 80, BMW 3-Series, Citroen Xantia, Ford Mondeo, Honda Accord,
Mazda 626 and Xedos 6, Mercedes-Benz C-180, Mitsubishi Galant, Nissan
Primera, Peugeot 405, Renault Laguna, Rover 600, Saab 900, Toyota Carina E,
Vauxhall Cavalier, Volkswagen Passat and Volvo 850 SE 2.0.
And which are the pick of this very extensive list? That's hard to say
because, by any sensible standard, they are all very good cars indeed.
The BMW 3-Series and Mercedes-Benz C-180 are the only ones conforming with
what was once the classic concept of in-line engine and rear-wheel drive.
All but one of the others have front-wheel drive and transversely mounted
four-cylinder engines. The sole exception is the five-cylinder Volvo.
In the Audi 80, Ford Mondeo, Renault Laguna, Saab 900, Vauxhall Cavalier and
VW Passat, there is a V6 option for those who feel happy with a medium-sized
car only if it has a multi-cylinder engine of at least 2.5-litres capacity.
Comparisons really come down to a matter of personal whim.
For example, any of the cars will amble along at speeds far in excess of the
British motorway speed limit of 70mph (112 kmh), which the Department of
Transport admits is broken by 56 per cent of drivers.
At 100mph (161 kmh) they still have power in hand - although increasingly
tough police action against speeding makes this an academic matter.
All are power-steered as standard. Most have ABS brakes, driver and, in some
cases, front passenger airbags and doors reinforced against side intrusion.
Automatic transmission is universally offered as an option. Air-conditioning
is part of the package with some upmarket versions of these cars, such as
the Renault Laguna, and can be had as an extra on any of them.
Only the Saab 900 and Volvo 850 are exclusively petrol-engined. For my
taste, the car with the best ride, and which at its price is the best
turbo-diesel, is the Citroen Xantia. I also rate its spaciousness for rear
passengers highly.
The Rover 600 has a more distinguished interior than its cheaper mechanical
clone, the Honda Accord. Mondeo is Ford's best car for years  - the least
expensive 1.6-litre is more refined than the 2.0-litre and I find the estate
car body more attractive than the saloon or hatchback.
Though built on a Vauxhall (Opel) Calibra platform, the new 900 is a
genuine, dyed-in-the-wool Saab. The Renault Laguna, newly arrived in
Britain, feels like a scaled-down Safrane.
Some of the C-Class Mercedes-Benz interiors are not to my taste but in every
other way the new car is an improvement on that benchmark among compact
business cars - the former 190E. Its ultra-smooth, four valves per cylinder
diesel versions are stayers, not sprinters.
For sheer get-up-and-go, the BMW 325TDs is unrivalled among diesels but it
sells for Pounds 6,000 more than the most upmarket Xantia VSX. Among larger
business cars, the latest, more firmly sprung Jaguars seem to have gained in
agility while being as refined as ever.
Equally appealing are the 3.0-litre and 4.0-litre V8-engined BMW 530 and
540. So, for that matter, are the sepulchrally silent Mazda Xedos 9 and the
sportier Toyota Lexus GS300.
The Ford Granada/Scorpio and Rover 800 are beginning to show their age but
the top models in particular are still agreeable to drive. The new Vauxhall
(Opel) Omega replacements for the Vauxhall Carlton and Senator go well
enough to win business away from Granada/Scorpio.
Whether these excellent new cars will be able to seduce status-conscious
user-choosers out of their BMW 5-Series and Mercedes E-Class remains to be
seen.
At the bottom of the market the small-is-beautiful, or
smaller-is-acceptable, rule can also be applied.
Ford's latest Fiestas are vastly improved and now have optional ABS brakes
and power-steering.
The even more compact Peugeot 106 range, with much admired refinement and
handling, is soon to be expanded by the 1.6-litre engined, power-steered
luxury Gentry and sporty XSi versions.
I rate the Escort/Astra sized Peugeot 306 and mechanically similar Citroen
ZX highly. And Fiat's new Punto is good enough to set a cat among the
pigeons in the sub-Ford Escort size class.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (16): Third party
benefits - M&amp;S has switched to outsourcing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Dennis, compensation manager for Marks &amp; Spencer, has explained why
one of Britain's leading retail groups decided to make changes in the way it
handled its fleet of 1,200 company vehicles.
'The company car is an extremely important benefit. But it is more than just
the provision of wheels.
'It is the total service that matters, the removal of hassle over such
things as maintenance, replacement and so on.' By moving to out-sourcing, he
says, 'we've taken a big step forward to enhance this benefit'.
Out-sourcing is the latest buzzword in the vehicle fleet management
business. This is when a company delegates all its fleet management to a
specialist third-party, eliminating the need for dedicated in-house support
personnel.
'Put quite simply, it is one nominated contract hire supplier managing all
the other suppliers to that customer. So all invoices for monthly rentals,
excess mileages, or whatever, are controlled by the nominated supplier, who
then provides the client with one consolidated invoice for auditing,'
explains Mr Neil Pykett, managing director of Cowie Interleasing, the UK's
biggest vehicle contract hire company. Cowie have the Marks &amp; Spencer
out-sourcing contract.
He said: 'We replace the client's software with our own and his people with
our people. Although based at our head office, they answer the phone in the
client's name. The benefits are that the client has only one set of invoices
to auditand we free his own staff to concentrate on other, perhaps more
important, core activities.'
Mr Dennis said there were two main reasons why M&amp;S moved to out-sourcing: to
reduce the administrative burden, of course, and to shorten the
communication lines between the company car driver and the people providing
the day-to-day service.
No longer does the driver have to contact the M&amp;S fleet department and then
wait while it contacts the car supplier. 'With the new arrangements, the
driver rings Cowie and gets an instant answer in most cases.' M&amp;S was
already running its company car fleet 'ridiculously efficiently,' according
to Mr Dennis. It had a fleet manager with one assistant. Staffing remained
the same after the change to out-sourcing, but the fleet manager had other
jobs to do, such as looking after group travel arrangements.
There are four women at Cowie devoting their entire working time to handling
the M&amp;S fleet. Previously M&amp;S had its cars on four-year contract hire from
three suppliers, including Cowie.
The other two companies are still responsible for maintaining their vehicles
but liaise with Cowie. Mr Dennis says that M&amp;S will continue with a second
company car supplier - Kenning Leaseline - which will have about 15 per cent
of the total business 'to maintain a competitive element and to provide us
with market intelligence.'
Out-sourcing is not suitable for every company, according to Mr Colin
Grant-Wilson, managing director of Lease Plan UK. He told a recent meeting
of the Institute of Directors that there had to be 'an out-sourcing culture'
within the company moving to this style of management. 'It is risky to go
into out-sourcing for the first time with the company car. The skills
required are different.'
Companies thinking of out-sourcing their fleets had to make careful
preparations, insisted Mr Grant-Wilson. 'It has to be got right from the
start. You have to ensure that you have identified all the elements and have
negotiated with a supplier exactly what you expect from him.'
According to the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA), the
most recent survey of its members' fleets showed that the 'notable trend
towards the concept of out-sourcing' has helped contract hire and contract
purchase increase their shares of the available market. This is because
these two methods of company car acquisition incorporate a high degree of
fleet management support.
Contract hire involves a rental agreement at a fixed price and for a fixed
term which is not usually less than two years. The supplier, or lessor,
retains ownership of the vehicle and takes all the risks, including resale.
The vehicle's user, or lessee, is buying a service, and therefore does not
show the vehicles on its balance sheet. The contract may or may not require
the lessor to provide maintenance or other support services.
The disadvantages of contract hire include inflexibility, higher cost to
compensate the lessor for the finance provided, excess mileage charges for
exceeding contractual mileages and early termination policies which can be
restrictive and costly.
BVRLA says that, as contract hire is longer-established than contract
purchase, it has been experiencing slower growth. Contract purchase,
however, showed a 35.2 per cent growth among BVRLA members in 1993,
'testament to its greater acceptance among vehicle users, increased
awareness of its benefits, an enhanced confidence in its legal foundation
and the higher number of fleet cars costing more than Pounds 12,000 for
which contract purchase is a more tax-efficient means of acquisition.'
Contract purchase involves the provision of vehicles under a funding
arrangement that is not a lease, but an agreement to purchase whereby the
vehicle supplier agrees to buy back the fleet at the end of a fixed period
for a pre-determined sum.
The risks of ownership are therefore transferred to the supplier, although
the fleet must be shown on the user's balance sheet. The supplier may also
provide maintenance and other support services with the vehicles.
BVRLA's research showed that the the rise in contract purchase's popularity
caused a drop in the use of finance leasing and fleet management.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (15): More powerful than
money - Lessors rely on the lure of the company car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DERRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like everything else involved in the business car market, contract hire and
leasing specialists can only wait and see how the company car will be
affected by the tax changes which took effect this month.
Scare stories have been circulating in recent months suggesting that
thousands - if not tens of thousands - of company car drivers would turn in
their keys and demand a cash alternative when they found how much extra tax
they would be paying from April 6.
But it appears that the cash versus car debate was a bogus one, fuelled by
accountants keen to sell reports and services at inflated prices. While some
companies may consider offering employees an alternative to the company car,
the vast majority have not been unmoved. They reason that if they increase
salaries to a level which allows the employee to buy and run the same car as
he previously enjoyed as a company driver, the cost to the business will be
prohibitive.
Despite tax changes - including increases in certain instances - the company
car remains a tax-efficient means of remuneration for all except the small
percentage of perk drivers doing fewer than 2,500 miles a year and enjoying
the benefit of an expensive company car.
Mr. Gary Spellins, sales and marketing director at Lex Vehicle Leasing, the
UK's contract hire market leader, with a fleet of 56,000 vehicles, says that
the new tax regime will encourage more employees to concentrate on the
capital cost of the car in future, but the effects, if any, 'will not be
seen for another couple of years. Companies cannot change or take back all
their business cars overnight, so if there are to be changes in the sort of
cars that employees choose, we'll see this when the normal time comes to
replace current vehicles.'
The changes he expects are that a proportion of drivers will turn to smaller
and cheaper cars in order to reduce their own tax burden. He does not expect
the contract hire and leasing market to contract. 'The market is broadly
very stable,' he says. 'All we have seen in the last couple of years is a
slow down in the frequency of changes of cars - but the number of vehicles
on lease or contract hire has remained a very steady 30 per cent of the
total company car market.'
That market last year was 740,000 new cars delivered to fleets and this year
he expects a modest increase to possibly 760,000.
But although the market size seems to be constant, the range and kind of
services demanded of contract hire and leasing companies is changing.
According to Geoff Cobley, managing director of Fleet Marketing Services,
while most enquiries in the first quarter of this year were for contract
hire, there is also strong interest in personal lease schemes, fleet
management/maintenance, and insurance claims management.
Contract hire is back at the top of the inquiry tree, he says, because
companies which held on to cars through the recession are now more confident
and are ordering new cars.
As far as personal leasing goes, in the last six months FMS executives say
they have spoken to 160 big fleet operators about this scheme in face to
face interviews. Geoff Cobley sees it as potentially a big force in future
contract hire business, but others are less certain that the market is truly
ready for private leasing.
'We have developed a private leasing product but we won't launch it until
there is primary demand in the market and it's not there yet,' says Mr
Spellins.
'At the moment, considerable interest is being expressed in outsourcing, a
system whereby the contract hire company takes over virtually all the
running of the fleet on behalf of the company. Not all our customers,
however, want this. Our job is to deliver what the customers want in the way
in which they want it delivered.'
Contract hire and leasing companies are finding they need to provide ever
higher levels of service while at the same time keeping costs to a minimum -
because price competition is rife.
The consequences of over-ambitious price competition - usually achieved by
gambling on re-sale values three years down the line - can be seen from time
to time in the collapse or take-over of a contract hire company - including
a number of well-publicised examples.
But, says Mr Terry Nunn, chairman of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing
Association (BVRLA), there is no sign of any dramatic changes in the market.
'Though there must be one or two companies in difficulties acquisitions and
mergers are running at normal levels. This is a very mature market and for
the most part its players are mature businesses. And they are currently
enjoying a definite pick-up in the market,' he says.
Lex's view is similar. As the biggest player, it enjoys economies of scale
and it can also afford to invest in the most sophisticated systems and
technology - for example, 60 per cent of all the vehicles it acquires are
bought on-line and the company also has on-line links with all its big fleet
customers.
But, says Mr Spellins, despite these many advantages over smaller companies
there is little prospect of Lex or Cowie Interleasing - the only other
contract hire company of Lex's size - enjoying anything like a monopoly.
'Well-managed companies will continue to increase their market share but not
by much, because our customers seem to believe contract hire is a commodity
product and so often individual contract decisions come down simply to
price. Some companies are finding that sourcing their whole fleet through
one contract hire company has significant cost savings in terms of the
internal economies that can be made through dealing with a single source,
but with over 500 contract hire companies in the market - and the fact that
it is very easy to start up a new business in this sector - price
competition is here to stay.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (14): Now most
manufacturers are at it - At 25 per cent of UK sales, diesels may have
reached saturation point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Demand for diesel passenger cars in the UK has been rising continually since
1990. The helter-skelter ride may now be slowing, but it has irreversibly
changed the shape of the country's car market.
A decade ago, when diesels were bought by eccentric afficionados compelled
to count every penny, they barely rose above l per cent of the UK market.
Now they account for a quarter of all new cars sold.
That, though, is roughly where they will remain, according to market leader
Ford. 'The potential is there for a little more, but to some extent it will
be restricted by availability,' says Ford.
The dramatic overall trend in favour of diesels is accurately mirrored in
fleet sales - those classified by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders as over 25 units. Both fleet and retail diesel sales were up by
around 70 per cent in the opening two months of this year, compared with a
total market gain of just under 18 per cent.
Indeed, the early movement to diesel was largely led by fleets, whose
hard-nosed managers were under pressure to cut costs. 'We used to make a
saving of Pounds 1,000 per car per year,' reports one fleet manager
responsible for 1,100 cars. 'It's not as much as that now, because residuals
(trade jargon for re-sale values) are not as good, but we still make a
saving of Pounds 400 on each car on fuel alone.'
In round terms, a diesel engine is 25 to 30 per cent more economical than an
equivalent petrol-engined model. Diesels tend to be more reliable and
long-lived too, according to Hertz Leasing.
As a result, resale values are higher, though the sheer numbers coming on to
the used car market as a result of the boom have softened prices. Supply and
demand probably means the end of really high resale values for diesels,
though few expect the advantage to be eroded completely.
But the UK spurt was not entirely driven by costs. Other important factors
spurred the growth. The latest crop of high speed car diesel engines is very
much more refined. They are quiet, smooth and powerful compared with older
technology diesels. Citroen has a turbo diesel ZX which it would pit against
any hot hatchback with petrol power.
Increasing the sophistication of engines was accompanied by a trend to make
the cars in which they are installed much more appealing to customers. The
days are long gone when diesel power was used only in no-frills economy
models like taxis. Trim and equipment levels on offer today are similar to
those of petrol cars. Now, for example, there are top level Ford Mondeo
Ghias and Range Rover Vogues with turbo diesel power.
At the same time, diesel models no longer carry such large price premiums
over petrol, although Audi's advanced direct injection turbo diesel is
considerably more than its petrol equivalent. The moves by Citroen and Ford
are much more representative. Those companies have opted for price parity
between diesel and petrol for their Xantia and Mondeo models.
These developments so broadened the appeal of diesels that they have
resulted in enormous changes to the UK car market.
While overall new car demand plunged from the 2.3m peak in 1989 to 1.59m in
1992, diesel sales grew in each of those three years by an average of about
19 per cent. When total demand picked up last year by 9 per cent, diesel
sales shot ahead by almost 70 per cent. More diesels were sold last year
than in the previous two years combined.
Even so, car makers were somewhat surprised by the strength of the
development in the UK, where, unlike in many European countries, there is
little difference between the pump prices of diesel and unleaded petrol.
But with UK diesel demand solid, and Europe's faltering sales recovery under
way, car companies are going to need all the diesel engines they can
manufacture in order to hold on to market share. Companies without a strong
diesel line-up are bound to lose out.
That is why Ford is investing Pounds 90m at its Dagenham factory to lift
output of its latest 1.8-litre turbo diesel from the present capacity of
1,350 a day to 1,650. The unit, introduced in the second half of last year,
is crucial to Ford.
Fitted to Mondeo and Escort, it has taken the company from fourth in the
diesel car pecking order to No. l.
General Motors, Vauxhall's parent company, is putting Pounds 200m into a new
diesel unit at its manufacturing complex at Kaiserslautern, Germany. It will
start production late next year, and be capable of producing 250,600 units a
year.
Meanwhile, GM is buying diesel engines for its European cars from its
Japanese affiliate, Isuzu. In addition, it has just started sourcing larger
diesels from BMW for the new Vauxhall Omega which goes on sale this month.
Not that the diesel phenomenon is restricted to the large volume
manufacturers. Even leading prestige car makers, whose wealthy customers are
less influenced by the economics of diesels, are reporting good demand.
One in every eight new Mercedes-Benz sold in the UK last year was a diesel.
Practically one in five BMWs sold in the country so far this year is a
diesel.
The trend puts certain competitors at a disadvantage. Jaguar and Saab, for
example, have traditionally eschewed diesel power, and are thus unable to
take advantage of the present boom. But ignoring a quarter of the market
cannot be done over the long term.
Similarly, Japanese companies in the past have put little effort into car
diesel technology. Those policies were influenced by the absence of any
diesel customers in Japan and the US, where Japan does far more business.
But with Britain and the rest of Europe demanding diesels, that is having to
change.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (12): Not all customers
are honest - Rented and leased vehicles are increasingly likely to be stolen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY BOSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Such is the growing incidence of theft of cars in the UK that Avis staff are
now taking photographs of people who want to rent their vehicles.
'We're using this system at high risk locations', says Avis Operations
Director, Steve Maltby, 'and we'd rather not rent to those who won't have
their picture taken.'
Maltby is also chairman of the security committee of the British Vehicle
Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA) and is concerned at the numbers of
vehicles being stolen both in the leasing and daily rental sectors of the
market.
'It's costing our members Pounds 125.5m a year', he says, 'and when you
consider that 60 per cent of the light commercial vehicles which are stolen
are never recovered, and some 17 per cent of the cars are never seen again,
you can see the scale of the problem.'
Of the l2m cars run by BVRLA members, 3 per cent of the leasing cars and 3.5
per cent of the daily rental cars are stolen every year.
Interestingly, Avis carried out a simple test in its Northern Ireland
operation which significantly cut down on theft. Of its 400 fleet cars, some
21 were fitted with an expensive engine immobiliser, while the others were
supplied with a dl6 steering wheel lock. Some of Maltby's colleagues scoffed
at the garishly coloured lock, but his action was soon vindicated.
'Within two weeks, seven of the cars fitted with engine immobilisers had
been broken into, but those cars fitted with the steering wheel lock were
untouched.
'The point is, it's highly visible, so it's a deterrent to the petty thief,
and he's usually the one who breaks into cars. He sees the steering wheel
lock, he goes to the next car which isn't protected.'
And thereby hangs the next problem. Many in the leasing industry believe
that the car manufacturers and the government must do more to protect all
vehicles from the criminal.
The actual theft of vehicles seems to be slightly slowing down, says Howard
Thomas, operations director of Lease Plan, Europe's largest vehicle lease
company, though thefts from vehicles are still very evident. 'What annoys me
is that today the anti-theft technology is proven, and it's relatively
inexpensive, and yet some of the vehicle manufacturers are still not putting
enough standard anti-theft equipment into cars.' As an example, Thomas
points to the number of cars which are fitted with a simple perimetric
alarm.
'Some buyers haven't a clue what this really is', says Thomas, 'and many
come out of the showroom with the idea that it protects the car. But it only
protects the doors, and perhaps the bonnet and boot. It does not stop the
criminal smashing the window and reaching inside and taking whatever is in
the car. With this sort of cheap alarm system such a theft doesn't even
activate the alarm.'
Thomas adds that a car's image also attracts the thief. 'We get far more
break-ins of BMWs than we do of Ford Mondeos or Vauxhall Cavaliers, though
usually the theft is because there's a good in-car entertainment package
there. What we like to see is a sound system which is built into the car,
which forms part of the build of that car, so it cannot be taken out, and if
it is, then it's of no use.'
There had been important strides, for example the Vauxhall Astra where the
radio's display was not part of the unit itself, but some manufacturers were
still doing only half a job.
Take the new Renault Laguna. It had an easily stealable radio, which was not
built into the car. 'To us this is a distinct disadvantage.' Thomas points
to other cars where there are similar problems.
'The Citroen Xantia has engine immobilisation, which we see as a very
important feature, but you cannot get it on the diesel models, the best
sellers in the Xantia range.'
This is a view echoed by others in the industry. As Steve Maltby points out,
'the car manufacturers are generally doing more, responding to pressure from
government as much as anybody else, but one of the sad things is that while
they are increasingly putting security of all types in their most up-market
models, there are generally less anti-theft measures across their ranges.
Whether somebody is paying Pounds 6,000 or Pounds 60,000 for a car he should
be entitled to a decent level of security. Car manufacturers who are not
supplying anti-theft across their ranges are not supplying a proper service
to the customer.'
Ford, now considered by many in the industry to be at the cutting edge of
anti-theft technology, disagrees.
'We have alarms on all of our models as standard, with the exception of the
four-wheel drive Maverick', says Ford's Don Hume, 'and all of our Fiestas
and Escorts now come, as standard, with the transponder key, each of which
has a one in 10 trillion start code programmed into it. Without the right
key it's not possible to start the engine.'
But Ford also still fits perimetric alarms to many cars, rather than a full
ultrasonic system. That said, Ford is testing a tracking device which can
tell a control room where a specific car is at any time.
A similar device is used by Swindon-based Datatrak who can track stolen
vehicles, directing the police to them, wherever they are. This system has
proved especially useful to safeguard valuable freight.
There are other advanced systems being tested by police forces throughout
the country. One of the most interesting is a device which couples a
transmitter in the hire car with a receiver fitted into police cars.
Should the car be stolen, the police could not only track it, but once they
got close enough they could activate the receiver to slow down the stolen
car, stopping it safely, and then presumably arresting the thief. If
on-going tests are successful and the system gets Home Office approval it
could be fitted as standard on some expensive cars next year.
In tandem with their own tracking device, Ford is also continuing to
experiment with satellite tracking. This system would ensure that at any
given time the car could be pinpointed - within seconds - wherever it is in
the world.
Clearly anti-theft technology will continue to improve, but caution is
required with some of these devices. Three years ago a British company
developed a system which locked the thief in the car. That is not always a
good idea.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (13): Time for a breather
 -Insurance rates have peaked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buyers of motor fleet insurance have faced significant increases in their
costs in the last three years.
In response to heavy theft and accident losses on motor fleet business and
after suffering their worst overall losses in the history, in 1991 and 1992
the UK's biggest insurance companies increased rates sharply and reduced
their exposure to motor fleet insurance.
However, there have been signs recently that rates are beginning to fall as
competition returns to the market.
'Rates are holding at present levels or if anything getting cheaper,' says
Mr David Ney, executive director of Willis Corroon Risk Management, the risk
management arm of the the insurance broker.
Royal Insurance, one of the country's largest composite insurer, which
imposed rate rises of 24 per cent in 1992 and 15 per cent in 1993, said its
rates remained flat at the beginning of this year.
And at Lloyd's, underwriters say rates are dropping. 'There are definitely
lower rates around. The prices at which business is being underwritten is
tending to fall,' says Mr Martin Gibbins, underwriter for Wessex Motor
Policies at Lloyd's, part of the Wellington Group.
Mr Gibbins cautions, however, that the picture is uneven and that on average
his group renewed most policies at the beginning of this year with small
increases.
Although there has been some reduction in theft claims, partially reflecting
the introduction of security devices by many fleet managers, drivers of
company cars are still more likely to have an accident than drivers who use
their own cars.
Mr Ney says that accident frequency rates of 60 per cent, in which six
drivers out of every 10 insured have an accident, are typical for motor
fleets, compared with 20 to 25 per cent for private motorists.
Mr Ney cites some examples of accident frequency rates of more than 100 per
cent.
So why is fleet insurance becoming cheaper? One reason is that a number of
new insurers are chasing business.
Mr Gibbins says that up to a dozen Lloyd's syndicates are now 'dabbling' in
motor fleet business, compared with five or six syndicates underwriting the
business last year.
In addition, a number of companies who treated motor fleet business with
'disdain' a year ago are now rediscovering their appetite for the class.
Mr Ney suggests that rate competition in the personal motor market, which
has been fired by the growth of direct telephone-based companies such as
Direct Line, Churchill and The Insurance Service, is now 'bleeding through
to the fleet market'.
The implication here is that companies who are losing significant portions
of the personal market to their more technologically advanced competitors
are compensating by bidding competitively to win motor fleet business.
General Accident, the Perth-based composite, scaled back its involvement in
the market for larger fleets last march. Mr Nigel Lister, the company's
assistant general manager (UK), says he believes competition is now
returning to the market, making the class less viable than it was a year ago
and confirming his company's pessimistic assessment of the class. GA is
concentrating its efforts on becoming a market leader for mini or small
fleets of up to 25 vehicles.
GA carried out a detailed study of the market over the past 17 years and
came to the conclusion 'that at the end of the day there is nothing anybody
will be able to do unless the whole market says it cannot write risks at
these rates,' explains Mr Lister.
Mr Lister says that GA's operating ratios (claims plus expenses as a
percentage of premiums) were among the best in the market, indicating that
marketwide losses in the class are inevitable. 'There are always a few
companies who think they have got it right. The whole thing shifts gears,
moves sideways and just trundles along in the same old way,' he says.
'It is the same old merry go round. I'm absolutely convinced that nobody is
going to make money on large fleets.'
Mr Lister says that one of the main difficulties faced by motor fleet
underwriters is the long tail of liability claims, a problem which has
become more acute since most bigger fleets usually limit their insurance to
third party coverage.
Companies says Mr Lister is assessing its premium rates on the basis of a
claims history stretching back only three years. Yet many of the heaviest
claims can take up to five years to crystallise.
The implications of this rate competition could undermine efforts by
insurers to make fleet managers more safety and security concious.
Mr Gibbins says that even in current market conditions there is still scope
to press policyholders to introduce alarms, immobilisers and transponders to
their vehicles. Transponders, small electronic tag devices embedded in the
body of cars and lorries, allow the police to track the whereabouts of
stolen vehicles.
However Mr Lister and Mr Ney are less optimistic. Mr Ney says: 'Forward
thinking companies are always going to embrace risk management but for many
the motivation to improve risk is financially driven. If premium costs fall,
it makes the benefits of driver testing less attractive.'
General Accident introduced an arrangement which offered discounts for fleet
managers who sent their drivers on approved training courses, but Mr Lister
says that take-up was limited.
'In a surprising number of cases we just got a blank look. People would say
'we just can't afford to have a driver off the road'.'
Many people were just not interested 'despite all the hype', added Mr
Lister. Those companies that practise risk management are 'shining beacons.
They are very conspicuous indeed.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (12): Shoppers spoilt for choice - An
oversupply of outlets is threatening retailers' profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singaporeans proudly proclaim the work ethic and the relentless quest for
economic self-improvement to be their bedrock national values. Yet the
casual stroller down Orchard Road, centre of Singapore's prime retailing
district, might conclude that what really makes the country tick is
shopping.
The teeming boulevard is a showcase of affluent consumerism crammed with
labyrinthine shopping complexes, designer boutiques and department stores
offering everything from Paris fashions to cameras and computers.
Towering above it all is the twin-towered Ngee Ann City, which opened last
autumn. A gleaming pink marble palace, it houses a massive 66,000 sq m of
retail space, more than half of it occupied by Takashimaya, a Japanese
up-market department store.
But first impressions are deceptive. Passionate as Singaporeans may be about
acquiring the good things of life, their capacity to spend is being
outstripped by the number of retailers stampeding to supply them.
While the country's total retail space, at about 7 sq ft per head, is low by
western standards, it is growing at breakneck speed. On current plans, it is
estimated that it will rise by more than 40 per cent between 1993 and 1996.
Takashimaya is only the latest and grandest foreign-owned outlet to open on
Orchard Road. It follows recent department store openings by other Japanese
chains, including Isetan, Sogo, Tokyu and Yaohan. Lavish stores are planned
by Seiyo, also of Japan, and Lane Crawford of Hong Kong.
This expansion coincides with two other ominous trends. One is that foreign
visitors, long an important source of custom, have trimmed back spending as
the country's appreciating currency has eliminated its former
bargain-basement appeal. Many retail prices today are at least as high as in
London.
Simultaneously, Orchard Road's long-standing pole position is threatened by
an accelerating shift in retail trade to the suburbs prompted by lower
rental costs and government moves to encourage more modern shopping
facilities closer to the public housing estates which ring the city.
The result has been a savage squeeze on retailers' margins. In the second
half of last year only one department store group, Robinson's, reported a
profit. With further new capacity still to hit the market, conditions seem
unlikely to improve soon. 'A big shake-out is on the way,' says Mr Alex
Hill, managing editor of Asian Retailer, a Singapore-based industry
publication. 'I would be very worried if I were a retailer just entering
this market. It will take years of losses to get established.'
Mr Hitoshi Hanehira, Takashimaya's local managing director, professes not to
be concerned. Though his store will take at least 10 years to return an
overall profit, he claims it has captured 25 per cent of total department
store sales, thanks to its wide range of goods and novel attractions such as
a health club, art gallery and exhibition centre.
However, he admits Takashimaya's success will be at the expense of other,
smaller retailers. 'Department stores of only 10,000 sq m will be unable to
compete,' he says. Indeed, Tokyu has already been forced to abandon its
original store for cheaper premises and a less luxurious format.
Several indigenous Singaporean retailing groups are responding by seeking to
expand in other parts of Asia, notably in China, although it is too early to
judge how well the tactic will succeed.
But there is also a brighter side to Singapore retailing. It lies in the
rapid growth of supermarkets, spurred by more sophisticated consumer tastes
and the steady contraction of the country's traditional covered food
markets, which are increasingly circumscribed by stricter hygiene rules.
The best supermarkets offer a wide range of branded products, attractively
displayed in modern surroundings. 'They are as good as any in the world,'
says Mr John Deuchars of Davids Holdings, an Australian distribution and
wholesaling company which recently set up in Singapore.
However, the supermarkets' development remains dogged by primitive and
costly distribution methods, which involve irregular deliveries of
individual products in small quantities by different suppliers.
'Singapore has the most inefficient distribution system of any country I
know,' says Mr Chris Nelson, head of Asian operations at Dairy Farm, the
Hong Kong-based retail group which recently acquired Singapore's Cold
Storage supermarket chain.
Davids aims to change all that. In partnership with NTUC Fairprice, the
country's biggest grocery chain, it plans to centralise distribution and
deliveries and replace paper work with electronic billing and ordering
systems. It reckons it can almost halve supermarkets' stock and save them 4
percentage points of gross margin.
Consumers should also benefit in time from keener prices. These have been
kept high by Singapore's long-standing tradition of exclusive agents, which
use their monopoly over the supply of many imports to cream off big profits.
Changing the system, a British colonial relic, may prove politically
controversial. But the Singapore government, which once fiercely defended
the interests of small merchants and shopkeepers, appears increasingly to
accept the case for modernising distribution.
Further impetus is likely to come from the growth of discounting. Yaohan of
Japan has already set up a vast American-style suburban merchandise mart,
which claims to undercut city-centre prices by 10-15 per cent, while Kmart
and other US discount chains are considering setting up local operations.
These developments all point to further rapid changes in Singaporean
retailing in the next few years. But while new growth opportunities are
likely to emerge, fiercer competition in all parts of the business is likely
to make fat margins and easy profits a thing of the past. But then, that is
increasingly the industry pattern in many other parts of the world.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (11): A means to an end - Education is
geared to expanding economic output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Listening to Mr Er Kwong Wah, the top civil servant at Singapore's education
ministry, is enough to turn his counterparts in many other parts of the
world green with envy.
His ministry's SDollars 3.2bn budget accounts for 4 per cent of gross
domestic product and a fifth of total government spending, second only to
defence. And, he makes clear, there is plenty more where that came from. 'We
have no problem getting money, providing we can show a case for it. If we
need a bigger share of GDP, I'm pretty confident the government will provide
it.'
As his comments imply, Singapore worships at the shrine of education.
Although schooling is not legally compulsory, in a country where the
attendance rate nudges 100 per cent, it scarcely needs to be. Almost two
thirds of school leavers go on to obtain a university or polytechnic degree,
one of the highest proportions in Asia.
However, this is a religion with a distinctly worldly purpose. It is
dedicated explicitly to nurturing the resources required for continued
expansion of national economic output.
Mr Er, asked about his philosophy of education, gives a reply which seems
more suited to a plant manager than to a pedagogue. His priorities, he says,
are set by the country's department of trade and industry: 'We have to
produce the products which fit into the department's system.'
The result is an education machine which is strongly biased at all levels in
favour of scientific, technical and business skills.
Computer training begins at the age of four and Mr Er's ministry is
investing SDollars 750m to equip every school with a computer room and
language laboratory. More than three quarters of all university students
major in engineering, science, business administration or accounting.
And education does not end with full-time schooling. Companies are required
by law to pay 2 per cent of turnover into a special fund, on which they may
draw to finance employee re-training. Teachers, whose pay is pegged to that
of civil service engineers, do an average of three weeks' in-service
training a year.
As a result, even the least talented school-leavers are equipped with a set
of basic skills, and the more able are highly numerate and technically
adept. Many companies operating in Singapore say this produces workforces
which are not only professionally well-qualified and dependable, but
extremely adaptable.
So much so that Apple Computer, for instance, is able to rely on temporary
staff to fill half the 2,000 jobs at its Singapore plant, adjusting the
numbers at short notice in line with demand. The company also moves
permanent employees between jobs every two to three years. Indeed, it says
it has to, to fulfil their career ambitions.
However, impressive as Singapore's education and training record is, it is
not flawless. The most frequent complaint from companies is a chronic
shortage of capable senior managers, ready to take risks, exercise
initiative and shoulder a broad range of responsibilities.
As a consequence, experienced local managers can virtually name their own
price. Mr Nobu Watanabe, who is in charge of Sony's operations in Singapore,
says higher-level salaries far exceed those at the company's UK operations,
which he previously headed.
Companies have responded to the challenge in different ways. Some, with
government approval, have imported managers from other countries. Others,
such as Motorola, say they have simply got by with much leaner management
teams than at home.
Sony, by contrast, has embarked on an ambitious 10-year programme to groom
its own local top management. However, Mr Watanabe says he fully expects
half of them to leave the company and he will treat the investment incurred
as a pro bono contribution to Singapore's economy.
The scarcity may simply reflect the fact that Singapore is still too young a
country to have produced many experienced home-grown managers. However, some
critics blame the education system's heavy emphasis on technical proficiency
and learning by rote.
'It is very rigorous,' says Mr Liew Mun Long, managing director of L&amp;M, a
leading construction group. 'Engineers in the US and Britain have a much
broader outlook. Even in business schools, the approach is very
textbook-based. If we want engineers to develop into managers in mid-career,
the system must open up a bit.'
That argument points to a larger, longer-term question, which is starting to
provoke a low-key debate. How conducive are the highly practical disciplines
instilled by Singapore's education system to genuine innovation and
creativity? Could the country ever aspire, for example, to produce a Nobel
prize winner?
Mr Philip Yeo, chairman of the Economic Development Board which manages
national industrial strategy, gives a blunt answer: 'I don't see that day
coming. Nobel prizes don't create jobs. Some people call us Singaporeans
pure economic creatures, and they are right. We don't believe in woolly
stuff, but in what we can get for our money.'
Some younger technocrats are less sure, however. They point out that the
country's industrial dynamic is propelling it towards more sophisticated
information-based service businesses and wonder how effectively a skill base
heavily oriented towards precision engineering will cope with these less
tangible challenges.
The final uncertainty is about the longer-term social implications of the
education system. Many parents express concerns that its pressure-cooker
atmosphere and increasingly competitive nature are imposing heavy strains on
their children.
Some also think the system, in which students are streamed by ability at an
early age, is in danger of becoming too stratified. Mr Er says there is
flexibility for children to move between streams, but also concedes that
some individual schools enjoy an elite status. However, he says, this has
been the case for many years.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (10): Multi-coloured
swapshops - A plethora of rival price lists are being used by dealers / An
examination of their merits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
We don't bet on the future and we don't predict the future values of cars,'
says Leslie Allen, director and managing editor of the motor trade's used
car price bible, Glass's Guide, 'because it really isn't possible to see
what will happen in the future.'
Try telling that to the growing band of companies doing exactly that -
publishing rival price guides which claim to predict accurately the price of
cars three or four years ahead.
The need for such information is clear. Leasing companies buying fleets of
new cars want an idea of how much those same cars will fetch tomorrow.
'It's the whole basis of the leasing industry,' says Colin McLean, chairman
of the British Valuers, Rental and Leasing Association's leasing and fleet
committee, 'and clearly the biggest pitfall for lease companies is that they
get the future values wrong.'
But do the price guides get them right? Sometimes not, says Alex D'Adda,
managing director of Evesham-based Leasecontracts, a mid-sized company which
runs 12,000 cars for its UK-based clients. D'Adda has recently spoken out
against price guides, citing what he believes are their vastly inflated
future values for a number of diesel cars when compared with their petrol
counterparts.
'How can one possibly believe, as CAP and Yellow Book are proposing, that a
BMW 525TDS Touring model is going to be worth vastly more than the
equivalent petrol model?', asks D'Adda.
CAP Monitor is published by CAP Nationwide Motor Research, based in Skipton,
North Yorkshire, and is the brainchild of John Procter and John Nolan, two
Yorkshire car dealers who set up the organisation in 1979 and still own it.
Their first publication was the Black Book, brought out specifically to
rival Glass's Guide. Like Glass's, it is a monthly publication which lists
values for used cars. CAP has since launched similar books for different
markets: Red Book for commercial vehicles, Green Book for motorcycles. In
1991, it launched Monitor, the publication which forecasts future values.
CAP will not reveal its subscriber figures, though sales and marketing
manager Joy Whittaker claims 'most of the people who order Glass's also
order CAP'.
Glass's Guide was launched in 1933 and is claimed to be part of the longest
running research organisation in the UK.
Today, Glass's Guide is jointly owned. Thomson Publishing has a 51 per cent
share and the remaining 49 per cent is owned by Hemmings, a small publishing
company. Glass's is the only price guide to have an ABC circulation figure;
the most recent showed 47,000 subscribers.
More recently the Yellow Book joined the fray. Yellow Book is not a product
from CAP as one might suppose, but was launched three years ago by motor
industry research company Sewells International, which later sold it to
consumer publishing group EMAP-Response.
Yellow Book's publisher, Bill Mason, says there are currently 300
subscribers, but adds that the figure is growing rapidly.
CAP's Black Book and Glass's Guide live and breed on today's information
and, in the case of secondhand prices, this information comes from the
trade. Glass's Guide relies mainly on a network of car dealers, auction
houses and fleet managers, all of which feed prices realised in dealerships
and auction rooms into the guide's headquarters in Weybridge, Surrey. Glass
has six full-time editors, each conducting around 250 face-to-face
interviews a month with people in the motor trade.
CAP - it stands for Current Actual Prices - has a team of 15 editors, former
motor trade sales people. They receive price information from a team of 20
researchers, who travel up and down the country visiting dealers and auction
houses and recording realised prices. This information is fed into CAP's
computer, then published.
When it comes to future residual values, the job is not so straightforward,
especially when a new car comes on to the market. How does one work out, for
example, a Rover 600's future value?
Our editors sit down and look at the car in detail,' says Joy Whittaker at
CAP, 'and if it's a new car then they would compare it with an obvious
rival. In the Rover's case, they'd compare it with the BMW 3-series, and
would reach a projected future value based on this comparison. In cases
where there is perhaps no direct competitor, they will take two or three
rivals which are nearest and compare them all.'
Yellow Book does things differently, obtaining its information from David
Henley Systems, a systems and database company which has supplied
information to leasing and fleet management companies for the past 10 years.
Yellow Book turns to economist Professor James Morrell for additional price
information.
EMAP-Response clearly sees a substantial market in price and cost
information for fleet and leasing customers, a factor behind its recent
launch of the awkwardly named TOPCALC system (Total Fleet Operating Cost
Analysis), described as an independent guide to the life costs of vehicle
fleets. This computer-based system can be used to call up information about
any car, covering a range of 10,000 to 40,000 miles a year.
The system can give the total costs of the operating life of the car over
any period up to four years, or they can be broken down into monthly and
pence-per-mile figures. Additionally TOPCALC can supply details of car
manufacturers' retail prices, fuel and maintenance costs, factory fitted
options and, the big one, future residual values.
For the companies operating these price guides, it is a highly lucrative
business. For example, Glass's 47,000 subscribers are said to pay a minimum
annual fee of Pounds 125 for the monthly guide and Pounds 250 a year if they
opt for the computer disk version. CAP charges Pounds 130 a year for its
Black Book, which is as well known in the trade as Glass's Guide, and Yellow
Book costs Pounds 274.
But how well do these guides do their job, and do they exert an influence on
the market which is out of proportion to their ability and knowledge?
'There has certainly been a concern in the industry that CAP Monitor and
Yellow Book try to predict, rather than forecast, and there is a
difference,' says Howard Thomas, operations director at Lease Plan, Europe's
largest car leasing company, running more than 200,000 cars for clients.
'Obviously, because our whole industry is based on the final value of a car
we purchase today, mistakes can be very costly indeed. I simply don't think
some of the price guides have enough information to make some of the
judgments they do.
'This is underlined by the cases where the rival guides sometimes show
thousands of pounds difference on the same car. The reality here is that the
motor trade pays in pound notes - they are the ones who realise the real
value of a car.'
Alex D'Adda at Leasecontracts says that he, too, has seen differences in the
values of cars in the price guides, and it worries him. 'We recently sold
Pounds 2m worth of used company cars, cars whose residual value had to be
worked out three years ago. We had to get it right. One per cent out, and
we'd have been seriously out of pocket with obvious implications for our
company and our cIients. We have to put our money where our mouth is, the
price guides don't have to do that.'
The BVRLA is also concerned about the residual values of cars and is not
content to rely on the price guides. Over the past two years, it has been
building its own comprehensive database, taking confidential information
from 28 of its most representative member companies on projected residuals,
as well as realised residuals.
The results of the BVRLA Residual Value Survey are supplied to the 28
companies which contribute, giving them a good picture of trends in the
industry. All other BVRLA member companies can receive the report for a
small fee.
'We have to remember that it's always going to be very difficult to forecast
three or four years ahead,' says McLean, 'and we also have to look at
factors other than the car itself - for example, the likely inflation during
that period, any changes in taxation, price of fuel, anything like that
which could influence the final value. As far as the price guides are
concerned, I don't feel that they exert too much influence in the market.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (11): Need before status
 -Operator profile / ASDA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All the UK's big food retailers are finding their margins under pressure
these days. This is leading to a renewed determination to keep down costs,
including very often a re-think on company car policies, writes Gary Mead.
One of the more determined approaches has been that of Asda, fourth-biggest
of the supermarket groups, serving about 4m customers weekly. The company's
fleet which in 1992 peaked at 1,250 units, is now down to just below 1,000
units. It leases all its cars because of tax benefits and 'to avoid exposure
to the risk on residual values'.
According to Asda, the company is trying to get away from the notion of a
company car being a status trophy, encouraging instead the view that it is a
tool, to be given to executives according to performance and need. There are
five levels of eligibility for a car within the company.
A car used to be given according to an executive's grade in the company
hierarchy, but since June 1993 a new policy has been introduced which
relates an employee's remuneration to performance and not to managerial
position. Asda says the 'new flexibility has been very popular with car
drivers'. The policy gives those eligible for a company car a wide range of
choice of make and brand, the only restrictions being for insurance reasons
on 'hot hatches', two-seaters or soft tops. Previously only a narrow narrow
range of cars was available.
As part of its efforts to tighten cost controls Asda at the same time
altered its policy on replacements. Where it was three years or 60,000
miles, it is now four years or 80,000 miles. The company says it encourages
the use of diesels because of greater fuel efficiency. Individuals are
offered the choice of a better model than he or she would otherwise be
eligible for, if the choice is a diesel model.
Asda operates a single supplier policy and has used Avis for the past five
years, though it does periodically put the business out for competitive
tendering. It says that economies of scale, plus the ease of dealing with a
single supplier, suits it better than having a range of different suppliers.
Moreover, it has outsourced most of its fleet administration, with
executives dealing directly with Avis on all matters relating to their cars.
The biggest issue concerns the new tax regime, and whether or not it is
beneficial to drive a company car. So far only 20 Asda executives have
decided to take up the cash allowance being offered instead of the company
car.
The company has only been offering the cash offer for a year, and the offer
can be taken up only when a car comes up for replacement, so it remains
early days. The company says it expects the proportion taking up the cash
offer to increase steadily. The allowance reflects the lease price, plus
petrol and insurance costs.
Asda executives who do modest business mileage are becoming very sensitive
to list prices when selecting their new car - a natural response in the
circumstances.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (9): Jewel in the manufacturing sector's
crown - The country's electronics industry is a leader in south-east Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A historic aptitude for making hairpieces and cameras may seem a decidedly
unpromising source of national advantage in fast-moving high-technology
markets. Yet for Singapore the two activities have provided a launch-pad for
one of the most successful and fast-growing electronics industries in
south-east Asia.
Electronics is the jewel in the crown of the country's manufacturing sector.
Not only does its SDollars 38.4bn output last year - a 20 per cent increase
on 1992 - make it the largest single industry; it is the flagship of
Singapore's determined efforts to carve out a steadily larger role in
research-intensive businesses with high value-added content.
Singapore's proudest claim is that it produces more than half the world's
computer hard disc drives, a distinction which it has kept despite growing
competition from Asian neighbours with lower labour costs and a drastic
restructuring of local disc-drive manufacturing in the past few years.
In addition, the country hosts production of a wide range of consumer,
telecommunications and office automation products. Most of the output
supplies markets across south-east Asia and, in many cases, other parts of
the world as well.
Singapore also recently strengthened its components capability with the
opening of a state-of-the-art sub-micron wafer fabrication plant, a joint
venture between Texas Instruments, Canon, Hewlett-Packard and the national
Economic Development Board.
Singapore's bedrock strength is a talent for high-quality precision
engineering. Mr Lee Suan Hiang, deputy managing director of the EDB, likes
to tell how, when electronics companies first set up in Singapore, female
workers turned their traditional adeptness at threading hair into wigs to
cramming components on to printed circuit boards.
This ability was enhanced more than 20 years ago when Rollei of Germany set
up a local camera plant and trained workers in mechanical engineering. 'The
plant closed, but the skills stayed on,' says Mr Lee.
Basic manual dexterity has become less important as acute labour shortages
and rising wages have encouraged increased automation. Sony, for instance,
now produces 3.6m television picture tubes annually at a showpiece plant
employing 600 people - the same number it needs to make 1.6m tubes at
Bridgend, South Wales.
Staff numbers at Apple Computer's Singapore factory have recently been
falling by 10 per cent a year, despite a steady expansion of its range which
now includes all the company's products except the recently launched Newton
electronic notebook.
In theory, these trends might seem to diminish Singapore's attractions to
the world's electronics industry. After all, the capital costs involved in
automation are the same all over the world - a fact which led many US
personal computer makers in the early 1980s to repatriate final assembly
operations previously done in Asia.
However, the country possesses other assets. One is the steady expansion of
a sophisticated and reliable on-shore supply network. Sony says that when it
began producing in Singapore 20 years ago, it mostly assembled imported
components. Today, it sources 85 per cent of them locally.
Mr Jeff Dryjanski, regional director of Motorola, which has long had
operations in Singapore, also points out that imported components and
sub-assemblies carry far smaller duties than, say, in China.
Furthermore, he says, Singapore's excellence in production engineering - of,
for example, the miniature pagers which Motorola makes produces there - is
so outstanding that it is now setting the standard for some of the company's
operations in other parts of the world.
Nevertheless, some observers wonder how much longer Singapore can hope to
retain its competitive edge in the electronics manufacturing sector. They
point out that the output of lower-margin products, such as smaller disc
drives and some categories of consumer electronics, is increasingly shifting
over to cheaper countries.
This prospect does not worry the government, which points out that one of
Singapore's greatest strengths has been its proven ability to move quickly
out of maturing activities and into emerging ones.
'We are preparing for the day when there will no longer be a hard disc drive
industry in Singapore,' says Mr Lee of the EDB.
The next big growth wave to which Singapore is pinning its hopes is in
multi-media technologies and, in particular, the production of CD-Rom
interactive information and entertainment systems. These developments are
also providing opportunities for home-grown entrepreneurship, a phenomenon
hitherto not much in evidence in Singapore's electronics industry.
Several companies have recently been formed to cash in on multi-media. They
include Aztech, Creative Technologies and IPC. Most have been founded by
Singaporeans who gained experience working for local subsidiaries of foreign
multinationals.
Central to the government's longer-term strategy for the industry is the
encouragement of more local research and development activities, with a
particular emphasis on manufacturing technologies.
One way is through collaboration between multinational companies and local
government and academic research centres. For example, Singapore
University's Institute of Microelectronics has established close links with
AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories.
The government is prepared to back such initiatives with generous financial
incentives. The National Science and Technology Board, for example, is
contributing, in the form of a grant, a quarter of the SDollars 10m cost of
a multi-media and microchip software R&amp;D centre which Sony recently decided
to set up.
Apple Computer is also stepping up local R&amp;D, with the aid of a SDollars
9.3m government grant. It has already designed a computer monitor in
Singapore and develops there Chinese-language operating software for its
machines.
The company is now considering expanding its number of researchers by
recruiting in China and India, where trained scientific brains are plentiful
and relatively cheap.
However, Apple does not conceal the fact that, for all Singapore's other
advantages as a location for research, the availability of public funding on
easy terms remains decisive.
Without that incentive, the company would probably not have located some R&amp;D
activities there, admits an executive. He says: 'The future of our research
here will be very much dependent on government support.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (10): Honing a competitive edge -
Releasing labour for skilled jobs is behind a drive towards automation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Residents of a Singapore suburb will take part this year in an experiment
which could set trends all over the world. They will be given a 'smart card'
with which they will eventually be able to carry out virtually all daily
transactions.
The card, containing a chip on which value can be stored, will be an
'electronic purse', enabling the holder to make purchases in shops, travel
on the subway and make telephone calls. It will also work in banks'
automated teller machines (ATMs), so that the holder can withdraw cash,
apply for new share offerings, and so on.
People in many industrialised countries will recognise elements of the
experiment in services already available to them. Moreover, Singapore's
grand aims for technology are very similar to the 'information
superhighways' talked of elsewhere - the marshalling of computer and
communications technology so that information is easily available and put to
efficient use by all.
What makes Singapore different is its comprehensive plan to bring
information technology to bear on every aspect of life.
The country has a pressing need to automate whatever it can. It has a small
pool of people with increasingly high aspirations. They want skilled jobs.
The government, seeking to speed economic development ever higher up the
curve of technology and added value, wants them to have skilled jobs. A job
replaced by information technology releases a citizen for more productive
work and may reduce costs.
Singapore not only has the need. It also has the potential to make the
information technology dream come true. First, it is small and has no rural
areas: technological changes involving everybody are less difficult to
achieve than elsewhere. Second, it has a government with a predilection for
planning and a people who fall in with the plans. Third, it has the money to
invest in those plans.
The National Computer Board, charged by the government with supervising the
information technology revolution, is working to create an 'intelligent
island' - a phrase it borrowed from a British Broadcasting Corporation
documentary about Singapore.
Essentially, the plan involves wiring Singapore throughout with fibre optic
cable which will enable all homes and offices to have access to a vast range
of inter-active services via telephones and personal computers.
One of the NCB's principal tasks is to oversee the building of the
information pipeline - what it calls the National Information
Infrastructure. It aims to have fibre optic cables to every home and office
by 2005.
Just as challenging, however, is conceiving a broad enough range of services
and activities available on the system to give it general appeal. It is all
very well to look forward to the day when every home will have a computer
through which personal business and recreational transactions can be
accessed. But will people actually turn the machines on?
Mr Ko Kheng Hwa, NCB chief executive, reels off a list of National
Information Infrastructure 'trigger products', a number of which are
essentially educational - using computers in the classroom, or having
tuition at home via computer. Singaporeans will be able to browse through
possible cultural and recreational activities.
They would also be able to take advantage of a 'borderless library' or to
create a 'personalised electronic newspaper'. These are concepts which do
not sit easily with the Singapore government's close control over the
availability of information - it bans satellite dishes and controls entry of
foreign publications.
Mr Ko, who notes that Singaporeans have enormous access to information
through travel and through foreign news sources which they can easily
receive, acknowledges that the subject is 'one of the challenging issues
that we have to address. . . As we move along we have to come to solutions
to some of these issues.'
Although it is unclear how many uses Singaporeans, and people elsewhere,
will find for computers, there is no doubt that the wiring of Singapore will
create the potential for big improvements in efficiency of business.
Some elements which do not require fibre optic cabling of the whole island
are already operating: for example, all types of businesses and government
departments involved in exporting and importing are linked to 'TradeNet',
which enables rapid processing on screen of customs and other formalities. A
'LawNet' system is also operating.
Singapore Telecom offers a Teleview service including home banking,
financial information, news, games and educational services. There are about
90 service providers on the system, and about 20,000 subscribers.
Ms Chua Sock Koong, treasurer of Singapore Telecom, says: 'It's not an easy
service to market. There is a lot to overcome.' But she says that the best
way to inculcate a general acceptance of the uses of information technology
is in schools.
From 1996, Singapore's system for making drivers pay to enter the busiest
city districts will be computerised. Cars will carry units which will be
detected as they enter the areas and will automatically debit drivers'
pre-paid smart cards.
The development of such services means intensive work in Singapore on
computer software and hardware. If it pays off, it will not only make the
island an extraordinarily high-tech place in the next decade. It is aimed to
give Singapore a competitive edge in technological development so that it is
less dependent on creative work elsewhere.

Hundreds of thousands of winners and losers have been created by the revised
company car taxation system, even though the government does not expect to
increase its tax intake.
The majority of the UK's estimated 2m company car users should see their tax
bill this year rise or fall by only small amounts following the introduction
of the new system earlier this month.
But some are in for a nasty shock with fundamental implications for their,
and their companies', future car choices and policies.
Increases of up to Pounds 600 in actual tax payable may be faced by the many
executives who cover between 2,500 and 18,000 business miles a year and
operate so-called 'tax break specials' - cars costing just under the old
Pounds 19,250 price band and with engines of just under two litres.
What makes an employee a winner or loser and how are the sums involved
calculated?
The process is relatively simple.
The accompanying tables show:
TABLE 1. The tax scale charges for 1993/94 plus the price and engine
capacity bands by which they were determined. The table also shows
reductions in the assessed benefit occasioned by three business mileage
thresholds - under 2,500 miles, between 2,500 and 18,000 miles, and over
18,000 miles.
The new tax system is based on a percentage of the car's list price. The
percentage for a driver covering under 2,500 business miles is 35 per cent;
for between 2,500 and 18,000 business miles this reduces to 23.3 per cent;
and to 11.67 per cent for over 18,000 business miles.
Drivers should deduct a further one-third in each case if the car becomes
more than four years old during the relevant tax year.
TABLE 2 provides a reference guide to the break-even points between the old
regime and the new.
Take, for example, drivers who covered 2,500 to 18,000 business miles in 1.4
to two-litre cars costing up to Pounds 19,250 under the old system. They
will have to run a replacement car costing no more than Pounds 12,814 if a
higher tax bill is not to be incurred.
It is in this category that some of the loudest squeals of protest are being
heard.
In TABLE 3, where car list prices intersect with the old scale charge band,
drivers can ascertain the increase/decrease in their tax assessments.
TABLE 4 shows specific examples of winners and losers among drivers covering
2,500 to 18,000 business miles on a 40 per cent marginal income tax rate.
The heaviest losers are those driving less than 2,500 business miles a year
with cars at the Pounds 80,000 ceiling where an additional actual tax bill
of Pounds 7,100 will be incurred.
Just how many losers there are likely to be in the middle manager category
was underlined in February by a study of 255 business organisations from WF
Corroon, the human resources and employee benefits consultants.
It found that most middle managers drive Fords, Vauxhalls and Rovers costing
between Pounds 16,000 and Pounds 23,600 and that 56 per cent would have
Pounds 600 increases in their tax bills.
However, such drivers are unlikely to receive much sympathy from those with
more utilitarian cars in the under two-litre category.
A sales rep driving a basic 1.6 litre car costing Pounds 7,000 less than an
executive's 'tax break special' was, under the old banding system, paying
the same as his more well-heeled counterpart.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (7): Simplicity and
clarity at last - On this page, John Griffiths examines The implications of
UK tax changes for company car owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On April 6 the Inland Revenue introduced a new regime for taxing the private
benefit employees enjoy from the use of their company cars.
Out went the awkward 20 year-old system under which tax payable was assessed
by means of scale charges on a matrix of car price and engine capacity
bands. In came a much simpler system, based on a straightforward percentage
of a car's list price plus extras at time of purchase.
The new regime has a considerable impact on individuals and their current
cars, creating thousands of winners and losers in net tax payment terms. But
it is claimed by the Government not to increase the overall burden of
company car taxation. In the Government's view, the company car became tax
neutral - in other words, as a benefit it became taxed fairly - when scale
charges were last increased for the 1993/94 tax year.
Impact on individuals aside, there is one very considerable benefit in the
new regime for all involved in company cars:
Because it is based on fixed percentages of list prices, the regime is
self-adjusting. Provided the government makes no changes to the percentages
themselves - and this would be difficult now that it has proclaimed the
level of company car taxation to be fair - the assessed taxable benefit will
rise automatically with new car prices. Fleet managers and company car users
alike should have a more stable framework within which to plan policies or
make car choices.
For the motor industry and the dealers, especially, the new regime should
thus end the period of uncertainty which traditionally set in before each
Budget, as rumours circulated about how much company car taxes were likely
to rise that year.
Particularly at the end of the 1980s, there was good reason for the company
car sector to be fearful every time the Chancellor rose to his feet, because
company car taxes were more than doubled within five years.
The essential elements of the new regime are:
All employees earning over Pounds 8,500 a year and with the benefit of
private use of a company car are liable to pay tax on this benefit.
The benefit is calculated as a percentage of the list price of the car plus
extras, and is variable by two factors - the business mileage covered each
year by the user, and the car's age. The highest percentage, 35, applies to
a user covering less than 2,500 business miles a year in a car less than
four years old. This percentage is reduced by one third, to 22.33 per cent,
where the business mileage is between 2,500 and 18,000. When business
mileage is over 18,000 this percentage is halved, to 11.67 per cent.
In turn, each of these percentages is reduced by one-third in cases where a
car becomes more than four years old during the tax year under assessment.
Thus, the 35 per cent assessment would become 23.3 per cent; the 23.33 per
cent drops to 15.56 per cent, and the 11.77 to just 7.78 per cent.
As a result of intensive lobbying by luxury car makers such as Rolls-Royce
and Aston Martin, whose Pounds 100,000-plus cars would be excessively
disadvantaged by the scheme, there is a cap, or list price upper limit, of
Pounds 80,000 above which the same tax would be assessed irrespective of
price.
When the outlines of the list price scheme were announced, speculation was
rife that a market could rapidly develop in extras fitted after the
purchase, to lower the tax burden.
Since then, however, the Inland Revenue has framed its definitions more
tightly and the list price has to comprise:
manufacturer's, importer's or distributor's published list price on the day
preceding registration, plus VAT (the 10 per cent special car tax was
abolished in two stages last year);
delivery charges, including VAT;
list price of accessories installed before the car is delivered to the
employee, also including VAT and fitting charges;
plus the list price, plus VAT and fitting, of any accessories fitted
subsequently costing more than Pounds 100.
Accessories in this category fitted before July 31 are exempt. Employees can
make a capital contribution to the car, for example in order to obtain a
better vehicle than the one to which they are ordinarily entitled.
Doing so reduces the list price pound-for-pound for tax purposes up to a
maximum contribution of Pounds 5,000. Any higher payment by the employer
will be disallowed for tax purposes.
The Inland Revenue has also moved to plug one small loophole in the previous
taxation regime which allowed mainly perk users to run expensive classic
cars on a low-tax basis. These were classified, under the old regime, as
merely cars over four years old of a certain engine capacity, even if the
car in question was a Pounds 250,000 Ferrari from the 1950s or 1960s.
Hopes that a similar car could be valued for tax purposes on its 40-year-old
list price have been dashed: if it is adjudged to have an open market value
of Pounds 15,000 or more the Inland Revenue will value it.
There are no changes to the basis on which fuel provided for an employee's
private benefit is taxed. This is the one area which is not self-adjusting
and for the current tax year is assessed at Pounds 640 for a car of under
1.4 litres, Pounds 810 for 1.4-2 litre cars, Pounds 1,200 for over 2 litres,
and Pounds 580 and Pounds 750 respectively for diesels of under and over 2
litres.
In all cases, the employee will actually pay 25 per cent or 40 per cent of
all the above amounts, depending on his or her marginal tax rate.
Employers must also pay National Insurance contributions amounting to 11.2
per cent of the benefit to the employee of private use of the car and on the
fuel benefit where applicable.
They will face a number of other new obligations, including to make
quarterly returns, starting in July, identifying who has received, changed
or handed back a company car and when, together with details of model, fuel
used, and price, any contribution by employee and the expected annual
business mileage.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (9): Car versus cash -
trick or treat?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Under new tax rules nearly 60 per cent of UK executives would be better off
swapping their company cars for extra pay and a mileage allowance, according
to a survey by Stoy Benefit Consulting.
Almost one third would benefit by more than Pounds 750 a year, the company
concluded.
Stoy Benefit's survey, which was undertaken after the new tax regime was
announced last year, looked at 5,400 companies operating a total of 189,000
cars.
It claimed to be the largest ever undertaken in the business cars sector and
was particularly useful for fleet managers. This was because it based its
calculations about employee benefits on the premise that costs to the
company of a cash scheme should be the same as if company cars continued to
be provided.
However, the survey found that the other 43 per cent of executives would
benefit from keeping their cars - nearly one quarter of them to the tune of
Pounds 700 a year or more.
The conclusion, according to Stoy Benefit's managing director, Mr Brian
Friedman, had to be that, while the company car was no longer as tax
advantageous as it used to be, 'there are still many for whom it remains
so'. The government's policy towards taxing company cars 'may, therefore, be
said to have been effective in producing the much more balanced position
revealed by the survey', he added.
However, whether an individual is better off taking cash instead of a car
depends very much on personal circumstances and requires analysis of a
number of variables.
These could include the mix of business mileage to private mileage, the cost
of finance, interest foregone and the mileage rate for use of a private car
on business.
Several tax consultancies and accounting groups, such as Coopers and
Lybrand, KPMG Peat Marwick and BDO Binder Hamlyn, have developed complex
computer models to make these evaluations.
Given the correlation now existing between price and taxation levels,
companies should clearly encourage the type of employee reassesment which
might encourage staff to hold on to company cars, albeit cheaper ones.
This is because the lower the list price, the lower the company's own costs,
including the pro rata reduction of the 10.2 per cent National Insurance
Contributions the employer is obliged to pay on the employee's private
benefit of the car.
Another good reason for doing so, suggests remuneration and consultancy and
actuarial group Wyatt, is that many companies have little idea of the
daunting costs of running a private car.
When they make cash offers in compensation for a car they could be storing
up industrial relations problems for the future, once employees find out the
costs of providing their own cars even with company mileage allowances.
Most offers 'fall far short' of actual costs, according to Wyatt's annual
study of company cars and flexible benefits packages.
Also 'few employees have a clear idea how to calculate the true value of a
company car in their personal circumstances', the study, based on a survey
of 260 companies operating fleets ranging from a few dozen cars to several
thousand, concludes. It found that 69 per cent of organisations surveyed
were responding to taxation changes by reviewing their company car policies
with 28 per cent of the total offering a cash alternative to the car - more
than double the 1992 rate.
Popular methods for working out the cash benefit included ensuring that it
did not cost the company any more than the car or providing the notional
cost of contract hiring a car.
However, even in companies offering the cash alternative, the take-up rate
was found to be very low - no more than 10 per cent.
The Wyatt study concludes: 'Even given a more or less neutral cash
alternative offer, in the absence of a positive communication and selling
programme, few employees are likely to choose the cash alternative.
'And most employees (85 per cent of those surveyed) still want to retain
their company car fleet and, therefore, are not actively seeking to persuade
employers to give up their cars.'
There are other ways of minimising the tax burden.
One, in the short term at least, is for employees to keep their company cars
if becomes four years old in the current tax year.
As an example, the car might have had a Pounds 10,000 list price in 1990.
Under the new list price scheme, it would qualify for a one-third reduction
for tax assesment purposes.
Simply to replace that car with the same model, at a list price of around
Pounds 13,000, would virtually double the tax bill.
However, there is more to the car versus cash equation than money itself.
Many company car drivers tempted by the cash option are likely to be
dissuaded by the 'hassle' factor of running their own cars.
For most company car drivers, service or repair is simply a matter of
phoning for the car to be picked up and to be delivered back to their home
or company.
Most private motorists face the dreary business of delivering the car to a
garage, finding transport to work, making their own way back to the garage
and, possibly, a long wait for a potentially unexpectedly heavy bill.
There are no insurance premiums to worry about - no longer a minor issue as
a result of increased premiums thanks to soaring crime and accident rates.
Considerations like this perhaps help explain the cash take-up is so low
currently.
The finding is not Wyatt's alone. Monks Partnership, in its own annual
survey of companies' car policies, also found fewer than one in 10 drivers
taking it up.
The small take-up is in spite of a near-doubling in the percentage of
surveyed companies making the offer.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (6): Open door creates wealth -
Singapore's industrial strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
For more than two decades, Singapore has proudly offered itself to the
developing world as living proof that multinational companies, far from
exploiting vulnerable host countries, can be exceedingly good for their
wealth.
Indeed, the country's spectacular economic growth and high standard of
living are the direct results of a policy of assiduously courting foreign
corporations which, until a few years ago, were shunned as pariahs in many
other parts of Asia.
Mr Philip Yeo, chairman of the Economic Development Board (EDB), the
government's main instrument of industrial strategy, defends the policy as
hard-nosed pragmatism.
'Who creates the jobs is what matters. Ownership is irrelevant,' he says.
'The day we became nationalistic, GDP growth would fall, for sure.'
Today, Singapore plays host to the operations of about 4,000 multinational
companies, 800 of them in manufacturing. They employ more than 200,000
people, more than half the total labour force, and their exports are
equivalent to about half the country's gross domestic product.
And they keep coming. Last year, inward direct investment in manufacturing
rose 12 per cent to a record SDollars 3.9 bn. More than a third was from the
US, and roughly a fifth each from Japan and Europe.
Part of Singapore's success is due to the energetic efforts of the EDB,
which combines professional marketing with an ability for keeping red tape
to a minimum. The EDB also has an attractive package to sell, which combines
political stability, a skilled labour force, generally liberal economic
policies and modern communications.
However, the nature of Singapore's attractions has altered since the days
when western and Japanese multinational companies viewed the country
principally as a cheap off-shore base from which to export products back to
their home markets.
Today, fiercer competition and expanding opportunities in south-east Asia
are prompting many multinationals to treat Singapore as a regional nerve
centre, equipped to respond rapidly to changes in neighbouring markets.
As Mr Wilson Tan, general manager of Apple Computer, puts it: 'In the early
1980s, corporate location was very much cost-driven. Now, time-to-market is
a much more important consideration.'
Mr Jeff Dryjanski, regional director of Motorola, says Singapore's rising
costs have been more than offset by its efficient business infrastructure.
'A lot of our costs are machinery. You can't just buy machinery and expect
it to run. Automation doesn't just happen by accident.'
On this score, Singapore is rated highly compared to many neighbours -
'Malaysia has quite a good commercial infrastructure and is starting to
develop a sense of business urgency,' says another western businessman. 'But
try talking about those things in Indonesia or the Philippines, and it just
doesn't click.'
The EDB continues to scour the world for inward manufacturing investment.
However, it has recently started expanding industrial strategy in two
directions which capitalise on what it sees as Singapore's intrinsic
advantages.
One is to widen the the scope of multinational activities by attracting more
regional headquarters and make the country the base for more
information-based services. It is well on the way to achieving the former
objective. But prospects for the latter appear more doubtful.
Many foreign businessmen point out that the country's tight controls on the
media, including censorship of foreign newspapers and a ban on direct
satellite dishes, are unlikely to attract businesses which depend for their
life blood on free information flows.
The controls look even more anomalous in the light of the EDB's other
initiative, intended to expose indigenous businesses more directly to
international influences by encouraging them to expand abroad.
This so-called 'second wing' policy has several origins:
The well-publicised belief of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the Senior Minister, that
Singaporean companies had grown accustomed to too easy a life at home and
needed to become more adventurous.
The government's desire to diversify its massive reserves, mostly invested
in foreign securities, by channelling money into opportunities offering more
direct benefit to the real economy.
Growing awareness of physical constraints on further domestic growth. In the
words of Mr Sim Kee Boon, chairman of the group Keppel group and an elder
statesman of Singaporean business: 'Our costs are going up and commercial
opportunities are being exhausted. We need to look outwards.'
In its first incarnation, in the late 1980s, international expansion looked
mainly to west. However, the thrust was blunted after investments by a
number of Singaporean companies turned sour.
The idea now is that Singapore should export not just capital, but also
technology, experience and skills, and focus its attention more tightly on
other parts of Asia.
In practice, this has so far taken the form mainly of involvement in the
development and construction of industrial estates and holiday resorts.
Several dozen such projects have been announced, notably in Indonesia, China
and more recently in India.
It is too early to judge the likely returns on these projects, the viability
of some of which depends on persuading multinational companies located in
Singapore to take space in the newly-developed industrial estates abroad.
'This may all be great for Singapore Inc.,' says a foreign broker. 'But I'm
much less sure what it means for quoted Singaporean companies.' However, the
risks in many cases are likely to be limited by support from the government,
which has said it is ready to invest up to one third of its foreign exchange
reserves in promoting the 'second wing'.
It is not certain that the government's hopes of using the initiative to
strengthen indigenous industrial suppliers will bear fruit.
In the electronics industry, (see facing page) most bigger manufacturers
located in Singapore say they buy most of their components from other
multinationals, relying on local suppliers mainly for lower-value items such
as plastic mouldings and formed metal.
For the foreseeable future, it seems likely that Singapore's wider
international ambitions will rely as heavily as its domestic economy on the
muscle power of foreign-owned corporate guests.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (8): Greater urgency injected -
Privatisation Programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In most countries, the spread of privatisation has been driven by two
overriding motives: to shake up companies which have grown fat and lazy
under state ownership, and to fill the coffers of cash-strapped governments.
In Singapore, however, neither concern has come into play. By common
consent, most of the country's extensive state-owned sector is efficient and
well-managed. As for the exchequer, persistent budget surpluses means it has
money coming out of its ears.
According to Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, the main objectives of
privatisation have been to strengthen Singapore's stock market and financial
services industry by increasing the supply of tradeable equity, and to give
the country's citizens a more direct stake in its economy.
In addition, the government hopes that privatisation will further its
'second wing' strategy of encouraging business expansion in the rest of Asia
by making companies more adventurous and pioneering.
The programme was formally launched in the mid-1980s and has so far involved
about 60 sales, many of relatively small companies which have been sold to
corporate buyers. Recently, however, external events have injected greater
urgency into the programme.
The principal one is a plan by the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange to move to a
paperless electronic trading system. This spells the end of trading in
Malaysian companies' scrip certificates, which accounts for more than half
the equity traded, by value, on the Singapore exchange.
The prospect encouraged the government last year to press ahead with its
most ambitious privatisation to date, the flotation of about 11 per cent of
Singapore Telecom (ST), which raised more than SDollars 4bn. By most
measures, it has gone a good way to meet Dr Hu's goals. Lured by a range of
incentives, about 1.4m Singaporeans have acquired shares in the company,
more than tripling the number of shareholders in the country. ST's recent
market value of more than SDollars 30bn accounts for roughly a quarter of
the total capitalisation of Singapore's stock exchange.
Apart from its high profitability, stemming from its large international
call volumes, ST's appeal is underpinned by the fact that it is the only
privatised telephone company in Asia which faces no immediate threat of
competition. Its monopoly is guaranteed on mobile telephony until 1997 and
on basic services until 2007.
Nonetheless, at its recent share price, ST is worth almost half as much as
British Telecom, which has sales more than 10 times larger and pre-tax
profit four times as big. Some brokers see limited scope for further
appreciation. However, a sharp fall, which could jeopardise popular support
for further privatisations, seems even less likely.
Generous loyalty bonuses have given individual shareholders - who have seen
the value of their investment double after allowing for initial flotation
discounts - a strong incentive to retain their shares. Furthermore, it is
widely thought that state investment bodies, such as the Central Provident
Fund, would step in to prop up the price, if necessary.
Encouraged by the ST success, the government plans to privatise Pidemco
Land, a property company, later this year, followed about two years later by
the power supply businesses of the Public Utilities Board. Other likely
candidates include Singapore Broadcasting, the port authority, the
government printers and the mass transit railway.
Mr Hu hints that the scope of the programme may become more adventurous.
With hindsight, he says, the government 'grossly under-estimated' the demand
for ST shares, and there is no reason in principle why 100 per cent of many
state-owned companies should not be sold in one tranche in future.
He also favours a simplification of the three-tranche approach applied to
Singapore Telecom, under which shares were offered separately to small
shareholders, national financial institutions and all-comers.
There is no shortage of potential candidates. The government owns stakes,
directly and indirectly, in several hundred companies. By one estimate,
these account for more than two thirds of the stock market's total
capitalisation.
The government has used its influence as a shareholder selectively. Once top
managers are in place, it has tended to let them get on with the job,
intervening only in exceptional cases when national interests are at stake.
However, it monitors corporate performance rigorously and is quick to
discipline managers who fail to perform.
To judge from the comments of the managers themselves, this system is
unlikely to change radically even in companies which have been totally
privatised. In any case, the government has retained a degree of influence
over many bigger companies by holding 'golden shares' and setting a cap on
the proportion of their equity which may be held by foreign investors.
Furthermore, Mr Hu says the government intends to continue holding sizable
stakes in privatised companies in 'strategic' sectors, such as defence
manufacturing.
Provided their shares are realistically priced, the generally high quality
of Singaporean companies seems set to continue to ensure strong demand for
future privatisations.
Indeed, if the programme faces any problems, they are more likely to be on
the supply side. With so much of the country's economic and industrial
activity accounted for by foreign-based multinational companies, some fund
managers complain that it is difficult to find enough opportunities to buy
direct stakes in 'Singapore Inc.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (7): Novel distribution methods - Shares
soar for Integrated Processors and Communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the entrance to IPC's blockhouse-like headquarters on a suburban
industrial estate stands a scarlet Ferrari Testarossa, owned by Mr Patrick
Ngiam, the company's chairman. It is, he says, his one extravagance in an
otherwise punishing regimen which keeps him working from 6am until 10pm,
five days a week.
If it were only a matter of money, Mr Ngiam could buy a boat-load of
Ferraris and still have plenty left over. Since IPC went public last year,
its shares have soared on the Singapore stock exchange, where it is
capitalised at about SDollars 1.8bn. Three quarters of the equity belongs to
Mr Ngiam and close relatives.
Investors' rapturous enthusiasm partly reflects the fact that Mr Ngiam, 39,
is one of a rare breed - a home-grown high-tech entrepreneur who thinks big
and, on his record to date, knows how to deliver.
Mr Ngiam, a Thai by birth who went to school in Singapore, of which he later
became a citizen, formed IPC three years ago with his brother Benjamin after
selling a printed circuit board manufacturer which he had set up 10 years
earlier.
Two other brothers and a sister have since joined IPC, as has Mr Ngiam's
wife, whom he met while they were both students at Essex University in
Britain.
The company - the initials stand for Integrated Processors and
Communications - began life making personal computers. Its range has since
expanded to include laptops, multi-media systems and electronic
point-of-sale terminals, and it will launch a notebook computer this summer.
Last year, it earned pre-tax profits of SDollars 41m on sales of SDollars
274m.
Mr Ngiam insists that IPC is not really a personal computer manufacturer,
but first and foremost a marketing-driven company which has thrived by
pioneering novel distribution methods and emphasising customer service.
'Technology is just a means, not an end,' he says.
Surprisingly, IPC launched its first products in Europe. 'The great thing is
that Europe is a big market, but because it's divided, you can develop at
your own pace,' says Mr Ngiam. 'In the US, it's taken for granted that you
will address the whole market at once. But that is very costly.'
Stranger still, the company made its debut in France, not usually considered
an easy market. Mr Ngiam said it was chosen because Bull, the country's
ailing state-owned computer group, offered such a soft target and because
IPC was the first company to sell personal computers there by mail order. By
last year, it had won 6 per cent of the French market.
It now sells in about 20 countries in Europe, Asia and the US, where it
acquired Austen, a distributor and manufacturer, last year. It plans soon to
establish a European plant, probably in Britain or Ireland, and possibly a
research centre as well.
The exact location will depend on the regional aid packages on offer.
After its dazzling start, IPC's biggest challenge now is to show it has
staying power in an industry notorious for its high casualty rate. Mr Ngiam
says part of his strategy is to complement its PC range with products, such
as point-of-sale terminals, which are made in smaller volumes but earn
higher margins.
This will involve increased investment in research and development to ensure
that the company remains technologically innovative. But the key to its
future success will be to keep a tight control on operating costs while
continuing to respond rapidly to market developments.
'We have to stay nimble. We have to offer the best service and the best
products. We have to be the fastest and the cheapest,' he says.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (6): Preference for
Rovers - User profile / Lucas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring, downsizing, re-organising - all flourishing euphemisms to
disguise the painful need to get costs into line with sales. Of all the
perks once available to company executives, the great taboo, the car, is
under attack from all directions.
Lucas Industries is another example of what can be done with a bit of
creative attention resulting from commercial pressure. In the course of a
year Lucas now reckons to be making savings of Pounds 3m through
significantly changing its company car practices. While the overall car pool
has stayed constant, with around 2,000 vehicles, its sourcing and servicing
of that pool has considerably altered.
There are two categories of employees entitled to a company car at Lucas,
the essential user - where it is a tool of the job, a function of doing
thousands of miles annually on company business - and management executives
whose position in the company hierarchy entitles them to a car as part of
their overall package.
In January, 1993, the company began looking into its company car polices,
with a view to tightening up the costs and bringing some managerial order to
what was rather a hotch-potch of choice. 'In a sense we were running what
was a whole series of mini-fleets, which was both very expensive and
sometimes confusing. It didn't make a lot of sense,' says the company.
Until last year both categories of user - essential car and management  -
were able to exercise a reasonable amount of choice over brand and model;
users were able to choose from six different manufacturers, have any model
within a certain price bracket, and could choose from diesel or petrol
No longer. In cost-conscious times some things have to go, and essential car
users now are restricted to one brand of car - Rover - under a solus
agreement. Mr George Simpson, formerly chairman of Rover, is to take over as
chief executive at Lucas in May.
Another fundamental change is that all Lucas's essential car users must
these days drive diesel cars, and choice of models has been circumscribed.
These fundamental changes have not been applied to the management car, over
which the individual still has a choice of manufacturer and model. Lucas
argues that as the company car for this grade of employee is still seen as
an incentive, part of the overall salary package, the decision to leave
things as they were is justified.
A further significant change is that Lucas now operates a policy of contract
hire, where previously it owned its fleet. Lex Vehicle Leasing now manages
the fleet. 'This minimises our administration costs and we can utilise their
fleet management expertise,' say Lucas.
So far, the company has not offered cash incentives to its employees to
rescind their company car. But the company is making it possible for
individuals within the management car bracket to down-grade their vehicle,
in order perhaps to get a smaller car and a variable sum of money, rather
than stick with large, plush models.
And as for the April 6 tax changes, Lucas thinks they will not really affect
its policies, but will naturally influence individual decisions in ways yet
to be seen. Perhaps the only safe prediction is that many more individuals
are likely to be thinking more carefully about precisely what benefits
accrue from possessing a company car - which in turn may erode its already
tarnished status as a status object.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (5): Triple offensive -
Japan-UK plants chase bulk sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The three Japanese carmakers - Nissan, Toyota and Honda - are seeking to
increase significantly their presence in the UK fleet market as output grows
from their UK car assembly plants.
The fleet market - defined as sales to companies running 25 or more vehicles
 -accounted last year for 42 per cent of the overall UK new car market of
1.78m. Its share has jumped from only 27 per cent in 1987.
The business market - defined as sales to companies running between two and
24 vehicles - accounted for additional sales of around 350,000.
Nissan, which has the largest share of any Japanese carmaker in both the UK
and in west Europe, estimates that two out of every three new car purchases
in the UK are made with company money.
These sectors cannot be ignored by any of the world's leading carmakers
aiming to capture a significant share of the UK new car market.
As long as the Japanese car producers were constrained by quota limits on
direct vehicle exports from Japan, they preferred to direct their main
attention to the retail market, but that picture is now changing
dramatically, as they build up local sources of production in Europe.
Nissan, Toyota and Honda have their first European car assembly plants in
operation and they are all located in the UK. As far as the fleet market is
concerned, this gives them the opportunity of breaking through any remaining
prejudices on the part of the big fleets against buying cars that are not
British or European-built.
The quota restraints on direct exports from Japan are in any case being
eased, as the European Union moves towards removing all restrictions on car
imports by the end of 1999. In the case of Nissan, the remaining quota
restrictions are already of little significance for its UK sales efforts,
however, as 70 per cent of the vehicles it sells in Britain are now
European-built.
It was the first Japanese carmaker to begin car production in Europe in
1986, and by last year its output in the UK had jumped to 246,281 of which
74 per cent were exported.
Honda and Toyota both began car production in the UK in late 1992. Toyota
output at its plant at Burnaston, near Derby, totalled 37,314 last year and
is forecast to rise to 100,000 this year. Honda produced 32,139 cars at its
plant at Swindon, Wiltshire, last year and this is expected to reach 100,000
in 1995, when it adds assembly of a second car range.
All three Japanese carmakers chose large family cars as their first models
for local production in Europe, models which sell to the heart of the fleet
market. The Nissan Primera, the Toyota Carina E, and the Honda Accord are
competing directly with the best-selling fleet cars of Ford and Vauxhall,
the Mondeo and the Cavalier.
Honda claims that it is targeting the user-chooser company car driver rather
than the large fleets, which have only one of two makes. 'There is little
profit in that sector,' it says, 'and competition between Ford and Vauxhall
is cut-throat.' It expects around 50 per cent of the UK sales of its
Swindon-produced Accord to be company purchases.
Honda says that it cannot match Ford and Vauxhall discounts, but it claims
that the overall running costs of the Accord are lower than for its rivals
because of better second-hand values.
Nissan has faced a particular sales and marketing challenge in Britain, as
it seeks to re-build its share of the UK market following the setbacks it
suffered during its long-running legal battle with Nissan UK, its former
independent importer/distributor controlled by Mr Octav Botnar.
It has only held direct control of its UK sales and marketing operations
since the beginning of 1992, when it started with a total of 150 dealers.
Nissan's share of the UK new car market had held steady at around 6 per cent
throughout the 1980s, but slipped to only 4 per cent in 1991 at the height
of its conflict with Mr Botnar.
With an expanded dealer network - it is being increased from 294 at present
to 330 by the end of the year - Nissan is aiming to raise its share of the
UK new car market to 5.5 per cent in 1994 from 5 per cent last year and 4.7
per cent in 1992 according to Mr Andy Green, sales director of Nissan Motor
(GB).
As part of this effort it is increasing its presence in particular in the
fleet market. Mr Green forecasts that fleet sales will account for 25 per
cent of Nissan's new car sales this year compared with less than 20 per cent
in 1993.
While the fleet sales market is dominated by the traditional big four groups
in the UK new car market, Ford, General Motors (Vauxhall), Rover and the PSA
Peugeot Citroen group of France, the Japanese carmakers are beginning to
gain ground.
Ford, Vauxhall and Rover all lost share in the fleet market last year. By
contrast Nissan raised its share to 2.7 per cent from 1.6 per cent a year
earlier, while Toyota increased its share to 1.6 per cent from 1.0 per cent
in 1992. The earlier dominance of Ford, Vauxhall and Rover in the fleet
market has been undermined, and the share of these three has fallen from 89
per cent in 1987 to 69.3 per cent last year.
Nissan has raised its fleet car sales from 5,431 in 1991 - the low point
when it was still immersed in its legal fight to take control of the
franchise - to 10,890 in 1992 and 19,939 last year.
According to Mr Simon Rutherford, NMGB national fleet sales manager, Nissan
is aiming to increase its fleet sales to around 24,000 this year to claim
around 3 per cent of the fleet market.
Nissan has built up a 16-strong fleet sales department including six field
staff, and is now running a fleet of 400 demonstrator vehicles. Two managers
specialise in looking after the top 80 contract hire and leasing companies
in the country.
Having reached its initial targets in the market for large fleets, Nissan
has also started to pay more attention to the local business and medium
fleet sectors with the launch of its Nissan In Business dealer programme. To
date 52 of its larger dealers have been selected to join the initiative,
which is designed to complement the group's national fleet activities and
build more company sales in local markets.
Toyota started preparing its fleet sales activities in 1990 in preparation
for the start of production of the Carina E in the UK at the end of 1992. In
1990 its fleet sales totalled only 1,326, but sales have doubled each year
since to 2,690 in 1991, 6,521 in 1992 and 12,120 last year.
In the same period the share of Toyota's UK sales derived from the fleet
market has risen from 3 per cent in 1990 to 23 per cent last year, while its
share of the overall UK fleet market has jumped from 0.2 per cent to 1.6 per
cent in the same period.
Toyota is aiming to increase its fleet sales again this year by close to 50
per cent to 18,000 according to Mr Brian Mahony, Toyota (GB)'s corporate
business director. He expects fleet sales to be accounting for as much as 30
per cent of Toyota's total UK car sales by the end of the year with the
share reaching as much as one-third over the longer-term.
The UK-produced Carina is accounting for 55-60 per cent of Toyota's fleet
sales, and half of the group's fleet sales are to contract hire and leasing
companies.
From one person in 1990 the Toyota (GB) fleet sales department has grown to
14, its fleet of demonstrator vehicles has jumped from 8 to 200, and its
database of potential fleet customers has climbed from 1,200 to 11,500.
Toyota has chosen 80 dealers from its 270-strong network as its main
strategic fleet dealers, and it is here that it has concentrated its
specialist training efforts. 'We are now a player in this market, and we are
going forward carefully and comfortably,' says Mr Mahony.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (4): Economic growth surprises the
forecasters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore, as a newly industrialised economy, had schooled itself to expect
slower, steadier growth than in the heady, early days of its development.
Last year, however, the economy confounded the forecasters and this year it
may do so again.
The 1993 growth rate of 9.9 per cent was well above both the previous year's
6 per cent and the government's long-term targeted range of 4 to 6 per cent.
For 1994, the government is forecasting growth of 6 to 8 per cent.
Manufacturing industry grew by 9.8 per cent, mainly because of strong demand
for electronic products such as disk drives, telecommunications equipment,
semiconductors and printed circuit boards.
A sharp increase in stock market trading, combined with expansion of foreign
exchange dealing, domestic lending and Singapore-based international
banking, brought a big increase in the contribution of financial services to
growth, too.
When this performance is combined with low inflation, a strong currency,
fiscal surplus, productivity growth exceeding real wage growth, and buoyant
export markets in the US and Asia, the economic picture is extraordinarily
rosy.
Not that the island's leaders are complacent about the prospects. Singapore
has no resources except its population - even water is imported. The
government is, therefore, paying considerable attention to ensuring that its
people have the right qualifications to push an already industrialised and
well-off country further forward.
Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, noted in his February budget speech that
Singapore had the least educated workforce of any of its near rivals in
Asia, with only 54 per cent of the labour force having at least secondary
school education compared with more than 70 per cent in Hong Kong, Taiwan
and South Korea.
Moreover, he pointed out, the economic structure is very much that of a
developing country - 'we depend heavily on foreign technology.' Research and
development spending was well below that in Taiwan and Korea, and very few
Singaporean companies ranked as world-class, he said.
The government itself may be to blame for this. Its emphasis on
government-led planning and the dominance of state-controlled companies has
tended to stifle entrepreneurship.
Many of the products of Singapore's manufacturing industry are likely, too,
to have a fairly short cycle before they are replaced by newer technology.
The aim must always be to be competitive for the next wave of products. To
this end, the Economic Development Board last year invested in a
semiconductor wafer fabrication plant in partnership with three foreign
companies.
Improvement of educational standards, creation of more dynamic companies -
partly through privatisation - and encouragement of high-technology
investment are all part of the government's long-term programme to keep
Singapore competitive and advance it to what it calls the 'First League.'
At the same time, it is seeking to prevent greater affluence from
stimulating popular demand for increased provision of government services
such as care for the elderly. 'We must avoid the pifalls of welfarism which,
as the experience of socialist and western democratic governments has shown,
sooner or later leads to dependency and destruction of the work ethic,' Mr
Hu said in his budget speech.
In the shorter term, there are a number of economic question marks:
First, the introduction of a 3 per cent value added tax from the beginning
of this month is likely to depress consumer spending, though most economists
believe the effect will only be temporary. It will cause a one-time increase
in inflation, though probably of less than 3 percentage points. The
government has reduced other taxes to offset the impact and has guaranteed
to keep the VAT rate at 3 per cent for at least five years.
Second, interest rates began to creep upwards even before the US Federal
Reserve began to tighten credit earlier this year and are generally expected
to rise further during the year. Since Singapore's anti-inflation policy
depends on maintaining a firm exchange rate against the US dollar, local
interest rates are likely to rise further this year.
Third, residential property prices have been rising too fast for the comfort
of some economists.
Fourth, a fall this year in the stock market - in line with the general
correction in south-east Asian markets after last year's strong gains - is
likely to reduce the contribution made by financial services to economic
growth this year.
Growth of manufacturing industry is likely to remain closely linked to
demand in important export markets, particularly the US. Tourism has also
shown healthy growth, although the government worries that visitors may
increasingly treat Singapore as a stop-over between Asian destinations.
The government is mindful of the short-term challenges as well as the
longer-term questions over Singapore's competitiveness. It knows that
continued prosperity depends on staying ahead of other regional economies in
attracting foreign investment and trade.
Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, summed up the government's continuing
intention to plan ahead when he said in his budget speech: 'Singaporeans
must not be lulled into thinking that we have arrived, and start relaxing
and taking progress and prosperity for granted.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (5): A highly efficient one-stop service
 -Key role for Singapore's Economic Development Board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's the annual press conference of the Economic Development Board and Mr
Philip Yeo is 'off': talking in rapid fire even while he is being
introduced, the chairman dispenses with his prepared statement, harries
local journalists to ask questions, and soon brings the meeting to an end
ahead of schedule.
Mr Yeo is in charge of Singapore's industrial development, and he is
rocket-powered, writes Alexander Nicoll.
The EDB is given credit by foreign companies for its highly efficient
one-stop investment service. Its officials will meet you at the airport,
guide you to a potential factory site, and guarantee a time (soon) when it
will be operational. The board has continued to convince foreign
manufacturers of Singapore's attractions even though the island's costs are
higher than those of its equally ambitious neighbours and skilled labour is
in short supply.
The job of selling Singapore is done partly by dressing the country's
aspirations in bewildering marketing-speak. The board aims to build
'world-class industry clusters.' Singapore is to be a 'global knowledge
arbitrageur.' It wants to promote 'second 'S' curve corporations.'
Here is a sample of the board's annual report: 'Collective competitiveness
is about synergy. It is about how the partnerships and strategic alliances
Singapore Inc forges under the Singapore Unlimited and Shakkei approach can
result in win-win benefits for all parties concerned.'
But underlying all this is a fierce determination to create jobs which will
attract the country's young people. Mr Yeo and his older colleagues in
government are ever-conscious of Singapore's small size, lack of resources,
and vulnerability to the intense competition to win away the foreign
investment which has driven the island's growth. For them, it is a matter of
the country's survival.
'What's important to a young boy or young girl in university is: who's
creating the job for me?' Mr Yeo says. He makes no apologies for
government's prominent planning role: 'Government is the great worrier. No
individual has the resources to do what a government can do. When government
abdicates, individuals suffer.'
There is no question about where he expects the aspirations of the young and
their educators to be focused - 'if people want to be poets, sculptors or
painters, they can do that as a hobby, but not as a job.'
Mr Yeo goes further. His preference is strongly for the maintenance of
Singapore's role in manufacturing more than development as an international
services hub - 'manufacturing is the key to our economy because it creates
many multiplier effects,' he says, although he acknowledges that 'the
services sector is also important because it creates good white-collar
jobs.'
The EDB, mindful of the potential obsolescence of key Singapore products
such as disc drives, is seeking to develop higher-technology industries.
Last year it took a stake itself in Singapore's first 'wafer fab' making
semiconductor chips in partnership with Texas Instruments, Canon and
Hewlett-Packard.
The EDB's success in promoting Singapore as a place for inward investment
can hardly be questioned. Inward investment remains strong while it has
fallen sharply in Singapore's neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia.
But it is less clear that the EDB will be able to reverse its approach to
take on the new role demanded of it by the government. This is to lead
Singapore's 'external wing' policy of investing elsewhere in the region.
Predictably, this has been cloaked in another slogan: 'Shakkei, where a
beautiful garden is made more beautiful by integrating distant scenery into
the garden landscape.'
What this actually means is investing part of Singapore's riches abroad but
seeking to keep the investments closely tied to the real economy at home -
for example, through farming out labour-intensive parts of a production
process to a cheaper country while keeping the high-value-added,
skill-intensive parts in Singapore.
The task is challenging not least because more than 70 per cent of
Singapore's manufacturing industry is accounted for by foreign companies,
likely to have their own regional strategies which may not fall in with
those of Singapore. A company's decision to manufacture in China may be
taken quite separately from consideration of its presence in Singapore.
Mr Yeo hopes to work with the multinationals, some of which, he says, 'are
more loyal to Singapore than local companies.'
'Our job is to encourage Singapore companies to invest overseas,' he says.
'The EDB is a very hard-nosed organisation. Whatever project we promote must
have a direct economic benefit for us.'
He says this assurance is vital because 'otherwise Singapore appears to be a
regional Father Christmas.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (2): Convergence remains
a fantasy - Standardising Europe's car prices is thwarted by exchange rate
turbulence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A closer convergence in new car prices across west Europe will remain 'a
mere fantasy', as long as the European Union is confronted with frequent
significant exchange rate realignments, according to leaders of the European
car industry.
The latest survey of car prices published by the European Commission at the
end of last year showed that around 80 per cent of car prices from European
manufacturers and 90 per cent of Japanese car prices had differentials
across the EU of less than 20 per cent.
According to the Commission, Spain and Portugal are now the lowest price
markets in the EU, while Germany is the highest (based on prices in
November, 1993).
The issue of pan-European car pricing has been caught up in the growing
debate about the future of the car industry's controversial selective
distribution system, which allows the use of exclusive dealer networks.
As far as the European Automobile Industry Association (ACEA) is concerned,
however, it is currency fluctuations that have the 'decisive influence' on
car prices. 'Greater convergence of car prices in Europe will remain a mere
fantasy as long as the European Union is confronted with frequent,
significant exchange rate realignments and widely varying tax regimes,' the
association said in a recent statement.
This stance, broadly rejected by European consumer organisations, that are
seeking the removal of exclusive dealer networks, has been given significant
support by the latest European Commission price study.
The focus on carmakers' pricing policies across Europe is unlikely to ease
in the near future, however, as the issue of price differentials is
inextricably linked to the debate over the selective distribution system. In
mid-1995 the present 10-year 'block exemption', which controversially allows
carmakers to use a selective dealer distribution system in contravention of
European Union competition rules, is due to expire.
The exemption, granted in 1985, was conditional in part on car prices
between member states not differing by more than 12 per cent in the
long-term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of less than a year.
Before the currency turmoil in the autumn of 1992, the motor industry had
been warned by the EU competition authorities that a renewal of the block
exemption would depend importantly on car manufacturers' performance in
conforming with these limits on car price differentials.
Since the upheaval in the European exchange rate mechanism, carmakers have
been able to seize on the currency issue in their defence.
Car manufacturers' efforts to reduce price differences had not been
reflected in the prices published by the Commission, as they had largely
been offset by recent currency realignments versus the ECU, said ACEA.
These had varied from a 3 per cent revaluation in the Deutsche Mark and the
Guilder and 7 per cent devaluations of the Escudo and the peseta.
The Commission's latest study - the second of what is now becoming a regular
biannual exercise - does accept that 'car manufacturers have tended to
reduce price differentials for most of their models', if monetary
fluctuations are excluded.
When the effects of exchange rate changes are removed, about 90 per cent of
all car price differentials covering both European and Japanese models are
less than 20 per cent across EU member states, says the Commission.
The study shows that the biggest price disparities occur in the market
segments for small cars, while the price differentials are not as marked for
medium and large cars.
Spain was now the lowest price market in the EU according to the latest
Commission survey, but as recently as June 1992 it had been the highest
price market according to ACEA.
All European manufacturers have price differentials of more than 25 per cent
for at least one model, however. The widest price difference in November was
shown by the Seat Ibiza small car with a range of 41 per cent between the
prices in Germany and Portugal.
Seat, the Spanish subsidiary of the Volkswagen group of Germany, currently
has the widest price variations for identical models across the EU,
according to the latest study, with 50 per cent of its models having price
disparities of more than 20 per cent.
By contrast, the Volkswagen marque has significantly reduced its price
differences from 50 per cent of its models having disparities of 20 per cent
or more in the Commission's initial study in the first half of 1993 to only
10 per cent at the end of 1993.
Price differentials for Japanese models are on average lower than for
European models, the Commission says.
According to a recent study published by Ludvigsen Associates on the issue
of the block exemption, the present EU requirement for aligning prices
across the Union is one of the 'most difficult issues' facing the Commission
in framing a new regulation.
'Price differences of more than 18 per cent will continue for reasons that
have nothing to do with selective distribution,' says the report, Beyond
1995: The Future of Car Dealer Franchising in Europe. Rather than converging
with the single market, such exogenous factors as currency fluctuations and
national taxes are stubbornly resistant to harmonisation.'
The Ludvigsen report supports the move by the Commission to encourage
greater price transparency in the EU, however, through the biannual price
study. It suggests that the requirement for such transparency could be made
part of the regulation for a renewed block exemption.
It supports too the call from motor retailers for the practice of direct
sales by carmakers to large fleet customers to be curtailed. 'High volume
purchasers can obtain much deeper discounts from manufacturers than the
manufacturers' own dealers commonly can. Such customers include the daily
rental companies, and the contract hire and leasing companies as well as
large corporate fleet operators.
'The discounts available to daily rental companies, for example, often allow
the car to be disposed of for more than the acquisition price,' says the
report published last month.
The UK Retail Motor Industry Federation in particular has criticised the
'deep discounts which large fleet owners obtain from suppliers, which
distort the price structure for other buyers.'
The latest European Commission car price study noted that 'a general
downward trend' for car prices in the EU had occurred during 1993. It is
unclear how far this trend has been reflected in actual prices for the final
car buyer, however.
In the UK some carmakers are sharply cutting or even eliminating dealer
margins on selected new car models in a move to reduce the list prices in
particular of entry level models, the cheapest cars in a manufacturer's
range.
One of the first to take such action has been Volvo, the Swedish carmaker,
which has eliminated the dealer margin on its entry level cars and has
replaced it with a handling charge.
Volvo accepts that the actual transaction price paid by the customer on its
cheapest models has not changed, but the elimination of the dealer margin
had removed any discount and haggling, and the list price now represented
the transaction price.
'Before with discounts it was possible to get down to the prices we are now
advertising, but now we can include these prices in our list prices. We are
legitimising the cut-price deals that were being done before, but which we
could not advertise. Our dealers wanted a car below Pounds 10,000 again,
after our price increases last September had taken our cheapest cars well
over Pounds 10,000.'
Volvo has not yet decided whether it will extend the initiative in the UK to
other models. 'We are treating this as a pilot scheme. If it is successful,
we could look elsewhere in our range.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (4): Cabriolets and the
over 40s - Poll reveals quirks of the mature manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now here's an interesting fact: the older the manager of a company car
fleet, the more likely he or she is to restrict the choice of car available
to employees.
This emerged from a recent survey by Lex Vehicle Leasing when more than half
the companies questioned said they would not allow employees to have
'exotic' vehicles such as four-wheel-drives, sports cars and cabriolets.
Lex's explanation: 'This suggests that, as far as the fleet manager is
concerned, a company car is a tool of the trade and to be used for the
company's purpose. Therefore, non-standard cars may be considered
inappropriate.'
Older fleet managers, those over the age of 46, were the most likely to
restrict choice of vehicles: 63 per cent of this age group offered no choice
of exotics compared with 47 per cent of those under 35. 'This may be
explained by the fact that older fleet managers are more likely to be found
in larger companies where company policy is likely to be more tightly
defined,' says Lex in its 1994 'Report on Motoring.'
Perhaps the most important trend to be pinpointed by the survey was that,
despite a reduction in Britain's white collar workforce, debates about the
future of the company car and imminent changes in the system of company car
taxation, there was no evidence that companies were phasing them out. Nor
were employees pushing for cash in lieu of a company car.
These findings are reinforced by research by PHH Vehicle Management Services
which showed no sign of any decrease in company car popularity.
Its survey revealed the most significant factor behind any increase or
decrease in a company's fleet size was a corresponding change in the size of
the workforce.
Only 1 per cent of company car drivers questioned for the Lex survey
reported that their company was phasing out company cars. More than half, 51
per cent, reported no change of any kind in their company's policy towards
company cars.
The most significant change in policy was that about one in every five
drivers, 21 per cent, said that their employers had delayed renewal of
company cars during the previous year.
The survey showed that only 2 per cent of those questioned had had to give
up their company car during the past two years. Of these, 65 per cent had
become ineligible for a company car either because they had changed jobs or
because they no longer had a job. Only 11 per cent of those who no longer
had a company car claimed to have opted for cash or a salary increase within
the same company instead of the use of a car.
The Lex survey, research for which was carried out by MORI last October,
showed most company car drivers seemed to think of their cars as 'tools of
the trade'. No fewer than 69 per cent of those surveyed believed their
vehicle to be essential for their job.
This rose to 96 per cent among those who travelled more than 12,000 miles on
business each year. In all, only 15 per cent of company car drivers thought
of their car as a 'perk' and simply part of their remuneration package.
Interestingly, over three-quarters of directors and partners considered
their vehicle to be essential to carry out their jobs effectively, compared
with fewer than half the senior managers questioned.
Changes to the personal taxation on the benefit of having a company car,
introduced in April this year, seemed to have had little impact on the
opinions or actions of company car drivers, says the Lex survey.
More than one in three of them, 36 per cent, had not or did not expect to
react in any way to these changes. However, 24 per cent of those questioned
said they had asked for, or were likely to ask for, a pay rise, because they
assumed the new tax system would make them worse off. Only 14 per cent of
drivers said they had asked for, or were likely to ask for, a cheaper car to
compensate for the rising tax burden.
Lex found that a high proportion, 38 per cent, did not know how much company
car tax they paid. It suggests that this might be because the tax is usually
wrapped into the driver's general tax code and paid via PAYE.
Company car drivers, particularly those who clock up more than 20,000 miles
a year, admitted to more motoring offences than private drivers. According
to Lex, more than three-quarters (76 per cent) admitted to speeding on
normal roads compared with 59 per cent of private drivers. Company car
drivers were also more likely to park illegally, intentionally drive through
a red light, not to 'belt up,' and to drive a car while over the legal
alcohol limit.
Paradoxically, despite this somewhat cavalier attitude towards motoring
offences, many company car drivers felt strongly about safety features in
cars. They appeared more interested in safety features than in security
measures.
The fitting of air bags, anti-skid breaking and side-impact protection bars
featured highly in company car drivers' aspirations. Nevertheless, Lex found
that company car drivers expected to have security features such as central
locking, car alarms and deadlocks on their cars.
In spite of recent reports about concern among women about their safety
while travelling alone, only 28 per cent of companies said they took special
measures to protect female company car drivers. Once again, the older the
fleet manager, the greater was his or her concern.
More than eight out of 10 (82 per cent) of the drivers questioned said they
would replace their car if they no longer had a company vehicle. Of these,
just under two-thirds (62 per cent) would replace their company car with a
used vehicle and 31 per cent said they would buy a new one. Most (60 per
cent) said they would buy a car of similar quality and type to the one
provided by their companies.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (3): The car becomes an
office - Mobile telephones just keep on proliferating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaving the office used to mean saying goodbye to phone, fax and computer.
In the last decade, however, technology advances, particularly in data
processing and cellular radio-telephony, have led to the birth of the mobile
office.
The mobile telephone, in particular, has quickly established itself as an
effective business tool in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Since the
introduction of cellular radio services in Britain in 1985, the number of
subscribers to the two original analogue national networks, Cellnet and
Vodafone, has grown to around 2.1m - or almost a fifth of the total 9.5m
users in Europe.
Most of these subscribers are business users, many of whom started with a
dedicated carphone but have more recently moved to handportable telephones.
Many of these lightweight pocket-sized handsets can also be used in
conjunction with a car-kit which removes the limitations of battery life and
provides better reception.
The clear advantage of hand-portables is that they travel with the user  -
not the vehicle - so they can be used almost anywhere.
Nevertheless, some large fleet buyers have continued to buy dedicated
carphones because of the substantial cost savings available with bulk
equipment purchases.
Over the past 18 months the range of mobile telecommunication equipment and
services has proliferated. In particular, the advent of digital cellular
technology has spawned a second generation of cellular networks in the UK
and Europe, and encouraged the operators of the traditional analogue
networks to repackage their services in a broader range of tariff structures
aimed at different segments of the market.
For example, the two analogue network operators in the UK now offer six
different tariffs. Both have built digital network services based on the
pan-European GSM standard - Vodafone has developed two service offerings,
Metrodigital and Eurodigital on its GSM network.
Although the uptake of these new GSM services has been relatively slow in
the UK where the analogue networks are well-established and provide superior
coverage, elsewhere in Europe, especially Germany, GSM services have grown
rapidly.
The business traveller in particular stands to gain some considerable
advantages from digital services such as GSM.
Digital services provide clearer and more reliable connections which are
also more secure from eavesdropping. By the mid-1990s GSM customers will be
able to travel throughout Europe using the same handset.
In the UK, a second set of digital services based on a sub- set of the GSM
standard dubbed Personal Communications Networks (PCNs) have also appeared.
Mercury One-2-One, the first PC service in Europe, was launched in the UK
last autumn, and Hutchison Microtel plans to launch a rival service this
month.
Elsewhere in Europe, Germany has licensed one PCN operator and France is
licensing another. It remains to be seen whether these services prove
attractive to business travellers in the longer term as PCN services were
originally envisioned as primarily urban services aimed at individual
customers.
Mercury One-2-One, which offers both personal and business tariffs, has a
limited appeal for the moment as its service availability is confined to
London and the south east, although this is being steadily extended.
This fragmentation of the cellular market has added to customers' confusion.
Already some vehicle fleet operators find they are inheriting a haphazard
collection of equipment, service contracts and billing systems.
According to Mercury Mobile Services, an independent service provider, many
corporate users do not know how many mobile phones they have or how they are
being used. To address this problem, MMS offers a 'free mobile
communications audit' and a 'consolidation service' which has been used by
corporate clients ranging from Digital Equipment to Shell, the Automobile
Association and UPS.
However, cellular telephony is not the only communications choice available
to large corporate fleet operators. Some large customers, including local
government and utilities, which only require vehicle-to-vehicle or
vehicle-base communications, have discovered that public access mobile radio
(PAMR) networks such as National Band Three (NB3) in the UK can offer
significant cost advantages.
NB3's network covers 85 per cent of the UK population and now claims more
than 45,000 subscribers ranging from transport, distribution and
construction companies to couriers, construction companies, waste disposal
organisations and security firms.
PAMR networks can also offer highly competitive mobile data services to
customers who require voice and data communications, or just data for
example to log and track fleet vehicles.
As the use of portable fax machines and 'notebook' portable computers has
grown, so too has the demand for mobile data transmission. Not surprisingly,
this can be done in a growing number of ways, for example by using modems
with the existing cellular telephone networks; by using PAMR or private
mobile radio networks; or the services of dedicated mobile data network
operators.
Generally, transmitting data over an analogue cellular system is far more
difficult than over the 'fixed wire' public telephone system. One
increasingly popular alternative is to use dedicated mobile data services
such as the Ram Mobile Data network in the UK which, like most other
dedicated mobile data networks in Europe, is based on Ericsson's Mobitex
technology.
Although mobile data services have generally grown more slowly than
expected, the expansion of mobile computing and the next generation of
portable digital assistants (PDAs) such as Apple's Newton is expected to
lead to growth by the end of the century.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (2): PAP secure despite protest votes -
People's Action Party retains a firm grip on power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL

<TEXT>
Last August, Mr Ong Teng Cheong was elected to Singapore's presidency, which
carries limited executive powers, with 58.7 per cent of the popular vote.
Most noteworthy about the poll, however, was that 670,358 people, or 41.3
per cent of voters, chose not to support the former deputy prime minister.
Instead, they voted for Mr Chua Kim Yeow, a relative unknown who was
reluctant to run - he did so in order to make a contest out of what was the
first presidential poll - and barely campaigned. He said Mr Ong was 'a far
superior candidate.'
The poll appeared to be the latest of a series of protest votes against the
People's Action Party, which has governed Singapore since the island became
independent in 1965.
This in no sense represented a crisis, since the PAP appears still to enjoy
wide popular support on key issues and retains a firm grip on power. But it
did suggest that the party needs to ensure that it stays in tune with the
views of Singaporeans, who are quite prepared to register their disapproval.
The PAP is seen as a secretive organisation, run by planners rather than
politicians, and to some extent as lacking a sense of what is important to
ordinary people.
In the last general election in 1991 - the first contested as prime minister
by Mr Goh Chok Tong - the PAP won its lowest ever share of the popular vote,
61 per cent, continuing a steady slide from a 76 per cent share won in 1980.
Opposition parties won four of the 81 elected parliamentary seats. This was
taken seriously by Mr Goh, who said then: 'In my view, life cannot be as
before. Certain things have to change now. How they will change I do not
know.'
Mr Goh, whose predecessor, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, is still an active patriarch and
Senior Minister in his cabinet, has subsequently managed to restore his
position.
Gone is his initial emphasis on more 'consultative' government, which
appeared not to play well with more conservative voters. His latest cabinet,
appointed last December, was interpreted by local analysts as further
establishing his seniority.
Also assisting him has been internal dissension within the leading
opposition party, the Singapore Democratic Party, which has three
parliamentary seats. Following its expulsion of Mr Chiam See Tong, its
founder and parliamentary leader, the party became embroiled in factional
wrangles in the courts.
Another SDP politician, Mr Chee Soon Juan, has encountered difficulties
which are more normal for the opposition in Singapore. Mr Chee, dismissed
from his post as lecturer at the National University of Singapore for an
alleged financial irregularity, was then sued for defamation by his
department head, a PAP member of parliament. In February, Mr Chee abandoned
his defence against the suit.
The US government's 1993 human rights report on Singapore says that 'the
government has used its broad discretionary powers to hinder the creation of
support organisations for the opposition parties.'
It also notes that 'the PAP attributes the lack of an effective opposition
to disorganisation, lack of leadership, and lack of alternative policy
programmes.'
According to one foreign diplomat: 'The PAP takes the view that Singapore is
a small country with limited talent available, and that it cannot afford an
opposition - it needs all the talent in government.'
However, even if the PAP faces no immediate threat, Singapore's voters have
clearly been sending it a message. Prof Chan Heng Chee, an expert on the PAP
and former ambassador to the United Nations, says that in general
dissatisfaction is not on issues of individual liberty. 'For the majority of
people, the cost of living is the burning issue.'
The costs of housing and cars have been rising sharply, although inflation
in the prices of other goods has been far less steep.
Moreover, says Prof Chan, the quality of goods and services has increased in
tandem with rising income, pushing up the cost of living.
Some Singaporeans fear that such is the speed of Singapore's development,
younger people will have ever-rising expectations but also less personal
incentive to succeed because of greater family wealth relative to that of
earlier generations.
Prof Chan says: 'There is a group of young people who would like a much more
liberal society, but they are not in the majority.' She says the average
Singaporean would have little sympathy with, for example, avant-garde
theatre companies which recently got into trouble after an actor made
himself vomit on stage after reading a local newspaper, and another cut his
pubic hair on stage.
Other analysts saw this incident, and another in which a playwright was
found to have attended a US workshop in which a Marxist was involved, as a
warning by the authorities against the raising of popular political
consciousness through cultural activities.
Prof Chan nevertheless acknowledges there will be a desire for changes in
political style and says the task will be to respond to expectations
'without weakening the fabric of society' - that is, lapsing into the sexual
promiscuity, drug use and press irresponsibility which Singaporeans see
afflicting western societies.
With Mr Goh now expected to lead the government beyond the next general
elections due by mid-1996, his more immediate task will be to ensure the
continued appearance of fresh talent in government as experienced
politicians retire.
His latest cabinet, though it involved an extensive re-shuffle, did not
introduce a single new face.
Singapore's politicians are among the world's best paid but the appeal of
the private sector and of less high-profile but still lucrative government
posts is considerable. A recent trend has been increased use of the armed
forces as a talent pool from which to draw PAP leaders.
One such leader is Mr Lee Hsien Loong - known as 'BG' (for
Brigadier-General) Lee - deputy prime minister and son of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.
Only 41, he is expected eventually to take over the reins from Mr Goh,
having apparently made a good recovery from lymphatic cancer. However he is
thought not to be as popular as his father, and will find it difficult to
follow in his footsteps.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (3): Expanding base for international
bankers - Regional centre for financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore's credentials as a regional centre for financial services have
strengthened over the past year.
In common with other south-east Asian stock markets, Singapore's has
benefited from increased demand from local investors as well as an influx of
funds from US investors awakening to Asia's rapid development. The October
flotation of 7.3 per cent of Singapore Telecom was an important step
forward. Futures trading on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange
has also grown rapidly.
Meanwhile, Singapore continues to remain attractive to international banks
wishing to establish a regional base. Foreign exchange trading is growing
and a number of foreign houses have set up international fund management
activities.
The expansion of financial services was an important factor in the island's
much faster-than-expected 9.9 per cent economic growth in 1993. Financial
services, which contribute about one eighth of gross domestic product,
enjoyed about 20 per cent growth, according to officials.
In spite of the growth of trading activities, the backbone of the financial
industry remains international banking, which began in the 1960s as a
relatively unsophisticated loan booking business and has developed steadily
since.
The Asian dollar market, in which banks have set up some 200 separate
book-keeping entities called Asian Currency Units, had a total balance sheet
of Dollars 386bn by the end of 1993, representing a modest resumption of
growth after a decline caused by Japanese banks reducing the size of their
balance sheets.
Officials say that although Japanese banks are by no means withdrawing from
the Singapore market, they have become less aggressive and less keen on
capturing market share at the expense of profitability. Therefore, pressure
on margins has eased.
Singapore-based syndicated loan business has been growing, particularly for
regional lenders, including Thailand. Banks in Singapore have even begun to
take some Chinese loan business away from Hong Kong.
Domestic banking business has also been buoyant, with growth in loans to buy
property and cars, of which prices have been rising sharply.
Foreign exchange trading, for which Singapore is the world's fourth-largest
centre after London, New York and Tokyo, grew to a daily average of Dollars
85.4bn in 1993 from Dollars 80.8bn in 1992, the Monetary Authority of
Singapore estimates. Dealing in the D-Mark, the most actively traded
currency, exceeds that of the Tokyo market where the yen dominates.
The government has been seeking to stress Singapore's attractions for
international fund managers. By the end of last year, some 83 fund
management concerns were operating, mostly foreign, and had SDollars 61.8bn
under management compared with SDollars 37.4bn in 1992, according to
monetary officials. About 20 of the concerns have funds under management of
more than SDollars 1bn.
Among recent entrants is the People's Bank of China, China's central bank,
which last year established a subsidiary in Singapore both to raise funds
and to manage the country's foreign exchange reserves.
All of this suggests that Singapore poses a growing threat to Hong Kong, its
long-time rival as an Asian hub for international financial activity.
Although Singaporean officials will not be drawn into overt competitive
statements, they quietly point to the rise of office rents in Hong Kong.
One senior official said he believed Hong Kong would increasingly be geared
to serve the booming industries of South China as the economies became more
closely linked, and that Hong Kong's role as a more international centre
would diminish accordingly.
Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, says: 'One of our objectives is to develop
truly into a capital-raising market, like Hong Kong. . . We are different
from Hong Kong in that we are much more regulated, though Hong Kong is now
moving much closer to the Singapore model. . . In the long term, they will
become more like us and we more like them.'
A particular concern of the Singapore government has been to prevent
international financial business having undue influence on the domestic
economy. Because of Singapore's small size, the government has always
believed that to allow the Singapore dollar to become an actively traded
currency would make the island excessively vulnerable to the massive ebbs
and flows of international speculation.
This policy remains, although officials admit that the growth of
international purchases of Singapore stocks may make it harder to sustain.
Nevertheless, they are confident that even if foreign funds were for some
reason to flow out of the local market, large foreign exchange reserves will
permit the Monetary Authority of Singapore to continue to intervene in the
currency markets when necessary to steer a steady appreciation of the local
currency - its most important anti-inflation tool.
The expansion of the domestic financial markets last year exposed some
frailties. The flood of orders from local investors for Singapore Telecom
shares in October, coming on top of an already huge increase in trading
volume, was too much for stockbrokers. Because they could not handle the
burden, investors were allowed to make their applications via banks'
automated teller machines (ATMs). Subsequently, they were allowed to sell
Singapore Telecom shares at bank branches.
This has led the exchange to permit a by-passing of stockbrokers which
members of most stock exchanges would find scarcely tolerable. The exchange
announced in January that because 'stockbrokers are unable to fully service
the needs of the investing public and to provide investors with alternative
means of trading,' it would introduce a new dealing system through branches
of local banks.
Investors will be able to buy and sell all scripless shares at bank branches
without opening an account with a stockbroker. They will simply need an
account with the clearing institution to hold shares, and an ATM card from
their bank which can be used instantly to check and debit or credit their
accounts. Share trading is entirely computerised - the exchange's Central
Limit Order Book (Clob) system matches buy and sell orders automatically.
One of the reasons for the interest in Singapore Telecom's privatisation was
the relaxation of controls on the Central Provident Fund, to which both
employers and employees are required to make substantial contributions.
Individuals are allowed to withdraw money from their CPF accounts to make
share and property purchases - although if they subsequently sell those
assets, the capital must return to their CPF account. After the rules were
relaxed in October, the month of the Telecom sale, SDollars 4.5bn was
withdrawn from the fund of which SDollars 4.1bn went into share purchases.
More than half the population now owns shares.
CPF funds and further privatisations (although no further large official
sales are imminent) are likely to add considerably to the depth of the stock
market - a boost which it needs even though brokers had inadequate capital
and backroom strength to handle the October rush.
Nearly half of Singapore stock exchange trading is actually in Malaysian
stocks, and in 1993 the 17 most active stocks in terms of numbers of shares
traded were all Malaysian.
However, at least some of this business is expected to drain away from
Singapore as the Kuala Lumpur exchange adopts scripless dealing. The
Singapore authorities therefore have an urgent need to deepen the market in
local stocks.
Although the market capitalisation figure has risen sharply, the 'free
float' is far smaller as the government or other large holders retain
substantial stakes in many companies. Some shares also have limits on
foreign ownership.
Peregrine, the regional securities house, estimates that of theoretical
market capitalisation of SDollars 218bn, only about 30 per cent is truly
available of which about half is owned by overseas investors.
For fund managers, it is hard to get full exposure to the Singapore economy
because a large proportion is still in the public sector and foreign
companies account for more than 70 per cent of the island's manufacturing
output.
However, listed companies have generally shown strong earnings growth and
are expected to continue to do so, underpinning what analysts see as a
promising outlook even after the past year's sharp rise caused partly by the
sudden acceleration of economic growth.
The Singapore International Monetary Exchange has established itself as a
force in its own right in the futures business. Established in 1984, its
early years were dominated by its pioneering trading link with the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. That contract expires this year but is being
re-negotiated. However, dealing in three-month Eurodollar deposit rate
futures - the main contract linked to Chicago - is now down to only about a
third of Simex volume.
Instead, the exchange is dominated by Japan-related contracts, particularly
three-month Euroyen deposit rate futures and Nikkei 225 stock index futures.
In October, Simex introduced a Japanese government bond contract to the
displeasure of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. 'We explained to them that this was
appreciated by the Managed Futures Association in the US,' says Mr Ang Swee
Tian, exchange president.
For the future, Simex is considering the introduction of more regional stock
index futures - it launched a Hong Kong index contract last year  - and is
discussing a link with the International Petroleum Exchange in London under
which it would launch a Brent crude oil contract to take advantage of
Singapore's important role as an oil refining and trading centre.

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (1): The mother of all
battles - Changes in the taxation of company cars have failed to shake their
popularity as status symbols. In Europe, the entry of Japan's three UK-based
producers has raised competition for business fleet orders to fever pitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The business car market is crucially important to all car makers. In the UK
and Germany, for example, it accounts for more than one-half of all sales.
In the past 15 months competition for business sales has reached fever
pitch, stoked up by one of the steepest downturns on record in Continental
European markets.
Although a frail recovery is now beginning, the competitive temperature is
also being raised by other factors, notably the coming on stream of two more
Japanese 'transplant' car factories - Toyota's and Honda's - in the UK.
Nissan, the first, is now well established, having first begun production at
Sunderland in the mid -1980s. But it has expanded well beyond original
projections, last year making nearly 2850,000 units and becoming the biggest
car exporter from the UK.
Toyota's and Honda's UK plants have been on stream only since the beginning
of last year and are still climbing towards their combined declared capacity
of 300,000 units a year. Yet few expect that these plants will also not be
expanded further, and in any case the EU is scheduled to become completely
open to all Japanese cars, including direct imports from Japan, by the end
of the decade.
All three know they must have a firm presence in the business car market for
their long-term viability to be ensured - and are meeting fierce resistance
from the indigenous European industry.
One of the predictable consequences is that the customers - the businesses,
partnerships and individual entrepreneurs operating an estimated 10m-plus
business cars on Europe's roads - are enjoying a buyers' market stretching
as far into the future as the industry cares to look.
Also helping to hold down prices, and driving manufacturers and their
dealers to offer business car operators an ever more extensive and
sophisticated network of support services, is the continuing sharp debate on
variations in new car prices within Europe and whether the existing system
of exclusive new car dealerships - which requires an exemption from EU
competition rules - should be allowed to continue after the exemption
expires in mid-1995.
Not surprisingly, the industry fears a retailing 'free-for-all', and has
been trying to harmonise prices and limit increases, in an attempt both to
mute the criticisms of consumer groups and to avoid upsetting Brussels while
it ponders the 'block exemption' options.
As a result, most fleet managers would appear to have little incentive to
take advantage of the creation of the EU to indulge in cross-border shopping
for cars.
The lion's share of fleet business traditionally has gone to a country's
leading indigenous, or at least very long-established, producers - in the
UK, that means Ford, Vauxhall, Rover and Peugeot. Few other manufacturers or
importers have previously managed to secure more than a one or two per cent
share each in the face of deep discounting - of 35 per cent or more in a few
extreme cases - and other inducements by the majors to retain fleet
business.
In addition, until the 'transplants' began generating significant component
and other jobs in the UK and Continental European sector, Nissan and other
Japanese companies had to contend with widespread corporate hostility to
'buying Japanese', and even Sunderland-built Nissans were proscribed from
many fleets.
But as several annual surveys of company car policies now show consistently,
this prejudice is fading fast in Continental Europe as well as the UK.
Toyota claims to be already on the 'approved' list of more than 500 sizeable
companies in the UK alone.
To raise the competitive stakes further, North American manufacturers are
also eyeing Europe's business car market as potentially fertile ground for
US-built niche vehicles such as MPVs (multi-purpose vehicles) and
recreational four-wheel-drives.
So far, however, Europe is showing no signs of imitating the US, where
company car provision is low and where leasing of cars by individuals,
rather than purchase, is gaining ground rapidly.
This is despite some gloomy prognostications in the UK, where steep rises in
company car taxation imposed from the late 1980s until last year has
prompted some industry observers and accountancy groups to suggest that many
company car drivers, if offered a cash alternative, would take it.
In reality, the company car had long been seriously undervalued for tax
purposes. And company car policy surveys undertaken since the 1993 Budget -
which claimed to have at last achieved tax 'neutrality' for the company car
 -indicate clearly that no significant decline in the company car population
is in prospect.
That will have come as no surprise to people like Mr Tony Vernon-Harcourt,
joint editor of the annual Monk's Guides to company car policies in both the
UK and Continental Europe. The perception that company cars are a peculiarly
British phenomenon is just plain wrong, he points out. They have become a
deeply-entrenched part of remuneration packages throughout Europe, with any
tax advantages they may possess forming only part of the picture.
Perceived status, the freedom from servicing and repair 'hassles', and from
the stress of buying and selling cars privately all figure high on the list
of company car 'pluses', while Monk's researches show that companies regard
their ability to offer the 'right' sort of company car as a useful weapon in
wooing talented staff away from rivals.
Just one statistic makes the point - in 10 out of the 12 countries surveyed
regularly by Monks, at least nine out of 10 general managers have an
automatic entitlement to a car.
Surveys among wide cross-sections of the business community consistently
indicate that many companies still have only a poor grasp of their true
fleet costs and how to minimise them. However, as the number of factors to
be considered multiplies, the management of company fleets becomes an ever
more demanding business.
To traditional concerns such as model choice, efficient purchasing,
replacement cycles and maintenance organisation there have recently been
added factors such as soaring insurance premiums and the requirement to take
measures against the likelihood of theft. As a result, many companies have
thrown their hands in the air and have simply surrendered their fleets to
outside management.
Thus a new catch phrase has entered the world of fleet management:
out-sourcing. Implemented to the full, it means a company simply receives a
monthly bill for everything connected with its fleet from contract hire
rentals to fuel statements.
'But outsourcing begs the question of just how far you go,' according to Mr
Geoffrey Bray, sales and marketing director of Fleet Support Group, who
maintains that it can be an unjustifiably expensive 'cop-out' by company
management.
A sobering thought for many an in-house fleet manager ..

FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (1): Relentless quest to be in the first
league - Income per head in Singapore has already topped that of some
industrialised countries - but the city-state's leaders are not complacent
about the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Singapore's remarkable development represents a challenge to western
free-market recipes for success.
The government has a dominant role in planning the island's development. It
ensures that all the conditions are in place for the island to meet its
economic goals - ranging from building physical infrastructure, to the
maintenance of social order, to obtaining the right number of graduates in
engineering or computer science.
The public sector is extensive. According to a study by the US embassy in
Singapore, 'government-linked companies straddle almost every industrial
sector, from arms-making to food processing, from steel to semiconductors,
and from robot leasing to banking and property development.'
Under its privatisation policy, the government has been careful to maintain
control - last year, for example, it sold only 7.3 per cent of Singapore
Telecom to the public. With government-linked companies and foreign
manufacturers accounting for the bulk of industrial production, the domestic
private sector has a relatively low profile.
The combination of an open trading economy, government-led development and
social stability remains appealing to foreign investors even though the cost
of operating in Singapore
has risen. Last year, new commitments to manufacturing investment from
foreign companies totalled SDollars 3.1bn, or more than SDollars 1,000 per
head of Singapore's 3m population.
Singapore's leaders, their confidence boosted by an unexpected acceleration
of economic growth to almost 10 per cent last year, are becoming more
outspoken in defending the government's prominent role in the economy and in
the management of citizens' lives.
Mr Richard Hu, the veteran finance minister, chose to re-state some of the
government's essential philosophy in his budget speech at the end of
February - delivered against a background of not only rapid growth but also
fiscal surplus, low inflation and rising productivity.
High taxes to finance heavy government subsidies would discourage hard work
and enterprise, he said. But market solutions carried to the extreme 'are
harsh on the less able who become the poor and low-income earners.' He said:
'The government cannot adopt a totally laisser faire approach, and blindly
hope that market forces will make everything work out in the end.'
Mr Hu said the government sought to ensure racial integration in housing
estates - the population is 75 per cent ethnic Chinese; 14 per cent Malay;
and 8 per cent Indian - because 'left to natural forces, people will find it
more comfortable to gravitate towards the like-minded.'
The result of such choices would be 'racial and religious enclaves, a sure
formula for social strife as we have seen in other parts of the world.'
Similarly in education, 'while the choice of courses ultimately depends on
individual applicants, we cannot passively accept these individual choices
as the final word.' Too many doctors and lawyers would mean too few
engineers and computer scientists. 'The viability of our economy will be at
risk.'
Singaporeans justify this unusually interventionist approach through
reference to the country's perpetual vulnerability as a small island, wide
open to the cycles of the world economy, with no resources except its own
people.
They have been well schooled in this approach by Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who led
the country through its reluctant independence from Malaysia in 1965 until
1990 and remains, with the title of senior minister, a powerful force in the
cabinet of Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister.
The unusual lengths to which the Singapore government goes to ensure social
order have been highlighted by last month's sentencing of Mr Michael Fay, an
18-year-old American convicted of vandalism, to six strokes of the rotan, a
heavy cane which leaves permanent scars.
The sentence provoked violent condemnation from some quarters in the US  -
even President Clinton said the punishment 'seems extreme' - although it
also received support from Americans who, writing to newspapers and
congressmen, said violence and vandalism in the US should be treated in
similar fashion.
'We believe that tough laws, enforced strictly and impartially, keep
Singapore not only clean but, more important, safe and crime-free,' said
Singapore's ambassador to the US.
Singapore's leaders insist that laws and penalties seen as tough in the west
are not controversial among Singaporeans. However, some of Singapore's elite
and leaders of the business community may be dismayed at the guilty verdict
pronounced last month on three economists and two journalists for breaches
of the Official Secrets Act. The case stemmed from premature publication of
the government's preliminary estimate of economic growth for the second
quarter of 1992.
The trial suggested that there may be growing conflict between the
government's desire to control information and its ambitious goal of
becoming a centre for information technology.
There is, however, little evidence that authoritarian government is
responsible for loss of popular support for the People's Action Party, which
has ruled Singapore since 1959. Nevertheless, the PAP, which holds virtually
all the seats in parliament, has suffered significant set-backs in elections
over the past few years.
The PAP is under no immediate threat. Opposition politicians find it
difficult to make headway against the PAP's formidable propaganda and legal
machine. The PAP has been strengthened by recent bickering within opposition
parties. However, PAP strategists are bound to be concerned at the level of
anti-government votes in most elections.
Prof Chan Heng Chee, an expert on the PAP and former ambassador to the
United Nations, believes economic development, affluence and education have
brought increased demand from Singaporeans for 'more political space,
participatory government, open government, and a step back from an
over-regulated society.'
Although they do not reject PAP government, Singaporeans 'do want to see
more opposition members in parliament,' she wrote in a paper last year. Prof
Chan says the PAP leadership understands it must moderate its style of
government. She also believes that for most Singaporeans, the main causes of
dissatisfaction are economic - such as the rising cost of living.
With costs rising and aspirations high - income per head has already topped
that of some industrialised countries - the city-state's leaders are not
complacent. They are relentlessly pursuing their goal of pushing the country
into the 'First League'.
Part of this drive is an attempt to spread Singapore's wings overseas. In a
country so dominated by the government, it is ironic to find leaders
frustrated with the lack of entrepreneurial spirit among businessmen. Mr Lee
and Mr Goh are urging them to be more venturesome in investing abroad.
The government's 'external wing' policy springs from the realisation that
Singapore's rapidly accumulating wealth can only be put to limited use at
home. At the same time, other Asian countries with lower labour costs,
especially China, are competing ever more fiercely for manufacturing
investment.
Manufacturing capacity cannot simply be shifted to cheaper countries as
Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong have done, because Singapore lacks
the home-grown companies to do this. Instead, it has opted to play to its
strengths: infrastructure, efficiency and marketing. It has gone into the
industrial parks business.
Singapore has built an industrial park nearby at Batam island in Indonesia.
It is doing the same at Bangalore in India - visited recently by Mr Goh -
and has even more ambitious plans for new towns in China - to which Mr Lee
has led several visits.
The hope must be that foreign companies will sign up for new plants in other
countries because they feel they will get treated as though they were in
Singapore: that is, with sure and speedy supply of essential infrastructure,
services and manpower.
In spite of Mr Lee's exhortation to take more risk, the foreign push is
carefully controlled. The government is prepared to invest up to a third of
its SDollars 78bn foreign exchange reserves, but the Economic Development
Board insists that every project must have a direct economic benefit to
Singapore - by which it means skilled jobs.
Mr Philip Yeo, EDB chairman, asserts vehemently that Singapore will not
become 'Father Christmas' to the rest of Asia. But with the 'external wing'
policy still in early days, the government's principal focus remains in
ensuring economic progress at home, where it has a number of concerns:
Singapore sees no economic security in leaving manufacturing to cheaper
countries in favour of becoming purely an international services 'hub'.
Therefore, it must continue to attract investment in manufacturing with the
skills and value-added appropriate to its high costs. This means moving up
the technology curve in the knowledge that products such as computer disc
drives, of which half the world's production is in Singapore, rapidly become
obsolete.
The latest hope in this direction is an EDB joint venture with foreign
companies to produce semiconductor chips. Foreign manufacturers are prepared
to accept Singapore's high costs because it is close to the markets for
their products; is stable and efficient; has manpower of sufficient skill;
and is an open economy.
Education is a primary concern, with skill levels well below those of other
newly-industrialised countries. The government is willing to borrow talent -
recent EDB advertisements in Indian newspapers for skilled professionals
attracted 18,000 responses.
The ageing of the population is the latest worry. The government takes a dim
view of spending money on old peoples' homes. Welfare policies 'take away
the responsibility of people for their own welfare, with detrimental
consequences for the family, state coffers and the competitiveness of the
economy,' according to a recent editorial in the Straits Times, which
normally reflects the official view. The government has therefore launched a
drive to promote 'family values' which include filial piety - supporting
parents in their old age.
Behind the 'family values' campaign, however, lies a deeper fear: that
Singapore's growing wealth will lead both to complacency among the young and
to greater demands for western-style liberty of the individual.
The government fears that this, in turn, would lead to the decay which it
sees in western society: sexual promiscuity, single parents, drugs,
violence. In its view, if Singapore succumbed to these problems, it would be
lost.
There is thus a defensive element in the growing role of prominent
Singaporeans in promoting 'Asian values', of which the essence is giving
general economic well-being a higher priority than individual liberty.
Mr Kishore Mahbubani, a senior foreign ministry official, writes in a recent
paper that until recently, Asians and Americans both assumed that the US had
discovered the secret of achieving a well-ordered society and that Asians
would emulate the political and economic arrangements of the US. But he
says: 'The US . . . does not appear to be a well-ordered society today.'
Urban Americans living in 'little fortresses,' frightened to go out at
night, find their personal freedom considerably reduced. This reduction, Mr
Mahbubani says, is the result of a 'mindless ideology' under which the
freedom of a small number of individuals is not constrained - for example,
through detention without trial - 'even if to do so would enhance the
freedom of the majority.'
Americans visiting east Asia, he says, 'will come to realise that their
society has swung too much in one direction: liberating the individual while
imprisoning society.'
But Singapore remains keenly aware of its need for close and friendly
relations with the US.
As a small nation in a region fraught with bilateral rivalries, it wants
Washington to remain the balancing wheel of regional security. As an open
trading economy, it needs the US to keep up pressure for reduction of trade
barriers. Most importantly, the US remains the largest export market and the
largest investor in Singapore.
Hence Singapore's enthusiastic support for Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation, the 18-member grouping whose new secretariat has been
established at the government's expense in Singapore.
Challenges to western faith in democracy reflect growing confidence
resulting from economic success. Singapore's aim in the coming years will be
to maintain the competitiveness and strong economic fundamentals which have
put it in a position to question western social and political values.

FT  18 APR 94 / UN Bosnia policy in disarray: Karadzic orders ceasefire and
3km exclusion zone around Gorazde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BELGRADE, LONDON

<TEXT>
Bosnian Serb forces edged back from the centre of Gorazde last night after
sending armour into the heart of the town and leaving in tatters the United
Nations and Nato policy of making the Moslem enclave a safe haven.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said last night that he had
ordered a ceasefire to come into force at 8am today and had approved the
creation of a 3km exclusion zone around the town.
However, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, said he remained
deeply sceptical about the Serbs' intentions. He accused Mr Karadzic of
'tactics and manipulation' and called for the resignation of Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general.
The Serb withdrawal ended a day in which UN policy seemed be in increasing
disarray. The latest advance followed almost immediately after an earlier UN
claim during talks with the Serbs that it had negotiated a ceasefire and an
agreement to deploy 350 peacekeepers in the town.
US president Bill Clinton admitted last night that the Serb advance had gone
beyond the point where air power was likely to stop it. 'It wouldn't
necessarily be possible now for close air support to have the desired
military effect,' he said. He was referring to the difficulty of bombing
heavy weapons inside Gorazde without hitting civilians.
Mr Clinton also telephoned Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and discussed
prospects for an overall ceasefire in Bosnia. However, the Moslems seem
unlikely to agree to any truce that consolidates Serb advances.
More than 20,000 residents of outlying parts of the enclave took shelter in
the town centre as Serb forces moved into position half a mile away and cut
the town in two by firing on its central bridge over the river Drina.
'In military terms, the Serbs now have Gorazde,' a UN source said. The
latest Serb moves amount to a humiliating reversal for western governments
that had declared Gorazde a safe area but have been unable to prevent its
effective capture.
Last night the UN Security Council, after closed-door talks, condemned the
'escalating military activities by the Bosnian Serb forces', particularly
action at Gorazde and Sarajevo.
At the weekend Mr Yasushi Akashi, Mr Boutros Ghali's representative in
Bosnia, suggested that UN forces might have to withdraw from Bosnia. Efforts
to deploy aircraft over Gorazde were hampered yesterday by the absence of UN
ground troops.
The latest Serb onslaught was in direct violation of promises to Mr Vitaly
Churkin, the Russian peace envoy, to observe a ceasefire. After further
talks with Bosnian Serb leaders at Pale Mr Churkin said: 'I have heard more
broken promises in the last 24 hours than I have in my entire life . . . I
hope something of what was promised is fulfilled.'
In mid-afternoon, scores of panic-stricken people poured into the local
headquarters of the UN High Commission for Refugees, saying a tank was
advancing. Later the tank edged away from the heart of the town.
Virtually all 65,000 residents of Gorazde are now crowded into the town
centre, and a UNHCR official said the food situation might soon become
critical unless there was a ceasefire.
An aid worker in Gorazde said there appeared to be a deliberate Serb policy
of herding people into such a small space that living conditions became
unbearable.
The Serbs' capture of the town will help them to establish a greater Serbia,
one of their key war aims. It will provide an uninterrupted link between
their territory in eastern Bosnia and Serbia proper. They will now be
negotiating from a position of strength, and even if a 3km exclusion zone is
observed, they will control the strategic heights outside the town.
UN troops from Britain, France, Ukraine and Egypt were last night on standby
to enter the town.
Earlier, the Bosnian Serb forces released 19 UN personnel from Canada, who
had been detained for three days in retribution for Nato air strikes. About
150 UN personnel were still being held behind Serbian lines.

Monday: UK producer price figures for March are expected to show continued
wide margins, with input prices falling by 3.7 per cent compared with March
last year and output prices rising by 2.8 per cent, substantially down from
August's 4.3 per cent peak. The median forecast for the output price index,
excluding food, drink, tobacco and petrol, points to 'underlying' inflation
of 2.5 per cent at the factory gate.
Tuesday: US merchandise trade figures for March should reveal a deficit of
Dollars 9.3bn against Dollars 9.8bn in February. French visible trade should
show a FFr4.9bn surplus.
Wednesday: Better weather should help US housing starts to rebound in March.
But the expected surge to an annual rate of 1.42m from 1.31m in February may
not last because of rising interest rates.
Thursday: Provisional figures for French consumer prices in March point to a
drop in the year-on-year rate to 1.5 per cent from February's 1.8 per cent.
Friday: UK money supply figures may show a recovery in bank and building
society lending to Pounds 1.5bn in March from Pounds 600m in February.

MONDAY 18
Hosokawa succession
Japan's ruling coalition is expected to put forward Tsutomu Hata (left),
foreign minister, as candidate for the prime ministership in a parliamentary
vote to be held this week. The vacancy follows the resignation of Morihiro
Hosokawa on April 8.
Meanwhile, Michio Watanabe, a member of the opposition LDP and a former
foreign minister, plans to form a breakaway party. His hope is that the
ruling coalition's dominant right wing may then back him for the
premiership.
EBRD meeting: The board of governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development holds its third annual general meeting in St Petersburg,
Russia (to Apr 19). It will discuss a new strategy that concentrates
resources on the private sector.
European Union foreign ministers begin a two-day session in Luxembourg. On
the agenda are financing of the EU's common foreign and security policy,
talks with Ukraine on a possible partnership and co-operation accord, and
the EU-Cyprus association council.
Strasbourg: The final European Parliament session before the European
election in June begins (to Apr 22).
Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, begins her first official visit
to Germany (to Apr 21). It intends to cement the 'very friendly' relations
between the two countries. Germany is Pakistan's third most important
trading partner and the visit includes talks with Siemens, one of several
German companies which have invested DM53m (Dollars 31m) in Pakistan and to
which Bhutto will look for more investment as she pushes ahead with
privatisation. Talks with the government are expected to centre on nuclear
weapons, Yugoslavia and Kashmir.
Hungary begins its 'small shareholders programme', an attempt to broaden
privatisation, with a public offering of shares in Sopron Brewery. On the
same day, retailer Fotex expects to complete a Dollars 100m international
equity offering, the largest by an east European company.
Chernobyl check: International Atomic Energy Agency officials are to make a
tour of inspection of the Chernobyl nuclear power station (to Apr 22). Their
visit comes after a report described the plant as unsafe. It was the scene
of the world's biggest nuclear accident, when reactor number 4 exploded 8
years ago this month.
Holiday: Zurich (markets closed).
TUESDAY 19
Arafat visits Moscow
Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, is to
visit Moscow in an effort to obtain stronger support from the Russians in
the joint US-Russian sponsored Middle East peace process.
Later in the week, Mr Arafat may hold talks with Shimon Peres, Israel's
foreign minister, during the Crans Montana economic conference both will be
attending in Bucharest.
Rights issue: An Australian parliamentary delegation begins a three-day
visit to Bougainville, the Pacific island controlled by Papua New Guinea. It
has been the scene of bloody clashes between secessionist rebels and PNG
defence forces.
Access has been negligible since the conflict escalated five years ago, and
one of the delegation's aims is to investigate alleged human rights abuses.
Airport dispute: The European Commission is due to decide whether to start
infringement proceedings against Air France for discriminating against
non-French airlines at Orly airport, Paris. The debate, which is likely to
prove controversial, has already been delayed for several weeks after the
Commission bowed to French demands that it be delayed until after Air
France's unions had voted on the airline's restructuring plans.
The UK and other member states insist Air France is abusing a monopoly
position at Orly (left), and the decision is likely to prove highly
political in the light of the other row bubbling in the Commission over the
huge state aid package the French government recently gave the airline.
Euro Disney: The heads of the loan syndicates to the troubled theme park
near Paris will this week be in tense negotiations to persuade all the
group's 61 banks to approve proposals for its FFr13bn (Dollars 2.2bn)
financial restructuring. Only four of the banks have yet to agree to an 18
month interest holiday. All 61 lenders are expected to have rubber-stamped
the rescue deal by Friday.
Swedish bond: Sweden is to auction Skr10bn (Dollars 1.3bn) of 20-year
index-linked zero-coupon bonds, starting today, and continuing on the 20th
and 22nd. It is Sweden's first issue of bonds to be linked to inflation, in
the form of the consumer price index.
FT Survey: Estonia.
WEDNESDAY 20
IMF prepares for spring
The International Monetary Fund prefaces the spring meetings of its
governors in Washington DC with the publication of its World Economic
Outlook. Early drafts suggest the IMF has upgraded its forecast for growth
among the Group of Seven countries to 2.4 per cent, against 2.2 per cent in
September, largely because of higher growth expectations for the US.
Prospects elsewhere in the G7 are uninspiring, although Britain can look
forward to growth of 2.5 per cent, in spite of this year's tax increases.
Rio Group meeting: Foreign ministers from the Rio Group, which represents
Latin America and the Caribbean, meet their counterparts from the European
Union in Sao Paulo, Brazil (to Apr 23).
Nigeria's official 'war against indiscipline and corruption' is due to start
today. The military regime promised in November an extensive purge, but
corruption probes in the central bank and the oil industry have disclosed
nothing yet.
Hanover Messe, the world's largest industrial fair, begins (to Apr 27). Some
350,000 people are expected to visit the 1m sq m exhibition area, where
6,848 assorted companies from 60 countries will display their wares.
UK unemployment figures for March are expected to show a further fall after
February's seasonally adjusted decline of 38,800. A surprise rise in January
raised doubts about the recovery, but unemployment appears to have resumed a
downward trend. Analysts predict a seasonally adjusted drop of about 25,000.
UK average earnings will be closely watched. Last month, they revealed a
slight pick-up in wage inflation. An unchanged annual rate of 3.25 per cent
is expected for February.
UK PSBR: Government borrowing figures for March and the whole 1993-94
financial year are published. Although March is traditionally a month of
high expenditure, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement is still expected
to undershoot the Pounds 50bn budget forecast. The consensus forecast points
to a March PSBR of Pounds 11.1bn, and borrowing of Pounds 45.8bn in 1993-94.
Kremlin chess contest:
The Intel chess grand prix opens in the Kremlin, Moscow, where Gary Kasparov
faces 15 challengers, including Britain's Nigel Short. Speed games, with 25
minutes for each player, will decide the Dollars 160,000 prize fund.
Follow-on tournaments are to be held in New York, London and Paris.
THURSDAY 21
Russia says no to Nato
Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, was due to sign the Partnership
For Peace today - but has now said he will not. The change of mind follows
Nato air strikes on Serb positions round Gorazde which were not co-ordinated
with the Russian side.
On Sunday, he said: 'We want a more serious and substantive agreement. . .
an agreement that will exclude unilateral actions, particularly military
ones in areas where we clearly have to co-operate.'
Crans Montana: The Romanian capital Bucharest hosts its first big
international conference since the Ceausescus fell in 1989, with the Crans
Montana Economic Forum (to Apr 24). The meeting, devoted to emerging
markets, is due to be attended by seven heads of state, 10 prime ministers
and 13 foreign ministers.
Aluminium pact: Trade delegates from some of the world's big
aluminium-producing countries meet in Brussels. They will discuss progress
following their historic agreement, reached in January, to cut world output
by between 1.5m and 2m tonnes. Western companies have announced annual cuts
of more than 900,000 tonnes, but Russia is having difficulty reaching its
objective of cuts of 300,000 tonnes by the end of April.
Kohl in Hungary: Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany visits Hungary to boost
the country's governing conservatives ahead of elections on May 8. Germany
has championed Hungary's bid to join the European Union, and Hungarian prime
minister Peter Boross will want to make domestic political capital out of
the special relationship.
Queen's Awards for Industry
The 1994 winners of the Queen's awards for export, technological, and
environmental achievement are named today. The awards
honour companies that have achieved an outstanding increase in export
earnings, an advance in the application of technology or a benefit to the
environment. They are held for five years from their announcement.
FT Survey: Queen's Awards to Industry.
UK retail sales: A disappointingly low 2.5 per cent annual growth in retail
sales in February sparked fears that consumers were curbing spending ahead
of this month's tax rises.
March figures, published today, will be watched closely by the markets for a
further indication of consumer confidence. The City consensus, for a 0.3 per
cent month-on-month increase, making the annual rise 2.7 per cent, is in
line with CBI reports of modest growth.
Holiday: Brazil (markets closed).
FRIDAY 22
Papandreou meets Clinton
US President Bill Clinton receives Andreas Papandreou, Greece's prime
minister, at the White House in Washington. The US is is expected to press
Greece to be more flexible in its dispute with its neighbour Macedonia over
its name and flag.
It is Mr Papandreou's first visit to the US since he founded the Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (Pasok) 20 years ago. Previously, he lived in the US for
25 years, and headed the economics department at the University of
California at Berkeley.
European steel: European Union industry ministers meet in Luxembourg.
Discussions will centre on the steel industry and a Commission proposal to
extend a rescue plan until November while companies finalise ways to cut 8m
more tonnes of capacity in hot-rolled products.
Saleroom: Canaletto's A Capriccio of the Scuola di San Marco in Venice is
the centrepiece of an auction of old master paintings by Christie's of
London. The work, which dates from the 1740s, is estimated to fetch between
Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m.
WEEKEND 23-24
G7 takes stock
Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven
industrial countries gather in Washington on Sunday to review economic
growth, prospects for employment, and efforts to support Russia's struggling
economy.
Their meeting - the third this year - may also focus on recent turbulence in
financial markets, following the US decision in February to raise short-term
interest rates.
Bafta awards: The British Academy of Film and Television Arts on Sunday
presents its Production and Performance Awards for the best films, actors
and television shows of the year.
El Salvador holds a run-off on Sunday in the presidential contest between
Armando Calderon Sol, of the ruling rightwing Arena party, and Ruben Zamora,
who heads a leftist coalition which includes the former FMLN guerrilla
group. Mr Calderon Sol is the favourite, after just failing to gain 50 per
cent of the vote in the first round.

FT  18 APR 94 / Equity Markets: Continued stability in sight - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street investors may have put the rough seas behind them. After safely
navigating the month's most important economic obstacles, especially the
potential hazards of last week's inflation data, stocks are picking up fresh
signals of stability from the catalytic bond market.
But a torrent of quarterly earnings to be released this week is sure to
raise a ripple or two. Disappointments could even lead to sell-offs in a
particular sector, as Motorola demonstrated last week when its results
sparked a rout in technology stocks.
'With most of the major indicators now out of the way, I see the market
continuing to stabilise,' says Mr Peter Cardillo, director of research at
Westfalia Investments.
Last week, share prices held fairly steady and activity returned to a
measured pace after a fortnight of staggering volume and sharp swings in the
key market indices. The bellwether Dow Jones industrials finished with a net
fall of 11 points on average daily NYSE volume of 271m shares, against 323m
the previous week.
But the jitters which have dominated since the Federal Reserve tightened
monetary policy for the second time on March 22 have not dissipated
entirely.
'Investors have tied themselves in knots about the economy's strength, the
inflation outlook and about the prospects of another Fed rate increase,'
says Mr James Solloway, chief investment strategist at Argus Research in New
York. He believes the market is 'extremely oversold' at present but doubts
many investors agree with him.
Mr Solloway questions the perception among many analysts that the market's
valuation remains excessive. Earnings and share prices are in line with
historical levels when special charges for restructurings are excluded from
corporate results, he argues.
Last Wednesday afternoon revealed the market's potential for upset. The
NYSE's uptick rule, which restricts programme-guided selling, was tripped
near mid-day when the Dow plummeted to a 50-point decline. The sudden drop
came amid further weakness in the US Treasury market, in a pattern that has
characterised the two-month-old 'correction' in share prices.
Stocks were rattled because bonds had fallen despite tame consumer and
producer price data. Traders were speculating that the Fed may raise
interest rates on the heels of Friday's report on March capacity
utilisation, which provides clues on long-term inflationary trends.
In the event, the data showed factories, mines and utilities had operated at
83.6 per cent of capacity, a slight gain which fell short of forecasts. The
news cleared the way for two uneventful sessions to close out the week.
Mr Solloway sees the likelihood of continued choppiness until the anxieties
over interest rates subside. There is no question the mood remains
pessimistic, he says.
But even if the market falls anew, he is confident the worst is over.

ZURICH
A busy week is in prospect for the pharmaceutical sector. Ciba unveils
first-quarter sales figures today and Roche full-year results tomorrow.
Goldman Sachs expects 1993 net profits will be towards the top end of market
expectations, which are for a 18 - 30 per cent rise. It adds that its own
estimate of SFr2.39bn, which would represent a 24.6 per cent increase, may
well be exceeded by SFr50 - 60m. On Wednesday, Sandoz details 1993 figures
and announces first-quarter sales for the current year.
PARIS
Peugeot Citroen announces 1993 results on Thursday. Kleinwort Benson
forecasts a loss of about FFr1.6bn. But it expects the group to report
earnings of FFr1.57bn in 1994 as a result of its restructuring measures, the
success of its new models, notably the Xantia and the 306, and the slight
improvement expected in the French economy. It also expects the group to
continue to outperform the market in coming months.
The Euro Disney banks expect to finalise their FFr13bn rescue package to
salvage the troubled leisure group by the end of the week.
AMSTERDAM
Nedlloyd, the Dutch shipping and road haulage group which has been one of
the Dutch stock market's best performers in recent months,
reports full-year figures on Thursday. The group, which suffered a Fl 116m
loss at the half-way stage, said then that there would be a clear
improvement in the second half, although the figures would remain negative.
MILAN
Extension of the pre-opening session on the Milan bourse to 10.30am from the
current 10.00am takes effect from today, along with other measures agreed
last week in an attempt to ease pressure on the computer system, which has
struggled to cope with the recent flood of orders. The new regime includes
alterations to accepted bid/sell ranges for shares and rules on grouping of
share orders.
TOKYO
Concern over the political situation continues, although the view is growing
that there will be no great change in economic policy, whoever becomes the
next prime minister. Investors are more likely to focus on the yen and
fluctuating global markets.

FT  18 APR 94 / Equity Markets: Hope of early base rates cut revived -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes for an early cut in UK base rates are back in force following the
March retail price index figures and the stock market faces this morning
with more enthusiasm than for several weeks past. The recent correction
appeared to blow itself out when the FT-SE 100 Index found support around
3,100. Since then, equities have tried to respond to good company news, in
particular to a stream of dividend rises, but have been balked by erratic
bond markets, which have been reacting feverishly to developments in the
Bundesbank/US Federal Reserve dramas.
Setting aside the Bundesbank's success last week in wrong-footing markets
and the anxiety over the accidental downing of US helicopters over Iraq, the
international bond market scene has not changed significantly. The shift in
sentiment has come at home, where the March inflation numbers are seen as
providing credibility for the base rate cut which markets assume the UK
chancellor of the exchequer would like to make.
Strauss Turnbull believes markets could be looking at annualised inflation
of no more than 2 per cent by next month, opening the way for a cut of  1/4
per cent in interest rates, probably around the time of the local elections
in May. Most analysts would be in agreement, although some would warn rates
will be rising again by the second half of the year.
Dividend growth figures have received a further boost now the effects of the
1993 Budget reduction in advance corporation tax credit has dropped out of
year-on-year data. Dividend growth is well on target for expectations of a 6
per cent increase for 1994, according to surveys of fund managers, or as
much as 10 per cent, according to some analysts. These trends are expected
to remain as strong in 1995.
The best performances have been seen in cyclical stocks as confidence in
economic recovery has revived. Building and construction stocks are leading
the market and have traditionally responded sharply to interest rate cuts at
home and, in the case of several leading stocks, to rate cuts in Germany.
The oil sector is now moving powerfully as some, but not all, analysts begin
to predict recovery in crude prices. With BP and Shell heavily-weighted
components of market indices, the impact on market ratings of the rally in
the oil sector will be significant.
However, any benefits to market indices of oil sector outperformance could
be counter-balanced by uncertainty in the pharmaceutical sector. After a
poor 1993, the first quarter has proved equally disappointing, with Glaxo
underperforming the FT-A All-Share Index by nearly 11 per cent, Zeneca by
over 7 per cent, Wellcome by nearly 6 per cent and SmithKline by about 2 per
cent.
The damage to drug stocks originated from poor results from the US majors
but has left the UK names highly vulnerable to specific developments.
Market recovery is likely to be highly selective.

FT  18 APR 94 / Equity Markets: End-users left behind by change in
derivatives - Risk &amp; Reward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News of further corporate losses on derivatives in the last few days has
reawakened concerns about the way companies use these complex financial
instruments.
Last week, Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products company, took a
Dollars 100m after-tax hit on two 'geared' swaps. In Japan, Kashima, a
privately held oil company, admitted it had accumulated a massive Y150bn
loss on currency derivatives.
Only a few months ago, the German industrial giant Metallgesellschaft had to
seek help from its banks after losing around Dollars 1bn on oil derivatives
trades by a subsidiary.
In the light of the recent spate of losses, the Group of Thirty's survey of
practices among dealers end-users makes interesting reading.
The G30 survey was conducted a year ago, and formed the basis of the
Washington-based think-tank's detailed recommendations on tracking and
controlling derivatives.
The survey has just been published, and although some progress in
implementing the G30 recommendations may have been made, the findings
suggest that the speed of the market's development has in some cases left
behind less sophisticated end-users.
The end-users surveyed are mainly companies, or public sector entities, with
only a small proportion - 3 per cent - of institutional investors.
According to the survey, 29 per cent of end-users said there was little
understanding of derivatives at board level. While 53 per cent claimed 'a
sufficient understanding relative to the use of derivatives' by their
organisation, only 18 per cent felt there was a good understanding.
More encouraging was the finding that 39 per cent of end-users had at least
one board member with relevant on-the-job derivatives experience.
However, below board level, 29 per cent said there was no organised training
available to management on how derivatives can be used and should be
managed.
The survey also showed up some weakness in the support functions, where 21
per cent felt the training provided was not adequate to ensure that business
is conducted effectively.
The findings among derivatives dealers themselves also left some room for
concern: 65 per cent said that their board of directors had some knowledge,
but there was a heavy reliance on the next level of management.
However, in one important area - the level of disclosure in public financial
statements - end-users are leading the way: 58 per cent state the total
notional amount of derivatives outstanding, and 51 per cent divide it by
product type.
Among the dealer community, this falls to 36 and 40 per cent respectively.
However, since the survey was conducted, there have been notable advances
led by the US banks, but filtering down to the normally secretive German
banks - perhaps in an attempt to forestall the regulatory enforcement of
such disclosure.
Another interesting revelation from the end-users is their heavy
concentration on over-the-counter derivatives: 92 per cent said they use OTC
more than exchange-traded derivatives.
Although the survey reveals some areas for concern, perhaps the most
interesting finding was the extent to which derivatives are now viewed by
end-users as an essential tool for risk management, aside from any
position-taking or profit-earning aims.
All the end users surveyed described the value of derivatives as important,
very important or even imperative (42 per cent); not one said they were of
little value or not very important.

Friday's unexpectedly good inflation numbers and the news of a short-dated
gilt auction will have increased hopes of a base rate cut as trading resumes
this week.
According to Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International
(Europe), the inflation news, which saw the underlying rate falling to 2.4
per cent in March, fulfilled only one half of the conditions for a rate cut.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the
Bank of England, will also want to see signs of a weakening recovery before
they agree to a cut.
Such signs could emerge this week, as analysts pore over Wednesday's
unemployment figures and Thursday's retail sales statistics. But the
chancellor may have a narrow window of opportunity to cut rates if he wants
to avoid being accused of a political move ahead of the May local, or June
European, elections.
The short-dated auction also prompted speculation about a rate cut.
Depending on timing, a cut would either boost the price of short-dated stock
which had already been issued, or allow the Bank to achieve a lower
financing cost.
Gilts seem to have steadied after the first quarter's falls. But a rally may
require more evidence that the latest inflation figures are not just
retrospective, but point to continued slow prices growth.

The US credit markets are likely to be dominated this week by continued
speculation over how rapidly, and by how much, the Federal Reserve will move
to tighten monetary policy again.
There is a general expectation that the Fed will raise the Fed Funds rate
from its current 3.5 per cent on May 17, at the next meeting of its
policy-making Open Market Committee. Suggestions that it might move before
then, however, have had an unsettling effect on the markets in recent days.
Treasury securities ended Friday mixed in sluggish trading after a
front-page report in the New York Times said that the Fed was sending
signals of another increase in short-term rates.
Since the market already knew this was the Fed's general intention, analysts
wondered whether the prominence of the story indicated an earlier than
expected rise.
However, the market took some comfort from industrial production and
capacity utilisation figures for March, which came in as expected, and the
benchmark 30-year Treasury issue closed the day unchanged, with a yield of
7.28, up from 7.25 the previous Friday.
This week the market faces statistics on the trade balance on Tuesday,
housing starts on Wednesday and the Federal Budget on Thursday.

<TEXT>
Following the small interest rate cuts from the Bundesbank last Thursday - a
quarter-point off both the Lombard and the discount rates, taking them to
6.5 and 5.5 per cent respectively - the bund market will this week focus on
the March money supply figures.
As Mr Adolf Rosenstock of the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt put it,
the chance to cut the whole interest rate salami will depend on the
development of broad money growth in the months ahead.
If the M3 number for March, due to be published later in the week, turns out
at less than 15 per cent, it is likely to be encouraging for the listless
German government securities market.
'Only if the indicator of long-term performance does calm down again - that
is, if M3 does not indicate a preponderant risk of resurgent inflation after
1995 - in conjunction with a strong economic recovery, will the Bundesbank
find scope for lowering rates more,' Rosenstock argues.
The green light will only be given when the trend growth in M3 is back to
around 7 per cent, he says. This would compare with the 4 to 6 per cent

FT  18 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Bundesbank cuts get lukewarm reception -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are not many tricks the Bundesbank can learn from the Bank of England,
but one useful lesson would have been to observe the unenthusiastic response
which the UK gilts market gave to the quarter-point cut in UK base rates two
months ago.
The German government bond market reacted in the same lukewarm fashion last
Thursday when the Bundesbank cut a quarter-point from the discount rate to 5
per cent, and from the Lombard emergency funding rate to 6.5 per cent.
If the Bundesbank had hoped that the unexpected timing of the cuts and its
optimistic statements about German money supply and inflation would bolster
confidence in the German government bond market, then it failed dismally,
analysts say.
'The main problem was that the Bundesbank only cut by 25 basis points rather
than its usual 50 basis points,' says Mr Reiner Back, head of fixed-income
strategy at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt. 'The market took this as a
sign that German interest rate cuts are petering out.'
The market's perception that the current interest rate cycle is close to its
bottom is reflected in the futures market, where Euro D-Mark contracts are
discounting three-month money of 5 per cent by March 1995, down from 5 1/2
per cent currently, but of 5 1/2 per cent by December next year.
'This implies that there is another 50 basis point cut to come in the
discount rate and then that's it,' says Mr Thomas Mayer, senior economist at
Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt.
Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at SG Warburg in London, believes
investors are increasingly reluctant to buy bunds because of the question
mark hanging over the durability of low German rates.
'Money-market rates look forward and therefore become detached from official
rates,' he says. For example, in March 1983 when the discount rate fell to 4
per cent, the bottom of that interest rate cycle, three-month money touched
a low of 4 3/4 per cent.
However, by September it had returned to 6 per cent, even though the
discount rate remained unchanged until the following June. 'So what is the
potential for German bond yields to improve from where they are already?' he
asks.
The lack of investor appetite for bunds is also holding back the market,
says Mr Mayer. The rise in US rates has made foreign investors less inclined
to move into bunds while domestic investors, especially individuals, feel
uncomfortable about buying bunds at current yield levels.
'The Bundesbank's small move will not unblock this situation since it was
not enough to encourage investors to buy,' says Mr Mayer.
The buyer's strike must be worrying the banks, whose holdings of bunds have
sky-rocketed since the start of the year, although last week's rate cuts
should make these holdings cheaper to finance.
According to Bundesbank statistics, banks now own DM281.9bn worth of bunds,
up from DM262.8bn at end-1993 and DM186.6bn at end-1992.
'The rise of DM20bn since the end of 1993 must surely have been involuntary
since bund prices were falling,' says Mr Mayer.
The rise in bund holdings could reflect the slowing demand for loans in
Germany, analysts say, although it is likely that the banks would be keen to
use any rise in bund prices to reduce their stockpile.
Mr Back says the positive outlook for inflation in Germany and the
Bundesbank's decision to stick with a variable rate for its repurchase
agreements should help to push bund yields lower. He forecasts that 10-year
bund yields will fall below 6 per cent by the end of the year.
Now that the Bundesbank has restored a relatively wide spread between the
discount rate and the repo rate, now at 5.70 per cent, it has room to cut
between five and 10 basis points off the repo rate this week, analysts say.
The Bundesbank's cuts last week were followed by rate cuts in Switzerland,
Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark and analysts believe that
Italy, Spain and France will soon do the same.
However, it remains to be seen to what extent European bond markets can
decouple from the US, where rates are heading higher.
Mr Ifty Islam, fixed-income analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, says the
lack of significant buying since the start of the second quarter has made it
difficult to get any momentum going. So, while it will be possible for the
German market to decouple at the short end of the yield curve, it will be
far more difficult at the long end.
Analysts say that if the Bundesbank wants to learn anything from the Bank of
England, it should copy its recent decision to publish minutes of top-level
meetings. If it did, the market would not be confused so frequently by
conflicting statements from Bundesbank council members and would have a
valuable insight into its inner workings.
But despite all its protestations of wanting to reduce volatility, perhaps
the Bundesbank enjoys playing cat and mouse with the market.

The Japanese bond market is expected to be supported by activity from
domestic institutional investors, which concluded their annual asset
allocation meetings last week.
The recent rise in bond yields have made returns on the stock market seem
low. Mr Toshiomu Uragami, chairman of the Life Insurance Association, last
week revealed that most life assurers will maintain a cautious stance toward
stock investment and will increase allocations to the domestic bond market.
Investors are likely to focus on February household spending data to be
announced in the latter half of the week as the figures are likely to
confirm the recent trend of growing consumer spending.
Meanwhile, political wrangling over the shape of the next government has had
little impact on bond prices, since most investors reckon that whoever
becomes the next prime minister after Mr Morihiro Hosokawa is unlikely to
change overall economic policy drastically.
Mr Mikio Fujii of Nomura Securities, says if Mr Michio Watanabe, former
foreign minister, is chosen, the bond market may briefly fall since he is
seen as a fiscal expansionist, but if Mr Tsutomu Hata is elected, the market
may be in for a short rally since he was finance minister when the stock
market plunged to a six-year low in 1992.

FT  18 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Reversal seen in Ecu underperformance -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fixed-income analysts are exhorting investors to buy Ecu bonds, arguing that
their underperformance during recent months of turbulence is about to be
reversed.
'Ecu bonds are cheap,' declares Mr Steve Major, senior bond analyst at
Credit Lyonnais Euro-Securities.
'We have a very rare situation which should make investors sit up and pay
attention,' echoes Mr Bob Tyley, senior strategist at Paribas Capital
Markets.
What makes Ecu bonds so attractive, they say, is that their yield spread
over German government bonds (bunds) has widened significantly. Similarly,
the gap between theoretical and actual Ecu bond yields is now close to flat,
and they expect the actual yield to recede below its theoretical counterpart
in coming weeks.
The theoretical yield is the yield which would result from constructing a
synthetic Ecu bond from the underlying constituent markets. The actual yield
is that earned from Ecu bonds trading in the market.
On Friday, the theoretical 10-year Ecu yield stood at 7.01 per cent,
compared with the 7.00 per cent actual yield on the benchmark Ecu bond. In a
normal market, the actual yield tends to trade around 20 to 25 basis points
through the theoretical yield.
Meanwhile, the 10-year Ecu benchmark yields about 60 to 65 basis points
above its German counterpart, and analysts say it could narrow to around 30
 -40 basis points in coming months.
According to Mr Tyley, the sector's weakness is not due to negative factors
pertaining to the market itself, but rather, to the Ecu having fallen by the
wayside during recent bond market turbulence.
'In volatile market environments, the Ecu market tends to be neglected,' he
says. 'Investors have enough to do trying to cope with the volatility in
their domestic markets, before worrying about the Ecu.'
Currency considerations are a further attraction, says Mr Major. If the
dollar rises to DM1.80 over the next three to six months, the Ecu/D-Mark
cross should rise to above DM1.95, from the current level of around
DM1.9350, he says.
'This should provide the opportunity for a significant increase in total
return for D-Mark-based investors and is a strong argument for increasing
exposure to the Ecu sector.'
Supply poses little threat, traders say. Last week saw Ecu1.2bn of Ecu
Eurobond issuance, spurred by arbitrage opportunities and a slight increase
in demand.
'We've seen some demand from investors - especially in the Far East - who
want exposure to Europe but don't feel confident to pick individual European
markets,' said one trader.
Some say that massive Ecu bond redemptions will facilitate the absorption of
new supply. Some Ecu14bn in bonds mature this year, and while those funds
won't necessarily all flow back into the Ecu market, retail investors have a
propensity to reinvest in the same currency, says Mr Tyley.
Nevertheless, many investors appear to be holding back in the face of more
near-term issuance. 'We've had some investor inquiries, but they know
there's more supply' in the pipeline, reports Mr Hans Knol ten Bensel,
Eurobond manager at Kredietbank in Brussels.
The UK is set to issue an estimated Ecu500m of 5 1/4 per cent notes due 1997
tomorrow and Spain is rumoured to be planning an Ecu1bn - 1.5bn bond over 10
to 15 years in coming weeks.
Moreover, investor confidence is still shaky, and likely to stay that way as
long as uncertainty over the direction of US interest rates keeps bond
markets jittery, says Mr Knol ten Bensel.
Until confidence in the longer end of the US and European yield curves
revives, he expects investors to keep their money in short maturities, which
stand to benefit most from further European interest rate cuts.
Meanwhile, a proposal floated late last year by the Commission of the
European Union to issue bonds to finance European infrastructure projects,
is dying a slow death after running into opposition from some EU member
states. 'The whole idea was not very well thought through and should be left
to die its natural death,' said a banking source.
The EU expects to borrow about Ecu4.5bn this year for projects which have
already been approved.

FT  18 APR 94 / Emerging Markets: Ashanti Goldfields offer assured of
success - The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A last-minute agreement to convert government liabilities to public sector
workers into shares in Ashanti Goldfields Corporation seems to have assured
the success of the Ghanaian public offer of the Ashanti flotation, the
latest privatisation on the fast-growing Ghana stock exchange.
It is estimated that the conversion to shares of the government's debts to
staff, dating back to the presidential elections in October 1992, has
accounted for sales of Dollars 15m to Dollars 20m, while shares worth
between Dollars 18m and Dollars 25m have been bought for cash by
institutions and private investors.
Some 10,000 AGC employees are to receive five free shares each in the
flotation.
Even the local element of the Ashanti flotation is so large that its effect
on the Ghana stock exchange is hard to forecast.
The Ashanti shares to be offered exclusively to the Ghanaian market will be
worth at least Dollars 68m, equivalent to 37 per cent of the Accra stock
market's total capitalisation (about Dollars 180m at the end of March) prior
to the flotation.
Since only 43 per cent of the market capitalisation is owned by Ghanaian
public portfolio investors, the two local Ashanti offers will almost double
the amount of shares which are actually available on the stock exchange.
The total initial value of Ashanti shares in the flotation is at least
Dollars 368m. But the majority will be traded on the London stock exchange,
and some Ghanaian investors may take a quick profit by selling Ashanti
shares on the London market if they show a premium after dealing begins on
Tuesday.
The first Ghanaian public offer makes up about 3 per cent of Ashanti's new
capital. But priced at between Dollars 17 and Dollars 20 a share it is worth
about 10 per cent of total bank liquidity in Ghana, a large amount of
savings for a nation whose investors are mainly unfamiliar with the equity
market.
A further 1.4 per cent of AGC stock will be open to Ghanaians in the fixed
price offer in May.
Brokers are pleased with the outcome. 'I think it was a clever move,' said
Mr Ken Offori-Attah, head of Databank Brokerage, which produces the Accra
market share price index.
'It helps the government to achieve its objective of widening the investor
base of this market, as there are over 100,000 civil servants who could have
bought stock.'
But Mr Miles Morland, of Blakeney Management in the UK, believes that the
government, advised by James Capel and Morgan Grenfell in London, should
have offered the local shares at a discount to the international price.
'The Ashanti flotation was tailored mostly for the big foreign institutions.
But it could have created greater interest among the Ghanaian public, most
of whom have not previously bought shares,' he says. 'Incentives were needed
to attract domestic investors, which is what this market really needs to
sustain growth.'
That growth has been phenomenal.
The Databank index gained over 60 per cent last year in dollar terms. And in
the first quarter of this year the index has risen by nearly 70 per cent
after devaluation of the local currency, the cedi.
Leaders among the 15 listed stocks, including Kumasi Brewery, Mobil,
Standard Chartered and Unilever, are putting on 5 per cent a week, according
to Databank.
The rise is based partly on the profits growth of the 15 quoted companies,
mostly subsidiaries of multinationals. It also reflects foreign investors'
interest in an emerging market which is one of the few good prospects in
sub-Saharan Africa.
In 1993 the profits of Standard Chartered Ghana rose by 70 per cent, showing
the best return on capital anywhere in the banking group, while profits
growth of Unilever Ghana was 33 per cent and Guinness Ghana 76 per cent.
Before the market became international last year, share prices in Ghana were
well below net book value, with an average price earnings ratio of 8.7.
'Ghana is still one of the cheapest markets in the world and that is what
will continue to attract foreign investors,' said Mr Morland.
'But it needs a healthy domestic investor market, and that depends partly on
whether the government can get the macro-economic management right.'
The performance of the 15 listed companies tells only half the story.
As public spending rose out of control, finance minister Mr Kwesi Botchwey
raised interest rates and is trying to bring down inflation. This in turn is
squeezing the smaller companies which must form the basis of Ghana's
expected economic growth. This has been underpinned by large inflows of aid
sponsored by the IMF's backing for Ghana's stuctural adjustment programme
and the country's recent political stability.
International investors took all of the Dollars 25m of government stock in
seven listed companies which the state divested in a placing in February,
handled by Databank and initiated by Blakeney Management.
The placing has been criticised because no stock was offered to Ghanaian
investors, including the multinationals who held a large part of the other
shares.
Databank argues that the deal gave the market a big lift when Ghanaian
investors saw that offshore funds were prepared to invest that heavily. The
government has accepted some of the criticism and is to offer the remaining
Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m of shares in the seven stocks still in government
hands to the public this week.
Under pressure from the World Bank, the government says it will speed up its
privatisation programme and has retained UK consultants to help the
Divestiture Implementation Committee.

FT  18 APR 94 / Emerging Markets: Focus on lower German interest rates -
Currency Markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges are likely this week to be concerned with the impact of
last Thursday's unexpected cut in official German interest rates.
Particular attention will be paid to the effect the easing of credit policy
has on the repo rate, which the Bundesbank uses to set the level of German
money market rates.
The pace at which Germany cuts rates is crucial in determining the pace at
which other European countries can ease monetary policy.
Some analysts predict that the repo could fall to 5.6 per cent or lower,
from 5.7 per cent, at this week's auction. Others believe that the
Bundesbank is not moving fast enough in lowering rates.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, comments: 'The
Bundesbank's failure to signal any reduction in the key repurchase rate
indicates a reluctance to accelerate the pace at which (it) is guiding money
market interest rates lower.'
The concern is that high German rates maintains pressure on former hard core
ERM currencies, like France and Denmark, which have high unemployment and
low inflation.
The Bank of France is expected to cut rates, assuming a decent fall in the
German repo rate. Italian rates are also likely to come down once a new
government is in office.
The Italian lira could, however, come under selling pressure if there are
delays in forming a new government. A squabble last Friday about appointing
the speaker in the senate led to lira sales.
A number of important UK data will be released this week, including March
retail sales, the CBI's distributive trades survey, unemployment and
producer price inflation. The retail sales figure will be closely watched
for any hint which it provides of the impact of tax rises on consumer
spending.
Collectively, the data could provide support for a further lowering of rates
in the UK, but few observers expect a rate cut before mid-May.
Attention will also be focused on the political turmoil in Japan. There is
little clarity about who will be the new prime minister, or what the impact
of change might be for financial markets.
Continued lack of progress in resolving the trade dispute with the US has
led an increasing number of analysts to predict that the dollar will fall to
record lows against the yen, below Y100.
The failure of concerted dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan, bolstered
last week by the Bundesbank, to lend support to the US currency, has further
soured sentiment.

Polish equity investors breathed a sigh of relief at the end of last week
when price falls slowed on the Warsaw bourse following the removal of 10 per
cent price limits in force since the exchange was established three years
ago, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
However, uncertainty remains as to what the market will do over the next two
sessions when prices remain free before the limits are reintroduced.
The first day of free trading brought a 6.7 per cent fall in the WIG index,
52 per cent down from the market's March 8 peak.
Mr Andrzej Skowronski, the head of Elektrim, a listed company which has seen
its market value shrink from 16,020bn zlotys to 8,580bn zlotys in the past
four weeks and was planning to raise some Dollars 50m through a forthcoming
rights issue to finance further purchases of state sector companies, said on
Friday it was too early to reassess Elektrim's strategy. 'But if we get less
money from the issue then we'll simply buy less plants,' he said.

HUNGARY
Hungary today starts its mass privatisation programme with the opening of a
public offering of state shares in Soproni Sorgyar, the country's third
largest brewery, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
The State Property Agency, the privatisation authority, is tendering its 37
per cent shareholding in Soproni, worth Ft1.9bn (Dollars 18m) at the issue
price of Ft3,800 a share.
Two fifths of the issue, which is lead managed by brokerage CA Securities,
is open to cash investors, including foreign institutions. But the largest
tranche, three fifths of the entire amount, is reserved for sale to small
investors on strongly preferential terms through Hungary's new 'small
shareholder programme'.
The programme is open to adults paying a token Ft2,000 'entrance fee' and
entitles them to buy shares worth up to Ft100,000 and spread payment over
five years.
MUTUAL FUNDS
The recent poor performance of many emerging markets appears to be dulling
US investors' appetite for mutual funds which invest in developing
countries, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. Last week, for example,
Morgan Stanley postponed a Dollars 60m offering of shares in its new
European Emerging Markets Fund, citing unfavourable market conditions.
This follows recent declines in prices of publicly-quoted emerging market
country funds, including two - an Africa fund and an India fund - launched
in February by Morgan Stanley that now trade at considerable discounts to
net asset value.
THAILAND
Thailand's Association of sub-brokers is to appeal to the stock exchange to
lower the Bt350m (Dollars 14m) entrance fee it proposes to charge for each
of the four new brokerage seats it is adding to the existing 40 seats,
writes William Barnes in Bangkok.
The fee is nearly Bt50m more than previous controversial fees obtained when
seats were distributed by competitive bidding, but stock exchange officials
say the volume of trading has grown sharply.

FT  18 APR 94 / Markets: Zulus and platinum prices - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Fresh outbreaks of political violence seem likely in South Africa over the
next few days, ahead of next week's first all-race elections. Zulus
demanding tribal autonomy are promising mass protests in the streets of
Johannesburg from today. The last time they did so 53 people died.
Such a turbulent political backdrop might appear to spell sharply higher
precious metal prices. Yet as tension has mounted in South Africa over the
past few weeks, and attempts to negotiate a settlement with the Zulus have
failed, the prices of gold and platinum have been notably subdued.
Both enjoyed a brief run-up in early April but since then have fallen back,
and expectations of a sustained surge over the coming weeks are probably
misplaced, provided that Mr Nelson Mandela, the republic's leader in
waiting, remains in good health.
South Africa now produces only 20 per cent of the world's gold, thanks to
sharply rising output in Australia and the US, and newly mined gold only
adds a small fraction to the world's supply of the metal, which is largely
stockpiled. Temporarily South African supply problems need not, therefore,
have a dramatic effect on prices.
South Africa's gold mines, moreover, which are nowhere near the worst
political trouble spots in Natal province, are insulated by security
cordons, and Zulus account for a very small percentage of their workforce.
So any large disruption of supply is unlikely.
Platinum is a little different. South Africa produces 75 per cent of world
supplies and the Soviet Union accounts for the bulk of the remainder. Most
of the platinum mined each year is consumed immediately by industrial users,
notably vehicle manufacturers for catalytic converters.
Its price is therefore closely tied to potential South African supply and
the economic cycle, particularly in Japan, which accounts for about 55 per
cent of global demand.
Mr Andy Smith at UBS in London considers that more than 70 per cent of
changes in the spread between platinum and gold since 1986 can be explained
by the discount of the financial Rand to the commercial Rand (a proxy for
South African 'supply shock') and by movements in the Nikkei stock index (a
proxy for Japanese demand).
The sharp rise in platinum prices early this year may have been due partly
to precautionary Japanese buying, but much of it seems to have been driven
by commodity funds speculating in the futures markets.
The drop in the platinum price over the past few weeks seems due in no small
measure to commodity funds liquidating their holdings ahead of the election,
and there seem to be few fundamental reasons for a rapid rise.
The re-intregration of the Bophuthatswana homeland, a leading source of
platinum, into South Africa in February removed the main risk to the
Republic's supply. South African production of the metal is expanding, and
so is recycling.
However while there may not be much sustained upward pressure on platinum
prices over the next few months, 1995 and 1996 could be a different matter.
By then, the Japanese economy should be well on the mend, and the honeymoon
of South Africa's new multi-racial government could well be fading.
US technology stocks
This week could be a very bumpy one for US technology stocks as a raft of
the sector's leading companies produce first quarter figures, including
Intel and Microsoft (today) and IBM (Thursday).
Technology stocks have been among the US market's strongest performers
recently but the sector has been in a nervous state since a sharp drop in
prices across the board last week, when Wall Street took fright at what
appeared to be a series of relatively innocuous events.
The primary catalyst was first quarter earnings from Motorola, which were 46
per cent up on last year, but 1 cent per share shy of Wall Street's mean
expectation. The stock fell 10 per cent in two days, even though Motorola is
one of the strongest companies in the sector. It has a broadly diversified
product line and dominates the wireless communications market, which is set
for explosive growth, both in the US and internationally.
The anxiety over Motorola was compounded by the semi-conductor industry's
report of a book to bill ratio (orders to product shipped) of 1.13 for
March, which was healthy and unchanged from February. However it was below
Wall Street expectations, which ranged as high as 1.2. On Friday Digital
Equipment saw 20 per cent knocked off its share price when it reported
losses which were much heavier than expected.
Digital, struggling to adapt belatedly to a shift in demand from large
systems to personal computers, is something of a special case, and there is
no obvious explanation for the market's general disenchantment with
technology.
As much as anything, it seems to be due to the puncturing of excessively
high expectations and fear that US industry's sharply increased spending on
high technology capital equipment could start to reach a plateau.
Motorola, for example, seems to have been punished partly because it has
established a tradition of consistently beating the market's earnings
forecasts. Merely matching them is a disappointment, and that could spell
trouble for other companies reporting less than stellar figures this week.
Corn and beans
The television news pictures have a depressing familiarity from last year.
Heavy rains have again brought flooding to parts of the agricultural
mid-west, reviving memories of last year's Mississippi floods, which sent
the price of agricultural commodities sharply higher. So far, however, the
deluge has had little effect on the price of corn and soybeans, the two
crops most affected by the floods of 1993.
This is partly because planting has yet to start, but also because
meteorologists are predicting that 1994 will not see a repetition of last
year's severe flooding. The outbreaks so far are isolated and the
forecasters are predicting normal precipitation over the next month.
Corn prices, which have risen more than 20 per cent since the start of 1993,
and soybeans, up 13 per cent, look like remaining robust for the next few
months. However if the meteorologists are correct they could come under
substantial downward pressure as harvest time approaches.
That is because farmers are planning to plant nearly 140m acres of the crops
this year, the highest in almost a decade, and the Federal government has
put a one year hold on its programme under which farmers have to idle land
to qualify for crop subsidies. It is anxious to rebuild grain stocks which
have fallen to their lowest level since the 1970s because of last year's
flooding.
Better harvests around the world mean that US exports of oilseeds, feed
grains and wheat could be down 15 per cent this year, which should also put
downward pressure on prices.
All this, of course, assumes the heavens do not stay open. But statistics
are on the farmers' side. In the past century the mid-west has never had two
torrential springs running.
South Korea
The South Korean Government, which sold an initial 10 per cent of
state-owned Korea Telecom to domestic buyers last autumn, is due to auction
another 5 per cent today and tomorrow under a plan to reduce its holding to
51 per cent by 1996.
Despite a strong supply of new offerings in the Seoul market, the issue is
expected to sell well, given the company's commanding position in the sector
and the very positive outlook for the Korean economy.
At a time when most emerging markets have been badly caught in the backwash
of rising US interest rates, the Korean Composite stock market index is up
nearly 3 per cent on the year and appears to be in the middle of a solid
bull run, helped by sharply rising earnings and plentiful liquidity.
North Korean nuclear threats are a wild card, but could prove the blustering
forerunner of reduced political tensions on the peninsula.
The problem for foreign investors is getting enough of the market, given
Government restrictions on overseas stock ownership. However there are signs
Seoul could ease controls in the second half of the year.

FT  18 APR 94 / The Markets: Harnessing brainpower to the demands of the
market - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is becoming a cliche that the most successful economies of tomorrow will
be those which can best harness their brainpower to generate economic
growth.
With the global economy being transformed by revolutionary changes in
information and communications technologies and rapid progress in
biotechnology, advanced automation and the development of new materials, it
comes as no surprise that governments are taking a greater interest in
research and development.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in its most
recent annual review of its members' industrial policies, reported that many
advanced industrialised nations have 'placed renewed emphasis on the
research and new product end of intangible investment' with the aim of
expanding high-skilled job opportunities and economic growth.
In his February budget, Mr Paul Martin, the Canadian finance minister,
announced a shake-up in research and development spending as a first step to
creating a new national science and technology strategy. Australia, for many
years a laggard in terms of research spending, has managed to generate rapid
growth of business sector R&amp;D through a special tax concession that was
introduced in 1985 and confirmed in August 1992. In the US, according to the
OECD, industrial policy is being focused to a large extent on the structure
and quality of research and development and how it can be harnessed for
civilian uses.
However, while it may seem obvious that technical progress should result in
economic growth, it is not so clear from an economist's point of view. World
Bank studies of east Asia have stressed the importance of other factors such
as good basic education, flexible labour markets and government policies to
encourage savings and infrastructure investment as ingredients in the rapid
and sustained growth of countries in the region.
Technological progress was important but this took the form of the
absorption and improvement of foreign knowledge rather than home grown
research and development. Perhaps for this reason, the east Asian 'tiger'
economies of Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan appear fairly low down the
international league table for scientists and engineers engaged in R&amp;D, as
shown in the accompanying illustration.
At the other extreme is Israel, which, in spite of being outside the OECD
group of advanced industrial countries, has nearly twice as many people
working on research and development per 10,000 of the labour force as the US
or Japan. According to Israeli government figures, the country spends 3 per
cent of its gross domestic product on research and development, which is
more than the US or any of the other Group of Seven leading industrial
countries.
To be sure, Israel is a special case. The country had to invest heavily in
military R&amp;D in the 1960s and 1970s to ensure its survival. On those
foundations, it has developed a science-intensive industry that is
especially geared to competing in export markets.
Government involvement has been considerable since 1985, when a law was
passed to encourage industrial R&amp;D. A government department - the Office of
the Chief Scientist - disburses grants ranging from 20 to 66 per cent of
approved R&amp;D expenditures. Its annual budget doubled to Dollars 230m between
1990 and 1993, and spending is due to increase by a further 30 per cent this
year.
The arrival since 1989 of 550,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union
has triggered a further official boost to research and development. More
than a quarter of the new arrivals between 1990 and 1992 were scientists and
technologists. To give these people useful employment, the government is
supporting a network of technological 'incubators' in which fledgling R&amp;D
companies are 'adopted' and given logistical and administrative support by
established institutions such as universities or research centres.
The state typically provides each project with about Dollars 100,000 a year
for two years to cover the start up period when risks are very high. The
incubators have more than 200 projects in hand. These employ more than 1,000
scientists and engineers of whom almost 80 per cent are new immigrants.
It is doubtful whether the Israeli system, with its special history, should
be seen as a model for other countries. But it has achieved results. The
Chief Scientist's income from royalties from commercially successful
innovations is rising steadily: from Dollars 14m in 1990 to Dollars 32m last
year. According to government figures, Dollars 4.5bn of a total of Dollars
8.8bn of manufactured exports in 1992 were products that had their origin in
the country's R&amp;D effort.
However, a successful research-based international trade performance depends
on more than the amount of R&amp;D spending. Research has to be geared to the
demands of the market, a point that is underscored by Canada's proposed
refocusing of R&amp;D spending and its planned withdrawal from such prestige
projects as a particle accelerator and international space station.
The ability to turn research-based products into manufactured goods is
vital. The ability to mobilise capital from domestic and international
sources to develop products is equally important. Marketing cannot be
ignored.
The Israeli experience, however, seems to back up the OECD's argument that
'expenditure on physical investment and on research and development in the
business enterprise sector plays a crucial role in determining the relative
competitiveness of countries in the medium and the long term'.
In that case, the chart - showing how business sector R&amp;D in the
industrialised world has slowed - should give policy makers pause for
thought. If, as the OECD maintains, there is now a renewed interest in R&amp;D
among its member countries, it is not before time.

FT  18 APR 94 / International Company News: Iberia in agreement with United
Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iberia, Spain's government-owned national airline, has announced a
preliminary, wide-ranging commercial agreement with United Airlines.
The accord is modelled on the recent undertaking between the US carrier and
Germany's Lufthansa to co-operate over flight routes, ticket sales and
promotion.
The Iberia agreement will give United Airlines an increased share of the
Latin American market, where American Airlines is the dominant US carrier.
The Spanish airline has built up a strong position in Latin America through
its shareholdings in Aerolineas Argentinas, which is 85 per cent owned by
Iberia, and in Chile's Ladeco and Venezuela's Viasa.
Iberia, which has sustained heavy losses in recent years, in part because of
its Latin American investments, is likely to seek a participation by United
Airlines in the Aerolineas shareholding.
Iberia said that it will also be downgrading its presence in Miami, where it
operates a hub for Central American connections, and turning over most its
business there to the US carrier.
The agreement will allow Iberia's transatlantic passengers access to the
United Airlines network in the US and extend reciprocal services to United
Airlines passengers travelling on to destinations in Southern Europe.
In this sense it complements the agreement with Lufthansa that is weighted
towards the German airline's network of routes in Northern and Eastern
Europe.
Full details of the Iberia-United Airlines pact, the first such
international agreement ever undertaken by the Spanish airline, are due to
be announced in June.
Iberia is, meanwhile, understood to be conducting negotiations over a
possible sharing of European routes with Lufthansa, United Airlines' other
European partner.

FT  18 APR 94 / International Company News: Genentech profits more than
doubled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Genentech, the San Francisco-based bio-technology group, reported
first-quarter earnings more than doubled, thanks to initial sales of two new
products and increased sales of products already on the market.
The company, in which Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical group has a majority
stake, reported earnings of Dollars 38.9m, or 33 cents a share, up from
Dollars 14.3m, or 12 cents a share, in the same period of last year. Sales
rose from Dollars 153m to Dollars 198.9m.
The figures, released on Friday, were below analysts' highest forecasts and
the share fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 44 1/2 on profit-taking.
The two new products launched in the quarter were Nutrpin, a human growth
hormone, and Pulmozyme DNase for treating cystic fibrosis. Pulmozyme
produced sales of Dollars 22.4m.
Sales of the group's two growth hormone products rose 3 per cent to Dollars
53.6m.
Sales of Activase, the clot-dissolving drug for heart treatment, rose 43 per
cent to Dollars 70.2m.
Upjohn, the pharmaceutical group, reported first-quarter net earnings of
Dollars 135m, or 74 cents a share, compared with Dollars 133.4m, or 73
cents, in the same quarter last year.
Operating revenues totalled Dollars 915.9m, compared with Dollars 918.2m,
while operating income fell from Dollars 183m to Dollars 168.6m.
Mr John Zabriskie, chairman, said the sales and earning performance had been
achieved despite intense generic competition against several key products.
There was a Dollars 68m drop in sales of the anti-anxiety agent,
Xanax/alprazolam, due to increased generic competition.
Warner-Lambert, the pharmaceuticals and healthcare products group, told an
analysts' meeting on Friday that it expected to achieve a 5 per cent
increase in earnings per share to Dollars 1.42, against Dollars 1.35 last
year, when first-quarter results are released tomorrow. Sales should be up
11 per cent. Analysts' earnings expectations were pitched around Dollars
1.38 a share.
Mr Melvin Goodes, chairman, said that for the full year the company expected
a double digit sales increase and an earnings gain of at least 8 per cent,
excluding restructuring charges and accounting changes.

FT  18 APR 94 / International Company News: Groupe Schneider sees benefits
of lower debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe Schneider, the French electrical engineering and construction group,
raised net profits by 33 per cent to FFr405m (Dollars 69.46m) last year as
lower debts reduced financial charges and operating margins resisted
Europe's recession.
The group, which was last year merged with SPEP, the holding company which
is Schneider's principal shareholder, also expressed optimism about 1994.
'The activity of the group should benefit from the gradual improvement in
the European economy, from a clearer recovery in the US and from continued
growth in Asia,' the company said.
Last year's result was achieved on a decline in turnover from FFr59.66bn to
FFr56.38bn. Most of the fall came from the Enterprise arm, which includes
the three main activities of the loss-making Spie Batignolles division.
Losses at Spie Batignolles were reduced last year, from FFr275m in 1992 to
FFr215m, reflecting the impact of cost-cutting measures introduced in 1992.
Improvement was limited, however, by slower than anticipated sales of real
estate.
According to Schneider, the principal factors behind the rise in profits
were the reduction in debt and the resilience of profit margins. Net debts
were reduced by about 40 per cent to FFr10.9bn at the end of the year,
following the sale of non-strategic assets worth about FFr2bn.

Mayr-Melnhof (MM), the family-controlled Austrian carton board and packaging
group, will raised about Sch3.2bn (Dollars 270m) through the planned
flotation of the shares.
About 4.4m shares will be offered to investors at Sch720 per share, leaving
the family with two thirds of the capital.
Three-quarters of the shares are expected to be placed internationally and
the rest in Austria. MM is the leading European producer of recycled carton
board, the second largest converter of folding cartons and holds a leading
position in the waste paper industry in Austria and Germany.
The proceeds from the issue will help finance acquisitions and further
expand the group's operations in Europe. MM has production facilities and
subsidiaries in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, and Britain,
as well as in Austria.
The offer will be split between 4m ordinary shares, with another 400,000
shares reserved as options for the underwriters.

FT  18 APR 94 / International Company News: Digital Equipment losses raise
questions of control - A look at the US computer group's shock decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of a short-term recovery for Digital Equipment, once second only to
International Business Machines in the computer market, have been dashed
with the company's report of far larger than expected third-quarter losses.
Digital stunned investors on Friday by reporting third-quarter losses of
Dollars 183.3m, or Dollars 1.34 a share, about four times higher than
analysts' projections. Revenues fell 6 per cent to Dollars 3.26bn.
Worse, Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive of the computer
company, acknowledged that he too had been taken by surprise by the
'unacceptable' results, raising serious questions about financial controls.
Only nine months ago, Digital appeared to be on the road to recovery. After
three years of heavy losses, the company reported a modest quarterly profit.
A broad restructuring, initiated by Mr Palmer soon after his appointment in
1992, was cutting costs, and a new line of computers based on Digital's
powerful Alpha microprocessors promised revenue growth.
Optimism began to fade, however, as Digital reported losses for the first
and second quarters of fiscal 1994 (ending in June). Now the heavy
third-quarter losses have made it painfully clear that Digital's problems
are far from being solved.
Confidence in Mr Palmer has been shaken. 'There are no excuses' for the
company's disappointing performance, he acknowledged. 'In one critical
dimension, that of profitability, we are not succeeding.'
Like IBM, Digital is struggling to adapt to fundamental changes in the
computer market. The company is in the midst of a product transition from
its proprietary VAX minicomputers to a new generation of 'open systems'
products that adhere to industry software standards.
Digital's new 'Alpha' products have been well received, with sales more than
doubling from the second to third quarters. It has also made remarkable
progress in the personal computer market, rising from the ranks of 'also
ran' to the Top 10 in the past two years.
It is apparent, however, that these successes have masked a sharp decline in
gross profit margins on product sales, down almost 10 percentage points in
the third quarter from the same period last year.
Gross margins on a new Alpha computer are 6 to 7 per cent lower than on a
similarly priced VAX minicomputer, Mr Palmer explained.
Thus, as sales of the new products increase and those of the older VAX
products decline, Digital's profit margins will continue to erode. Expanding
PC sales, with even lower margins, are exacerbating the problem.
Digital's third-quarter results revealed another serious problem in its
services business, which until now has provided a stable source of revenues
and profits. Service revenues in the quarter fell 11 per cent to Dollars
1.5bn. As Digital's customers replace older equipment with more reliable
products, particularly new data storage systems, demand for high-margin
maintenance agreements is diminishing, Digital said.
Gross margins on the service business fell by 1.6 per cent in the third
quarter, signalling that Digital's cushion against profit declines on
product sales may be thinning.
Mr Palmer said that Digital will accelerate its current restructuring plans
to cut costs, with 7,000 jobs now expected to be cut by the end of the
fiscal year in June.
By then, he said, Digital will come up with a new restructuring plan, which
will probably involve several thousand more job losses.
Digital's biggest challenge, however, is how to cut costs without slowing
sales. The company has a far larger salesforce, in proportion to its
revenues, than competitors, Mr Palmer acknowledged. Yet it cannot afford to
cut back until alternative 'indirect' sales channels, via third parties,
have been established.
'If we move too fast to take out (people from) sales before we have
developed indirect sales channels, the revenue is going to fall faster than
the cost. This is not a happy outcome.'
Yet Mr Palmer was clear that Digital 'needs to move to a competitive cost
structure as quickly as possible.' He plans to present a new restructuring
plan in June that 'will not be insubstantial'. Analysts expect Digital to
cut up to another 20,000 jobs and take a write-off of about Dollars 1bn.

FT  18 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Fund managers moving to
gilts, survey shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increasing number of UK fund managers are planning to reduce their cash
positions, and a portion of those funds appears to be heading for the UK
gilt market, the latest Smith New Court/Gallup survey of fund managers
shows.
Whereas in March a balance of 17 per cent of fund managers planned to reduce
their holdings of gilts, this has now been replaced by a balance of 10 per
cent who are planning to increase their holdings.
This is the first time since September 1992 that the survey has shown a
positive balance of managers planning to increase their gilt holdings.
However, the consensus forecast for the level of gilt yields does not imply
much decline from current levels.
Redemption yields on high coupon 15-year gilts, which stood at 8 per cent at
the time of the survey, are only expected to have fallen to 7.7 per cent in
three months' time and to be at 7.8 per cent in a year's time, the survey
shows.
During the recent bond market upheaval which pushed long-term yields in most
markets sharply higher, many investors chose to keep out of the fray and put
their funds into less volatile short-term cash instruments.
However, according to the survey, a balance of 27 per cent of fund managers
now intend to reduce their cash positions, the largest recorded figure since
last September.
Among new investments, Japanese equities continue to be the favourite asset
class, though European and UK equities are also coming back into favour.
The balance of fund managers planning to increase their holdings of Japanese
stocks remains very high, at 46 per cent, while a positive balance of 10 per
cent of managers said they planned to increase their exposure to European
equities.
The equivalent figure for UK equities has moved up to 20 per cent from the
single-digit balances seen in the previous three months.
Gallup conducted the survey on April 11 and 12, polling 85 institutions
which handle some Pounds 720bn of funds.

FT  18 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: World futures dream hits
reality - Laurie Morse considers Globex's options following the loss of CBoT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Friday's defection by the Chicago Board of Trade was a widely expected blow
for Globex, the electronic futures trading system. Just how serious, though,
remains uncertain.
While the CBoT's bond futures and options contracts are the largest in the
world, they generated the least volume of any contract listed on Globex.
Conceived in 1987 but not launched until mid-1992, Globex was meant to be a
worldwide, round-the-clock trading system that would list the all world's
main futures contracts. Instead it has attracted only meagre volume. Only
France's Matif has found a way to use the system profitably.
Globex was developed and is operated by Reuters, the financial information
and news group. With the departure of the CBoT from the end of this month,
only Matif and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange remain as Reuters' Globex
partners.
Executives at Reuters and the CME say the CBoT's loss will be more than
compensated for by Globex's expansion in Asia.
After long regulatory battles, Globex terminals are being installed in Hong
Kong, Japan, and Singapore, which places Globex in the time zone that was
its original target. Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman and the chief executive
of Globex, says he is optimistic he will persuade either Germany's DTB or
London's Liffe to list contracts on Globex within the next 30 to 45 days.
Recently announced computer enhancements may also broaden the system's
appeal.
However, the race to secure Globex's future will be short. Under the new
governance agreement with Reuters, if the CME fails to trade 25,000
contracts per day on the system within a year, Reuters can terminate the
deal and close Globex. In March, Globex's busiest month ever, the CME's
average daily volume on the system was just 4,500 contracts.
Meanwhile Globex faces several challenges. Liffe is talking with the Tokyo
International Financial Futures Exchange about offsetting trading
arrangements for Euroyen futures, and has not completely closed the door to
sharing trading rights to interest rate contracts with the CBoT.
The CBoT is also negotiating an alliance with New York-based Bloomberg
Financial Markets to trade CBoT financial contracts on Bloomberg terminals
after hours. Bloomberg, with a reputation for innovation and 37,000
subscribers worldwide, including 4,000 in Asia and 11,000 in Europe, would
be a significant challenge to both Reuters and Globex.
Mr Michael Bloomberg, Bloomberg's president, said the arrangement would
require additional software development, but that his system was
'technically capable' of handling CBoT trades. However, the CBoT must gain
regulatory approvals for the project in the US and all overseas trading
locations, a process that could take years to complete.
The CBoT plans to list its financial products for after-hours trading on a
local computer network sometime in July. Until then, the exchange's bond
futures will be shut for a large portion of the Asian and European business
day, increasing risk to CBoT customers during a period of interest rate
volatility.

FT  18 APR 94 / UK Company News: Murray Johnstone to launch trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based investment management group, is planning
a new investment trust specialising in small UK companies to be known as
Murray Acorn Trust.
The trust's size and the timing of the launch have not been settled, but the
group said it intends to focus on quoted companies with a market
capitalisation of less than Pounds 50m, of which there are about 1,100.
Murray Johnstone said prospects at the smaller end of the sector remained
good. These companies were under-researched by stockbrokers and less widely
owned by institutional investors, so the proposed fund could fulfil a useful
role for both institutional and private investors.
Mr Alistair Stewart of Murray Johnstone said recent market wariness towards
the continuing flood of new investment trusts was a concern, but he was
confident of this sector's appeal.

FT  18 APR 94 / UK Company News: UB paid departing US head Pounds 932,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Biscuits paid a total of Pounds 932,000 to Mr Tom Garvin when he
resigned as head of its US subsidiary Keebler last year, according to its
annual report.
UB also confirmed in the report that it cut its contribution to the
Conservative Party from Pounds 130,000 to Pounds 40,000.
Mr Garvin's departure followed a decision to refocus the US business after a
fall in both margins and market share. UB announced restructuring charges of
Pounds 92.5m for its US operations with its annual results last month. After
reorganisation costs group pre-tax profits fell 28 per cent to Pounds 116.7m
last year.
Mr Garvin's payment includes only Pounds 236,000 in cash, which is less than
one year's salary. The remaining Pounds 696,000 consists of pension
contributions to which he was entitled under the terms of his contract.
The report also showed that Sir Robert Clarke, UB's chairman who is due to
become chairman of Thames Water, received an increase of nearly 30 per cent
in his total remuneration. Though Sir Robert's basic salary remained
unchanged at Pounds 439,000, his pension contributions rose to Pounds
299,000 from Pounds 127,000.

FT  18 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Dividend payment on the cards -
Citicorp
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Citicorp is expected to announce later today that it will begin paying a
dividend to shareholders again, finally putting behind it the traumas of the
early 1980s.
The bank suspended its dividend in October 1991, four months before it was
forced to enter a memorandum of understanding with banking regulators which
imposed limits on its financial and operational flexibility. The memorandum
was finally lifted last month, paving the way for a reinstatement of the
dividend when the bank's board meets this afternoon in New York.
Though it still lags US competitors in terms of capital strength, Citicorp
pushed its key tier one ratio above 6 per cent last year.
If it matched other banks' pay-out policies, it could reinstate the dividend
at around Dollars 1.50, says Mr Frank Suozo, banking analyst at SG Warburg
in New York. He adds, though, that the bank is more likely to pay an initial
80 cents-Dollars 1, leaving it room for increase in coming quarters.
Like other big money centre banks, Citi will report first-quarter results on
Tuesday. Several regionals announce figures today. The news is likely to be
good on the credit side, with further reductions in underperforming assets.
Net interest margins are also expected to have held up well.

FT  18 APR 94 / Taylor reforms Barclays' structure: Chief executive moves to
replace divisional system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays is to announce this week that it is creating a management group to
handle relationships with large companies as part of reforms intended to
bridge the divide between its commercial and investment banking arms.
Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief executive, is thought to have opted to
replace the bank's divisional structure with a set of management groups
based on different sets of the bank's customers.
The reform, the first implemented by Mr Taylor since his arrival in January,
builds on changes under which the BZW investment banking division has taken
charge of large corporate accounts in the US, Asia and Europe.
Mr Graham Pimlott, head of merchant banking within BZW, is expected to be
appointed as head of the new corporate banking group. He is to report to Sir
Peter Middleton, Barclays' deputy chairman, on the board.
Mr Taylor is also expected to announce measures to strengthen Barclays'
central group function. This is intended to create a clear separation
between the Barclays group, and the new set of management groups.
Under the existing structure, created in 1991, Barclays tried to balance
responsibilities between the executive chairman and the chief executives of
its three divisions - BZW, banking and service businesses.
But Mr Taylor, who was recruited last year when Mr Andrew Buxton split the
roles of chairman and chief executive, thinks the group function has been
too weak, and the split between BZW and the banking division too strong.
Mr Taylor believes Barclays should model its structure around different
groups of customers. The new large corporate banking group will try to sell
a range of other services as well as lending money.
Barclays confirmed yesterday that Mr Buxton's basic pay is to rise by Pounds
50,000 to Pounds 350,000 this year, while Mr Alastair Robinson, who heads
the banking division, will receive basic pay of Pounds 220,000, a rise of
Pounds 30,000.
The details were disclosed in directors' contracts made available in advance
of the annual general meeting. They were disclosed for the first time
although they run for only 364 days, and so could be kept private.

FT  18 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Hint of light at the end of the
summer season  - Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Delays to the start of rail services through the Channel tunnel will mean
that Eurotunnel will have to rely on projections rather than hard figures
when it unveils its results on Thursday.
The numbers for 1993 will be largely academic but Sir Alastair Morton,
co-chairman of the Anglo-French venture, must have hoped to be able to
announce revenues from the first few months of operations.
Delays in signing off the tunnel, its signalling and communications systems
and the rolling stock, have prevented the start of commercial services,
however. A full freight and passenger service will not be running before
September-October, missing the crucial summer season.
These delays are costing Eurotunnel tens of millions of pounds a month in
lost fares and projected revenues of Pounds 224m for this year now look
hopelessly over-optimistic.
Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made towards resolving the
myriad of disputes which have bedevilled the project. The only outstanding
dispute is with the British and French railways but the ground has been
cleared for a rights issue of up to Pounds 750m, probably matched by a
similar amount of new bank loans, expected in May.
Eurotunnel's announcement that it plans to seek shareholder approval to
increase the number of shares available for this issue has raised fears that
it may be planning an even larger fund-raising or that it may be prepared to
offer shares at a deep discount.
Hanging over the rights issue will be the unresolved questions about the
tunnel's ability to attract the customers it needs to pay its way. Success
is dependent on continued expansion of the cross-Channel market and on
Eurotunnel making its published tariffs stick. Prospects for increased
traffic look good but avoiding a price war will be more difficult.

The first quarter of 1994 for the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group is
the last quarter at the helm for chief executive Bob Bauman. It may also be
the best quarter of the year as the US patent on ulcer drug Tagamet expires
next month. First quarter pre-tax profits should be Pounds 347m, a rise of
13 per cent on past year's first quarter, according to Andrew Porter at
securities house UBS. The dividend, watched by sector investors after the
sharp rise in Glaxo's payout earlier this year, should be 2.76p, up 9 per
cent, for the quarter.

FT  18 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): IBM - Other Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines will report its first quarter results on
Friday with investors anxious to hear whether the struggling computer
manufacturer has achieved even a meagre net profit in what is traditionally
its slowest sales period of the year.
The consensus on Wall Street is that IBM should report net earnings per
share of about 8 cents, on revenues of about Dollars 13bn (Pounds 8.90bn)
for the quarter. This would represent a turnaround from last year's first
quarter when the company reported net losses of Dollars 399m or 70 cents per
share after a charge of Dollars 114m for retirement health benefits.
Most analysts believe that the worst is over for IBM, after three years of
heavy losses culminating with last year's record loss of Dollars 8.1bn,
including an Dollars 8.9bn restructuring charge.

FT  18 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Retailers braced for effects of
tax rises - Other Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This month's income tax increases are expected to dominate the results of
the raft of small retailers - such as Etam, Bentalls, Austin Reed, Tie Rack
and Liberty - which are reporting next week.
However, it may still be a bit too early to get any meaningful indications
from the current trading statements. Most company observers will be waiting
for Sears' results on April 26.
Retailers are more likely to comment on what was generally perceived to be a
weak Easter.
Etam, the fashion clothing company, will be the most closely examined of
those reporting. It is expected to show a 33 per cent pre-tax profits
advance to about Pounds 14.5m, excluding property losses.
Evidence appears to indicate that the group has been struggling to draw in
new customers, but the hard core Etam shopper remains loyal. The total
dividend may well be raised by 7 per cent to 7.4p.

FT  18 APR 94 / Staying in front in a time of change: A culture shift at the
UK's largest fund management company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Below a striking image from the world of sport runs the corporate message:
'We have what it takes.' The advertiser is Mercury Asset Management, the
UK's largest fund management company.
What surprises is not the message itself but the fact that MAM feels the
need, for the first time in its history, for this kind of image-building
exercise. The move reflects two realities: that the fund management industry
is undergoing fundamental change as long-term savings patterns shift and the
fact that MAM itself faces growing competitive pressure in its core
institutional UK pension fund accounts.
For blue-blooded MAM, 75 per cent owned by the investment bank, SG Warburg,
these challenges are bringing a culture shift, if not culture shock. When Mr
Richard Royds, managing director in charge of unit trusts, suggested
sponsoring a financial news slot on radio two years ago, 'Warburg people
just about choked on their coffee,' one MAM official recalls.
But MAM increasingly recognises that it must find new business, beyond its
solid base in consistent, successful management of assets for UK pension
fund trustees. 'The UK institutional market is and will remain tremendously
important to MAM,' says Mr Hugh Stevenson, MAM's chairman. 'But things
change.'
What Mr Stevenson forsees is a slow, but steady shift in UK pension fund
provision. Instead of the traditional defined-benefit scheme of pooled
provision, where retirees are entitled to receive a percentage of their
final salary paid from a pension scheme, companies will increasingly offer
so-called defined contribution schemes.
To this end, MAM last summer launched a new product, which incorporates
sophisticated stock options techniques, through its Mercury Life subsidiary.
The product is aimed at taking some risk out of money purchase pension
arrangements. The value of an individual's defined contribution pension can
be slashed by a drop in stock and bond markets in the years before
retirement and MAM says its product will cut that risk.
The advertising campaign is all part of the process of re-assuring pension
scheme members that their money is in good hands.
'In a defined-benefit scheme, people feel much closer to their fund manager.
It's their own little pot of money. It's increasingly important that the
person has a warm feeling about MAM,' says Mr Stevenson. 'We want MAM to be
a household name,' says Mr Colin Clark, a director of MAM's institutional
business.
Indeed, over the past few years, MAM has been building its private client
business, including a first foray into investment trusts. In 1993, MAM was
ranked as the UK's sixth largest unit trust company, a jump of three places
in the 18 months that Mr Stevenson has been in charge.
Mr Stevenson, who had been a director in the investment banking division at
SG Warburg and a MAM board member for many years, was considered by MAM
insiders to be a peacemaking candidate to succeed Mr Peter
Stormonth-Darling, who retired in 1992.
Former MAM officials said that the view inside the firm was that competition
between the two heirs-apparent to Mr Stormont-Darling, Mr Stephen Zimmerman
and Mr David Price, was too intense to allow either one to be appointed
chairman. Rather than face defection or discord, MAM chose someone from
outside its ruling inner circle.
While MAM officials dismiss talk of internal rifts, former employees say it
was clear that among Mr Stevenson's main tasks would be to keep the company
working as a successful unit.
By the end of March 1993, the last full year for which data is available,
MAM had Pounds 35bn in UK pension fund assets under management, Pounds 6bn
in retail funds which come from individuals and Pounds 9bn in international
funds. Of that, the institutional money had only risen by 15 per cent in the
previous year, while the retail assets had grown by 50 per cent.
By the time 1994 figures are released, the retail assets will have grown by
a further 50 per cent, boosted by the launch of two of the UK's most
successful investment trusts: the Mercury World Mining Trust and the Mercury
European Privatisation Trust.
However, there may be more to MAM's efforts to refocus the business than
forward planning in a changing market. According to pensions consultants who
advise trustees and therefore drive the institutional fund management
business, MAM is no longer finding it so easy to draw in big institutional
money. It needs new markets to retain its lead in domestic fund management.
In recent years, the company has been shaken by several well publicised
defections, most notably that of one of its star fund managers, Mr Leonard
Licht. But perhaps more damaging, consultants say, has been the less visible
departure of some more junior fund managers, whose talent MAM needs to
nurture to stay on top. Former MAM employees said that the inability of the
company to promote some of its most ambitious staff because senior positions
are unlikely to become available quickly had led to frustrations. Since Mr
Stevenson's arrival, MAM has been making an effort to motivate and retain
managers in this tier. For instance, senior MAM directors Mr Stephen
Zimmerman and Ms Carol Galley devolved asset allocation and stock selection
decision-making, allowing rising stars to test their mettle and share the
glory.
Also, the consultants say, MAM has historically been weak on client
servicing. 'Their cuddle factor isn't a strong point,' says one. 'Clients
respect them when they have good performance, but in their hearts they don't
really like them.'
This attitude has damaged MAM in some beauty parades. 'We felt they were
offering us a favour, not a service,' says the administrator of one leading
UK local authority superannuation fund who, after considering MAM, chose two
other fund managers. MAM has recognised this shortcoming and greatly
increased spending on client service.
In the mid-1980's when MAM was spectacularly outperforming its competitors,
client servicing did not seem such a great issue. But in recent years, its
overall performance, while generally above average, has not been as frothy
as before, forcing MAM to pay closer attention to client care.
Indeed, pension consultants say that in 1993, MAM's funds which are measured
by Combined Actuarial Performance Services, a performance measurement
agency, had a median return of 28.8 per cent, marginally below the industry
median of 29.2 per cent as measured by CAPS.
MAM's performance itself has become an issue, not because it is poor but
because the company takes the unusual step of refusing to disclose the
median return on the pools of money it manages.
Meanwhile, there has also been carping about the range of MAM's performance
on balanced pools where the fund manager has full discretion over how assets
are to be invested. Pension consultants say that MAM has a reputation for an
unusually wide range of results by its different fund managers - a
reputation which performance measurement agencies say is unfounded.
Mr John Williams, research analyst at WM Company, a performance measurement
service, says that over a five-year period, the disparity amongst MAM's
results, while not as narrow as that of some competitors, is 'not out of
line' with other large fund managers.
MAM officials bristle when questioned closely about their performance
figures on balanced accounts. Mr Stevenson says MAM's business consists
increasingly of 'specialist' accounts, where the client determines the broad
category of assets to be purchased and sets a performance benchmark to be
met by the fund managers. Only accounts with the same benchmark should be
measured against each other, he says.
MAM is not alone in seeking to refocus its strategy. The other three big UK
pension fund managers, Schroders, PDFM and Gartmore, are also looking for
ways to expand, either through new domestic products or by tapping
international accounts. Privately, MAM's largest competitors concede they
also are too reliant on a single product in a single market.
Mr Stevenson is confident that MAM will prosper in these new conditions.
'Our strategy is to maintain ourselves as a growth company in a growth
industry,' he says.

FT  18 APR 94 / Santa Fe to float gold subsidiary on NYSE
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Santa Fe Pacific, the US railroad and pipeline group, is to float its gold
subsidiary on the New York Stock Exchange on terms which value Santa Fe Gold
Corporation at between Dollars 1.76bn and Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.43bn).
The gold business includes some of the US assets Hanson, the Anglo-American
conglomerate, acquired with Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK and swapped
last year for Santa Fe's coal and aggregate operations. That deal
transformed Santa Fe Gold into the sixth-largest North American gold
producer with an anticipated 1994 output of 900,000 troy ounces. It also has
one of the biggest gold reserves in North America, amounting to 14.1m
ounces.
Santa Fe Gold said at the weekend it would initially offer newly-created
shares to raise between Dollars 243m and Dollars 279m which will be used to
pay down debt of about Dollars 340m.
The parent group's holding will be diluted to 86.2 per cent as a result. It
has received notification from the US Revenue Service that it can distribute
the rest of Santa Fe Gold to shareholders tax free.
Analysts expect this to happen before the year-end, qualifying Santa Fe Gold
for inclusion in the new Financial Times Gold Mines Index.
A syndicate of underwriters led by Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and SG
Warburg will offer 12m Santa Fe Gold shares in the US while a further 6m
shares will be offered internationally by those three underwriters plus JP
Morgan, and Union Bank of Switzerland.
Shares will be priced between Dollars 13.50 and Dollars 15.50 each.
Santa Fe Gold is one of the biggest holders of mineral rights in the western
US.

FT  18 APR 94 / B&amp;C writ stops creditors getting Atlantic payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A planned payout to the creditors of Atlantic Computers has been cancelled,
following news of an impending Pounds 1bn legal claim against the failed
computer leasing company, its administrator said yesterday.
Mr John Soden of Price Waterhouse, Atlantic's administrator, said he was
unable to proceed with plans to pay creditors a first dividend of 16 pence
in the pound in June. Instead, payment was 'unlikely to exceed a few pence
in the pound'.
A Pounds 1bn legal action against Atlantic Computers is being prepared by
Ernst &amp; Young, the administrators of British &amp; Commonwealth, which collapsed
in 1990 following the failure of its Atlantic Computers subsidiary. The writ
is expected to allege that Atlantic Computers mis-stated its financial
position when it was acquired for Pounds 407m in 1988.
The news of the impending writ has prompted the Atlantic Computer's
administrator to serve a protective writ against Atlantic Computers'
auditors Spicer and Pegler, now part of Touche Ross. Writs have also been
issued against three former Atlantic directors. The purpose of the writs is
to indemnify the Atlantic administrators if the B&amp;C action succeeds.
The news of the legal action will come as a blow to creditors who have an
estimated Pounds 400m of claims. Mr Soden said it could be 'four or five
years' before the legal action was resolved.
The move by B&amp;C's administrators will dash hopes of a swift payout that were
raised when Price Waterhouse recovered about Pounds 70m of an intercompany
debt due from Atlantic Computer System, a US subsidiary company. That led
the administrators to draw up a scheme of arrangement, a method of
distributing cash to the company's creditors that avoids a liquidation,
which was approved a few weeks ago.
A spokesman for the Spicer &amp; Pegler partners said that they were aware that
'moves have been made on a protective basis' but they were unable to comment
further at this stage.

dealer

The pride of leading Swiss bankers in the care they take to avoid handling
dirty money has been bruised by revelations that Union Bank of Switzerland
has been holding Dollars 150m (Pounds 102.7m) in Zurich for an alleged
Colombian drug dealer for several years.
Although it is by far the largest amount of drug money uncovered in a Swiss
bank, the account is not the first of its kind. In 1989 a parliamentary
commission accused the public prosecutor of laxity in pursuing narcotics
investigations, and a book with the cheeky title, La Suisse Lave Plus Blanc
(Switzerland Washes Whiter), became a best-seller.
But this latest case is a surprise in the light of the efforts made by Swiss
authorities in the last few years to outlaw money-laundering and force banks
to stop dealing with criminals.
The controversy began when Mrs Sheila Miriam Arana de Nasser, who held the
account, applied in January for permission to buy her house near Geneva.
As with every foreigner, Swiss authorities insisted on checking her
background and bank references. With the help of US drug enforcement
officials, they identified her as the wife of Mr Julio Nasser David, sought
as a leading drug trafficker in Colombia.
On February 23, Mrs Arana was arrested by Swiss police and the account
frozen. On Friday, charges were filed in Miami against the couple for
smuggling more than 55,000lbs of cocaine and 3m lbs of marijuana into the US
from 1976. Mr Nasser David is still at large, and the US is seeking Mrs
Arana's extradition from Switzerland.
The UBS vice-president who opened and handled Mrs Arana's account has been
suspended and is being questioned by Zurich police. The Swiss Bankers'
Association due diligence committee has launched an inquiry.
The big question among Zurich's banking community is how UBS, renowned as
the most cautious and meticulous of banks, could have failed for so long to
have spotted trouble in the Arana account.
According to the authorities, she opened it in 1979 with a Dollars 50m cash
deposit. UBS claims it carried out its normal identity checks which showed
the family had extensive shipping and hotel interests in Colombia, so there
was no reason to suspect anything untoward.
'Not every Colombian is a potential money-launderer,' says Mr Stephan
Haeringer, a UBS director. However, UBS admits that the account manager must
have been very naive.
Swiss laws and regulations on money-laundering were tightened in the late
1980s. Analysts were asking why UBS, which has a 100-strong internal audit
team, did not pay special attention to accounts from places such as Colombia
and Sicily with known links to drug smuggling.
Apparently, not much effort was required. A Zurich prosecutor says that even
the children in the Nasser Davids' home town of Barranquilla were aware of
the alleged drug links. The bank says the account has been virtually
inactive for many years, so there was no reason for suspicion.
'The manager's superiors asked questions and got appropriate answers,' UBS
said. 'We are now checking to see if we have to change our procedures.'
