China is heading for 11.5 per cent economic growth this year, compared with
a government target of 9 per cent, according to a leading Chinese research
institution, which warns the authorities they have yet to get a grip on
inflation.
In another sign of official concern at the overheating of the economy, the
People's Bank of China, the central bank, has introduced a moratorium on
investment funds, which it fears are contributing to speculation and
draining savings needed to finance government bond issues.
China's Academy of Social Sciences believes the booming economy, which grew
13 per cent last year, will begin to slow, but it says the government has
been too optimistic in its forecasts for a slowdown.
Economists at the academy, regarded as the leading Chinese 'think-tank' on
the economy, expressed concern about the continuing surge in inflation.
Cost-of-living increases in urban centres are more than 25 per cent up on
the same period last year.
The Chinese government is engaged in the delicate task of reining in its
runaway economy, while avoiding the kind of abrupt dislocation that
contributed to the social unrest of the late 1980s.
The authorities have been seeking to puncture a boom in capital spending
which has been one of the chief causes of inflation. Growth in fixed-asset
investment is forecast to slow this year to 12 per cent compared with last
year's 50 per cent surge.
The credit squeeze appears to be taking its toll on the state sector,
according to figures released by the State Statistical Bureau, which showed
that output by state firms, half of them in the red, grew by just 2.2 per
cent in the first quarter.
That compared with output growth of 32.1 per cent for collectives, including
township enterprises, and 79.1 per cent for other sectors such as joint
ventures.
Meanwhile, the People's Bank declared the moratorium on new domestic
investment funds in a further attempt to reinforce central controls over an
unruly financial sector and channel domestic savings towards the purchase of
government bonds.
China's official Business Weekly reported that about 50 funds had been
established with about Yn4.5bn (Pounds 354m) under their control. Only four
had been approved by the central bank.
China is relying on the sale of some Yn115bn of treasury bonds to fund its
1994 domestic deficit which is expected to reach Yn67bn. It also faces heavy
debt service obligations on borrowings for infrastructure.
The freeze on investment funds will not affect foreign-related investment
vehicles.

FT  18 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden takes a leaf out of the UK's book this week with its first auction of
index-linked government bonds. It is tempting to conclude that the fashion
is spreading, although previous attempts by Canada and Australia to get
index-linked markets going have not met with conspicuous success. Sweden has
spent some time preparing its issue, but the suspicion remains that the
timing is determined by a combination of the high cost of fixed-rate
borrowing and a heavy funding requirement. The budget deficit is more than
11 per cent of GDP; after last year's heavy recourse to overseas markets,
the authorities are now focusing more on domestic investors.
Since Swedish inflation is below 2 per cent and the yield on 10-year bonds
is more than 8 per cent, the government may consider index-linked borrowing
is attractive. The issue is in some ways a statement of defiance. It can be
seen as a signal that the markets are wrong to mistrust the authorities'
determination to keep inflation down.
The chances are that the SKr20bn of 20-year paper on offer will find a home
among domestic buyers, including institutions seeking to match their
longer-term liabilities. Lack of liquidity may deter international buyers,
even though there is a theoretical trading appeal. Since the Swedish paper
will carry no coupon, its value will be particularly geared to changes in
real interest rates. And since real yields in Sweden have risen strongly in
the recent bond market shake-out, the chances are that they will soon be
coming down.

FT  18 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Globex
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Board of Trade's decision not to participate in the restructured
Globex appears to cast a long shadow over the futures trading system.
Perversely, however, the withdrawal of the world's biggest futures exchange
may yet turn out to be Globex's salvation. The unhappy relationship between
the system's partners has dogged its development. Reuters will at least be
relieved that that uncertainty has been resolved.
There is only likely to be a small loss of terminals as a result of CBoT's
move. Despite its size, CBoT accounted for just 5 per cent of Globex's
transactions. But CBoT's withdrawal may ease the fears of other exchanges
concerning Globex's governance. Now that a new agreement is being drawn up,
other exchanges, such as Liffe and the DTB, may be tempted to sign up to the
system - especially if it is able to offer a bund contract. That may be
sufficient to give the network critical mass. The experience of Matif has
already shown that Globex is a technical success.
The big uncertainty is whether the concept of a round-the-clock,
round-the-world futures trading market is a valid one. Even if it succeeds,
Globex will take a long time to catch on. The financial impact on Reuters is
only likely to prove marginal either way. Reuters has already written off
its investment in developing the network. The healthy progress of Instinet
and Dealing 2000/2 is likely to mask any further disappointment.

FT  18 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Ashanti/Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The international offer of shares in Ashanti Goldfields, which closes today,
should attract strong institutional support. True, the gold price has been
in the doldrums after the excitement of last year. A rising tax charge may
also take the shine off Ashanti's earnings growth for the next year or two.
But Ashanti is a low-cost producer which boasts quality reserves and rising
production. So long as investors are willing to take a relaxed view of
political risk in Ghana, a share price towards the top of the indicated
Dollars 17-Dollars 20 range looks likely.
That outcome would be especially pleasing for Lonrho, which will own 43 per
cent of the company after flotation. The interest among investors generated
by the offer - and the additional transparency provided by its weighty
prospectus - have helped Lonrho's shares outperform the market since the
turn of the year. Assuming a share price for Ashanti of Dollars 20, Lonrho's
holding would be worth around Pounds 450m - more than its total market
capitalisation in the dark days of 1992.
If investors now turn their attention to Western Platinum of South Africa,
Lonrho's share price may have further to run. Like Ashanti, Lonrho's other
large mining investment is a low-cost producer with the promise of rising
production. As with gold, a rising metals price cannot be relied upon.
Political risk will also be a worry until the turmoil surrounding the South
African elections has passed. Then it will be up to Lonrho to prove that it
can make its assets sweat more effectively than in the past.

FT  18 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Earning credibility
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The not-so-new format for reporting company profits has now had a year to
bed in. In general, the system is working well, but the abolition of
extraordinary items has had the expected effect of making reported earnings
more volatile. Investors still want to get a picture of underlying company
performance. Most use the Institute of Investment Management Research
standard as a guide. It excludes from earnings those capital items which
have no impact on continuing operations, but includes costs which are
related to mainstream businesses.
The underlying earnings picture is still less easy to spot, and investors
are looking for other ways to track company performance. In part, that is
what the reforms were intended to achieve, since investors had come to rely
too heavily on a single crude measure. Earnings are a proxy for
distributable cash flow, and if the proxy is failing it makes sense to look
at cash directly. More estimates of future cash flows are being produced,
and there is a good deal of work going into discounted cash flow modelling.
There is also some attention being paid to dividends, since although they do
not provide much information about companies' growth prospects, they do hint
at management's confidence about the future.
Perhaps the most interesting line of attack, however, is in deconstructing
analysts' models of company profits to assess where the risks of errors lie.
Correctly identifying whether earnings are likely to be higher or lower than
consensus forecasts is the kind of deeper analysis that should make
institutions money.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund is forecasting world economic growth of
around 3 per cent this year, with a stronger recovery to between 3 1/2 and 4
per cent growth in 1995, writes George Graham in Washington.
In its world economic outlook, due out on Wednesday, the IMF predicts that
growth in the developing countries will remain steady, while in the
industrialised world only the US, Canada, the UK and the Nordic countries
have pulled out of recession.
IMF economists believe the Japanese economy has bottomed out, and that with
normal output in continental Europe the world should produce strong growth
next year.
The fund notes that the current recovery has not been accompanied,
particularly in Europe, by any appreciable recovery in employment.

FT  18 APR 94 / Spicy recipe for the Big Apple: Martin Dickson assesses the
impact of Mayor Giuliani on New York's long-running financial and social
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is mid-morning in Manhattan and a pudgy 13-year-old boy is playing video
games in an amusement arcade just off Times Square, that crossroads of
bright lights, sexual sleaze and tourist tat.
A team from New York City's new anti-truancy police squad accosts the child,
orders him into a van, and detains him for 90 minutes on suspicion of
skipping school.
A crackdown on classroom absenteeism may not be one of the weightiest
reforms introduced to New York in the past three months by its mayor, Mr
Rudolph Giuliani, yet it is symbolically significant: the city's first
Republican mayor in 20 years is taking the unruly metropolis by its collar
and trying to shake it into greater self-discipline, both fiscal and social.
Mr Giuliani, who has just celebrated his first 100 days in office, has been
a whirl of policy initiatives - in sharp contrast to the reactive style of
his Democratic predecessor, Mr David Dinkins, New York's first black mayor,
whom Mr Giuliani narrowly defeated in last November's election.
The mayor's reform programme, designed to avert a looming budget crisis and
reverse deterioration in the city's 'quality of life', has four main
elements.
The first is a crackdown on crime under a tough new police chief, Mr William
Bratton. For example, police officers on the beat can now arrest drug
dealers, rather than leaving this to special narcotics squads. The
anti-truancy patrols are designed in part to pinpoint juvenile criminals,
whose numbers are growing disturbingly.
Second, the mayor wants to reform the school system, which suffers from
declining standards, crumbling buildings and rising student violence. While
vital, this is a complex task on which he has yet to formulate clear
policies. His initial goal - to cut education bureaucracy so more money can
flow to schools - is only a partial palliative.
Third, he wants to create a more favourable business climate, and has made a
modest first step by proposing small cuts in the corporate tax burden.
Finally, he is trying to end that longest running of New York shows - the
city's recurrent budget crisis - with a reform of its finances,
privatisation of services and an efficiency drive.
His immediate task is to bridge a potential Dollars 2.3bn budget gap in the
year beginning July 1. His remedies include cutting the municipal workforce
by 15,000 and wringing productivity concessions out of the unions;
consolidating various government departments; and selling off at least four
municipal hospitals, 85 petrol stations and a television and radio station.
He is also trying to get New York state to assume a fairer proportion of
Medicaid, which provides healthcare for the indigent and is one of the
largest and fastest growing budget items.
The business community sees the budget package as a good start, though some
critics argue the mayor has been insufficiently radical, particularly in
shielding from cuts the heavily staffed fire and police services, which
backed him strongly in November's election.
Mr Dean Mead, of the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog
agency, says the package 'holds promise. I don't see anything in it that is
going to change dramatically the economic climate of the city, but it is the
beginning of that process'.
But along the way, the mayor has stirred up controversy. Many New Yorkers
say he has yet to demonstrate the skills of diplomacy and political
compromise needed to run the world's most polyglot city smoothly over the
long haul.
For Mr Giuliani, a 49-year-old former US attorney who made his name in the
1980s with the zealous prosecution of New York drug dealers, mafiosi and
Wall Street insider traders, has brought to City Hall the bullying,
irascible style of the courtroom interrogator, pouring personal scorn on
politicians and civil servants who cross him.
The strength of this approach was shown at the start of this month, when he
pressurised the normally bellicose municipal unions into accepting voluntary
redundancies. Its weakness was underlined a week ago, when his interference
and insults prompted the highly respected head of the schools system briefly
to resign.
The new mayor is walking a fine line. As the first Republican mayor of
Democratic-dominated New York since the aristocratic Mr John Lindsay in the
1960s, he has few political debts to pay, and therefore has the best chance
in a generation of reforming the city's government. But he also needs to
talk softly, if he is to win the co-operation of the Democrat-controlled
city legislature and municipal agencies.
The first real test of the administration's effectiveness will come this
spring as Mr Giuliani tries to build a consensus in the legislature for his
budget cuts. His predominantly white administration also needs to build
bridges to the city's minority communities, particularly the black 25 per
cent of the population which supported Mr Dinkins.
'I think he's off to a good start,' says Mr Felix Rohatyn, the veteran
banker who helped save the city from a more serious financial crisis in the
mid-1970s. 'But it's very important that as soon as possible he be seen as
mayor of all the people of the city . . . There are still a lot of racial
tensions in New York.'
How Mr Giuliani manages this balancing act could have a profound impact on
the future of New York, for he has come to office at a delicate point in the
city's history: its mounting social and financial problems could mean a slow
but inexorable economic decline, while solutions to them could prompt
revival.
New York is not alone in its problems. Many large cities face budget crises,
high crime, an alienated black underclass and a flight of business and the
middle class to the suburbs. Nor is it alone in electing a reformist,
market-oriented mayor. Over the past year cities as varied as Los Angeles
and Jersey City voted in Republicans in place of their traditional
Democrats.
However, New York does have unique features which set it apart from all
other US cities, both exacerbating its problems and offering long-term
strengths.
On the positive side, the compact nature of Manhattan, its reliable subway
system and its cultural attractions means that it has not suffered too badly
from 'white flight' to the suburbs. At the other end of the income spectrum,
New York retains its allure for new immigrants, who have revitalised some of
the city's most decayed sections. 'New York's immigrant-driven culture has
given it a ragged energy reminiscent of American cities at the turn of the
century,' says Professor Peter Salins, editor of the right-of-centre City
Journal.
However, the city also has a larger than average quotient of those in need -
be they newly landed immigrants, victims of Aids and crack cocaine, the
indigent or the deranged. New Yorkers, moreover, have long expected their
government to do more than other cities to solve their social problems. The
city runs the largest subsidised housing programme in the US, as well as 15
municipal hospitals and an elaborate system of shelters for the homeless.
Its bureaucracy is also unusually bloated, thanks to the strength of the
municipal union movement and its close ties to the Democratic party machine.
Over the past six years, employment by the municipality has risen by 15,000,
while a prolonged recession - the result of the 1987 stock market crash and
the 1990-91 national downturn - has cut the total number in work in the city
by 345,000, or 9.5 per cent.
All these factors mean that the city's spending is growing much more sharply
than its revenues, which were seriously dented by the recession of 1989-93.
Mr Giuliani will be helped by a recovery in the regional economy which began
last year, though this looks like being painfully slow, and employment may
not recover to pre-recession levels till around the turn of the century.
Still, provided New York tackles its 'quality of life' problems, many
observers think the city could grow healthily over the coming decades,
drawing on what are still immense comparative advantages.
It seems in no danger of losing its position as the world's pre-eminent
financial hub. That said, it cannot rely on Wall Street for jobs growth. The
securities industry has boomed over the past three years, but this has
created relatively few new jobs in Manhattan, partly because information
technology has increased productivity and partly because companies have
moved much of their routine 'back office' paperwork to cheaper cities as far
away as Florida.
Yet New York remains the single greatest source of creative and intellectual
capital in the US and is a leading centre for two of the sectors which seem
likely to enjoy particularly strong growth over the next few decades:
entertainment/information and international trade.
Mr Mitchell Moss, head of the Urban Research Centre at New York University,
says the city's competitive, cosmopolitan nature means that 'it is still a
phenomenal magnet for the talented'. Mr Giuliani just has to keep it that
way.

FT  18 APR 94 / Leading Article: Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a long time since a senior US official has advised Latin American
governments to do what they can to strengthen trade unions. And it is a far
cry from the Reagan and Bush years when that same official argues that
markets alone, without governments, cannot bring prosperity.
Yet this was the message of a powerful speech by Mr Lawrence Summers, the US
Treasury undersecretary, to the InterAmerican Development Bank last week.
His words, if put into action, would have profound implications for Latin
America and other developing regions. They also contain some risks.
Regional development banks such as the IADB were, he said, 'as important to
the new world order as the regional security organisations were to the old
one', as the challenge of defeating communism had been replaced by that of
sharing prosperity.
The development banks certainly have much to recommend them in helping to
address social problems that threaten regional prosperity. On its own,
however, throwing money at social problems will not work. Nor is there any
one blueprint for success in confronting them. And if it goes too far in
emphasising government action on social issues, there is a danger that the
US administration could help to reinforce rather than to remove obstacles to
reform in Latin America.
As Mr Summers himself implied, Latin American governments can now begin to
address social challenges only because of their improved macroeconomic
management and market-oriented reform programmes. The first priority for
governments attempting to address unequal income distribution is to tackle
inflation which daily widens the gap between rich and poor. As Brazil shows,
governments cannot even think about social programmes while suffering
four-digit annual inflation.
The risk is that the emphasis on social issues will raise conflicts which
play into the hands of those wishing to block further necessary reforms.
Most Latin American countries already have strong labour laws (though they
are unevenly applied) which inhibit competitiveness and benefit those with
jobs at the expense of the unemployed. Public-sector trade unions continue
to impede reform of bureaucracies, health and education systems.
More ominously, the new American emphasis on social ideals has parallels
with its stance on labour and environmental standards in trade negotiations.
Developing countries may ask what lies behind these arguments. Is the US
really worried about conditions of workers in Peru or is it looking to
hobble competition from poorer countries?
Some of these concerns can be alleviated by the multilateral approach
described by Mr Summers. But Washington must take care not to impose its
ideas on Latin America. Otherwise, its new drive for social justice in Latin
America will be seen as a covert means of pursuing the perceived commercial
interests of the US.

FT  18 APR 94 / Leading Article: Beauty's riches
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a truth universally acknowledged - and almost as widely resented -
that beauty rarely goes unrewarded. But it has taken the ingenuity of
academic economists to put a price on what the world's oldest profession
always knew. In a paper for the US National Bureau of Economic Research,
Messrs Daniel Hamermesh and Jeff Biddle have found that plain people earn 5
to 10 per cent less than people of average looks, while average lookers earn
5 per cent less than those who are good looking.
This seems hard on the ugly. Yet those who believe that market forces
reflect people's marginal value to society will no doubt say: tough but
just. The followers of Friedrich Hayek will, on the other hand, pay a
backhanded compliment to the physiologically disadvantaged by declaring that
there is no moral merit or demerit attaching to rewards in the labour
market. Yet both these camps, which tend to belong on the intellectual
right, should be on their guard for a leftish backlash.
As long as nobody attempted to quantify the adverse impact of the haphazard
distribution of natural endowments, it was possible for us to live with
nature's decision to confer fantastic brainpower on Einstein, exceptional
tonsils on Pavarotti and a super superstructure on Marilyn Monroe. But with
researchers producing extensive physical and economic data from household
surveys, we may shortly confront a powerful new interest group seeking
redress for physiognomical shortcomings. Mainstream opinion will demand
compensation through the tax and benefit system. The left will want
subsidies for cosmetic surgery. A suitable euphemism for ugly - homely? -
will be sought.
There is, of course, a better way. Average-looking people cannot be expected
to pay taxes for those of ill mien. A hypothecated tax should therefore be
levied on the beautiful in favour of the ugly. The important thing is that
beauty must not pay.

FT  18 APR 94 / Leading Article: Disaster at Gorazde
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Saturday was a black day in the history of both Nato and the United Nations
 -the two institutions on which it had seemed possible to build some
semblance of world order after the cold war. The debacle at Gorazde is a
disaster for Bosnia - one more, after so many. It is a catastrophe for
Unprofor, the UN protection force in the former Yugoslavia.
Many reputations will be tarnished. Those special envoys who last week were
uttering optimistic statements about ceasefires and compromise solutions are
left looking irredeemably foolish. A sadder casualty - given the hopes that
had been raised by his efforts until last week - is the reputation of
Unprofor's commander in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose.
For two months General Rose's energy and ingenuity, backed by an apparently
firmer sense of purpose among his political masters, had made it seem as if
Unprofor was actually capable of carrying out its mandate, and even as if
that mandate was clear and coherent. But in truth the mandate remained
contradictory.
It was often asserted, not least by General Rose himself, that Unprofor was
a neutral peacekeeping and humanitarian operation, authorised to use force
only in its own defence. Given the size and nature of the units composing
it, that was perhaps the only realistic way for its commanders to interpret
their mandate. But that interpretation ignored many paragraphs in the
relevant UN Security Council resolutions, which authorised the use of force
not only to ensure that humanitarian aid reached the people who needed it,
but also to defend the so-called 'safe areas'.
It also ignored the political context in which those resolutions were
passed, which was one of worldwide outrage at the violent dismembering of a
state.
The world at large has not wavered in its judgment that the principal
aggressors are the Bosnian Serbs, aided and abetted by Serbia. The Security
Council has imposed very tough sanctions on Serbia, and the 'safe areas' it
proclaimed were all places still held by the Bosnian government, but
threatened by the Serb advance. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the
Serb forces regarded Unprofor with intense suspicion, especially whenever
its commanders showed signs of taking their mandate seriously and being
prepared to use force to carry it out.
Perhaps if General Rose had been given the extra troops he asked for, he
might have succeeded. As it was, the Serbs called his bluff, and he
underestimated the gravity of their challenge until it was too late. Then
Nato provided 'close air support' at his request, but this was not enough
even to protect UN personnel, let alone to protect the 'safe area' of
Gorazde and its population. Only a much more intensive air bombardment of
Serb forces could have affected the military outcome, and for this there was
no stomach either in national capitals or at Unprofor HQ.
Logically there are now only two options left. One is for Unprofor to be
called out and the Bosnians left to fight their own war, with weapons and
perhaps also air cover from sympathetic outsiders. The other is for Unprofor
to be massively reinforced and equipped to fight.
Neither option is likely to be adopted. The Serbs are in a position to make
Unprofor's withdrawal very difficult, and few western governments will be
prepared to take responsibility for the likely immediate consequences for
Bosnian civilians, who for better or worse have come to depend on the UN
humanitarian relief effort. But governments will be even less willing to
contemplate an all-out war with the Bosnian Serbs. The sad probability is
that Unprofor will stay, becoming ever more constrained in its relief role
and in effect serving to ratify the results of Serb aggression. The reality
of the new world order is proving very different from the prospectus offered
in 1990-91.

FT  18 APR 94 / Contracting margins: The gloom among UK builders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction output in the UK is rising and companies are returning to
profit after record losses. So why do British contractors sound so
universally gloomy? Is it that, like the apocryphal farmer, they will never
admit to better times, or is the structure of the industry unable to meet
the challenges of recovery?
Building material companies forecast a 2 per cent rise in construction this
year, the first annual increase since 1990. A further rise of 2.5 per cent
is predicted for 1995 and again for 1996.
A survey by the Chartered Institute of Building claims that the industry
hired twice as many permanent staff during the first few months of this year
as at the start of 1993. Pay levels have started to rise in some companies
as they seek to hold on to remaining staff to cope with the increased work.
Montrose Technical Recruitment, one the largest UK construction recruitment
consultants, says: 'Registered job vacancies with construction employers
have risen by 44 per cent in the first quarter compared with the first three
months of last year, while the number of people placed with construction
companies is almost double that of the corresponding period last year.'
Yet in recent weeks, as chief executives have announced profit figures for
last year, their accompanying comments have been almost universally
pessimistic. The reason is less the size of their UK order books than the
low prices at which they are winning contracts. These leave little or no
margin for profit.
Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing, blames low margins on contractors
with high borrowings which need a regular flow of cash payments to meet
interest charges; contractors have been bidding for contracts 'at the
expense of profit'. He also criticises banks and institutional shareholders
which, he says, support 'enfeebled contractors' and add to damaging
over-capacity in the construction industry.
His company, which announced a 57 per cent rise in 1993 pre-tax profits to
Pounds 18.3m, estimates that over-capacity in the industry is running at
about 30 per cent. By contrast, building material companies have been much
more successful in cutting capacity.
Over-capacity has led to a fall in prices at which contractors win jobs, by
22 per cent since 1989; but list prices for building materials and labour
have risen by 21 per cent according to EC Harris, the construction cost
consultancy.
Some of the difference between tender prices and costs will have been made
up by claims for additional payments to meet 'unforeseen' design changes
which traditionally arise after contracts have been signed. EC Harris also
says there is evidence of a pick-up in construction tender prices of about
2.5 per cent since last summer.
Even so, margins are likely to remain paper thin, with increases in the
prices charged by building material producers and sub-contractors likely to
offset any rise in tender prices. Even if tender prices were to rise sharply
they might not affect published earnings figures for another two years or
more because of the time lag before profits from projects are included in
accounts, says Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers
Confederation.
Lead contractors are also being squeezed on another front. Part of their
profit comes from advance payments from customers. These are held on
account, earning interest, until they are passed on to sub-contractors.
Falling interest rates reduce this income. As in many industries,
sub-contractors complain about the length of time it takes for main
contractors to make payments - another sign of cash problems.
Laing's forthright comments about banks' support for weaker companies have
angered some rivals. Concerns about over-capacity, however, are shared by
senior executives in other companies. Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec,
the international construction company which last year made pre-tax profits
of just Pounds 21m on a turnover of Pounds 2.18bn, says the industry is in
need of rationalisation.
Some are better placed than others: housebuilders, for instance, which are
leading the sector out of recession. Sales are rising and margins have begun
to improve as prices increase and builders use up expensive land bought in
the late 1980s.
There is nevertheless concern that land prices, which have risen by up to 50
per cent in the south-east during the past 12 months, could slow the pace of
future earnings recovery. Public spending cuts, particularly on roads, could
also restrict growth in the industry.
Given these concerns, there can be little surprise that building shares,
which have outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share Index by more than a fifth in
the past 12 months, have looked more vulnerable in recent weeks.

Defending the Irish punt following sterling's exit from the ERM cost the
Irish government an estimated IPounds 350m, equivalent to about half its
1993 borrowing requirement, it emerged recently.
So it comes as less than a complete surprise that Maurice Doyle, the Irish
central bank president who played a prime role in formulating exchange rate
policy during the crisis, will not be running for a second term of office.
Finance minister Bertie Ahern, now mulling over a shortlist of candidates to
take on the job from the end of this month, had been especially careful to
praise Doyle's 'great professionalism'. But last Friday, introducing a new
five pound note, an impish Ahern rounded off his speech by thanking Doyle
for his 'sterling service to the bank and to the nation'.

Is France limbering up for candidacy as a semi-detached member of the
European Union? One might be forgiven for thinking so after the French
delegation's antics at last week's signing of the Gatt agreement, which made
the normally bolshy Brits look like positively model European citizens.
French industry minister Gerard Longuet's first task in Marrakesh was to
break ranks with his fellow Europeans by presuming to speak for all 12
countries during private talks with Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's
special trade representative. Next, he insisted that EU governments append
their names separately, instead of signing and sealing the great document
'en bloc' as previously agreed.
The final straw was when Longuet provoked an emergency EU council meeting,
and promptly headed back to Paris. When he finally reappeared, 11 hungry
ministers, who had spent an evening without sustenance, marched out en
masse.
Hence, by the weekend, the only delegate in Marrakesh with a good word for
the French was Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's trade commiss-ioner. No doubt that
is down to Brittan's good-humoured patience, and is quite unrelated to his
bid for the Commission presidency, for which French support is crucial.

<TEXT>
The decision to prevent political journalists from enjoying a libation on
the Terrace of the House of Commons has thrown an unaccustomed spotlight on
Michael Martin. As chairman of the Commons catering committee, Martin is
behind the decree that will allow MPs to wine and dine by the Thames this
summer free from the prying eyes of the press.
Perhaps fearing an increase in their bar bills, senior Labour figures were
hastily blaming the ill-conceived ban on the Tories. It had obviously eluded
them that Martin has represented the Labour constituency of Springburn in
Glasgow for the last 15 years. But then the 48-year-old MP's only other
claim to fame is that he was once an aide to Denis Healey.

Tut tut. The London Society of Chartered Accountants, which presumably holds
with greater transparency in financial reporting just like the rest of the
accountancy profession, has been caught cowering a trifle foolishly behind
the letter of the law. The 1993 accounts fail to provide a cash flow
statement because, as a note explains, the LSCA is defined as a small
company, which is exempt from the requirement to comply.

Meanwhile, senior New York economists already involved in the trendy
discipline of emerging markets seem to be about as unpredictable in their
movements as the economies they follow, to judge by the welter of recent job
changes in the sector.
Larry Brainard, who advised commercial banks during their negotiations with
Latin American debtors of the 1980s, is quitting Goldman Sachs for pastures
new at Chase Manhattan, where he is to be the bank's first chief emerging
markets economist.
One of the most senior Latin American specialists in New York, Jim Nash of
JP Morgan, is heading for Nomura, to take over its emerging markets effort.
Arturo Porzecanski recently left Kidder Peabody to run emerging markets
research at ING Bank in New York. And Frank Fernandez has quit Merrill
Lynch's research group.
As in the markets themselves, do you lose on the roundabouts what you gain
on the swings?

FT  18 APR 94 / Observer: Gurria's career
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
All those Wall Street houses assiduously courting Jose Angel Gurria,
Mexico's chief debt negotiator through the 1980s, will have to call it a day
 -for now.
The flamboyant former finance ministry official, who has graced many a
headhunter's list since he wrapped up the debt negotiations in 1990, has
signalled that his considerable ambitions are currently focused on the
domestic political scene. Over the weekend, he bowed out as head of the
state development bank and joined the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party as secretary for international affairs.
Battling along after the assassination of its presidential candidate Luis
Donaldo Colosio, the PRI faces a plummeting stock market and rising interest
rates. So there's no doubt it needs an effective spokesman to calm foreign
concerns about Mexico's future.
Fluent in at least four languages, the invariably good-humoured Gurria has
charmed scores of financiers over the years. But even he, with his
remarkable ability to sell a story in the worst circumstances, may be hard
pushed to promote the PRI effectively.
If he succeeds, and the party wins the August election, the prize should be
a top job in the next administration. If not, the sirens of Wall Street will
surely beckon once again.

FT  18 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poor excuse for not balloting members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms BARBARA ROCHE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Paying for parties' (April 14) supports the
recommendations in Labour's minority report on the funding of political
parties that shareholders should be balloted on company donations.
When your reporter pressed Sir Ivan Lawrence at the launch of both
Conservative majority and Labour minority reports as to why this measure was
not included in the majority report, he pooh-poohed the idea, suggesting it
was not necessary and would be far too complicated for companies to
administer.
This is a poor excuse. Our minority report calls for exactly the same
regulations which apply to political donations from trade unions to be
applied to companies. In other words, that companies wishing to make
political donations should establish a political fund approved by
shareholders every 10 years, and that provision should be made for
shareholders who do not wish to contribute to opt out.
Unless such a recommendation was implemented in law the position is clearly
not going to change.
A recent survey by Pensions and Investment Research Consultants found boards
defending their decisions not to consult shareholders by claiming donations
are 'falling within the remit the management, not the shareholders' (Smith
Kline Beecham) and 'a matter for the board' (Glaxo). Where shareholders are
'consulted' the methods are often not a model of democracy: Allied Lyons
told the survey that the 'mood' of the annual meeting was in favour of a
donation, 'judging from the applause which met the chairman's comments'.
This is an issue around which democrats in all parties should unite. It is a
pity that Conservative members of the home affairs select committee have
shown so little regard for democracy and openness.

FT  18 APR 94 / The Bretton Woods twins at 50: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have every reason to
celebrate their 50th anniversary this July. Of course they have made some
bad loans and shown insensitivity on some issues, such as poverty relief and
the environment. But critics should remember that these institutions, on the
whole, championed the right causes. They advocated free markets and
conservative macroeconomics when such policies were reviled by the
developing (and developed) world's intelligentsia.
Yet at this moment of triumph the future of the Bretton Woods twins is
murky. Over the next 50 years the power and prestige of these agencies - and
many like them - is likely to decline. This should not be read as a
criticism of their mostly able and dedicated staff. It will instead reflect
profound changes in the economic landscape - changes that are already
beginning to reduce the demand for their bureaucratic services.
The fund and bank, admittedly, have adapted skilfully to changing
circumstances. The fund no longer supervises a fixed exchange rate system
(because that long ago vanished) nor is it concerned solely with short-term
macro stabilisation. The bank has long ceased to be simply a supplier of
project finance. Today, both institutions are engaged in 'policy-based'
lending; both are trying to promote structural reforms; both are concerned
with long-term development. This suggests a clearer division of labour and
some rationalisation of functions is possible, as the independent Bretton
Woods Commission is likely to recommend later this year.
But a 50th anniversary year review of their operations ought to dig a little
deeper. The fund and bank, I would argue, are engaged in three distinct
activities: the provision of economic advice; the supply of development
capital; and the certification of policies as sound or unsound. All three
activities are separable, and all three can, in principle, be provided by
the private sector.
On advice, there is now broad agreement on the market-friendly policies
likely to promote development. Private consultants are perfectly capable of
devising economic reform strategies for developing and formerly communist
countries. Meanwhile, the lifting of controls on capital flows and the
growth of pension funds and other forms of institutional investment in rich
countries has created a huge pool of mobile private capital.
From a trickle in the early 1980s, total private flows to developing
countries have become a torrent, worth about Dollars 110bn last year. They
look durable because the bulk is long-term equity and bond finance. Foreign
direct investment is now the single largest source of capital for developing
countries, rather than official aid or loans, which have stagnated.
Despite this revolution, agencies such as the fund and bank claim to have a
critical role even in the middle-income countries that can so easily attract
private capital. They say they are uniquely well placed to influence
economic policies - and thus promote development - because they can make
loans conditional on policy changes. By serving as scapegoats, they claim
they can also provide political cover for unpopular but essential domestic
reforms.
There is something in this conditionality argument. The fund and bank can
doubtless point to instances where reform would not have occurred but for
their prodding. But as the fund's problems in Russia illustrate, the
leverage of external agencies is pretty limited in the absence of a domestic
consensus for reform.
The long list of perpetual borrowers from the fund and bank illustrates the
dark side of policy-based lending. Governments promise to make reforms in
order to get loans, and then renege on their promises. After a cooling-off
period, the process repeats itself. The fund and bank thus become unwitting
obstacles to reform; their loans enable countries to pursue rotten policies
for longer than would otherwise be the case. Trying to be kind, they create
more, rather than less, misery.
The private sector alternative seems far cleaner. If a country wants to
implement market-oriented reforms, it can buy the necessary advice
privately. Once it has proved its good faith, bankers and private investors
will be clamouring at its doors. And it is not true, as some sceptics argue,
that private investors are willing to risk their shirts only in relatively
prosperous countries already under the tutelage of the bank and fund. The
example of China, which attracted more than Dollars 20bn in private inflows
last year, shows that countries with very low per capita incomes can attract
private capital without an official badge certifying good behaviour.
Yet the bank and fund are still needed. Even in a liberal global economic
order, governments must co-ordinate policies, so as to avoid destabilising
shifts in fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policy. There will still be
financial emergencies, such as the debt crisis of the early 1980s. It is in
these spheres, rather than conditional lending, that the fund has most to
offer. The bank, meanwhile, should accept that many of its historic tasks
can now be performed by private bodies; a slimmed-down agency should focus
its energies on the poorest regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where the
outlook for private investment is bleakest.
What the fund and bank can no longer deny is that the growing competence of
the private sector in all aspects of development finance logically requires
a tighter definition of their role. Public agencies, as they have long
argued, exist to perform tasks that the private sector either cannot do at
all, or cannot do well.

FT  18 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Chance to blaze regulatory trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir IAIN VALLANCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Sizing up the watchdogs' (April 15) argues the case for
moderation in changing regulatory regimes of the energy, water and
telecommunications industries. For the most part, I would agree with you and
with Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, that an
evolutionary approach is preferable to some more extreme ideas now being
suggested.
I also agree that an all powerful regulatory giant, sitting astride the
whole process, would be highly undesirable. If anything, we should be aiming
to dilute the current concentration of power in regulatory hands rather than
adding to it.
In particular, it would be wrong to lump in telecommunications with the
utilities. Telecommunications regulation is a transitional process, while
competitors establish themselves in what is now a fully open market. We
already have a decade of experience behind us. The utilities are relatively
recent arrivals on the scene and their regulation can be expected to be a
permanent feature, as there will always be a strong element of monopoly in
their markets.
Oftel provided the original experiment in UK regulation and there is an
opportunity to use it again to blaze the trail for the next stage of
regulatory evolution. There are a number of reasons why a judicious review
of the Oftel framework would be timely.
First, 10 years without any review is a long time. Second, it is becoming
increasingly clear that separate regulation of telecommunications and
broadcasting makes little sense when the two industries are evidently
converging. Third, a framework designed essentially to cater for a duopoly
in telecommunications sits uncomfortably in a market with a multiplicity of
participants.
A review of Oftel for these reasons would offer the government the
opportunity, at the same time, to try out some of the more sensible
proposals for reform that are now being advocated - such as more explicit
regulatory objectives, greater transparency, less concentration of power in
one individual, and possibly even a 'short cut' review procedure at the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But, as Sir Bryan wisely counsels, such a
review should reinforce and not undermine the current separation of powers
between regulator and department of state.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, No political career is ever damaged by praising the party leader and
who would want to stand in the way of Giles Radice's path to power. Yet I
would question his assumption (Letters, April 14) that the opposition should
not say what it is about.
We've gone too far in trying to over-compensate for our folly in offering
long and insane shopping lists in the early 1980s. Now we offer nothing much
at all. Except commissions. 'What do we want?', 'Wait and see' is hardly an
exciting slogan.
Those who want to hand power over to a European central bank don't need an
economic alternative. The electorate does and the nation is fed up with
stumbling decline, everything getting worse, the feeling that this
government cannot even find a course to be blown off. It wants to be part of
a nation which is going somewhere and which can deliver what the people
expect of the system: jobs, economic growth, rising well-being, the
maximisation of living standards. All is possible and the public have moved
ahead of us in their willingness to accept the necessary measures.
After 16 years of marching the wrong way down a dead-end street they want
leadership in a new direction. Unless we capture that tide as did Mrs
Thatcher in 1979, and Labour in 1963, we become wise, statesmanlike,
friendly, commautaire and irrelevant.

Sir, Your leading article, 'Paying for parties (April 14), on the report of
the home affairs select committee on the funding of political parties,
claims that the Labour minority called for state funding. It then goes on to
criticise us for doing so.
In fact our minority report makes no reference to state funding except to
say that we do not intend to discuss it.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEOFF WESTCOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have read with interest the recent letters concerning Channel 5
(April 13 and 14). Each of the writers has laudably stated their vested
interest and then proceeded to defend their position. It has been stated
that viewers will not wish to buy a new TV set to gain a new channel (or
channels). This is quite true in many cases, but it seems to be overlooking
the fundamental attitudes and requirements of the viewers - do we actually
want another channel?
Production standards in television seem to be lagging behind viewers'
expanding requirements; we now have Eastenders and Coronation Street three
times a week but that is 'safe' television and is hardly intellectually
stimulating. Even the so-called 'hard-hitting' documentaries have resorted
to sensationalism and mediocrity. If Channel 5 is going to provide more of
the same, irrespective of whether it is digital or analogue, is it worth
having? Mr Miles (April 14) argues that advertisers need another channel;
but do we the consumers need one?

FT  18 APR 94 / The alluring call of the Buddha: Religious loyalties
exercise increasing influence in Japanese politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Politics and religion have often been uncomfortably close in Japan. And the
two estates are getting closer these days, to the alarm of many in a country
whose postwar constitution imposes a broad but imprecise ban on religions
exercising political authority.
Japan's largest and richest religious organisation, the Buddhist sect Soka
Gakkai, is a significant, yet poorly understood, behind-the-scenes force in
the political upheavals likely to lead to the formation of a new Japanese
government this week.
Founded 64 years ago as a pacifist protest against state Shinto ritual, Soka
Gakkai is now part of the political establishment as the power behind
Komeito, the clean government party. Komeito's partnership with the
conservative Japan Renewal Party dominates policy in the fragmented
seven-party coalition. Mr Tsutomu Hata, leader of the Japan Renewal Party,
is a potential successor to former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa - though
the outcome is unclear.
Formally, Soka Gakkai and Komeito are separate organisations, but their
links run deep: all but six of Komeito's 76 members of parliament belong to
Soka Gakkai and use its 1,000 community centres to address the faithful
during election campaigns.
Komeito's opponents in the opposition Liberal Democratic party suspect that
Mr Daisaku Ikeda, Soka Gakkai's 66-year-old leader and founder of Komeito 30
years ago, still runs his old party from behind the scenes. Mr Ikeda, author
of more than 60 spiritual tomes, is portrayed by critics as a billionaire
megalomaniac. He was forced to demerge Komeito and Soka Gakkai in 1970.
Komeito was then the political department of Soka Gakkai and Mr Ikeda was
alleged to run both as personal fiefs.
But Soka Gakkai's wealth still makes it an attractive political friend.
Political parties badly need new non-corporate backers because of a law
curbing the size of political donations from any one source.
Soka Gakkai's most avid suitor is the wily Mr Ichiro Ozawa, deputy head of
the JRP. His opponents accuse him of using his alliance with Mr Yuichi
Ichikawa, Komeito secretary-general - dubbed the 'Ichi-ichi line' in Japan's
press - to dominate the coalition.
Soka Gakkai's attractions are obvious. The sect and its affiliates own a
daily newspaper with a circulation of 5.5m and a gravestone business, and it
has established its own university. The newspaper, Seikyo Simbun, the sect's
biggest cash source, reported a Y9.4bn (Pounds 62m) profit in 1991. The
group is, however, shy about divulging its precise income.
Soka Gakkai's influence also derives from its following among the
spiritually inclined in Japan's armies of salarymen. Its membership - about
8m households in Japan and 1.3m abroad - makes it the most successful of the
half-dozen new religions to have grown over the past few decades by offering
a community and spiritual dimension to city dwellers who feel their lives
lack depth.
Mr Ikeda's officials are baffled at their movement's controversial public
image. They insist its influence is benignly ethical and deny it finances
any political party. Yet they accept its increased influence imposes new
responsibilities: they have to offer a clearer vision for Japan than a bland
diet of universal harmony.
Here, the main influence is Mr Einosuke Akiya, Soka Gakkai's president and a
close friend of Mr Ikeda. 'Religion is the underlying current in human life
. . . so there is going to be some kind of involvement in politics, based on
religious ideas,' he says.
There is nothing new in this, he adds. Three years ago, Komeito helped the
former LDP government win parliamentary agreement to send peacekeepers to
help the United Nations in Cambodia.
Mr Akiya wants Japan to play a greater role under a UN-based international
system, on which he is deliberately vague. But he has clearer views on
development aid. 'Japan must do more than merely provide international aid
to satisfy its obligations to the world community,' he says. It must discuss
aid projects with recipients, and send more aid workers into the field.
The sect does not, however, plan to impose a parliamentary whip on Komeito
members, he says. It does not have to. At least one Diet member has found
offending Mr Ikeda left him no option but to resign.
Komeito politicians see no constitutional problem in bringing Buddhism to
politics - if the party and sect stay institutionally separate. 'Yes, Soka
Gakkai supports us electorally, but Komeito handles its own political
business,' says Mr Akihiro Ohta, Komeito's vice-secretary general.
Dr Masami Kita, economics professor at Soka University, likens the
relationship with Komeito to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland's support
for the Labour Party in the 19th century. 'Soka Gakkai members are awakening
to their political responsibilities and exercising their political rights,'
he says.
The benefits to Komeito of the relationship are clear. It regularly pulls in
7m votes at general elections and is rarely defeated in any seat on which it
can afford to concentrate resources. Its election candidates address the
faithful at the end of monthly Soka Gakkai worship sessions. Their speeches
usually follow a simulcast talk over a central television screen in each of
the sect's community centres by Mr Ikeda, offering moral guidance from the
lives of a wide range of figures from Beethoven to Napoleon.
Part of Soka Gakkai's appeal, say members, is to bring spiritual freedom to
people who feel oppressed, as did its two founders, who were jailed as
'thought criminals' for challenging the monopoly of state Shinto of the
1930s.
The movement expanded fast after the second world war, under Mr Ikeda's
leadership. Another surge came in the 1960s from the first generations of
salarymen, often sent to Tokyo to live in company dormitories away from
their families. Soka Gakkai even went to the trouble of providing a laundry
service for the faithful.
But Soka Gakkai's membership has stagnated in recent years. New religious
converts have flocked to younger fringe groups, such as the
ultra-nationalist Institute for Research into Human Happiness, or to
Agon-shu, which uses its own satellite television station to blast healing
psychic power at the faithful.
Even before the recent spiritual revival, the Japanese showed a unique
capacity to follow several faiths at once, suggesting a dilettante approach
to religion which could rebound on Soka Gakkai. At last count, the
government's cultural affairs agency knew of 231,000 Japanese religious
sects with 215m members - more than 1 1/2 times the nation's population of
124m.
Soka Gakkai's inability to benefit more from this religious revival may
result partly from the damage to its image when a safe belonging to a former
director of its newspaper, containing Y175m, was found discarded on a
Yokohama rubbish dump in 1989.
The coalition government even felt it necessary three months ago to make a
small increase in the low tax rate on religious groups' business profits, in
response to public criticism of the tax privileges allowed to Soka Gakkai
and other rich movements.
The sect's image may equally have been harmed by its mass excommunication
three years ago from the 700-year-old Nichiren Shoshu Buddhist sect on which
its teachings are based. Mr Ikeda's followers had accused the Nichiren monks
of 'playing golf and living madly spendthrift lives'.
Mr Akiya is undismayed and likens the split to Christian protestants'
breakaway from the Catholic church. 'We have been liberated,' he says.
Despite its ambivalent public profile, Soka Gakkai will be part of Japanese
public life for some time. It is so powerful that the wobbly coalitions
likely to run Japan for the foreseeable future cannot afford to offend it.

It survived Ken Russell, complete with fantasy sequences and orchestrations
by Peter Maxwell Davies. Now at an age when demure discretion is expected,
Sandy Wilson's ersatz 1920s frivolity taps, charlestons and high-kicks its
enchanting way through a fortieth birthday season at the little theatre
under the Charing Cross arches where it first saw the light of
post-austerity day.
Forty-first, to be precise, but who would be so ungallant as to point out
that the first, short version of this flapper-age pastiche appeared in 1953,
while the full-length edition for the West End dates from January 1954? In a
time of sexual equality, boyfriends, like girlfriends, are presumably
entitled to arithmetical discretion.
In fact the new production by Maria Charles, the first Dulcie, has wrought a
certain old D'Oyly Cartery on the piece, apparently recreating the original
down to the last squeal and flounce. Not that there is much else you can do
with the show, a perfect crystallisation of sweet, silly 1920s musicals
perceived from a viewpoint part nostalgic, part amused, wholly affectionate.
The songs ('I could be happy with you', 'A room in Bloomsbury', 'It's never
too late to fall in love') could be taken for the authentic period product.
Disley Jones's bright designs are framed by a rose-clustered trellis. The
Villa Caprice Finishing School is rightly dominated by Judith Bruce's Madame
Dubonnet, her fractured Anglo-Gallic diphthongs indicating kinship with
Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau. She strikes the right blend of
involvement and ironic detachment - for all its resilience, the piece needs
a delicate stylistic balance. I remember a Bristol Old Vic production
somewhat overwhelmed by Eleanor Bron's conviction that she was the funniest
thing on stage.
As the millionaire's lovelorn daughter Polly Browne, Gemma Page has the
right whitish, genteel English light soprano, very authentic. Unlike Twiggy
in the film, she refrains from tap-dancing, but Oliver Hickey as Tony
(messenger-boy-cum-fugitive-from-the-peerage) dashingly makes up for it.
Occasionally one guiltily yearns for Ken Russell's forbidden, and over-ripe,
fruit: Jane Stoggles' jolly French maid is in the Hattie Jacques rather than
the Barbara Windsor tradition. State education has left us with enunciation
less Coward of Mayfair than Heath of Broadstairs ('If Mme Dubonnet feound
eout I'd be asked to leave under a cleoud') but for the most part the shrill
cut-glass accents pass for diamonds.
Wilson's rhymes strike one yet again with their insouciant ingenuity, well
up to Cole Porter standard ('I don't claim that I am psychic/But one look at
you and I kick/Away every scruple/I learnt as a pupil/In school, my dear').
The band (piano, percussion, bass) is under the direction of Geoffrey Brawn,
almost as much an institution as The Boy Friend itself.

FT  18 APR 94 / Arts: A language for the Zulu Tolstoys - Novelist Justin
Cartwright asks if art must be a political weapon in the new South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUSTIN CARTWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up on the slopes of Table Mountain, looking across the Cape Flats towards
the distant purplish mountains, Cape Town University is blessed with a
beautiful campus in a unique setting. The main buildings are built in local
stone; a large figure of Cecil Rhodes gazes north from a comfortable sitting
position. From the arts block, home to John Coetzee and Andre Brink, this
view is marred on closer inspection by the sprawl of the townships and
squatter camps which starts just at the point where the suburbs end and the
wind-swept flatlands begin. It stretches as far as the eye can see along the
once pristine sweep of False Bay. The university and the Cape Peninsula are
now separated from the rest of the country by an isthmus of misery.
It is not surprising with this reminder of the true state of the nation,
this painful contrast between the serene university and the squalid
townships, that teachers of the arts are suffering a crisis of identity. No
academic I spoke to has come to terms with the role of culture in the new
South Africa. With people dying in ever-increasing numbers and a grim
realisation that the new South Africa may in some ways be worse than the
old, the cultural debate has urgency but little cogency.
One of South Africa's finest essayists, Stephen Watson, describes his
feelings one day as he was preparing to lecture at the university: 'I was
forced to realise with a feeling akin to vertigo . . . that I no longer knew
what I was saying.' Watson found himself overwhelmed by the conflicting
claims of university as ivory tower and as 'site of struggle'. In some
degree every academic in the old, white, universities has suffered this
confusion.
The reasons, apart from the sheer scale of the deprivation, are not hard to
understand. Saul Bellow famously asked: where is the Zulu Tolstoy? Here the
questions are, if there is a Zulu Tolstoy, how is he going to come to our
notice? In what language is he going to be published? What - white -
academic is going to unearth him? And what Scandinavian country is going to
subsidise his airfares to international seminars? A number of academics
suggested to me that their work in township poetry, drama and workshops was
their justification for continuing to teach English literature. Others have
shied away from any notion of relevance. The relevance of JM Coetzee's bleak
novels to the South African predicament could hardly be greater, yet his
work is coded and freed of partisan content by being set in placeless and
timeless shadowlands. Nadine Gordimer, by contrast, believes in direct
participation in the cultural and political struggles, both as sponsor of
the Congress of South African Writers and ANC member. Her writing, too, is
clearly set in time and place. If she is sanguine about the prospect of the
ANC becoming just another political party, others find it difficult to
accept that they should now show allegiance to a party after years of
fighting for principles.
But while hundreds of people are dying each week, it is perhaps unsurprising
that the coercive language of progressive thinking is flourishing. In some
quarters the term 'cultural worker' is used without irony to describe anyone
in the arts or teaching fields. That this demonstrates a fondness for the
language of totalitarianism, seems not to worry the ideologues. There is, of
course, resistance to the notion, expressed by the ANC's cultural
department, that the refusal to take sides is itself a form of taking sides.
As Watson says, no artist, indeed no man, is obliged to give up his freedom
by speaking in the language of the day. This is quite a different issue from
the poet Jeremy Cronin's plea in his poem To Learn How To Speak that South
African writers must 'learn how to speak with the voices of the land'. The
one is a legacy of seminars in Eastern Bloc countries, the other is an
artistic desire to find a new South African voice.
At the heart of the marriage between ANC and communists is a historical
compromise which makes it difficult to know where the new government will
stand on many issues. The Marxist element finds culture itself suspect.
Something in its very nature is seen to be elitist. This leads to some
dangerously nave conclusions. The Zulu Tolstoys should not be discriminated
against just because they cannot write English. Some way must be found for
liberating their writing from the hegemony of colonial language.
(Colonialism is a protean term. It covers anything which smacks of
Eurocentrism. One lecturer told me that if she wants to attract an audience
for Jane Austen she includes the word in her description of the course: Jane
Austen, colonial norms in pre-feminist society.) And because the townships
were, as Watson says, the crucibles of resistance, it is logical to believe
that the most responsive art will emerge there. There is little evidence
that this is so. Indeed, with the exodus to the suburbs of the educated it
is unlikely ever to come to pass. Thanks to the struggle and Bantu
Education, no major black literary figures have emerged since the
generations of Lewis Nkosi and Wally Serote. Real progress, Nadine Gordimer
says, has been made in the theatre where black actors are highly
influential. The Market Theatre of Johannesburg has earned a reputation
worldwide for its invigorating and challenging productions.
Albie Sachs, the lawyer and ANC activist who was maimed in a car bombing in
Mozambique in 1988, caused a furore by suggesting in an ANC discussion paper
that culture was not a weapon of the struggle. Perhaps in his travels he saw
too much of socialist realism. The way he puts it is: 'We (the ANC) want to
give leadership to the people, not exercise control over them.' The counter
argument, sometimes explicit, often implicit, is that all hands are required
at the pumps. One poet suggested to me that while artists have personal
freedom, they must study the struggle and learn from it. She seemed not to
have considered the possibility that there could be more than one outcome of
the prescribed study.
The protagonists are going to have something to get their teeth into the
moment the issue of the theatrical and ballet companies and symphony
orchestras is addressed by the new structures. ('Structures' is a word you
cannot avoid in South Africa at the moment.) The bulk of government arts
funding has gone into huge, ugly buildings housing these companies. Largely
white audiences go to see largely white musicians and dancers performing the
works of dead, white males. Sachs himself claims to have attended the Cape
Town Symphony every Thursday religiously since his return in 1991 but he
cannot see how the massive subsidies to foreign musicians can be maintained.
A scramble for realignment is going on, with the old organisations trying
desperately to prove their credentials. For example, the strangely embalmed
Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal has instituted creative workshops
and appointed a black director for the Windybrow Theatre. Township theatre
groups have sprung up. Oral poets are being published. Northern Transvaal
woodcarvers have many new admirers.
Behind this nervous quadrille are worrying questions: Who is to be the
arbiter of taste? Who is to decide what is subsidised and what is dependent
upon the free market? Is it to be the ANC's cultural department, or is it to
be an independent Arts Council? To some this is as important an issue as
whether or not the new government will attempt to force the economy along
statist lines. It is an issue, like so much else in South Africa, which will
depend on which tendency of the ANC triumphs in the next five years.

The first monarch to bear the name of Windsor, so shrewd about the
burgerlich values to be projected via such mass media as the rapidly
spreading wireless, was woefully deficient in warmth and communicativeness
in his immediate circle.
His posterity have unconsciously had their revenge on the patriarch by using
the mass media to undermine the image of familial propriety. Snoo Wilson's
new play at Theatre Clwyd, Mold, off to Glasgow in three weeks, reminds us
of the scandal that rocked the dynasty over half a century ago. It also
emphasises how lucky we were to be rid of Edward VIII.
On a circular dais, like the face of giant sun-dial, the Duke and Duchess of
Windsor pace out their gilded exile in wartime governorship of the Bahamas.
Given Wilson's fizzingly imaginative way with history (he has a notable
arabesque on Shakespeare and Elizabeth I to his credit), we expect an
irreverent, perhaps surreal, bagatelle. In fact we get a duologue full of
the sort of anecdote, reminiscence and explanation inevitable with
historical subjects, smacking of research but only occasionally igniting
theatrically.
Wallis resents David's abdication. He adores her in a helpless, nice but dim
sort of way. She is obsessed to the point of paranoia by other people's
animosity, corroded by Britain's refusal to accord her royal status.
David has entrusted a shady businessman with Nazi sympathies with Dollars
2m; and the first act ends with the murder of local millionaire, Sir Harry
Oakes. There follows a hypothetical explanation of the Duke's historical
blunder in summoning police help from Miami without informing American or
British authorities. None of this is especially gripping since we know
little of the other characters. The play has little point beyond reiterating
that David was in sexual thrall to Wallis.
Giles Havergal's direction can do little with such a static piece beyond sit
the two characters down or stand them up, facing different directions. Maria
Aitken elaborately opens and closes her legs and stylishly delivers the
work's one flight of fancy, a dream combining images of sex and wealth.
David Yelland, pudgily resembling the Duke, grovels at her feet with a
slightly too plummy voice: royals then sounded less posh than BBC
announcers.

Monday is Monday; not the jolliest night of the week to come home ready to
laugh at two new office sitcoms. Still, you can always try.
Men of the World (8.30, BBC1) stars David Threlfall as a travel agent keen
to teach an innocent young colleague a thing or two about worldly wisdom.
Well . . . we'll see. It is cheering to note that Brenda Bruce - a comic
actress for any day of the week - features in the first programme of the
series.
The 10%ers (9.30 ITV) launches a seven-part comedy sitcom charting the ways
and wiles of Eden Management, a West End talent agency. This will make a
change from The Laurence Olivier Awards (9.00 BBC2): fun for luvvies but not
much cop for serious theatre-goers.
Two documentaries for serious Monday viewers: Horizon: After the Flood (8.00
BBC2) wonders whether prevention controls actually make a flood disaster
worse - the Mississippi floods last year were the worst in Old Glory's
recorded history, after all; and Soweto - A History (10.55 C4) which looks
at the huge city that has set political and cultural trends in South Africa.

FT  18 APR 94 / Arts: The Mill is not on the Floss - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Eliot (1819-1880) confided to a friend in 1860: 'the Mill is not even
on the Floss.' By the same token, at the Oxford Playhouse, the Shared
Experience touring production of The Mill on the Floss is nowhere near
Eliot. But it is no less enjoyable for that, and makes a laudable attempt at
a difficult task.
The play starts with Maggie Tulliver reading about witches and drowning.
This sets the tone for Maggie's unconventional life and watery death. Then
follows the familiar story of the fall of the house of Tulliver, the death
of Maggie's father, her venal aunts and uncles, her love for the son of the
man who ruined her family, and her passionate affair with her cousin's
fiancee. And a river runs through it.
Eliot works on the page and on film but not on stage because she needs a
fixed point of view - one narrator or one camera. The theatre has too many
possibilities. Shared Experience solved the technical problems better in
their recent Anna Karenina and A Handful of Dust by giving the actors some
of the narrative, allowing them to introduce each other. But here, the first
half is a jumbled sequence of events which would be hard to follow without
some Eliot pre-history. The second half works better because the characters
are known.
Eliot was more interested in abstracts than this production allows. She was
a Victorian agony aunt, having her characters speak truths about their
situation and ours: 'Being unhappy can become a bad habit.' Eliot's world is
all duties, ties and promises, the invisible bonds that make a community.
And that way of seeing life works better in print than on stage.
However, the production brilliantly has three Maggies: rebellious child,
pious young woman and passionate, sensitive adult making a prime time
Freudian tripartite personality. She would be a cert for Oprah Winfrey: 'And
what was the child in you telling you to do at that time?'
Shirley Henderson (young Maggie) is a fine actor; she brings poise, passion
and just enough idiosyncrasy to the part. Around her, Simeon Andrews as her
father and Ian Puleston-Davies as the brother who grows into him are both
solid; Helen Schlesinger as the adult Maggie is a riot of indecision. She
gives the lie to anyone who thinks Eliot cannot be presented sexily.
Elsewhere the acting is surer than the slippy regional accents, which will
hamper the proposed European tour. The set is commendably succinct  - a
stripped-out mill interior with ropes and grain sacks; and the costumes are
a delight, especially when Maggie casts off the penitential blue serge and
steps into a wicked black lace evening gown for a fateful charity ball.
Nancy Meckler and Polly Teale direct Helen Edmundson's adaptation. They have
taken on a difficult task, and have done better work with other adaptations.
But that is George Eliot's fault.

FT  18 APR 94 / The Monday Interview: Henderson in from the cold - The man
at the centre of Britain's arms-for-Iraq trial re-enters the business arena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Henderson, the businessman at the heart of Britain's Iraqgate affair,
was not easy to single out amid the clutter of the workaday exhibits at a UK
machine tools fair in Birmingham last week. But his anonymity - sitting in
the temporary stand numbered 3056 in the huge exhibition hall - belied how
much he has learned about how to promote himself when he needs to.
On the day John Major, the prime minister, visited the fair, Henderson -
silver-haired and with the looks of an ageing television soap opera actor -
chose to announce he was setting up a business partnership with John
Butcher, the Tory MP and former junior minister for trade and industry.
Henderson's resurrection from what had seemed business oblivion is not
without its ironies. Butcher's assessment of his partner as a patriotic,
unfairly maligned businessman conflicts directly with that of Lord
Trefgarne, another former trade minister. It was Trefgarne who, in a public
hearing on the arms-for-iraq inquiry held by Lord Justice Scott at the end
of March, accused Henderson of lying.
With his new venture - the takeover of welding company Production Systems
International - Henderson hopes to return to the business mainstream he was
suddenly ejected from when in February 1991 he was charged with breaking
government export regulations.
He was no stranger to publicity. In the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
Henderson had already raised eyebrows as the managing director of Matrix
Churchill, the Midlands-based machine tool company under Iraqi ownership.
The case against him, which collapsed, was that Matrix Churchill broke
export regulations by supplying Iraq with machine tools destined to help
make arms. During the trial in November 1992 Henderson's defence lawyers
revealed he had worked for British intelligence.
The government is still counting the cost of the ill-fated legal action.
Later this week Henderson's solicitor plans to present the arms-for-Iraq
inquiry with further evidence that British officials were involved in
approving the export to Iraq of dual-use machine tools capable of military
applications.
Since the trial found him not guilty, the 57-year-old businessman has been a
thorn in the flesh of government and Whitehall. Much of the evidence heard
at subsequent public hearings appears to have strengthened the public
perception that the Matrix Churchill trial should never have taken place.
'I've met a wide spectrum of people since the Scott inquiry got under way,
complete strangers who have come up to me and said how absolutely disgusted
they are by what the government did,' says Henderson.
Allies like his new business partner portray him as a patriot and unfairly
maligned businessman. His detractors - and it is not surprising that there
are many within Whitehall - see him as a publicity seeker.
He has attended the Scott inquiry on and off as a member of the public,
never always making himself available for comment on evidence relating to
his case. Such exposure has put pressures on his family life but he says his
availability to the media is part of a personal crusade to bring to light
the injustice and double-dealing of a government system to which he had
always felt loyal.
He counts among his favourite family portraits that of his son David, a
soldier of the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards being presented to the Queen
at a royal cocktail party.
Certainly Henderson adopts a disarmingly straightforward manner when he
describes the most controversial aspect of his working life: his recruitment
by the British intelligence services. 'I agreed to work for the intelligence
services for two reasons,' he says. 'The first was the glamour . . . the
second was simply, if I could help my country why not? In all honesty, at
that stage the glamour aspect was more attractive to me than the
patriotism.'
An MI6 officer code-named Balsom, who was Henderson's controller, has
described him as an 'extremely brave man'. Balsom says: 'Few people I have
met would take such risks and take them so much in their stride, with all
the pressures on them.'
Yet Henderson believes the intelligence services betrayed him as much as any
other government department. He may once have got a kick out of leading a
double life, but today he regrets his recruitment.
'When intelligence services get involved with businessmen, they must be
prepared to account for their actions. What I have learnt out of all this is
something I would have preferred not to have learnt: that the British
government I believed in was duplicitous.'
Yet there are very different accounts of Henderson's behaviour. In his
evidence to Scott, Lord Trefgarne described a meeting he had with Henderson
to establish exactly what Matrix Churchill was selling to the Iraqis: 'I
don't think I could have done more than look him in the eye and ask him what
the machine tools were for. He told me. I now believe he deceived me.'
Those who have distanced themselves from Henderson in recent months include
Mark Gutteridge, his former business partner. Gutteridge has not only
severed business links, but has kept a personal distance from Henderson in
recent months.
Businessmen within the machine tool industry are angry about the negative
publicity British exporters have received in the Matrix Churchill trial and
the Scott inquiry.
Henderson's business venture announced last week has been treated with
scepticism. 'Henderson is a salesman, not a businessman,' commented one
executive. Many will be watching closely to see whether he has the skills to
build up the small welding group which only broke even last year.

FT  18 APR 94 / People: Greenwald flies friendless skies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'There's never been a problem I don't like solving,' said Gerald Greenwald,
chairman-designate of United Airlines, the biggest US carrier, last week.
'And I like working with human nuance.'
It is just as well: for as boss of an airline that has been targeted for the
world's biggest-ever employee buy-out, the 58-year-old former Chrysler
vice-chairman could find himself facing problems and nuances a-plenty in his
new role.
Under a deal hammered out by United's management and labour unions - but yet
to be approved by shareholders - the airline's employees have agreed to big
pay cuts and other labour concessions in return for a controlling stake in
the company.
It is a bold endeavour, but nobody knows quite how worker control will pan
out. Who, for example, is to say that employees will not cripple the company
by voting themselves big pay rises once they have a foot in the boardroom
door?
Greenwald, the unions' nominee for the chairmanship, clearly relishes the
challenge ahead.
In a New York presentation aimed at selling the deal to United's
shareholders, he spoke repeatedly in terms of making history with the
buy-out.
In one sense, history has already turned full circle. Four years ago
Greenwald was heir apparent to Lee Iacocca as Chrysler's chairman when he
abruptly left the car maker to head an earlier union buy-out plan at United.
That buy-out collapsed, however, leaving Greenwald to join Dillon Read, a
Wall Street investment bank, before going on to head the restructuring of
Olympia &amp; York Developments, the failed Canadian property development group.
Now established as a bit of a trouble-shooter, Greenwald is currently
chairman of Tetra, a Czech Republic truck company, where he has been
retained until February 1995 to turn the company around. But United is where
he really belongs, he says, even though he has no previous airline
experience.
He must be spending many a quiet hour praying that United's shareholders
agree.

FT  18 APR 94 / People: Boonstra's light switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has tapped yet another high-flyer in
marketing to strengthen its board and bolster its return to profitability.
The company, traditionally strong in inventing products but not always as
successful at selling them, will appoint Cornelis Boonstra, former president
and chief operating officer of Sara Lee, the US-based food and personal
products group, to the head of its lighting operations in the summer.
Boonstra, a 56-year-old Dutchman, will also join the management board and
look after activities in the Asia-Pacific Region.
Boonstra, whose abrupt departure from Sara Lee in January came as a complete
surprise, is scheduled to replace Einar Kloster, who is stepping down from
lighting in July to return to his native Norway. Significantly, however,
Boonstra will be given a place on the board, expanding its membership to six
directors. Kloster, a scion of Norway's Kloster shipping family who spent
more than 30 years with Philips, never belonged to the management board,
though he did sit on the wider group management committee.
The appointment of Boonstra, whose 'heavy-weight' status as a top US
corporate executive puts him in the running as a potential heir to Jan
Timmer, Philips' president, is part of the group's search for marketing
expertise.
The move also extends the trend at Philips towards giving top jobs to
outsiders with extensive international experience.
Earlier, Pierre Everaert, a Belgian-born naturalised American, was coaxed
away from the chairmanship of Ahold, the Dutch food retailer with several
supermarket chains in the US.
Philips also recently announced that Floris Maljers, chairman of the Dutch
arm of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch soap-to-margarine manufacturer, will become
chairman of the group's supervisory board, a position usually filled by
retired Philips executives.

FT  18 APR 94 / People: Into Bank Negara's hot seat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ahmad Mohamed Don steps into the hot seat as governor of Bank Negara,
Malaysia's central bank, on May 1. Late last month Bank Negara announced
foreign exchange trading losses for 1993 of MDollars 5.7bn (Dollars 2.1bn).
Subsequently Jaffar Hussein, the central bank's governor for the last nine
years, announced his resignation, writes Kieran Cooke.
Ahmad, a 47-year-old British trained chartered accountant, has a tough job
on his hands. Bank Negara's 1993 forex loss followed on from a deficit of
over MDollars 9bn the previous year.
For the past three years Ahmad has been chief executive and managing
director of Malayan Banking or Maybank, the country's biggest financial
institution. He joined Maybank in 1982 as head of its treasury division
where he earned a reputation as a highly successful head of foreign currency
trading operations.
He will be reviewing his new bank's overall foreign exchange trading policy.
The Malaysian finance ministry recently instructed Bank Negara to stop its
'excessive' foreign exchange dealings.

The attack took place near the town of Abu Tig, on the Nile 340 km south of
Cairo, at about midnight.
Eight trains have been attacked in roughly the same area this year. The
attacks have had a devastating effect on the tourist industry.

FT  18 APR 94 / Management: Another string to their bow - Arts managers in
search of business skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY

<TEXT>
One minute Felix Warnock was playing bassoon in the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment. The next he was running it. As general manager he found
himself drawing up business plans, budgets and new management structures. It
was a far cry from baroque music.
The arts is full of people like Warnock, who clamber into management by
virtue of being good bassoonists, singers, actors. While lawyers and
accountants also become senior managers on the basis of their skills as
practitioners, they tend to be better prepared for their new
responsibilities. Arts managers are expected to adapt to their new jobs
without outside help.
The business school route is closed to them. The cost of a one-week course,
around Pounds 2,500, could make the difference for some arts companies
between profit and loss.
Business in the Arts is attempting to fill the gap with a scheme, sponsored
by English Estates, for sending arts managers on management courses. So far
nearly 50 managers have been put through the mill, and are now attempting to
apply business school recipes to their dance groups, orchestras, theatres,
galleries and museums.
Budget reductions over the last decade have meant that arts organisations
have needed all the management skills on offer. 'There has been a revolution
in the last 10 years. No one in the arts is owed a living anymore,' says
Barbara Woroncow, director of Yorkshire and Humberside Museums. 'We all need
training. Most of us are handling public money. If people had better
training they could make better use of the money.'
One might have expected some mutual culture shock in plunging an arts
manager into the sterile world of the business school. For a start they talk
a different language: the average arts manager has never heard of total
quality management, and has little idea of what a stakeholder is. Meanwhile,
their counterparts in business have no conception of the realities of
running a museum or opera company.
'For the first few days I was definitely regarded as an oddity,' says
Warnock, who attended the Leadership in Management course at Sundridge Park,
Kent. Ian Ritchie, general manager of Opera North, felt that colleagues on
his course at Ashridge 'didn't see how somebody like me was actually running
a serious business'. But by the end of the week, the similarities between
arts companies and a regular business appeared more remarkable than the
differences.
On the Making Change Work programme, Ritchie and his course-mates agreed
that the problems of managing change were similar whether they were selling
reinsurance or putting on operas. On the leadership course it emerged that
the difficulties of motivating people are the same whether they are
musicians or bank clerks.
'The issues they raise are very similar,' says Susan Segal-Horn at the
Cranfield School of Management. 'Arts companies need to be able to manage
downsizing and outsourcing, to decide where to invest resources and, above
all, manage short-term and long-term strategic change. These issues are bog
standard. They are the same for Marks &amp; Spencer, for transportation
companies, for everyone.'
Many arts managers, though, believe their problems are especially tricky.
Ritchie argues that Opera North is as complex as a multinational, although
he employs only 160 people and has a turnover of just Pounds 9m. He says the
financial constraints are especially onerous. 'People were amazed that my
annual objective is to achieve breakeven. A swing of 1 per cent means
missing the target by Pounds 80,000. Others said they did not have targets
that tight.'
As well as confirming how difficult their jobs were, the courses provided
the arts managers with some concrete help. Woroncow claims to have returned
from her strategic management course at Cranfield 'with a missionary zeal'.
Her first action was to commission Leeds University Business School to do a
customer relations survey of her 180 client museums.
She then tore up the existing corporate plan, which she saw to be a muddle
of aspirations, and replaced it with precise measurable targets. Next, she
signed up for Investors in People. Finally, she took her staff through the
exercises she had learnt. 'The course helped me to think in a structured way
of the business environment. I had lots of information, but didn't have the
tool kit to analyse where changes were coming from, and which were the most
important in the short, medium and long term.'
Warnock, who since the course has moved sideways to the new position of arts
administrator, says his main lesson was the need to listen harder to the
views of his colleagues. Ritchie is still hoping to find time to go through
the wad of paper he accumulated on the course.
Some of the arts managers felt they taught their business colleagues a thing
or two. 'The others found my presence refreshing,' says Ritchie. 'I was
talking about change in organic terms. One can be very theoretical about
techniques of making things happen, but can lose sight of the structure as a
fluid thing.'
While all enjoyed their week's immersion, they are wary of any trend to
elevate general skills of management above those of creativity. Warnock
warns that 'management training can be destructive if it is too narrow.
There are very few people at London Business School who understand how an
orchestra really works. You need 60 people to play a Beethoven symphony. It
would seem logical to pare it down, but you can't'

FT  18 APR 94 / Business Travel: When it pays to check your policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you were dispatched on a business trip at an hour's notice, would your
medical bills be covered if you had an accident? Even if you were given more
notice, would you check the cover offered by company travel insurance?
Managers of small companies and the self-employed need to be particularly
careful that accidents or losses abroad do not leave them out of pocket.
Insurers say a growing number of people are taking out annual travel
insurance policies, which provide cover for any number of trips in a year
and eliminate the need for last-minute arrangements. Columbus, the
specialist travel insurer, says sales of annual policies rose 39 per cent
over the past year.
For anyone who travels regularly, an annual policy is often cheaper than
buying insurance for each trip separately. Most annual policies cover
business trips, but do check - a few, such as NatWest's and Abbey
National's, exclude them.
There is usually a limit for each trip of two or three months; a few cheaper
policies impose an overall annual limit for time spent outside the UK -
about 150 days.
Premiums for a single person vary from about Pounds 75 to about Pounds 140.
Most annual policies provide at least Pounds 1m cover each for medical
expenses and personal liability.
Differences on other details - such as cancellation and curtailment, legal
expenses, compensation for delays, and lost or delayed baggage - can be
marked. Cancellation cover ranges from Pounds 1,000 with Columbus's most
basic policy to Pounds 12,500 with the American Express Premier policy.
Some insurers offer a choice of cover. If you never go outside Europe, why
pay extra to cover potential hospital bills in the US? And if your home
contents policy covers personal belongings outside the home, why pay to
cover luggage a second time? Bradford &amp; Bingley building society gives a 20
per cent discount to Pounds 79.60 to anybody whose luggage is already
covered.
Anyone planning to ski or go scuba diving should check the small print. Most
annual policies include limited skiing cover (usually 17 days a year), but
some exclude it.
Most annual insurance can be extended to cover your spouse and/or children
for less than the price of another individual policy.

FT  18 APR 94 / Business Travel: Catching a common code - What the
Delta-Virgin link-up means for passengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's tie-up between Delta of the US and the UK's Virgin Atlantic, the
latest in a series of transatlantic deals, might lead some to conclude that
a revolution in business travel is in the offing.
It is not, say airline industry executives privately. The business of 'code
sharing', the centrepiece of these deals, is largely to do with the
financial health of the airlines and does little for passengers. It may even
mean some people feeling misled about which airline they are flying.
Code sharing allows airlines to book passengers on each others' flights.
Code-sharing partnerships include British Airways and USAir, Dutch carrier
KLM and US airline Northwest, and the triple alliance of Delta, Swissair and
Singapore Airlines. One of the biggest yet, between United Airlines of the
US and Germany's Lufthansa, is scheduled to start this year.
In practice, code sharing means a passenger in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
could ask the travel agent for a flight to London's Heathrow airport and be
given a Delta ticket. That ticket will have a flight number beginning 'DL'
and show that the flight goes via New York's JFK. The passenger might then
fly Delta to New York and from there to London on Virgin.
For the airlines, the advantage is clear. They can plug into each other's
networks, claiming, for example, that they fly to destinations serviced by
the partner's aircraft. They are able to advertise more destinations, and
marketing is cheaper because costs can be shared within what is effectively
a larger network.
The risk for passengers is that they might book a flight with one airline
and travel on another. 'It is something akin to false pretences if this is
not made clear when the ticket is bought,' says an executive with an
independent airline organisation.
Virgin is at pains to say that its agreement with Delta is 'transparent' -
that passengers will know exactly what is happening when they inquire about
their flight. It points out that there are other aspects of the deal that
benefit passengers more directly. Virgin will share Delta's JFK terminal so
the connection is easier. Moreover, the airlines are linking frequent-flyer
programmes, so mileage points can be earned on either.
Similar co-operative arrangements are in place with the likes of Northwest
and KLM, and BA and USAir. But it is possible to achieve them without
code-sharing deals - as Virgin has done with British Midland and BA has with
Cathay Pacific.

FT  18 APR 94 / Business Travel: Bucharest bustle - Virginia Marsh offers
tips on visiting the city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bucharest's most powerful landmark is the massive white marble, gold and
concrete monstrosity that the late dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, named the
Palace of the People. This weekend, this monument to megalomania takes on a
new role. It will house the heads of state and other dignitaries attending
the Crans Montana Economic Forum - the first big international conference in
Romania since Ceausescu's overthrow in 1989.
The city is undergoing rapid change. Cars imported from the west choke the
main boulevards, which are lined with smart new cafes, showrooms filled with
foreign goods, and dozens of small boutiques and food shops. Foreign and
local companies vie for the billboard space along the road from the recently
modernised airport.
Every morning peasants fill the city's many open air markets with their
wares: round smoked cheeses encased in wax, soft white goat's cheese, cured
country hams, sour cream, fresh herbs and spices.
However, Bucharest remains a frustrating place to visit. The following tips
should help: At the airport, the traveller must stand in two queues, one to
buy a visa (Dollars 35), the other to have the freshly stamped document
examined by immigration. It is probably not worth getting a visa in advance:
the best tactic is to fight your way off the aircraft in order to be first
in the visa queue.
Book your hotel room. Bucharest's few business hotels are often full. Demand
has pushed up prices to international levels despite the generally lower
standards.
Most of the big hotels are within easy walking distance of the main
commercial district. The InterContinental, in the central university square,
remains first choice. The elegant but down-at-heel Hotel Continental is
popular with frequent visitors, such as World Bank or IMF officials, while
the Hotel Bucuresti is useful for those with political interests -
out-of-town MPs fill one-third of its rooms.
Ask your hotel to send a car to collect you from the airport, for Dollars 14
to Dollars 22. Taxi drivers usually try to charge a lot more for the 15km
ride. Take cash, preferably dollars; credit cards and travellers' cheques
are not widely accepted. Licensed exchange houses (Casa de Schimb) often
offer better rates than hotels or banks, which are crowded and open only in
the morning. Avoid changing money on the street: swindlers abound.
Take the right clothes: Bucharest is very hot in the summer and very cold in
the winter. Business dress is not formal: jacket and tie for men, dress or
skirt for women. Avoid running out of your favourite shampoo or toothpaste.
Basic items can be hard to find. Allow enough time between appointments:
punctuality is not a Romanian strong point. Meetings tend to ramble on,
especially if you are using a translator, although English and French are
widely spoken. The telecommunications system is terrible, so do not count on
making or receiving international and domestic calls easily. If possible,
make international calls early in the morning or late at night, when the
lines are less busy.
The system is being modernised, but this means that telephone numbers change
constantly. If you have problems reaching contacts, call international
directory inquiries.
At this time of year, Romanians start opening their roadside Terasa
(terraces), where you can recover from a day of protracted negotiations over
a beer or a glass of wine or Tuica, the fiery local plum brandy. La
Premiera, behind the national theatre, is one of the best.
Afterwards, it's worth wandering off the main boulevards into one of the old
residential areas, where you can catch a glimpse of the richness of
pre-communist Bucharest. Transylvanian turrets, dripping with Belle Epoque
plaster work, and wrought iron and neo-Gothic villas stand alongside
eastern-looking Orthodox churches and classic 1930s apartment blocks. This
architecture provides the perfect antidote to Ceausescu's palace.

FT  18 APR 94 / Management: Outsiders welcome - US companies are developing
workforce diversity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a lecture room in the Bank of Boston, an executive is pretending to
declare his homosexuality. He is taunted, laughed at and ignored for half an
hour by his co-workers. When this role-playing exercise is over, he talks
about how it felt to be an outsider.
The employees are taking part in a diversity training course, which aims to
attune them better to the feelings of others. The bank's management hopes
that when they return to the office, the trainees will show more willingness
to work not only with homosexual colleagues, but with any co-workers who are
different from them.
Through diversity training and other programmes, US corporations are
attempting to grapple with the opportunities and challenges of an employee
base which is increasingly heterogeneous.
Throughout the 1990s, minorities, white women and immigrants will account
for 85 per cent of net employment growth in the US, according to the DCI
Armory, a group of specialists in diversity.
To prepare for the changes, some 60 per cent of leading businesses in the US
are offering or planning diversity training courses, says Myron Block, a
diversity consultant for consultancy Harbridge House.
The US private sector first had to deal with a more diverse workforce in the
1970s, when the federal government enforced the hire of minorities.
Corporate concerns are different now from 20 years ago, however. For many
companies, compliance with the law remains the main priority, but an
increasing number say greater diversity makes good business sense.
'Diversity is a competitive edge issue,' says Darlene Siedshlaw, executive
director of diversity for the telecommunications group US West. 'There is no
question that the marketplace is more diverse than it has ever been. It adds
to our bottom line to have a diverse workforce to serve that marketplace.'
If a marketing force is too homogenous, for instance, it risks commiting big
errors when addressing diverse audiences. 'By having Hispanics on our staff,
it helps us to realise things about their culture,' says Leslie Mays,
director of diversity development for footwear manufacturer Reebok. 'For
instance, we have discovered that Hispanics are usually very brand loyal.
The brands they use when they're growing up are what they usually use later
on. So we know that when marketing to that group, we should target a young
audience.'
Telecommunications group AT&amp;T points to language barriers it can encounter.
'We use Spanish speakers to sell our services to the Latino market, and
Mandarin speakers to sell to the Chinese-American market,' says Joeann
McPhearson, district staff manager of AT&amp;T.
Diversity can be important for other reasons. With the rise in popularity of
ethical investments, some investors screen companies before deciding where
to buy shares. 'A diverse workforce attracts more shareholders,' says
McPhearson.
But if diverse groups often show more creativity - at least if the problems
relate to their diversity - they can also be difficult to manage. Studies
show, for example, that diverse groups can take longer to accomplish tasks.
'Diversity can create more interpersonal conflict and slow things down,'
says Susan Jackson, associate professor of psychology at New York
University. 'Companies need to learn how to minimise these conflicts to take
better advantage of diversity.'
Diversity training has become an important tool for corporations facing
these challenges, but the nature of the courses varies greatly. Some rely on
lectures to illustrate the history of black liberation, or the nature of
sexual harrassment, for instance.
Black actor Bill Cosby's video on bigotry in the workplace is popular. Other
formats encourage employees to open up about their personal prejudices.
'People in our training courses analyse their heritage and the messages they
got when they were growing up,' says Block.
Open conversation may not always be a good idea. 'It opens a can of worms on
the legal front,' says Jackson. 'If an executive admits to sexual
harrassment during a training course, for example, can he be fired?'
Many executives question the value of diversity training on its own, not
least in its effects on other employees. 'Standalone diversity training is
not enough to bring change to any corporation,' says Siedshlaw. 'It can even
be harmful. In the 1980s, we felt a lot of backlash from white males who
felt excluded from the diversity initiatives. Now, we have a programme on
the difficulties of being a white male in today's society and it's a big
success.'
The most successful companies in dealing with diversity, researchers say,
are those that make diversity part of their corporate culture. Increasing
attention is paid to companies' diversity profiles. 'We review trends in our
employment profiles every month to make sure we're not losing diversity,'
says Mays.
To ensure that the company maintains a diverse employee base, Reebok, along
with a growing number of companies, makes diversity part of the criteria
managers are judged by. 'We look at the diversity of the group they manage
before they came in and after they have been there for a while. And we talk
to them about how they helped position different people for career
advancement.'
With more companies seeking minorities and women, recruitment for these
groups can often be fierce. 'We've had to change the way we recruit college
graduates,' says Siedshlaw. 'If you just go to the placement office, you
will limit yourself, because people of colour are less inclined to use the
office. You need to go to campus organisations, the Society of American
Indians, for instance. We've had excellent results with the new programme.
Over the last two years, 50 per cent of new hires were people of colour.'
AT&amp;T even adapted its redundancy programme and abandoned seniority as a
criterion for lay-offs. 'If we had just fired the people who had been at the
company the least time, we would have been left with a more homogenous
workforce,' McPhearson explains.
To make sure recruits want to stay once they are hired, many companies have
encouraged constituency groups, to act as liaisons between employees and
management. Digital Equipment, for example, has a number of these groups,
including the African Heritage, Asian Leadership and Gay Plus.

FT  18 APR 94 / Small shops lead slide in optimism

<TEXT>
The latest distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British
Industry shows that most retail sectors reported an increase in sales
volumes in March compared with the same month in 1993.
However, as has been the case in every month since July, reported sales were
lower than had been expected at the start of the month.
The CBI figures deduct the proportion of those who report a decline in sales
from those who report an increase. The balance of retailers reporting an
increase in sales in March was 12 percentage points, ahead of the 10-point
gap reported in February, but well below the balance of 25 who expected an
increase at the start of the month.
Expectations for April have fallen. The balance of those expecting an
increase in sales is now 14, the lowest figure since February 1993.
Large retailers are much more upbeat about sales than small shops.
The individual retail sectors which reported the strongest increases in
sales in the year to March were booksellers &amp; stationers and grocers;
declines were reported by chemists, furniture &amp; carpet stores and by
hardware, china and DIY outlets.
Although retailers report relatively modest growth, wholesalers say that
sales volumes increased strongly in March. The balance of those reporting an
increase in sales, at 49, is the highest since October.
Among motor traders, the balance of those reporting an increase in sales
over the same month a year ago was 22, much lower than in either February or
January.
The CBI survey covered 479 businesses and was carried out between March 10
and March 31.

FT  18 APR 94 / BSkyB fails to take up home-shopping TV option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television consortium, has decided
not to exercise its option to keep a 50 per cent stake in QVC, the
home-shopping channel which is part of the Sky multi-channel subscription
package.
The surprising decision has been taken even though the channel appears to be
doing well and is heading for revenues of at least Pounds 40m in its first
year on air.
The channel was set up as a joint venture between QVC, its highly successful
parent in the US, and BSkyB, the satellite group in which Pearson - owner of
the Financial Times - has a significant stake.
To retain its 50 per cent stake, BSkyB was required to inject substantial
amounts of further cash around now but has decided not to do so. As a
result, the BSkyB stake in the home-shopping venture will fall to 20 per
cent on August 1.
One BSkyB executive suggested that the stake may have been of more value to
QVC than to the satellite company because a lot of BSkyB's energies are now
being directed to the planned launch next year of pay-per-view for films and
sports events.
The decision not to keep up its stake in QVC has been taken despite a
growing stream of profits at BSkyB. Before interest charges the satellite
company is now making operational profits of Pounds 3m a week. Even after
interest payments profits are running at Pounds 1.5m a week from a base of
3.3m homes subscribing to at least one BSkyB service.
QVC had good pre-Christmas results but its business 'fell off a cliff'
during the first three weeks of January. After that, however, sales began to
grow again and executives are now confident that they have a business which
in the short term will start to compete with mail-order catalogues and
eventually with conventional retail outlets.
Much of QVC's coverage is demonstrating individual items which can be bought
by credit card, with the emphasis on 'impulse' buys. Yesterday's themes
ranged from gemstones to leisurewear and gardening products.

FT  18 APR 94 / Unions split on minimum wage plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A public argument broke out last night between senior trade union leaders
about the future of Labour's commitment to a statutory minimum wage.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, speaking on the
eve of the Scottish TUC, told his delegation that Labour should commit
itself to support of a statutory minimum wage of not less than Pounds 4 an
hour. He said this would mean the state would 'no longer need to subsidise,
through the benefit system, the bad employer who pays poverty wages'.
Mr Morris went much further yesterday in his demands on Labour to introduce
more radical economic policies.
He said that the party should commit itself to restoring the link between
the level of old-age pensions and average earnings, which was broken in
1980. He also called for a 'firm commitment to universal benefits including
child benefit,' as well as a 'massive programme of affordable child care
facilities' and a 'stop to de-regulation and privatisation'.
Mr Morris added that these demands could be paid for if Labour backed 'a
fair and progressive' tax system. 'In simple terms, the rich must pay more,'
he said.
But Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering union, denounced Mr
Morris's proposal to fix a precise figure on a national minimum wage as
'irresponsible'.
He went on: 'It is legitimate to aspire to a national minimum wage. But it
is irresponsible when not in government to dictate its level.'
Labour leaders, including shadow employment secretary Mr John Prescott, are
also keen not to see any such commitment.
Mr Jordan also criticised Mr Morris's proposals as a 'supermarket
shopping-basket list' which 'would provide unlimited ammunition for Tory
party political broadcasts'.
He added: 'After 15 years in opposition the Labour party needs our support,
not our orders, in order to win.'

FT  18 APR 94 / AEEU strengthened by government policy on check-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About half the 500,000 members of the AEEU engineering union who pay
subscriptions through their pay packets under the check-off system have
agreed to carry on doing so, Mr Bill Jordan, union president, said
yesterday, Robert Taylor writes.
He said he was confident the union would not suffer a net loss of members as
a result of new rules on check-off which require written authorisation for
subscriptions to be deducted by employers at source.
As much as 75 per cent of the AEEU's income comes via the check-off system,
which covers 65 per cent of its membership.
Mr Jordan said the government's clampdown on check-off had strengthened his
union by galvanising the activists to recruit members.
The union also achieved a profit of more than Pounds 1.5m in 1993 - thanks
to a rise in subscriptions, a shake-up of its organisation and a slowdown in
membership loss.

FT  18 APR 94 / Funding cuts anger gas watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gas Consumers' Council argued strongly yesterday for the retention of an
independent voice for customers after recent calls for a wholesale shake-up
of utility regulation.
The council is critical of the government's decision to cut its funding,
saying the need for a consumer's voice is at its greatest during the
transition from a monopoly to a competitive market.
In its annual report, published today, the council says that complaints it
received about British Gas dropped last year by 19 per cent to 20,428, but
protests about independent suppliers rose by 43 per cent to 745.
Rivals to British Gas can supply only a very small number of domestic users.
But when the rest of the market is opened up for competition in April 1996,
they will be able to compete for most household business.
The government's detailed proposals for liberalising the household gas
market have so far been delayed by six weeks. This is causing concern among
independent suppliers and consumer groups.
Mr Ian Powe, director of the council, said: 'Anxiety is growing about the
effect this will have on compressing the consultation period for everyone to
have their say.' He added that consumers should have more than a month to
make their views known on the new market.
The council has backed Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the
gas industry regulator, in her concern that consumers will pay higher gas
prices for funding energy efficiency projects.

FT  18 APR 94 / Rail boss who may bury the hatchet: Bob Horton says he is
still a hard man. But, as he tells Charles Batchelor, he is not a Beeching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Observers may be wondering if Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack chairman, has gone
native.
His appointment to the state-owned company set up to manage British Rail's
track, signalling and stations after privatisation was confirmation to many
that privatisation meant dismemberment and decline.
But Mr Horton, who left British Petroleum two years ago with the reputation
of being 'Horton the Hatchet', enthuses: 'We have this absolutely priceless
national asset which we have jolly well got to make good use of. What we are
witnessing is not a little short of miraculous. An industry which is 150
years old is being made fit for the 21st century.'
Mr Horton is in charge of only one part of a railway which will soon
comprise 60 independent companies. But as the monopoly supplier of track and
signalling, Railtrack has an important part to play.
The approach adopted by Mr Horton and Mr John Edmonds, chief executive of
Railtrack and a lifelong railwayman, will play an important part in
determining rail's future.
Mr Horton is adamant that he has not changed, but he does not see his role
as that of Dr Beeching, who slashed rail services in the 1960s.
Mr Horton said: 'It would be difficult to imagine why I would want to take
on this job unless I was 'native' already. Twelve months ago people said I
was mad, but I felt this was a job which really had to be done. But I made
no secret about my management style, and there may be a few bruised feelings
around the place.'
He is keen to be tough on inefficiency and waste within the organisation so
as to be kind to customers and the level of train services. 'In three years'
time we will have a railway operating more reliably, more efficiently and
providing more capacity.'
One of the first tasks of Railtrack was to calculate the true cost of
running a railway service. Under BR, the train operating companies had not
been charged the full cost of replacing track and signalling.
Railtrack's calculations led to a doubling of charges and to howls of
protest from BR managers, many of whom hope to stage buy-outs over the next
two to three years.
Mr Horton said he was prepared to fine-tune his charges, but argued that the
principle of identifying the true cost of all activities is a sound one.
'For the first time we have transparency rather than the fudge and
cross-subsidy which used to take place.'
Replacing BR's internal procedures with contracts negotiated between
independent companies should also improve efficiency. He said BR's internal
arrangements had the virtue of simplicity, but sometimes led to cosy
relationships which were not necessarily the most efficient.
'It is mind-boggling that nearly Pounds 2bn of annual procurement could have
existed without contractual relations being established.'
The main attack on costs will be on the annual maintenance bill for the
10,000 miles of track, 90,000 bridges and 2,500 stations for which Railtrack
is responsible.
But Mr Horton believes Railtrack can also make savings by managing its own
affairs better. It has recruited specialists from outside the industry to
improve its record of project management. It has Pounds 500m to spend on
5,000 improvement schemes this year.
But making an impact on a network which has suffered from decades of neglect
will take time. A backlog of track maintenance means speed restrictions are
common while many stations are in need of urgent repair.
Mr Horton said that going live on April 1 meant Railtrack could start to
address these problems instead of sitting through endless meetings with
civil servants. 'But the problems ahead are at least as great as those we
have overcome. It will be a long and stony road.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Cost of living 'up 3.7% in year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A family of four will need to have had a 2.8 per cent increase in its income
in the year to February in order to maintain its standard of living, Reward
Group, a research and consultancy business, says today.
The group's survey calculates the income needed to maintain the standard of
living of eight families. It finds that the overall cost of goods and
services rose 3.7 per cent in the year to February, but private housing
costs fell 2 per cent thanks to lower mortgage rates and lower local taxes.
The most expensive place is London, followed by Woking, Surrey; Welwyn
Garden City, Hertfordshire; Slough, Berkshire; and Berkhamsted,
Hertfordshire. The cheapest place is Northern Ireland, followed by Thurso,
Highland; and Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan.
If housing is ignored, the most expensive places are Lerwick, Shetland;
Chingford, Essex; Manchester; Ealing, west London; and Maidstone, Kent. The
cheapest are Billingham, Cleveland; and Wolverhampton, West Midlands.
The survey found that over the past five years, costs have risen in the
north compared to the national average, while lower house prices have
reduced the relative cost of living in the south.

FT  18 APR 94 / Raw material prices alarm manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices of raw materials have supplanted the level of interest rates as the
main concern of west Midlands manufacturers, says the latest survey of
corporate opinion and performance from the area's Chambers of Commerce.
Isolated increases in metals prices have deepened concern about raw material
prices in general.
Manufacturers and stockholders have reported price rises for aluminium,
stainless steel and steel made from scrap metal in a region where economic
health is closely linked to the state of the engineering sector and where
there has been traditional reliance on the vehicle and aerospace industries.
The extent to which metal price rises, a source of sensitivity in the
engineering industry, are influencing national statistics and acting as a
guide to future inflation will be apparent today with the publication of the
producer prices index.
After a 30 per cent fall during the recession, prices for aluminium sheet,
bar and plate started to rise at the end of January. Over the past 10 weeks
the lead time for delivery from mills has increased from 2 1/2 months to six
months, said Mr Clive Orford, deputy managing director of Apollo Metals, the
Birmingham-based stockholder and processor.
He warned that 'if manufacturers are looking for material cost cuts, they
will be sorely disappointed'. Demand was rising and aluminium producers
hoped for higher margins after years of depressed returns.
Glynwed International, the diversified engineering group which is an
extensive user of steel, said that stainless steel prices had risen because
of the nickel surcharge imposed by producers. The level of this surcharge
depends on the movement of London Metal Exchange nickel prices.
There is also a scrap surcharge imposed on steel made in electric furnaces
and frequently used in the engineering industry. But, stressed Mr Nick
Boucher, Glynwed's group planning manager, 'there is no tightness in the
market; there is plenty of metal around'.
Pressure on steel prices remains downwards rather than upwards. British
Steel prices remain below 1990 levels despite attempts to impose rises on
the market. 'There are threats of price rises all the time, but I've not
seem them,' said Mr Robert Woolley, managing director of Frederick Woolley,
the Birmingham components manufacturer.
Generally the European steel market is oversupplied and steelmakers face
capacity cuts. But Mr Geoff Field, director of the National Association of
Steel Stockholders, whose members handle more than 60 per cent of the steel
bought by UK manufacturers, warned that there is a limit on how far steel
consumers can push prices down.
'It's a good situation for manufacturers, but there is a limit under which
the steel producers and stockholders cannot go,' Mr Field said.
The preoccupation of Midlands manufacturers with material prices does not
surprise Mr Woolley. He pointed out that materials account for between 40
per cent and 60 per cent of manufacturers' costs, and said: 'Get a saving
there and you'll be moving in the right direction.'
Mr Tony Bradley, the economist at the Chambers of Commerce, says diminishing
concern with interest and inflation rates has allowed manufacturers'
attention to switch to other cost pressures.

FT  18 APR 94 / Linking of tax and benefits 'flawed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals to integrate the tax and welfare benefit systems are flawed, says
a survey prepared for the Commission on Social Justice, the think-tank set
up by Mr John Smith, Labour leader, at the end of 1992.
The report by Andersen Consulting says most plans for integration are based
around two proposals - a negative income tax and a citizen's income.
A negative income tax would assess everyone using a single administrative
structure, with the government paying credits or collecting taxes according
to income. The report argues that an integrated scheme would still be likely
to need different assessment periods, with taxpayers being assessed annually
and benefit receivers weekly or monthly.
Furthermore, benefits are at present assessed on the basis of a household
unit. If this element of the system were maintained, women would lose the
right to independent taxation; but if assessment were done individually,
credits would be paid to the non-working wives of high-earning men.
The authors also argue that, because there is little overlap between
taxpayers and benefit recipients, any integrated system would probably still
retain two divisions to deal with the different groups.
A citizen's income would pay a basic income to everyone, clawing back the
cost in the form of higher taxes. The report argues that the tax increase
involved would be enormous and that incentives to work would be reduced.
The authors believe, however, that integration of tax and benefits might be
useful for specific groups such as pensioners, whose circumstances change
infrequently. For the rest of the population, 'strategic integration -
ensuring that the tax and benefits systems work together instead of creating
poverty and unemployment traps - may be more important than structural
integration'.

FT  18 APR 94 / Severn Trent to make pollution payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Reporter
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Severn Trent, the privatised water utility, will make ex gratia payments
totalling Pounds 600,000 to households in the Worcester area affected by a
pollution alert, Mr Brian Duckworth, director of customer services, said
yesterday.
Meanwhile, the National Rivers Authority said it had traced the probable
cause of the contamination, which resulted in about 100,000 people being
advised not to drink tap water. The authority said it would consider this
week whether to take legal action against the polluter. 'We usually
prosecute when there has been pollution, except in very exceptional
circumstances,' it said.
Mr Duckworth said the Guaranteed Standards Scheme agreed between the
industry and Ofwat, its regulator, included payments of Pounds 10 a day
compensation when households had their water supply disconnected without
proper notice. Although supplies had not been cut in Worcester, Severn Trent
would make payments 'in the spirit of the scheme'. He added: 'We know, for
example, that people bought bottled water.'
He said about 30,000 households were affected by the scare which started on
Friday when some people complained that their tap water smelled and tasted
of paraffin.
All signs of contamination would be gone early this week, Mr Duckworth
promised. It was too early to estimate the full cost to Severn Trent - the
main consideration so far had been to restore water supplies to normal - but
it would not not be substantial. The company would cover all costs from
revenue.
Severn Trent reported pre-tax profits up 4.3 per cent to Pounds 140.8m on a
turnover of Pounds 489.8m for the half-year to September 30.
Health officials said there was no serious risk from the organic industrial
solvent that contaminated the water. The NRA said there was little damage to
the river Severn and river Roden and no sign of fish being killed. This made
tracing the source of the pollution much more difficult - it was eventually
traced to the Wem industrial estate in Shropshire.
The NRA refused to name the suspected polluter. 'There are a huge number of
discharges from this industrial estate and we will be looking at licenses
this coming week to establish what is and what is not permitted.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Customs staff given performance pay targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of civil servants in Customs &amp; Excise will receive no pay rise
this year unless they reach basic performance targets.
The deal is the first of what could be a succession of innovative pay
agreements in the civil service agencies that have taken direct control over
pay negotiations for the first time.
About 65 per cent of all 540,000 civil servants will have their pay set by
their agency this year, rising to 90 per cent next year. A few
organisations, such as the Inland Revenue, have already devolved bargaining.
The Customs &amp; Excise deal, which the unions hope might set a trend, will
increase the pay bill by about 2.6 per cent. However the unions claim that
it will increase the pay of some clerical workers by more than 5 per cent.
There will be no pay rise at all for senior or junior staff who do not reach
basic performance targets, but the unions say this is unlikely to affect
more than a few dozen people.
For higher executive officers and grades below them, pay will rise in steps
 -related to performance - from 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. As the pay
deal covers a 14-month period the rise will be slightly lower in annual
terms.
The Customs &amp; Excise agreement involves a complete overhaul of the previous
complex pay grading structure and provides both more flexibility and a
higher performance-pay element.
Mr Mike King, who negotiated the deal for the NUCPS civil service union,
said that in spite of the unhappy experience with some performance pay
systems the union was confident that the system would work well. He added:
'The important thing is that we have shown that delegated bargaining can
produce the goods.'
Other big agencies such as the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service
are similarly overhauling their pay systems, but have not yet reached
agreement on this year's pay rise.
Some agencies, such as the Driving Standards Agency, are likely to 'shadow'
the outcome of the central bargaining undertaken by the Treasury. This still
affects about one third of all civil servants.
Those core negotiations are expected to produce a rise of around 2.5 per
cent, although they are at present stalled. Union officials say that the
Treasury is keen for several agencies to conclude their pay negotiations
before the core agreement is concluded so that the temptation to shadow it

FT  18 APR 94 / Multiples increase share of retail market to 36%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales are becoming increasingly concentrated, with the 10 largest
retail chains accounting for 36 per cent of all sales last year, compared
with 26 per cent of sales in 1987, the annual shops survey by Corporate
Intelligence has found.
Kwik Save is the fastest-growing multiple, underlining the competition the
market leaders now face from discount stores. Kwik Save has more than
trebled sales since 1987, compared with Tesco and J. Sainsbury, which have
approximately doubled sales.
The only change last year in the ranking of the top 10 retailers, compiled
by research group Corporate Intelligence, was that Argyll - which includes
Safeway, Presto and Lo-Cost - overtook Marks and Spencer.
Richer Sounds, the audio equipment discounter, achieved the highest sales
per square foot at Pounds 5,770, which was four times that of its nearest
rival, the tobacconist and newsagents Supercigs. Richer Sounds sold more
than Pounds 15.2m of goods from 15 very small shops last year.
Neto, the Danish-owned grocery discounter, had the highest sales per
employee at Pounds 243,000, followed by four furniture retailers with sales
of Pounds 179,000 to Pounds 197,000 per employee.
Sears, which includes Selfridges, Richards, Dolcis and Millets, remains the
retailer with the most outlets, in spite of rationalisation of its footwear
interests and departure from menswear retailing. It had 3,044 shops last
year, compared with the second largest, Burton, with 2,301 shops.

British Telecommunications will today apply to the High Court for an

entire British telephone directory on a compact disc.
BT claims that the Pounds 50 disc would breach its copyright. It also
objects to what it says would be the indiscriminate access that companies
would have to individuals' telephone numbers and addresses. It said the move
would increase inconvenience as more people would choose to go ex-directory.

FT  18 APR 94 / Size of executive pay-offs declines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The size of pay-offs to redundant executives has dropped by a quarter over
five years, says a survey by Drake Beam Morin, redundancy consultants. In
1989, a typical pay-off was just over four weeks' salary for every year of
service, but last year this had fallen to just over three weeks.
Of 12 countries surveyed, Portugal and Spain paid the most. The average
pay-off in Portugal was six weeks' salary for every year; the figure for
Spain was 5.6 weeks.
Mr Peter Trigg, DBM managing director, said: 'It should be borne in mind
that the statutory payment in the UK is one week for every year of service,
so that these executives are still relatively well off.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Record seizure of forged notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Police yesterday seized a record haul of counterfeit notes with a face value
of tens of millions of pounds in at least six different currencies, John
Authers writes.
Officers from the South East Regional Crime Squad raided a property in
Islington, north London, yesterday morning and discovered 'three people in
the process of producing between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m in sterling notes'.
Police said the find would probably prove to be the largest counterfeiting
operation discovered in the UK. Searches of the property, said to contain 'a
complete printing works' and of the home addresses of four men arrested on
the scene had revealed notes worth 'tens of millions of pounds'.
Plates and negatives for Pounds 50, Pounds 20 and Pounds 10 notes were
seized and the police also found sheets of Romanian, Spanish, Irish and
Nigerian currency as well as plates and negatives for Dollars 50 bills.

FT  18 APR 94 / Loganair close to buy-out deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Loganair, the subsidiary of Airlines of Britain which operates services
between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the Scottish Highlands and Islands, is
believed to be close to a buy-out by its management.
The airline is also expected to announce that it will enter into a franchise
agreement with British Airways, which flies to some of Loganair's
destinations. This would give Loganair access to BA's reservations system
and shield it from destructive competition from its rival.
The buy-out of Loganair is expected to be led by Mr Scott Grier, the
airline's managing director.
Airlines of Britain owns British Midland Airways and the Isle of Man-based
Manx Airlines as well as Loganair. Last month Loganair handed its routes to
destinations outside Scotland to Manx Airlines in order to concentrate on
its services to the Highlands and Islands.
Aircraft and staff were transferred from Loganair to Manx Airlines. Although
170 people lost their jobs all services operated by the two airlines were
retained.

FT  18 APR 94 / Unionist scorns Reynolds offer to share power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A power-sharing proposal by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,
aimed at wooing Ulster's unionists to the idea of a united Ireland has been
dismissed by Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party. It
has also received only a lukewarm reception in the republic.
Mr Reynolds told a Fianna Fail youth conference that he would be prepared to
give a 'personal guarantee' to Northern Ireland's political parties of a 30
per cent participation in a future all-Ireland government. This would in
effect give unionists 20 per cent of seats in an all-Ireland cabinet, and
similar representation in the Irish civil service.
However Mr Molyneaux, speaking from Washington, where he is beginning a
week-long visit to the US, dismissed the proposal as 'totally, totally
unrealistic . . . the greater number of people of Northern Ireland are not
orphans wandering about a barren landscape waiting for somebody to take them
in'.
Mr John Bruton, the leader of the opposition Fine Gael party in the
republic, also criticised the proposal for being a 'diversion' which would
distract attention 'from solving practical problems . . . many things need
to be done in the short term to build up trust'.
Even Mr Reynolds' Labour coalition partners were lukewarm. The party said:
'In principle we are in favour of power-sharing . . . but that is a very
long way down the road and there are an awful lot of bridges that would have
to be crossed before we could get to that point.'
However a spokesman for Mr Reynolds said the Unionist reaction was expected
and the proposal would 'remain on the table to be built upon'. He added: 'Mr
Reynolds felt that if we believe in (a united Ireland) we had better start
saying what it will entail.'

FT  18 APR 94 / Moves to curb lookalike own-brands opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retailers and consumer groups are joining forces this week to fight
proposals from manufacturers that would stop shops selling 'lookalike'
own-brands.
The government's trademarks bill, designed to bring UK law on unfair
competition into line with European Union rules, is due for its second
reading today. The British Producers and Brand Owners Group - which includes
Allied-Lyons, Grand Metropolitan, Mars, Nestle, Procter &amp; Gamble and
Unilever - wants to see the bill amended to include protection against
copycat competition from retailers.
Brand owners want the bill amended so that there would be protection against
lookalikes which do not directly copy logos or designs but imitate the
overall appearance of branded goods.
The Consumers' Association and the National Consumer Council will tell MPs
on Wednesday that shoppers will pay higher prices and get less choice if
own-brands are restricted. A survey by Which?, the Consumers' Association's
magazine, concluded earlier this year that consumers could save more than 25
per cent on a weekly shopping bill if they bought own-label equivalents of
branded products.
An example of the own-brand attack comes this week from J. Sainsbury as it
launches a cola designed to compete in flavour with Coca-Cola, the brand
leader, and undercut its price.
The British Retail Consortium said survey results disclosed today show that
consumers are not confused by own-brand equivalents of leading products. The
research, conducted by MORI for the consortium, found that 78 per cent of
shoppers said they never confused branded goods and the lookalike versions.
More than half of the sample of 514 shoppers said they liked branded and
own-label goods to look similar because it provided them with 'visual clues'
about the products.
The retailers argue that, in any case, manufacturers often copy one another
and there are recognised conventions in packaging and colours which help
'signpost' products for shoppers. Examples include blue and red packs for
milk and dark chocolate, blue packaging for household bleach and yellow
bottles for lemon-scented washing-up liquid.
Meanwhile, brand owners say that even if consumers do not confuse branded
and own-label products, similarities in appearance can give the impression
that manufacturers have made both. In reality, most brand manufacturers no
longer also make own-label goods for retailers.

FT  18 APR 94 / Golden Virginia is chilled by realities: Mrs Bottomley is
quietly agitating for a move to a safer department as the troubled NHS is
returned to the political front-burner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suddenly it seems to be going wrong. The National Health Service, no longer
immune from the grim realities of the government's finances, has returned to
the front-burner of politics.
For nearly two years the NHS has been kept off newspaper front pages. The
Labour charge in the 1992 general election that the government would
privatise the most cherished pillar of the welfare state has been put to
rest.
The new internal market in state health care has been entrenched. The
essential characteristic of the market - a split between the purchasers and
providers of health care - looks irreversible.
The new trust hospitals and general practitioner fundholders have boasted
with some justification that they are providing better care and shorter
waiting lists. Not so long ago Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary,
was tipped by her more excitable admirers as a future contender for the Tory
leadership.
Mrs Bottomley must have known it could not last. Faced with a Pounds 50bn
borrowing requirement the Treasury called a halt last autumn to the rapid
growth in NHS spending. The health secretary began quietly agitating for a
move to a less dangerous department in this summer's cabinet reshuffle.
But the speed and intensity of health's return to the front pages has
dismayed Tory MPs. What one minister calls the 'smile-and-it-will-go-away
approach', which has seen Mrs Bottomley get through previous scrapes, no
longer seems to be working. Unsympathetic colleagues are suggesting that,
now the going is getting rough, Mr Major must keep her on at health.
Headlines highlighting the fat salaries and expensive perks paid to the new
breed of NHS administrators have been accompanied by a spate of damaging
incidents at trust hospitals.
Reports of elderly patients being denied treatment because they are not
covered by the contracts signed by trusts and local health authorities make
for very bad politics. So does evidence that the new GP fundholding system
is allowing some patients to jump hospital queues.
There are other problems. Mrs Bottomley's rationalisation of health care in
London has provoked a damaging political backlash ahead of next month's
critical local elections.
Her assumption that everyone would agree that London consumed a
disproportionate share of NHS resources failed to take account of the
powerful public support for the capital's teaching hospitals.
In particular she misjudged the strength of opposition against the plan to
allow the renowned specialist departments at Guy's hospital to be threatened
by merger with neighbouring St Thomas's.
The campaign to save Guy's, led by Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP,
has the tacit support of prominent Conservatives. Many of the wealthy
benefactors who have poured millions of pounds in charitable donations to
develop Guy's have traditionally helped to fill Conservative party coffers.
Ministers have been told those funds could well dry up if the merger goes
ahead. What would in effect be the closure of Guy's is regarded as a bad
mistake by Tory as well as opposition MPs.
The health secretary has also come under fire in Whitehall for failing to
get to grips with the burgeoning administrative staff in the NHS. The public
criticism of NHS bureaucracy in Wales voiced by Mr John Redwood, the Welsh
secretary, has seriously undermined Mrs Bottomley's efforts to defuse the
issue in England. It does not help when health authority auditors uncover
payments of more than Pounds 200,000 to cover the relocation expenses of a
senior trust executive.
But the government's problems with the NHS run much deeper than the
coincidence of a few bad headlines. The real causes are rooted in money.
For all the opposition's complaints about 'underfunding' the government has
poured money into the NHS over the past few years to lubricate the changes
to a market-based system.
The creation of an internal market was always bound to expose the rationing
of provision which has been a feature of the NHS since its inception. There
is nothing new about patients being turned away from hospitals and
intolerable waits in accident and emergency units.
But real annual increases in resources of 4 per cent and above since the
late 1980s have clouded the transparency promised by the internal market.
They have obscured also the fact that the new system gives much more power
to health producers than to consumers. Instead of money following patients
the sick have found themselves chasing the money.
The financial cushion is now disappearing. Last year's public spending
settlement provided for growth in the NHS's Pounds 30bn budget of less than
1 per cent annually for the three financial years 1994-95 to 1996-97.
District health authorities and hospital trusts are now adjusting to the
harsher financial climate.
There are other resources available - through productivity and efficiency
gains - but no one in Whitehall doubts that in the run-up to the next
general election available resources will fall significantly short of
demands on the service.
Longer waiting lists and well-paid bureaucrats are an explosive political
mix. Opposition parties will exploit every story of managerial extravagance,
and there will be many more, to attack the health service reforms. Mrs
Bottomley is discovering that for Conservative governments there is only one
route to peace in the NHS - money.

FT  18 APR 94 / DTI starts talks about Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has begun consultations to help the
government decide whether to include a bill to change the Post Office's
status in next year's parliamentary timetable.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is one of a number of
ministers involved in meetings aimed at determining how to proceed.
One individual familiar with the position said: 'The department is keen to
come to some conclusions.' Ministers were 'coming to a period' where the
question of whether to legislate in the autumn parliamentary session 'has
got to be decided upon'.
Pressure on the government to determine a course of action is mounting both
because ministers are already in the preliminary stages of drawing up a list
of bills for the next session and because of the comments of the Post
Office's senior management.
Mr Bill Cockburn, the organisation's chief executive, last week fired the
latest shot in a long-running campaign for privatisation by claiming that a
quarter of the UK's 20,000 post offices could close unless the corporation
was given commercial freedom.
The government - which has been reviewing the Post Office's future for 21
months - will have to decide between about five options, ranging from the
status quo to full privatisation.
Mr Heseltine has made clear that he favours privatisation but many Tory MPs
for rural areas believe the Post Office would close uneconomic sub-post
offices after privatisation.

FT  18 APR 94 / Israel eases bar against Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel yesterday slightly eased an 11-day-old ban barring the nearly 2m
Palestinians from entering into Israel but said closure of the occupied
territories would continue indefinitely.
Mr Amnon Rubinstein, education minister, said the cabinet had agreed
yesterday to grant 16,000 entry permits to Palestinians for humanitarian
reasons and 4,000 work permits for Palestinians employed in Israel's
agricultural sector.
The government approved Shk30m (Pounds 6.8m) for public works and aid to
assist Palestinians suffering from inability to travel to their jobs in
Israel since the entry ban was imposed by the Jewish state to try to prevent
attacks by Palestinian extremists.
The cabinet also issued a strong warning to the Palestine Liberation
Organisation after hearing security reports which alleged the PLO had local
co-operation agreements with the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement,
responsible for two recent suicide attacks on Israelis. The warning to the
PLO came after Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, lashed out at Jordan
last week for allowing Hamas to operate offices and issue media statements
in Amman and called on the government to close down Hamas offices.
King Hussein on Saturday said Hamas was illegal in Jordan and denied his
government helped the Islamic guerrilla group. Hamas responded saying it
would strike Israeli and Jewish targets worldwide if Israel attacked its
leaders or political and media offices abroad. Hamas's military wing said it
would consider such attacks 'a start of a new war in which Israeli blood and
interests and Jewish communities around the world are open for our strikes.
We will respond to every attack by a stronger one.' But Hamas also offered
yesterday to stop attacks on Israeli civilians if Israel halted assaults
against Palestinian civilians.
Israeli concern about Hamas rose as the PLO and Israel resumed peace talks
in Cairo on a long-delayed agreement providing for Palestinian self-rule in
the occupied West Bank town of Jericho. Major General Amnon Shahak, head of
the Israeli delegation, said: 'I do not expect we will finish this week, but
let us see what happens next week.'
Israel and the PLO have several issues left to finalise including the
security zoning arrangements in the Gaza Strip, the jurisdiction of
Palestinian courts in Gaza and Jericho - especially their power to prosecute
Israelis - the fate of Islamic extremist prisoners held by Israel, and water
issues.
On the economic track of talks in Paris, both the PLO and Israel say they
could complete an agreement by the end of this week to establish the
economic relations between Israel and the self-governing Palestinian
economy. Both sides have already reached final agreement on energy, industry
and agriculture and have a conditional understanding on taxation subject to
agreement on the rate of value added tax to be levied in the Palestinian
economy. The two sides have yet to agree on labour relations, and
Palestinian demands for their own currency.

FT  18 APR 94 / International Press Review: The view from Judea and Samaria
 -Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
No Israeli newspaper can fuel public fears quite like the Jerusalem Post,
the English-language daily broadsheet which acts as a mouthpiece for the
country's right and ultra-right wing.
The events of the past 10 days - three attacks by extremist Islamic
guerrillas which left 13 Israelis dead - have given the Post the opportunity
to indulge in the sport of thumping the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the government of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
'Like the dictatorial regimes which support them, the terrorists believe
that negotiations should be accompanied by shooting,' the Post said last
week.
'Those who say, as the government has done, that the right response to
terrorism is to accelerate the negotiations and withdrawal process. . . are
doing precisely what the terrorists want them to do.'
Editorials like this led the Post's owner, Mr Conrad Black, to publish a
centre-page opinion piece last September making it clear that he disagreed
with his newspaper's editorial policy.
The Post has its own politicised language - all Arab guerrillas are
'terrorists'; the Israeli-occupied West Bank is known by the biblical name
'Judea and Samaria'; the territories are 'administered', not 'occupied'.
It also gives regular platforms to right-wing politicians such as Mr Ariel
Sharon, Israel's leading hawk. In an opinion article last week Mr Sharon
described the incoming Palestinian police force as 'murderers' and said the
government was 'perpetrating an immense security crime against Jews in the
State of Israel' by allowing the policemen into the territories.
Another favourite pastime of the Post is thumping foreign correspondents
reporting Israel in a weekly column called 'Eye of the Media' usually
written by Mr David Bar-Illan, the newspaper's executive editor. The column
takes the view that Israel gets an unrelenting negative press abroad and is
at war with hostile international media, including The New York Times.
'No paper in the democratic world, except one owned and run by Jews, would
dare be as snidely anti-Semitic as the Times of that day,' Mr Bar-Illan
wrote, referring to the coverage of the funeral of the Jewish settler
responsible for the Hebron mosque massacre in February.
But Israel is a deeply democratic and pluralistic society with at least nine
daily newspapers, including two business tabloids, for a population of 5m.
With the exception of the religious Hatsofeh newspaper, Israel's Hebrew
press is centrist to left-wing. Despite the recent attacks they support a
continuation of the peace process as the only realistic option.
'It is hard to understand why the opposition wants the government to suspend
the talks after every attack,' the respected liberal Ha'aretz newspaper said
last Friday. 'The strength of a people is measured not only by the number of
tanks it possesses, but also by its capacity to live with casualties and
loss of life.'
The 1.9m Palestinians who live in the territories are less well provided for
by media and much news and views are disseminated by leaflets, underground
pamphlets and by a graffiti war between the factions.
Two Arabic daily newspapers, however, are published in the West Bank under
careful monitoring and censorship by Israel and both newspapers are pro-PLO
and pro-Arafat, although they reflect the concerns in the occupied
territories about what is seen as Mr Arafat's lack of democracy.
After the second suicide attack by an Islamic extremist last week both
Al-Quds and An-Nahar took similar editorial lines avoiding condemnation of
the Palestinian attacks, while stressing that violence occurs against both
Arab and Jew and can only be solved by swift implementation of the peace
process.
'Crying and condemning is not the answer,' said An-Nahar. 'The answer is
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinians have
sacrificed much blood and have made many concessions to regain their rights
but Israel continues to get around international law.'
In a series of editorials last week Al-Quds compared the closure to a
'siege' which had caused a near collapse in the education and health
services of Arab East Jerusalem.
'Someone should stop Israel from imposing these wanton measures that only
complicate and intensify the situation, making peace more difficult,' the
paper said.

Serious anomalies in the run-up to Malawi's elections on May 17 are noted in
a report published today by a UN Joint International Observer Group,
reinforcing earlier findings of the national Electoral Commission.
Both bodies report intimidation, violence, bribery and theft or confiscation
of voters' registration cards. The ruling Malawi Congress party emerges as
the main culprit, but some opposition parties are also said to be engaged in
turf wars and violent disruption of opponents' rallies.
The United Nations group does not however consider the abuses it has found
to be an insuperable barrier to free elections.

FT  18 APR 94 / IMF predicts world growth of 3% in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund is forecasting world economic growth of
around 3 per cent this year, with a stronger recovery to between 3 1/2 and 4
per cent growth in 1995.
In its world economic outlook, due to be published on Wednesday just before
the twice-yearly meeting of finance ministers on the IMF's interim
committee, the IMF predicts that global growth this year will approach the
average level it achieved in 1976-85, before moving above the average next
year.
Growth in the developing countries is expected to remain 'remarkably
steady', according to a senior IMF official, while in the industrialised
world only the US, Canada, the UK and the Nordic countries have pulled out
of recession.
'We are still below average in the industrialised countries, because we
still have only one or two engines working, while the others are
struggling,' a senior IMF official said.
IMF economists believe that the Japanese economy has bottomed out, and that
with normal output in continental Europe the world economy should produce
growth well above its historic trends next year.
'Globally speaking, the economy is well into the growth phase of its cycle,'
an official said.
The IMF believes the big industrialised countries have followed many of the
prescriptions that the Washington institution laid out at last year's spring
interim committee meeting: completion of the Uruguay Round of trade
negotiations, efforts to tackle the budget deficit in the US, lower interest
rates in Europe and an attempt at fiscal stimulus in Japan.
Nevertheless, they warn that the current recovery carries an extremely
negative overtone, because it has not been accompanied, particularly in
Europe, by any appreciable recovery in employment.
'The risk is that the level of structural unemployment establishes itself
somewhere above where it was at the end of the last recession,' a senior
official said.
This unemployment problem was tackled by ministers from the Group of Seven
leading industrialised countries in Detroit last month, and is expected to
be on the agenda for the full G7 summit of presidents and prime ministers in
Naples in July.

FT  18 APR 94 / Brazil finishes restructuring debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil has completed the restructuring of about Dollars 49bn (Pounds 34bn)
of commercial debt, in the last of the main Latin American Brady-style debt
reschedulings. The deal, agreed late on Friday night in New York, brings to
an end more than a decade of uncertainty over Brazil's relations with the
international financial community.
Mr Rubens Ricupero, who took over as finance minister this month, described
the deal's conclusion as 'an important milestone' in the country's
'continuing programme of economic reform'.
But with presidential elections this year, and an unstable economy, there is
unlikely to be a rush of confidence and foreign investment into the country,
as happened in Mexico and Argentina after they completed similar
restructurings.
The Brazilian deal was also concluded without the agreement of the Dart
family of the US, who hold about Dollars 1.4bn of debt and are the largest
non-bank creditors. The Darts may take legal action to try to reverse the
deal.
Brazil and about 750 private creditor banks completed the elaborate debt
restructuring after nearly four years of negotiations to exchange the
country's old debt for new and reduce its total debt burden. The deal
offered creditors a choice of six options to repackage loans and interest
overdue into new bonds with maturities of up to 30 years. Brazil's central
bank estimated the deal would reduce its debt by Dollars 4bn and bring
Dollars 4bn more savings in debt servicing costs.
The Brazilian deal differed from other 'Brady-style' restructurings - so
called after the 1989 initiative from former US Treasury secretary Nicholas
Brady - since it was the first main deal to be concluded without a standby
accord from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF was concerned that
Brazil's economic reform efforts are still uncertain.
Without IMF backing, Brazil used Dollars 4.6bn of its own foreign exchange
reserves as collateral for some of the six options.

FT  18 APR 94 / Seeking an impossible peace: From inside an armoured
personnel carrier - A look at the South African army's task in a black
township's war zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Major Julius Lloyd has no illusions about the impossibility of his task: to
bring peace to the black township of Umlazi outside Durban, under the state
of emergency imposed in South Africa's Natal province ahead of next week's
elections.
The major is providing a guided tour - by armoured personnel carrier - of
the dismal shacks and 'matchbox' houses which cling precariously to the
steep green hillsides of the township. Imperceptibly, we cross the front
line of the Umlazi war zone, from an African National Congress neighbourhood
where men sit outside drinking and women hanging laundry, to an identical
Inkatha Freedom party area, where life goes on in much the same way.
All that changes is the facial expressions: in ANC areas, where Maj Lloyd
and his 41st Parachute Brigade troops are welcomed as peacemakers, there is
a smile on almost every pair of lips; in Inkatha areas, where the troops are
seen as an occupying army of the ANC, an averted glance, pointed
indifference, sometimes open hostility.
Maj Lloyd stands in the machine gunner's turret of one of the 'Casspir'
armoured personnel carriers used to patrol Umlazi day and night, and
reflects on the futility of using South African Defence Force troops to try
to solve what is overwhelmingly a political problem in Natal.
'We come into a place, always with a big force, and all we do is suppress
the violence. But the violence is just waiting for us to leave again. It's
all just waiting to pop up again,' says the man who commands the 'parabats'
(short for parachute battalion), a veteran of similar operations in the
warring East Rand townships near Johannesburg.
His troops have succeeded in restoring short-term stability in the two weeks
since their deployment under the state of emergency. Public transport has
returned after a violence-induced stoppage, and 'the children play in the
streets again'. Indeed, they are out in force as we patrol the township in
the brown SADF Casspir, begging for sweets from the soldiers' 'rat (ration)
packs'.
The troops have seized a number of illegal arms, at roadblocks and with the
aid of tip-offs. But the scale of the problem is vast: Maj Lloyd reckons
everybody in Umlazi has at least one firearm; and though nobody really knows
how many live in its densely packed 50 square kilometres, most estimates top
200,000.
Maj Lloyd believes both sides simply buried their arms caches when the SADF
arrived, and will unearth them once it, inevitably, leaves again. He says
the perpetrators are careful to ensure that the areas where arms are stashed
are kept free of violence, to avoid attracting the attention of the security
forces. Any big operation to unearth caches - whether in the townships or
the Inkatha-controlled hostel - does not seem to be on his immediate agenda.
The SADF is still able to pick up firearms, mostly homemade, at roadblocks:
because homemade arms are easier to conceal (until assembled, they simply
look like lengths of pipe), people do not bother to bury them. But
factory-made arms are largely kept out of circulation.
Maj Lloyd recognises that the SADF's popularity might wane if it started
raiding ANC arms caches and putting ANC 'self-defence units' out of action.
Instead, the troops are universally popular in ANC areas because they are
viewed as fairer than the South African Police's Internal Stability Division
(riot police) and the police force of the KwaZulu homeland, of which Umlazi
forms part. Both are accused of siding with Inkatha, and even participating
in Inkatha raids on ANC areas.
With the troops around to prevent possible bias in the security forces, and
to discourage fighting, stability can probably be guaranteed around polling
time. Those who wish to vote in the April 26-28 election will do so in
relative safety.
But Maj Lloyd is less sanguine about the long-term prospects for peace: 'The
tensions that exist will continue to exist after the elections,' he notes.
'Once we leave an area, it stays quiet for a week or two then it starts
again.'
But South Africa's politicians regularly ignore this kind of message from
the military: that troops are no more than a short-term palliative for the
problem of Natal. Without the use of huge numbers of troops - beyond the
capacity of the SADF to provide - the Natal conflict simply cannot be
crushed. Thick bush, irregular terrain, densely packed housing, all make it
difficult to pursue suspects whom the community wishes to hide. Only
politicians, not armoured cars, can penetrate this morass; if they do not do
so, Umlazi's fragile stability could yet prove only short-lived.

But Inkatha Youth Brigade Chairman Charles Loliwe, announcing the

FT  18 APR 94 / Fund seeking support for new issue of SDRs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund is looking for new ways to make its idea of
expanding global foreign exchange reserves more palatable to the
industrialised countries by spreading the expansion out over five years.
IMF managers are expected next week to ask finance ministers from member
countries, as they have at each of their twice-yearly formal meetings for
the last three years, to think again about a new issue of special drawing
rights, the basket of currencies that the Fund uses as its own accounting
instrument and which also functions as an international reserve asset.
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, has repeatedly called for
a new allocation of SDR36bn (Pounds 34.3bn) to member countries, arguing
that many countries - especially those in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union who have joined the IMF since it last issued new SDRs in 1981 -
are desperately short of currency reserves.
These new members have no SDRs in their reserves, but older members have
been reluctant to pass on any of their own SDRs. The IMF's statutes forbid a
restricted issue of SDRs to only some members.
In the face of continued hostility to the issue from Germany, the US and the
UK, which fear the injection of new reserve assets could fuel inflation
around the world, IMF officials have drawn up a scheme to allocate only
SDR16bn at the outset, adding SDR5bn more each year until international
reserves have reached the desired level.
'It would be a distinct mistake for the world not to avail itself of an SDR
allocation at this moment. There is a huge number of countries with
insufficient reserve assets, and a huge number of countries whose import
capacity is constrained by lack of reserves,' a senior IMF official said.
Officials have been dismayed at the difficulty of extracting money from the
industrialised countries to finance development through instruments such as
its enhanced structural adjustment facility (Esaf), which lends money at
very low interest rates to the poorest countries.
They argue that an SDR allocation would help to finance development ends by
monetary means, rather than drawing on scarce budgetary resources and
requiring a protracted parliamentary debate in donor countries.
Parliamentary debate would, however, be necessary in many countries for a
further plan for industrialised countries to give back their share of an
eventual SDR allocation to the IMF, to help finance the developing countries
and the transitional economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
IMF officials acknowledge that the idea of an SDR allocation is unlikely to
come to fruition any time soon, but insist that it is making progress 'at a
respectably slow pace'.

Turkish army commandos, supported by aircraft and helicopter gunships,

the Anatolian news agency reported yesterday Quoting military officials, the
agency said troops killed the guerrillas of the separatist Kurdistan Workers
party (PKK) in the mountainous terrain in the Sivi and Mezideryakeri
regions. The operations, involving about 40,000 troops, are part of a
Turkish spring offensive against the rebels in south-east Turkey and
northern Iraq. Military officials said Turkish troops would remain in
northern Iraq until the end of summer. The PKK has benefited from the
political vacuum in northern Iraq to carry out raids into Turkey from
mountain hideouts in the region. Turkey has responded by frequently bombing
PKK camps.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's trade deficit deteriorated sharply to Dollars 1.53bn in February,
an increase of 24 per cent over the same period last year. The unexpectedly
high deficit may put additional pressure on the peso, which is already
trading at the limit against the dollar allowed by the central bank. The
February deficit was pushed up by a 19 per cent increase in imports, which
reached Dollars 6.02bn in February. Exports rose to Dollars 4.49bn, a 17 per
cent increase. Manufacturing exports jumped by 26 per cent. The government
sought to blame the growth in imports on buoyant exports in its latest
explanation of why the trade deficit is a healthy phenomenon. The government
said some 40 per cent of the imports in February will be used to make goods
that that will soon be exported.

<TEXT>
A threatened national rail strike in Ireland, due to have begun at the
weekend, was called off at the 11th hour after management and unions agreed
to arbitration by the country's Labour Court. The dispute is over changes to
work practices and the introduction of new technology on Ireland's
antiquated rail network. Forty staff had been suspended for refusing to
participate in training courses on the new technology, but following
Friday's agreement, they have now been reinstated and the management has
decided to postpone for one month the introduction of a productivity package
pending the Labour Court ruling. Irish Rail loses around IPounds 90m (Pounds
87m) a year and is estimated to require some IPounds 800m in new investment
to modernise its rail network, rolling stock and signalling and ticketing
systems.

<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the centre-right French prime minister, failed to halt
the decline in his popularity in the latest opinion polls, and is now losing
ground against Mr Jacques Chirac, the Paris mayor, as the favourite
contender in next spring's presidential elections. The prime minister's
approval rating fell by two points in the past month to 43 per cent,
according to the authoritative IFOP poll published in yesterday's Journal du
Dimanche newspaper.
This decline marks a stark contrast to his stellar performance last year.
Perceptions of Mr Balladur have since been clouded by a series of
humiliating climbdowns culminating in this spring's virtual abandonment of
plans for a new minimum youth wage after violent protests by young people
and students.

The increased tariffs on a wide range of imported goods originally imposed
by the Russian government from March 15 have been delayed until July 1,
according to a government statement. The decision followed what the
Kommersant Daily newspaper called at the weekend 'a wave of protests from
the cities' over the prospective price rises on imported goods, which in
some large centres make up 25 per cent of the shopping basket. It also
follows strong protests from foreign states, led by the US. Mr Ron Brown, US
commerce secretary, raised the issue last month with Mr Victor Chernomyrdin
and received a pledge that the tariffs would be re-examined.

The European Bank for Reconstruction (EBRD), designed to help finance
eastern Europe's post-cold war transition to a market economy, yesterday
signed a (Pounds 7m) credit line for a privatised Russian company which used
to make inter-continental missiles aimed at western targets. Mr Jacques de
Larosiere, president of the slimmed-down and re-focused bank, and Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, began the bank's annual meeting
yesterday with the formal signature in St Petersburg of a deal which backs
the first use of a Russian Proton rocket as the launcher for a western
communications satellite.
Mr Ron Freeman, the bank's first vice-president, hailed the deal as the
bank's first venture into the conversion of the military aerospace industry.
Apart from agreeing the standby facility for Khrunichev, the Russian
aerospace company, the bank also helped to secure a waiver of former Cocom
restrictions needed to import the Dollars 36m high-tech Inmarsat satellite
into Russia for launching in 1995 and in obtaining insurance through Lloyd's
in London, he added. Saab/Scania of Sweden is adapting the satellite for
launch at a cost of Dollars 10m. The EBRD has committed over Dollars 560m to
projects in Russia and disbursed over Dollars 100m.

China's failure to explain the mysterious boat fire that killed 32 people -
eight mainland Chinese and the Taiwanese tourists - on a lake in eastern
China on March 31 has been threatening the growing detente between the two
sides.
Taiwan announced plans last week to ban travel to China and to suspend
cultural exchanges unless Beijing gave a satisfactory explanation.
After first describing the fire as an accident China said on its national
television news that the Taiwanese had been robbed and murdered on Thousand
Island Lake by three young men.

FT  18 APR 94 / Parties swing behind Hata: The personalities sharing Japan's
search for a new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of Japan's fractious coalition have reached a draft policy accord
intended to pave the way for the selection of a new prime minister early
this week.
Six of the seven ruling coalition parties aim to finalise the agreement
today on foreign and economic policies and field Mr Tsutomu Hata, the
foreign minister, as the alliance candidate for prime minister in a
parliamentary vote.
A rival bid for the leadership by Mr Michio Watanabe, a former foreign
minister who has announced his defection from the opposition Liberal
Democratic party, is unlikely to succeed. Mr Watanabe hinted yesterday that
he would support the new government.
'There is a definite agreement taking shape and it is natural to ask Mr
Hata,' said Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary- general of Komeito, the
Buddhist-backed Clean Government party.
Mr Hata appears assured of a majority because he has the support of all
parties in the previous government. That includes the New Harbinger party,
which threatened Mr Hata's chances last week by saying that it did not want
to participate in the new cabinet.
Agreement on a new government would bring an end to 10 days of wrangling
provoked by the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa after
allegations of financial impropriety. The row has accelerated the
realignment of Japanese politics, prompting another round of defections from
the LDP and deepening a split between the coalition's right and left wings.
The 10-point outline accord would commit the new government promptly to
enact the current year's budget, to push on with economic deregulation,
increase indirect taxation and to hold the next general election under the
new electoral system, implying that the next poll is to be at least six
months away.
On foreign affairs, Japan should follow UN policy on North Korea and take
'necessary precautions,' says the draft, a reference to possible UN
sanctions over that country's refusal to allow full inspections of its
nuclear sites.
The outline accord was criticised in the Japanese press for merely papering
over the cracks in the government partners' policies. The Social Democratic
party, the alliance's largest and most quarrelsome partner, continues to
oppose a rise in indirect taxes and wants a soft line on North Korea.
Mr Watanabe said that he and his fellow LDP defectors - the number is as yet
unknown - would support coalition policies. 'I understand and quite agree
with the points of agreement drafted by them,' Mr Watanabe said.

FT  18 APR 94 / UN exposed by debacle in Gorazde: Member states' political
expediencies will ultimately determine fate of Bosnia effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Ministry of Defence was yesterday referring all inquiries about
its troops' involvement in the worsening conflict in Bosnia to Unprofor, the
UN protection force.
But when Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, is challenged about the
issue in parliament this week, that sort of answer will not be enough. He
will have to account for his own stewardship of Britain's armed forces.
In Washington, politicians sometimes talk about the US involvement in Bosnia
as though it was a purely national concern; and other times they remember to
proclaim their dogged compliance with whatever they are told by the UN.
With the UN's firepower and bureaucratic empire growing by the day,
politicians in many countries have been tempted to use it as an alibi when
things go wrong. But the disastrous setbacks of recent days have left the UN
in danger of being exposed as a colossus with feet of clay: certainly no
more, and often less, than the sum of its national parts.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the senior UN representative in Yugoslavia, suggested at
the weekend that the UN might have to withdraw from Bosnia altogether. For
Mr Akashi and the UN secretariat, this would be a logical response to an
unsustainable position. But individual members of the Security Council have
entirely different, often conflicting, considerations to take into account.
Therein lies the UN's weakness. It does not speak with a single voice, and
not even its enemies treat it as a single institution.
The Serbs' attack on a British unit in the Sarajevo area over the weekend
would suggest that they, at least, are not influenced by the colour of
soldiers' helmets.
The five permanent members of the Security Council have vested huge powers
in the UN and its bureaucracy, but as the Gorazde debacle has shown they
have sharply contrasting ideas about how those powers should be used.
Moreover, the UN's ability to exercise its responsibilities depends in
practice on contributions of men and money from governments which can be
abruptly withdrawn. The UN in Bosnia has been forced to combine the jobs of
consensus-builder - dependent on co-operation from the warring parties - and
policeman.
Mr Akashi found himself in the former role yesterday when he unsuccessfully
asked the Serbs to hold their fire in Gorazde and release 150 UN personnel.
He stated on Saturday that if the Bosnian Serbs continued to withhold
co-operation, then it would be 'meaningless' for the UN forces to remain in
Bosnia.
His logic was clear enough. It might have been possible for the UN to mix
consensus with coercion if the coercion had been so massive that it brought
all the parties to the table in a conciliatory mood. But, in practice,
coercion has proved less effective than western governments hoped, leaving
the UN's position almost untenable.
In the end, however, the fate of the UN effort in Bosnia will depend not on
Mr Akashi's sound logic, but on the political expediencies weighing on
national governments.
The UN's vulnerability reflects Washington's recent refusal to finance an
increase in Unprofor's numbers.
US and British officials will be weighing up the domestic political cost of
casualties in an ugly, confusing war against the outrage that a massacre of
Moslems would arouse both at home and in friendly Islamic countries like
Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
Nato governments have insisted that air strikes have been used to protect a
handful of UN personnel, not the 65,000 residents of Gorazde. But western
leaders will not escape the political consequences of a rout in Gorazde even
if the formal purpose of the UN mission - to protect its staff - is secured
through a successful evacuation.
Islamic wrath will fall more on the west, which has disappointed the
Bosnians with false promises, than on Russia, which is openly pro-Serb.
Moscow has some reason to be embarrassed by the Serbs' continued offensive.
Yet Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Moscow's foreign minister, never made the extravagant
claims on behalf of his diplomatic approach that were repeatedly advanced by
armchair advocates in the west of 'bombing the Serbs'.
Mr Kozyrev will now tell his western counterparts in the Security Council
that Russian diplomacy sometimes works whereas western air strikes do not
work at all.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, recently boasted that the 'west
had played its last card,' Laura Silber writes from Belgrade. He has
revelled in recent Serb successes, proclaiming that his people are on the
verge of defeating not only their Moslem foes in Gorazde, but the entire
western world.
Serb leaders have excelled in the politics of brinkmanship, brazenly
snubbing the west - and even their traditional friends in Russia - as they
pursue their political and military goals. Last week Mr Karadzic proudly
told Serbs troops besieging Gorazde: 'You are the best army in Europe.'
Despite speculation of splits among the political and military chiefs, Serb
leaders appear united in the face of western indecision.
When Gen Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, last week requested close
air support to protect UN personnel under fire in Gorazde, they added him to
their list of international actors who had to be banished.
'General Rose has finished his mission in Bosnia', said Mr Momcilo
Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serb 'parliament'.
While President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has held back from displaying
open derision towards the west, the Serbian media have hailed the onslaught
on Gorazde. Serbian television has broadcast pictures of a ruddy-faced Gen
Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander, surveying the advance of his
troops from the high ground around Gorazde.
Banner headlines rejoiced over the Serb forces' shooting down of a British
Sea Harrier jet over Gorazde, an incident taken as proof of Nato's weakness
in comparison with the Serbian army.
The military moves in Bosnia in defiance of the outside world have been
echoed on the political front in Serbia. The leadership in Belgrade has
restricted the movement of UN personnel inside the Serbian republic, and
introduced entrance visas.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wide differences of interpretation have emerged between Belarus and Russia
over their economic union treaty, which seems to hand over all economic
levers of power to the Russian government and central bank, writes Leyla
Boulton in St Petersburg.
A senior Belarus minister has said Minsk would be allowed to keep a separate
central bank and that Russian President Boris Yeltsin supported this
position. However, a senior Russian minister has flatly denied the claim,
threatening resignation if it were the case.
Mr Mikhail Myasnikovich, deputy prime minister of Belarus, said that both
the Russian president and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime
minister, had agreed during a CIS summit last week to let it keep a central
bank. A treaty foreseeing the liquidation of the Belarus Central Bank was
signed on Tuesday despite the objection of its chairman.
But Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister, said the
government was 'categorically opposed' to allowing Belarus' own bank to
issue roubles alongside the Russian central bank. He said Russia had agreed
to swap Belarus citizens' savings for roubles at a generous one-to-one rate
only after Minsk's agreement to give up its central bank. 'I will resign
from government if we go back on this,' Mr Shokhin said. He claimed that Mr
Chernomyrdin was also opposed to a change in the deal. He had initially
agreed to let Belarus retain a central bank with responsibility for monetary
emission within limits set by Russia, but later changed his mind.

FT  18 APR 94 / Shortfall of MEPs backing accession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Expansion of the European Union to bring in Sweden, Finland, Austria and
Norway in January next year could now hinge on the votes of a score of
former Italian communists in the European Parliament.
Following the near collapse of the enlargement process over the now-settled
row between Britain and its partners over EU voting rights, it is emerging
that the European Parliament may not be able to muster the requisite votes
on the accession treaty for entry to take place on time.
Any setback in a tight timetable could further inhibit the, at best,
lukewarm enthusiasm for Europe among the population of the four applicant
countries, all of which must submit Union membership to referendum.
The European Parliament has to approve the accession treaty by a majority of
260 of its 518 members on May 4 to keep to the timetable. After May the
Strasbourg assembly dissolves for the June Euro-elections, and could not
look again at enlargement until September at the earliest. This would derail
the four newcomers' referendum plans.
But senior officials at the parliament, after canvassing the main political
blocs, have so far secured pledges of only 248 votes at best.
Part of the problem is that about a quarter of MEPs rarely attend the
parliament. Around half can expect to be replaced in June and, in May, many
will be campaigning for re-election.
The apparats of the two largest blocs, the 198-strong Socialist group and
the Christian Democrats - numbering 162, including 32 British Conservatives
 -are exerting strong pressure on their constituent parts to attend and to
pass the enlargement.
But on the latest calculations the Christian Democrats can only field 100
votes and the Socialists 109. Among the smaller groups, 22 liberals, 14
French Gaullists and Irish Fianna Fail members, and three rebel Greens bump
the figure up to 248 - 12 short of a majority.
The key lies, therefore, in the Socialist bloc where the only undecided
group big enough is the 31-strong Italian Socialists which, following the
implosion of the Italian Socialist party, in practical terms means the 20
MEPs of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) or former communists.
Belgian, Dutch, and some German and French Socialists - as well as some
Christian Democrats from these countries - are refusing to back the
enlargement because they want a 'deepening' of integration to accompany the
Union's 'widening'.
They are annoyed at the marginal concessions on voting rights made to the UK
last month, which they argue will make EU decision-making, in which the
parliament has a greater stake after Maastricht, more difficult.
Even five of the 45 British Labour MEPs, ordered by their party leader Mr
John Smith to support the enlargement, appear unlikely to vote Yes.
This line-up could change, especially following intensive lobbying by
Scandinavian and Austrian Socialist leaders this week.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, Mr Carl Bildt, the
Swedish premier, and a phalanx of applicant country ministers will continue
the lobbying in Strasbourg tomorrow.

FT  18 APR 94 / Walesa threatens to call elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW, ST PETERSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The row between Poland's President Lech Walesa and the ruling coalition
government over the appointment of a new finance minister escalated at the
weekend when the president threatened to dismiss parliament and call new
elections.
Tension between Mr Walesa and the government heightened after deputies from
the ruling post-communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) and the Polish
Peasant party (PSL) tabled draft changes in the country's interim
constitution giving parliament the right to overrule the president's veto on
government appointments.
President Walesa, in Litomysl in the Czech Republic at a meeting of central
European heads of state, said he did not believe the coalition would go
ahead with the changes. 'But if they do, that means elections. I will
convince the people of the danger of the course the coalition is taking,' he
said.
The coalition's move has been prompted by Mr Walesa's refusal to accept the
appointment of Prof Dariusz Rosati, a UN economist and SLD supporter, as
finance minister, following the resignation in February of Mr Marek
Borowski. Mr Borowski had argued with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak over
control of economic policy.
The coalition is arguing that the present interim constitution, passed in
1992, needs to be amended as the president's right of veto over cabinet
appointments deprives the governing majority of the power to replace
ministers. The constitution, as it stands, gives parliament the right to
overrule a presidential veto only when the cabinet is initially appointed.
Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the SLD leader who has persuaded Mr Pawlak to
support the amendment, called yesterday for talks with the president in the
hope he could be persuaded to accept Mr Rosati's appointment and avoid the
need for constitutional change.
The accord between the coalition parties marks a change of heart for Mr
Pawlak, who had initially opposed Prof Rosati's appointment. Mr Pawlak still
wants to increase his control over financial policy; this had been handed to
the SLD under the agreement establishing the coalition last autumn.
The president's hand is not strong as the coalition needs just four further
votes for the amendment to pass. The constitution also only permits the
president to call mid-term elections if parliament is unable to appoint a
government or pass the annual budget. The next parliamentary elections are
due in 1997.
Reuter adds from St Petersburg: Prof Rosati said yesterday he was still
willing to become Poland's finance minister, provided the long wrangle about
the appointment did not seriously damage the economy.
'I don't consider myself as a candidate but apparently the coalition does,'
he said. 'I wouldn't object. . . I would accept.'
He added: 'The economy can fall into disarray. If something fundamental
changes in the economy I would reconsider.'
Among his priorities as finance minister would be promoting privatisation
and enterprise restructuring. It would also be necessary to start work on
the 1995 budget, which would be financed in different ways to the past, he
said.
One possibility would be to raise a Eurodollar loan, and work had to be done
on signing a deal with the International Monetary Fund.

FT  18 APR 94 / Russia begins to choose between Union and empire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'Russia faces a choice: that between the recreation of a Union, and the
imposition of an empire,' according to Mr Sergei Karaganov, influential
deputy head of the European Institute think-tank and presidential adviser on
foreign relations.
Mr Karaganov was co-chairing a conference outside Moscow last Friday on
Russia's place in the world - jointly organised by his institute and the
Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, a German think-tank - as leaders of the
Commonwealth of Independent States struggled in the capital to cope with the
broader international role Russia is now according itself.
The deliberations of the conference shadowed those of the leaders' summit in
eerie counterpoint: as the policy analysts saw a greatly strengthened
Russian hegemony over the former Soviet states, so the Russian leadership
put flesh on their words.
Mr Mark Urnov, one of Russia's leading pollsters and sociological analysts,
presented to the conference a range of poll evidence which showed the huge
shift in both elite and public opinion in the past three years; from a view
in which 'the west was seen as a model, an Eldorado, the centre of
civilisation' to one where the majority believed that foreigners had too
much influence on Russian policy, and favoured a planned economy over a
market one.
Mr Alexander Tsipko, one of the country's leading political philosophers,
said Russia 'never had a national consciousness: it is uniquely without a
national state'. For Mr Tsipko, the destruction of the Soviet Union was also
a destruction of a state in which Russians had felt at home: confining
Russia within its present borders was to give it an impossibly narrow
compass. This is a theme which echoes much of the contemporary political
discourse in Moscow
The views, voiced by men who are principally seen as moderates, are
uncomfortable and were identified as such by the non-Russian participants,
including Germans and Poles. In Moscow, the leaders of the other 11 CIS
states were dealing with the practical result of this new assertiveness and
of their own weakness.
Russia has now an agreement - still subject to differing interpretations -
with Belarus on complete economic union and has seen Ukraine join the
general, and looser, economic union as an associate member. It has also
pinned Kiev down to yet another agreement on the division of the Black Sea
Fleet, with Russia reportedly taking at least 80 per cent of the hardware
(although this too is subject to differing interpretations). And it has
agreed with the central Asian and many Caucasian states to put Russian
frontier troops on external borders, while having military agreements with
nearly all of them.
They are committed to developing a tariff-free zone and to forging new links
between companies, the latter clearly in the interests of Russia which has
by far the largest share of large enterprises.
Leadership has its responsibilities. Russia has sought to bring Armenia and
Azerbaijan to the negotiating table to solve the Nagorno-Karabakh problem
and has won an agreement to put its peacekeepers into Abkhazia. These may
draw its troops into vicious and apparently intractable conflicts but will
increase Moscow's power and prestige while giving its army something to do.
This month's meeting of the CIS could, in retrospect, be seen as the
watershed of the organisation: the one when, after 2 1/2 years when its
existence was in doubt and when its proceedings drowned in unfulfilled
treaties, Russia took control.
Mr Karaganov's choice between Union and empire has still to be made but
there is now little doubt that the trend is towards one or the other.

FT  18 APR 94 / Berlusconi moves on Fininvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who is most likely to be Italy's next prime minister,
has made the first move to distance himself from his Fininvest business
empire by altering plans for the flotation of his publishing interests and
accepting the principle of a majority stake being in public hands.
Mr Berlusconi described the move to sell up to 53 per cent of shares in his
Mondadori publishing group, once combined with Silvio Berlusconi Editore
(Sbe) his other publishing interests, as ' a considerable sacrifice'. Until
now Mr Berlusconi has always insisted on having majority, if not absolute,
control of his companies.
Only two of the more than 300 Fininvest companies - Mondadori and Standa
stores group - are quoted and both these were acquisitions. Publishing
accounts for some 20 per cent of Finvest's business, Europe's second largest
media empire.
Mr Berlusconi would still be able to exercise control of Mondadori and it
would be surprising if he did not seek a friendly shareholder to guarantee
such control. But Mr Fidele Confalonieri, Fininvest chairman since Mr
Berlusconi stepped down to take up politics, insisted this was an important
symbolic step.
Financial analysts saw the decision as a necessary move to reorganise
Fininvest's publishing side with an annual turnover of L1,900bn (Pounds
790m) and reduce the empire's debt which topped L3,800bn in 1993. The new
floatation plans, cleared with Consob, the Milan bourse watch-dog late on
Friday, could raise close to L1,000bn for Fininvest - nearly one-third more
than the original plan drawn up last year.
The complex scheme involves the unscrambling of plans which began with a
reverse take-over by the non-quoted Sbe of the bigger Mondadori. Although
Mondadori's 1993 turnover of L1,787bn was six times greater than Sbe, the
latter last year raised its stake to 98 per cent in Mondadori. This was to
allow quotation of all Mr Berlusconi's publishing interests and have the
Berlusconi name on the Milan stock exchange.
With Mr Berlusconi likely to head the next government it was considered
better to use only the Mondadori name.

FT  18 APR 94 / Spain expects exports to lead recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish government is increasingly confident that the economy will grow
this year following last year's decline, according to Mr Pedro Solbes,
economy and finance minister.
The current account could break even for the first time since 1986, when
Spain joined the European Community. Last year it showed a deficit of
Pta632bn (Pounds 3.1bn).
Mr Solbes expects the export-led recovery to be 'closer to 1.5 per cent than
1 per cent'. His forecast is higher than most private projections, although
there is consensus among analysts that Spain will show positive growth. The
1993 recession was Spain's worst economic performance in 30 years.
Sluggish private consumption and limited investment growth would be offset
by a sharp rise in exports and tourist receipts, Mr Solbes said. Both
exports and imports were increasing faster than the government expected.
Unemployment, the highest in Europe at almost 24 per cent according to the
last quarterly survey, should begin to fall in the second half of the year,
with a sharp reduction in 1995 and 1996, he said.
Inflation, now running at an annual rate of 5 per cent, should also fall in
the second half. The government has a 3.5 per cent target for the year.
Mr Solbes, a political independent in the Socialist government, emphasised
the need to cut public spending, which, including regional government
expenditure, accounted for more than 7 per cent of GDP last year. Spain was
running out of leeway to increase tax revenues and needed to go further with
budget control, he said. This had to include reducing subsidies to
loss-making state companies.
He admitted that privatisation in Spain had been 'slow and limited' but
added that there were few companies that could easily be privatised. It
would be unrealistic to expect state steel, coal or shipbuilding companies
to be denationalised.
It would be difficult for Spain to bring its public deficit down to 3 per
cent of GDP by 1997, the EU convergence target for the third phase of
economic and monetary union.
Spain hoped to review its convergence programme with the EU in July.
Reflecting growing government anxiety over the controversy surrounding Mr
Mariano Rubio, the former Bank of Spain governor, Mr Solbes said it would be
'enormously negative from all points of view' if allegations of tax evasion
by Mr Rubio were proved true.

FT  18 APR 94 / Way clear for Forza Italia chief: Right-wing allies see
their candidates elected as speakers
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The slow constitutional procedure for forming a new Italian government
grinds into gear this week when President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro begins talks
with the leaders of political parties.
It is now a virtual certainty that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate,
will be called upon to head the next government, but he is unlikely to be
given the mandate until after April 25.
On April 25 Italy celebrates the nation's liberation from fascism and Nazi
occupation. President Scalfaro is said to be anxious to avoid this being
turned into a destabilising demonstration against the new right-wing
government that is backed by the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance which is
inspired by the ideals of Mussolini.
The way was opened at the weekend for forming the next government by the
election of the speakers of the two houses of parliament. The Freedom
Alliance, composed of three main parties - Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the
populist Northern League, and the National Alliance - and the small
Christian Democrat Centre succeeded in having both their candidates elected.
This is the first time in Italy's post-war parliamentary history that a
future governing alliance has sought to impose its own candidates and not
seek a broader consensus with the opposition. The move was intended as a
deliberate break with the past where the opposition was co-opted into being
part of the political system by agreeing to share some of the senior offices
of state - such as the speaker of the chamber of deputies.
The new speaker of the chamber of deputies is Ms Irene Pivetti, a militant
catholic aged 31, who was first elected as a League deputy in 1992. She is
the youngest speaker ever and was elected with 347 of the 617 votes cast in
the 630-seat chamber.
Ms Pivetti raised some eyebrows by her acceptance speech in which she openly
dedicated herself to God and ignored both the traditional homage to the
outgoing speaker, Mr Giorgio Napolitano, the highly respected former
communist, and the normal respectful address of the house members as
'honourable'.
In the Senate, the Freedom Alliance candidate Mr Carlo Scognamiglio, a
Liberal senator who defected to Forza Italia, just managed to win on the
fourth round against outgoing speaker Mr Giovanni Spadolini by 162 votes
against 161. After the first round of voting on Friday, which Mr
Scognamiglio lost, Mr Berlusconi warned fresh general elections might be
necessary. This threat brought a sharp rebuke from President Scalfaro.

FT  18 APR 94 / Railtrack plans cut in Pounds 1.8bn repair bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack, the company that took over British Rail's infrastructure this
month, is planning to cut the Pounds 1.8bn annual cost of maintaining
Britain's railway network.
The costs squeeze is bound to raise fears of job losses among the 33,500
people employed in maintenance departments. It may have far-reaching effects
for the hundreds of companies that have traditionally supplied British Rail.
Mr Bob Horton, Railtrack's chairman, has identified cutting maintenance
costs as a top priority if the company is to be profitable enough to be
privatised.
Railtrack will press for significant price cuts in negotiations over the
next 12 months with the 14 regional units in British Rail Infrastructure
Services (Bris), which maintains and renews track, signalling and power
supply equipment.
Reducing maintenance charges is one of the main ways Railtrack plans to earn
the return on capital required by the Treasury and prepare the business for
privatisation in a few years' time. It must earn a return of 5.6 per cent on
its Pounds 6.5bn assets, rising to 8 per cent after four years, the Treasury
has said.
Initially Railtrack will buy maintenance services from the Bris units, but
it hopes also to use outside contractors to increase competition. Ultimately
the Bris units themselves will be privatised. Some are expected to merge to
form larger, more viable organisations.
Mr John Edmonds, chief executive of Railtrack, indicated that job reductions
appeared likely. He said: 'I would not underestimate the working practice
problems we face.'
The move from internal agreements within a single organisation, British
Rail, to the 'discipline' of commercial contracts negotiated between
independent companies will bring about pressure for change in
long-established supply relationships.
The clampdown on maintenance spending is a central ingredient in Railtrack's
programme to get better value for money from suppliers.
Mr Horton said: 'We want to take the capital we have available and use it to
get the railway into the state of maintenance it should be in. We don't want
it sloshing around going to the person who shouts the loudest.'
The government has allocated Pounds 500m to Railtrack for investment
projects this year, rising to Pounds 750m in two years' time.

FT  18 APR 94 / UK may back moves to pull out UN troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain would be prepared to back moves to pull United Nations troops out of
Bosnia, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, indicated yesterday, as
ministers came under cross-party fire over their handling of the crisis.
Mr Rifkind said the UN was right to warn that it would have to pull out of
the region completely if it became impossible to fulfil its peacekeeping
mandate.
In a BBC Radio 4 interview, he dismissed the 'facile suggestion' of armchair
commentators that the warring factions in Bosnia could be bombed into
submission by Nato air strikes.
His comments came as Labour accused Nato's political leaders of 'indecision
and vacillation' while renewing its call for an emergency meeting of the UN
Security Council.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said there did not seem to be
'any clear political strategy to guide military action on the ground at
Gorazde'. Nato and the UN 'must make clear to the Bosnian Serbs that if the
ceasefire does not endure, then air strikes will result'.
The government also came under attack from its own back benches, with Mr
Terry Dicks, MP for Hayes and Harlington, saying he was 'appalled' that
Britain was still thinking about sending in more troops.
He called for British troops to be withdrawn 'straight away'. Referring to
the death of Royal Marine Timothy Coates, shot yesterday at a checkpoint in
Sarajevo while off duty, Mr Dicks said: 'Yet another British soldier has
been killed. We should not be there.'
But another Conservative - Mr Patrick Cormack, MP for Staffordshire South -
said such a pull-out would be a contemptible abdication of responsibility.
Ministers are likely to face fresh criticism in the House of Commons today
if a Labour demand for Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to make a
statement to MPs is accepted.
Downing Street said last night that Mr John Major, the prime minister, was
being kept informed of developments while in his Huntingdon constituency.
Mr Rifkind criticised countries that had not so far honoured pledges to send
extra troops. He said of 1,300 troops provided in the last two weeks, 900
had been British.

FT  18 APR 94 / Bank was warned of crisis at Schneider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank, the biggest creditor to the bankrupt Jurgen Schneider
property group, was told about the impending crisis at the privately-owned
company four days before the group's difficulties were made public last
week.
Mr Hellmut Hartmann, chief press spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said yesterday
that Mr Jurgen Schneider, the property developer who built up the group that
bears his name, wrote to a member of the bank's board saying that on medical
advice he had had to travel to an unknown destination and give up day-to-day
responsibility for managing the business.
The letter highlights the closeness of Germany's biggest bank to the failed
property developer. Deutsche is thought to be owed DM1.2bn (Pounds 480m) by
Schneider out of a total of at least DM5bn owed to more than 40 bank
creditors. Tradesmen and small businessmen are owed another DM250m. The
group's remaining cash resources were estimated at just DM5m when Jurgen
Schneider AG, the holding company at the heart of the group, filed for
bankruptcy last Friday.
In the long letter, Mr Schneider asked Mr Ulrich Weiss of Deutsche Bank to
provide further cash for the company in his absence and if necessary to wind
up the property group's affairs in an orderly way. The letter arrived at
Deutsche's headquarters in Frankfurt by special messenger on April 7.
Speculation continues about Mr Schneider's whereabouts, with suggestions
that he has fled to either Iran or Florida.
After receiving the letter, the bank quickly started talks with Jurgen
Schneider AG officials. After those discussions, the bank rejected the
request for further finance on April 10.
The difficulties of the group were made public late last Monday. Three days
later Deutsche Bank sued Mr Schneider, in his absence, alleging fraud.
Deutsche has insisted that it was not the company's 'house bank'.

FT  18 APR 94 / Growth in retail sales slows down ahead of tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK retail sales grew only slowly in March, according to the latest
distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry. The
survey will be seen as further evidence that consumers have become cautious
ahead of this month's tax increases.
Official retail sales figures will be published by the Central Statistical
Office on Thursday. The consensus forecast among analysts is for a 0.3 per
cent volume increase between February and March, giving an annual growth
rate of 2.7 per cent.
If the retail sales figures announced on Thursday are weak, hopes of an
early interest rate cut will increase. The recently published minutes of
meetings between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr
Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, showed that the chancellor
was worried about the potential impact of this month's tax increases on the
recovery.
Mr Clarke and Mr George agreed at their meeting on March 2 that signs of
weakening in the recovery, provided they were accompanied by news that
inflation was under control, might herald a cut.
Friday's statistics on retail prices, which showed a fall in underlying
inflation to an annual rate of 2.4 per cent in March, met one of the
necessary conditions.
The CBI survey shows that the balance of retailers reporting an increase in
sales in March, compared with a year ago, was 12 percentage points.
The balances in early 1994 have been much lower than the levels of 20-30
points recorded in the second half of 1993. Figures are calculated by
deducting the proportion of those experiencing a decrease in sales from
those reporting an increase.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades survey panel,
said 'the modest growth in retail sales in March is perhaps a further
indicator of the uncertainty facing consumers'.

FT  16 APR 94 / Retreat on Welsh colliery closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal has reprieved Tower Colliery in Mid Glamorgan, which it had
sought to close yesterday with the loss of 250 jobs, Roland Adburgham
writes.
Members of the NUM mineworkers' union at Tower, the last deep mine in south
Wales, voted yesterday to continue their opposition to the closure and
reject the redundancy terms. After the vote, British Coal withdrew its
proposal 'in light of the strength of the NUM's feeling and the union's
optimism for the future of the colliery'.
British Coal announced last week that it planned to close the pit yesterday.
It is now intended to carry on production at the present rate, although
there are 420,000 tonnes of coal on the surface at Tower.

FT  16 APR 94 / Toppled chief looks back in acceptance: But the collapse
'need never have happened'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man who has just lost control of a business he built from nothing to
one of the UK's largest privately held manufacturing groups, Sir Neville
Bowman-Shaw shows a remarkable lack of bitterness.
It is remarkable because Sir Neville, who, with his brother Mr Trevor
Bowman-Shaw, owns Lancer Boss, says the receivership of the largest UK-owned
lift-truck producer need never have happened. 'It's a great pity, as there
were alternatives on the table,' he says.
In the past few days Sir Neville has been almost a bystander in one of the
most unusual and fastest-moving corporate collapses seen in UK manufacturing
industry.
His version of events reveals how, in hindsight, he might have acted
differently.
Last autumn, he says, Bayerische Hypo-Bank, lead bank for Lancer Boss's
German subsidiary Steinbock Boss, suggested that Lancer Boss should meet
potential German investors in the company. Protracted talks began with
Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck producer, but it was not until
March 18 that an offer was received.
The offer, says Sir Neville, was for Lancer Boss' German, Austrian, UK and
Irish operations. It was for a nominal amount, he says, and was rejected.
Meanwhile, he adds, the company's UK banks and some of the German banks had
become concerned that there was only one suitor for Lancer Boss. In response
Sir Neville identified 'three or four' alternative investors. Deals with any
of these, he says, would have ensured full payment of Lancer Boss'
creditors.
Jungheinrich, he says, came back on March 30 with another nominal offer for
the German and Austrian companies, and eventually presented Sir Neville with
a seven-day conditional offer on the Thursday after Easter.
Sir Neville says he was told by legal advisers that he should not sign the
contract.
Following the refusal, the German banks withdrew facilities from Steinbock
Boss and, a few hours after a receiver had been appointed to the German unit
on April 8, Mr Allan Phillips and Mr Scott Barnes of Grant Thornton were
appointed receivers to the UK operations.
Sir Neville reflects that he should never have let Lancer Boss develop with
two separate banking groups. 'I am not being anti-German,' he says, 'but the
fact is that the German banking group thought a national solution was
satisfactory, but I think they are wrong. NatWest were looking for a more
European solution.'
He should also have given Lancer Boss a better financial structure, he adds.
He had tried to clinch a deal two years ago with a trade investor that would
have secured a long-term future for Lancer Boss, but was overtaken by the
recession.
Now Sir Neville says he faces a more austere future. And what does he miss
most? 'My driver  - people said I'd miss my driver most of all and it's
true. We were in the same regiment.'

FT  16 APR 94 / Lancer Boss hit by EU discord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER, KEVIN BROWN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The receivers to Lancer Boss, the UK lift-truck producer, yesterday attacked
the differences in UK and German insolvency procedures which have prevented
a sale of the combined UK and German businesses together.
Mr Allan Griffiths, a partner at Grant Thornton, said 'lack of harmony' in
European Union insolvency legislation was 'a matter of concern to me and the
insolvency profession'.
He said he would have preferred to have been in control of all the group's
subsidiaries, including Steinbock Boss, which went into German receivership
a week ago and was purchased on Thursday by Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based
lift-truck producer.
The purchase puts Jungheinrich in a strong position to buy Lancer Boss in
the UK but Mr Griffiths said there was still active UK and foreign interest
in acquiring the company.
Jungheinrich has yet to launch a bid and Mr Griffiths will meet Jungheinrich
executives early next week to discuss a trading relationship between
Steinbock Boss and Lancer Boss in the UK.
Mr Griffiths' comments come at a time when EU officials are in talks over
the possibility of increased co-operation on insolvency matters, including a
draft bankruptcy law across the EU.
The Department of Trade and Industry is also understood to be taking a close
interest in the difficulties of the UK receivers at Lancer Boss that have
been caused by the different approach of the German receiver.
The DTI said that it was too early to say whether the Lancer Boss collapse
would give fresh impetus to discussions between EU members on the
administration of cross-border receiverships. 'We recognise that there
appear to have been some difficulties here, and we are looking to see what
lessons there may be for the future.'
Mr Griffiths' criticism of lack of harmony in EC insolvency legislation was
echoed by Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, chairman of Lancer Boss before its
receivership. He said: 'I am sure that this case will prompt a review of
insolvency procedures in Europe.'
Mr Griffiths said he still believed that the value of Lancer Boss would have
been maximised by the sale of the combined UK and German businesses. But,
following the sale of Steinbock Boss, he would seek to sell the UK business
as a going concern and was encouraged by the interest received, including
some new approaches.
He stressed that Lancer Boss continued to trade and was operating normally.
He added: 'I believe the right organisation can make it pay.'
But he said he would not be able to sell the company until he had tied up a
trading relationship with Jungheinrich. There is considerable trading of
products and components between Steinbock Boss and Lancer Boss.
Meanwhile Mr Ludwig Schneider, a German-based management consultant and
restructuring specialist who was appointed late last year as the first group
chief executive of Lancer Boss, refused to comment on his time at the UK
company.
It is believed that Mr Schneider was introduced to Sir Neville by Bayerische
Hypo-Bank, lead bank for Steinbock Boss. Sir Neville said Mr Schneider was
the 'exclusive interface' with Jungheinrich in protracted discussions about
a possible takeover.
He would not say why Mr Schneider, a Brazilian who works for CMI, a Munich
consultancy, left the company in February, although it is known that Mr
Charles Whyte was appointed by Lancer Boss's UK banking group to replace
him.

FT  16 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Fish for feasting - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My knowledge of South African cooking is minimal. I have tucked greedily
into steaming dishes of bobotie, described as South Africa's answer to
shepherd's pie, and I have feasted on marvellously aromatic mangoes whipped
up into mousses and ice creams or simply cut from the stone in crescent moon
slices.
And that was it until a reader wrote and introduced me to one of her
family's favourites. She serves it as a light lunch dish or a first course
for dinner, with good bread and butter on the side and a salad of green
leaves laced with slivers of avocado.
CAPE PICKLED FISH (serves 6-8)
Shut the doors and open the kitchen windows wide before you embark on this
recipe and do not close the windows for an hour or so afterwards. Otherwise,
the smell of frying fish and vinegar fumes might overpower the cook.
Ingredients: 2 1/4 lb thick fillets of hake or cod, cut into 8-12 pieces; 7
fl oz oil; 3 large onions, sliced wafer thin;  1/4 lb pale muscavado sugar;
3 tablespoons finely-chopped chillies; 1 tablespoon finely-chopped fresh
ginger root; 3 tablespoons curry powder; 2 teaspoons sea salt; 1 teaspoon
lightly-toasted and crushed coriander seeds; 4 bay leaves; 1pt wine vinegar.
Method: Wash the fish, thoroughly pat it dry and remove any visible bones.
Heat  1/4 pt of the oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan until a light
haze appears. Then, fry the fish in batches for three to four minutes on
each side until golden brown. Drain well on crumpled kitchen paper.
Discard the oil remaining in the pan. Wipe out the pan and put the remaining
2 fl oz of fresh oil into it. Heat it and saute the onions gently for 10
minutes or so until soft and golden.
Sprinkle the onions with the sugar, add the chillies and ginger, curry
powder, coriander, bay and salt and cook over a low flame for two minutes,
stirring continuously.
Mix the vinegar with  1/2 pt cold water and pour it into the pan in a thin,
steady stream, stirring the contents of the pan all the time. Bring to the
boil and then simmer, uncovered, over minimal heat for 10 minutes to allow
flavours to blend and volume to reduce a little.
Lay the fish in a dish, overlapping the pieces slightly to make them fit if
necessary, and pour on the contents of the pan to immerse the fish
completely. Cover tightly with food film and foil and refrigerate for at
least two days before eating so the marinade permeates the fish well.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Skandia, the Swedish insurer, is to ease controversial restrictions on
shareholder voting rights. The move is partly in response to pressure from
Swedish institutional shareholders who had threatened to boycott a SKr2.8bn
(Dollars 354m) rights issue.
The move installs the principle of one share, one vote, for the first time
in the company's 140-year history. This is subject to an overall limit,
however, as shareholders will be unable to vote for more than 5 per cent of
the shares represented at a general meeting.
Under the old system, dating from 1855, shareholders were restricted to a
maximum of 30 votes, however big their stake. The restriction played a
crucial role in fending off a hostile bid from two other Scandinavian
insurers.
More recently, several of Skandia's big institutional shareholders have been
demanding more say in the group's affairs.

FT  16 APR 94 / Premiership battle could shatter Japanese coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a sweeping realignment in Japanese politics grew
dramatically yesterday after a third prime ministerial candidate emerged.
The Liberal Democratic party, which ruled the country for 38 years until it
was ousted last summer, was threatened with a split when Mr Michio Watanabe,
a party faction leader and former foreign minister, said he may form a
breakaway party.
If he does so, the dominant right wing of the fractious coalition which took
office in August may back him for the premiership, a move which would be
likely to bring the departure of the left from the current seven-party
government.
Mr Watanabe's supporters said he was preparing to put himself forward as a
prime ministerial candidate against the two other likely contestants, Mr
Yohei Kono, LDP president, and Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister.
'For me, the nation is more important than the LDP,' said Mr Watanabe, after
a two-hour meeting with Mr Kono in which the LDP leader failed to talk him
into loyalty.
Separately, five LDP members of parliament under the leadership of Mr
Michihiko Kano, a rising star of one of its two largest factions, yesterday
left the party to form an independent party. Five more said they might
follow.
Until yesterday, Mr Hata was the clear front-runner to succeed Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa as prime minister in a parliamentary vote next week. Mr Hosokawa
announced his resignation last week because of allegations of financial
impropriety.
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, deputy leader of the Japan Renewal party, the core of the
coalition's right wing, is open to partnership with Mr Watanabe and his
supporters. If this did happen, up to 90 members of parliament on the
coalition's left wing could leave in protest, so Mr Watanabe would have to
bring with him enough LDP defectors to compensate.
The New Harbinger party, a 15-member group inside the current coalition,
confirmed that it wanted no future cabinet posts but would co-operate with
the alliance.
The coalition can make no progress in preparing a new government until Mr
Watanabe clarifies his intentions, said officials.
Coalition leaders are due to meet tomorrow to discuss strategy. Mr Hata
yesterday appeared to signal a willingness to work with Mr Watanabe.

FT  16 APR 94 / Form a queue for your ID card: A National Gold Card will
quickly break down any libertarian scruples
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea came to me in Barclays bank. It will solve the government's
problems with unemployed scroungers, cut waste in the welfare state and make
the police happy. It will make the British more like Germans, which is long
overdue; and it will be popular.
Requiring, for perfectly legal reasons, a large amount of cash in a hurry, I
presented my Robert Fleming gold card to the lady in Barclays and was
rebuffed. She rightly demanded proof that I was not a crook; but when I
offered an impressive card issued by the Association of Chief Police
Officers, complete with photograph and handsome logo showing that my owner
is the Financial Times, she still refused to hand over the readies; wanted
proof of signature which I had not got; subjected me to a sceptical gaze and
was frigidly unimpressed by my representations that the FT was only a block
away, that the picture was excellent, endorsed by Scotland Yard . . . and
that, honestly, did I look like a thief . . . customers behind started to
cough nervously.
Suddenly, I understood the rage and frustration which must overtake a
suppliant in the dole queue whose story is disbelieved - and I, at least,
was asking for my own money. Yet I see the difficulty of the the person
behind the counter. Scroungers look very much like anyone else applying for
state benefits. Criminals with forged gold cards wear sharp suits and live
in Bayswater. And I had a card from a bank she had never heard of, an
odd-looking police ID and was demanding Pounds 2,000 in ready cash.
So why not transfer the picture (and its police endorsement) to the Visa
card, record finger-prints, password, mother's birthday and name of
favourite singer on the magnetic stripe? Then next time, she will say: 'Good
morning, Mr Wilkinson. You remembered flowers for the 14th? How can I help
you? Pounds 2,000? . . . The new Bartoli CD is fantastic, by the way'.
Libertarians would doubtless claim that such new-style credit cards were
police identity cards in disguise: what Hitler would have imposed and
similar rubbish. The fact is that more than half the adult population in
Britain uses this kind of ID card without anxiety. However, theft and
counterfeit by well-organised criminals is increasingly threatening their
integrity. (Worldwide credit card fraud is running at about Dollars 1bn a
year.) So the addition of photographs and other security information, now
being considered by some banks, will soon become universal.
What has this to do with the unemployed or with the police? The point is
that law-abiding middle class people like the status conferred by plastic
cards with or without photographs for getting into work, into bank accounts
or getting discounts in restaurants.
The government would like the other half to be similarly identified to help
reduce benefits frauds and other crimes. But it dares not impose the hated
ID card in the land of the free. Its image is still smudged with the
sufferings of war, fascism and Teutonic orderliness.
The government's error is to regard a national ID card as an instrument of
compulsion. It should be be entirely voluntary and offer lots of goodies,
just like a bank gold card, but available to all. Banks would surely accept
it as additional proof of identity, so it would be useful to the middle
classes. The government would require the banks to accept the card in their
cash machines, which would be linked electronically to a citizen account
which everyone would be entitled to have at the Bank of England.
Expensive? Well, there would be savings because benefits claimants could
collect their cash through a hole in the wall like everybody else, although
of course initial claims would be processed manually. Those who insisted on
a Briton's traditional right to queue for his cash would find the queues
long.
But how would this card become popular? By a tax-free national performance
bonus to be paid into every account when public borrowing dipped below the
Chancellor's target, perhaps? National Gold Card accounts could offer highly
advantageous Savings products and maybe a Pounds 1m lottery prize. Discounts
on police fines? It is just a question of marketing.
When almost everyone had a National Gold Card we would soon find out who the
fraudsters are and the woman at Barclays would discover at last that I am,
really, honestly, only a journalist.

FT  16 APR 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Misfit, psychopath, film critic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I am reluctant to generalise. But arts critics
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
especially film and television critics - must be one of the most wretched
groups of people on the face of the earth. They are troglodytes, misfits,
odd-balls. Also highly dangerous. Many of them come from broken homes, you
know, and are astonished to have found any sort of employment, ill-paid
though it may be.
Film and television critics come in two basic shapes: tall and half-starved,
or mean, small and round. In my dealings with them I have become most wary
of the mean, small and round ones. The appearance of both sorts is
extraordinarily tiresome: cravats are much favoured, as are turtle-necked
sweaters, beige-coloured jackets and suede shoes stained by soup drops.
This is neither the time nor place to describe their various gloomy
orientations. But it would not be untimely to register my disgust at the
odiousness of their opinions, which can be amazingly uncritical.
In common with all sane people, I am relieved that the British government
has agreed to yield on the matter of violent videos, and that it will
introduce tougher laws to help prevent young children being exposed to
pornographic and violent films.
Retailers or distributors who sell or hire unclassified videos will be
liable to two years' imprisonment, with the prospect of a six-month sentence
for those who supply 18-certificate films to under-aged children. The
director of the British Board of Film Classification, James Ferman, said
this week: 'From now on, we are going to have to cut more and classify
higher . . . some (films) that would have had an 18 certificate may not be
given a video licence at all.'
This is long overdue. Only a pig on a pink cloud, you might think, could
still peddle the knee-jerk response that all censorship is vile and
misguided; or that 'artistic freedom' is so precious and indivisible that
the makers of wildly exploitative films are to be defended with the same
arguments and fervour that would be extended to the makers of Schindler's
List or Hamlet. This is poppycock, and highly fraudulent.
Yet all sorts of rubbish has been written, even in recent days, defending
film-makers' absolute freedom to wallow where they will. Film and television
critics are hugely culpable - the very people who have shown themselves so
ill-equipped to defend the rest of us, especially parents, from the garbage,
particularly graphic violence and sadism, served up by film-makers and
distributors grubbing for profits.
Critics write for each other. They see too many films. They are concussed,
confused and irredeemably coarsened.
Belatedly, I have been catching up with Michael Medved's book, Hollywood vs.
America, which is subtitled Popular Culture and the War on Traditional
Values. You do not have to agree with everything Medved says in order to
endorse his cut and thrust.
In the preface to the British paperback edition of his book he says, quite
accurately: 'Poverty, racism and marital breakdown are all enormously
complex problems that will require many years of effort for any discernible
progress to be made; reducing the levels of violence in the media, on the
other hand, should be quite easy.'
Himself a critic and screen writer, Medved broke ranks and rounded on his
colleagues for their sympathetic treatment of Peter Greenaway's film, The
Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. 'When you look at the great reviews
for a loathsome little picture like this one, you can understand why so many
people don't trust film critics any more,' said Medved when the film opened
in the US. 'I actually feel ashamed to be part of this profession.'
He abhors, as I do, critics' penchant for describing camera-work, editing,
acting, set design - whatever - while ignoring, often, the morality of a
film's content or execution. 'The politically correct . . . notion is that
we should never dig deeper - to consider whether a given work is true, or
good, or spiritually nourishing - or to evaluate its impact on society.'
My remedy: banish all arts critics to the sports desk and make them write
about that. But it would be risky. Many editors would simply transfer their
sports writers to the arts desk, to write about film and dance. Sports
writers: now there is a bunch of psychopaths . . .

FT  16 APR 94 / Private View: Jimmy Reid builds his own soapbox / A former
apostle of international revolution explains how his beliefs fit with his
Scottish nationalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once he was news. Now he is a purveyor of news. Jimmy Reid, the former
shipyard shop steward, Scottish folk hero and communist pin-up boy, is
turning media proprietor. He launches a weekly current affairs magazine at
the end of the month.
No doubt former comrades of the loquacious Reid will see his Seven Days
Scotland as a grandiose gesture typical of the man whose transit from strike
leader to chat show performer, TV presenter and newspaper columnist they
have so envied and derided.
Nor is history on his side. It is a media pundits' maxim that there is no
market in Britain for illustrated weekly news magazines. Look, they say, at
Sir James Goldsmith's Now] magazine or Brian Wilson's Seven Days.
But Jimmy Reid is no fool, even if he talks a hell of a lot. He can turn out
a sharp polemic on religious bigotry, soccer hooliganism or Northern Ireland
as neatly as any tabloid leader writer, and a piece of analysis as trenchant
as any political commentator's.
His spoken rhetoric may be ear-numbing and its fervour may seem contrived.
But that does not mean Reid is not sincere. The fact that he left school at
14 with not much more than a big personality and a lot of charm did not stop
him devouring the heavyweight political and literary classics in his early
teens.
Reid's home in south Glasgow, not far from the Gorbals slum where he was
born, is eloquent. It is a tenement in a handsomely restored building whose
high-ceilinged rooms have been decorated in smart suburban good taste. In
London, a flat like this would cost a fortune.
The big study is arrayed with books - dictionaries, poetry, politics, music
 -like that of a comfortably off Oxbridge don. On the walls hang the
mementoes of his activist past, including a famous photograph from the 1971
work-in at Upper Clyde Shipbuilders which forced the Heath government into a
policy U-turn and made Reid a national celebrity.
Reid has aged comfortably. Yet even in the quiet of his own study, with a
bright red pullover stretched over his middle-age paunch and a bottle of
whisky at his elbow, he has the hectoring manner of the 19-year-old
apprentices' strike leader. Listening to Reid is rather like listening to an
opera singer practising in his bath: the voice lurches dramatically from
rumbling piano to fortissimo squeak, from confiding recitative to passionate
aria.
When I asked him why Scotland needed a news magazine, Reid launched into a
fiery recital of past English repression: the ban on the kilt, the quashing
of clan names (Reid, meaning 'red,' was the name adopted by the Robertson
clan) and the unjust terms of the Act of Union.
'Now don't misunderstand me,' he said. 'When the Scots keep shouting, it is
because (he growled menacingly) 'they are fearful. That's why we shout about
our Scottishness.'
But the real reason was 'a crisis of politics'. By this he means that the
number of Conservative MPs elected in Scotland has fallen from 22 in 1979 to
only 11 out of the 72 seats. Scots thus find themselves 'virtually
disenfranchised. They are having imposed on them a political culture which
is profoundly alien to them. Even the Tories can't stand it up here, apart
from a few hacks.'
Reid's magazine will not be political as such. It will cover leisure, arts
and sport and although its editorial line will be left of centre and
strongly devolutionist, its pages will be open to all points of view.
'There are right-wing views which canna be just bloody dismissed. They're
legitimate. But what I want to see - what we don't get in Scotland - is a
debate.'
Reid has raised Pounds 100,000 start-up capital from private investors but
he and his co-editor, Bob Houston, a fellow Glaswegian with years of
newspaper production experience, retain control. The spirit of the venture
may be Glaswegian but the contents are designed to appeal also to genteel
Edinburgh.
When I said Scotland was a geographical entity certainly, a state of mind
perhaps, but probably no longer a nation, Reid was outraged.
'By any definition ever penned, Scotland is a nation: it has a settled
territory, a jurisprudence, an economy. Not only that, it is one of the
oldest nations in this world. Do you think when the Romans drew Hadrian's
Wall, that was an accident?' He quoted Tacitus at me: 'They create a
desolation and call it peace', a reference to an early Scottish warlord who
was able to field 30,000 men against Agricola.
He talked of the de-industrialisation of Scotland under a neo-Conservative
government. 'It's got a genocidal dimension. It wasn't the bullets of the
settlers that killed the Red Indians, it was when they destroyed their
economy. Whenever I see young people leaving Scotland, I see an almost
genocidal process.'
But what makes you think your potential readers see it like that?
'If I was a neo-fascist entrepreneur starting a magazine, its political line
would still have to be centre-left. The only thing is, he wouldn't mean it
and I mean it absolutely.'
We argued about the distinction between race and nation and Reid said: 'If
you can't love Scotland you can't love the world. If you're a socialist and
you can't love your family don't talk to me about your love of humanity.'
He was moving up through the gears now. 'I am an internationalist and a
nationalist. I believe in good loving relationships between those who have a
sense of their own national identity. And I'll go further: if you love what
is good in your own people, you will love and admire similar sentiments in
the breasts of other people.'
When he is talking politics these days, Reid seems to prefer fluency to
focus. It is as if details bore him; what matters is the grand sweep. But he
certainly has the gift of the gab: 'Every pimp will argue a case that
justifies his activities in terms of market forces,' he said at one point,
'every brothel-keeper, every drug trafficker, every arms dealer. Tell me how
you handle the destruction of the rainforests on the basis of a programme
that's funded from the market?
Both before and after he left the Communist party - the party which had
groomed him for its highest post - to rejoin Labour in 1976, Reid was
regarded as a natural for the House of Commons. He stood for Parliament
under both banners but never pursued the safe Labour seat that could have
been his. Was this a waste of his natural talents?
'All I can say is that I've always been interested in politics, but in the
ideas - where are we going as a society, and so on. I always had an abiding
suspicion of career politicians. To me politics was all about stopping
children getting murdered by their social circumstances.' (Three of Reid's
six brothers and sisters died in infancy)
'After I left the yards everyone thought I had it all cut and dried. I've
never in my life structured any career for myself. Middle class people say
(he put on a mocking whine):  'What shall I do? Shall I go into medicine or
the family business? What about politics?''
Do you feel you didn't make the best of yourself?
'There are people who think that way,' Reid replied cagily. 'I'm well aware
there were expectations of a role that I should have played. And to that
extent I'm sorry if these expectations could not be realised.'
But were they your expectations too?
'Well this is a thing I'm trying to answer - indeed for myself. There was a
genuine factor in there, in that I didn't think in these terms.'
Was it that you found the self-promotion demeaning - that you would have
liked the result but were not prepared to go through the process?
'No, I think that if I went through the process I couldn't be sure that I
would emerge the other end the person I was when I went in. All I'm saying
is that at an important stage in my life I developed a disdain for the
wheeling and dealing of career politicians.'
Perhaps you have a distaste for joining up, I said, for getting in among it.
You prefer to be on the outside of any institution.
'I think there is an element of me which believes that all establishments
eventually become intrinsically reactionary. That does not mean you don't
become involved. I've always worked with people. My compulsion is to
communicate if I see something beautiful.' He mentioned music, and
racehorses. 'I'm not a creative person, I don't think.'
We talked about his notorious defection from the CP. Reid has always said he
would have left earlier if his shipyard fame had not intervened.
'Suddenly I become the best-known communist in Britain. People are joining
the Communist party because of me. Right? What a bloody problem I had] Now
that's the truth.
'I had it made, I could have gone through life dead cosy and been the
darling boy of the left and I'm saying 'This is No True.' I had to pack it
in. People that knew me understood. It was the most painful thing in my life
because there's a bloody ego involved here. I had to stand up and say
publicly: I'm wrong.
'Life's too short to pussyfoot about with the truth. I'm not talking about
wee truths - I'll bloody lie to save any bugger's unnecessary pain. I mean,
I've compromised. I think life is a compromise with death. How can you go
through life without compromising? There's nothing undignified about
compromising as long as you don't abandon your strategic objective.
'But I'm not apologising for my life. Because I've done a lot of good, even
thus far.'
Perhaps Jimmy Reid has found his vocation after all.

FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: A rare Rondine - Richard Fairman enjoys Opera North's
new production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A successful opera company has to keep hitting the top notes if it wants to
stay ahead of its rivals. At its annual press conference Opera North has
announced another imaginative programme for the 1994-5 season while busying
itself this month with the first major British production of Puccini's
neglected operetta, La rondine.
The other mature operas by Puccini are mostly familiar favourites. This is
the one that flew the nest. The original commission for an operetta never
really suited Puccini and it took several changes of plan before he settled
on a light opera, sung all the way through, to a plot so like a cross
between The Merry Widow and La traviata that early audiences must have
expected they could hum the tunes in advance.
Despite the work's initial success Puccini remained unhappy with it and made
a third and final revision unperformed since the war. Opera North -
adventurous as always - decided this was the version to do. In essence, the
change is that the leading lady no longer rejects the man she loves, but
instead is rejected by him. Puccini niftily turns most of the same music to
the opposite purpose; it is the psychological reversal that is significant.
Magda, the swallow of the title, is a courtesan, still young at heart and
attractive. Although she gets to sing the opera's famous number there is
insufficient scope in the role for the character to take flight. Helen Field
gave her a joie de vivre, a winning naturalness, that helped put flesh on
Puccini's bones.
Although Opera North is not flush with Italianate voices, Tito Beltran as
Ruggero, chubby-cheeked, young as a puppy, has a plausible Italian-sounding
tenor in the making. Anna Maria Panzarella and Peter Bronder lack that kind
of vocal ring, but were appealing enough as the secondary couple. Under the
conductor David Lloyd-Jones the opera swept the emotions along. La rondine
may be a second-rate score, but it was put together by a first-rate
craftsman.
A touch of flair in the production tipped the balance: this was a splendid
evening overall. Francesca Zambello has a sure feel for an opera's pacing
and atmosphere. Never mind that Bruno Schwengl's designs ranged from
handsome, gas-lit, black-velvet Second Empire chic in the first act to white
modern cleanliness in the third. Opera North made La rondine work.
Among next season's high points should be new productions of Chabrier's Le
Roi malgre lui, Verdi's Oberto with John Tomlinson and Walton's Troilus and
Cressida, together with Il trovatore and Pelleas et Melisande. The company
will also give the premiere of H. K. Gruber's Gloria von Jaxtberg in a
co-production with the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival and has
announced Alec Roth in a new post as Composer in Association. The momentum
in Leeds shows no sign of slackening.
La rondine in repertory at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, until April 29, then on
tour.

FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: A model of Renaissance perfection - Venice is hosting
a revelatory exhibition which places architecture in the forefront of the
fine arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Architecture has always considered itself first and sovereign of the fine
arts. It is not true, of course: each of the arts, in the hands of a master,
may enjoy its proper claim to the position of first among equals. But in its
proprietorial role, setting the stage by which the other arts may flourish,
architecture has always been a special case. But in times when the greatest
artists of all kinds engage directly in the practice of architecture and
great architects turn to painting and sculpture, such claims become not so
much unassailable as beside the point.
The period of this quite extraordinary exhibition, that begins in the 15th
century with the theories of Alberti and ends with St Peter's rebuilt and
Palladio waiting in the wings, was just such a time. Could more have been
made of the rich seed-bed from which so much of the architectural
inspiration sprang - the intimate architecture of chancel, altar and
reliquary, all the more apposite given the human scale of the models that
are the spectacular focus of the exhibition? And being in Venice, could a
show so full of Rome and Florence have done with rather more of Venice
itself, of Sansovino and Lombardo perhaps, and Carpaccio too? For the few,
albeit well-chosen, paintings shown, both portraits and architectural
fantasies, are important to the general argument. Perhaps. But to carp is
unworthy, for any such deficiency is immediately obviated by a short foray
into the city.
The show itself is the thing, and the scale and physical power of it are set
from the very start. The entrance court is dominated by the huge Sangallo
Model from the Vatican, raised up almost to eye-level to take on, in the
imagination at least, its proper monumental and architectural presence.
What we confront at this scale is not architecture as architecture so much
as architecture as sculpture. For so often the scope of architecture is so
vast as to be beyond natural comprehension. We discover any great building
bit by bit, to be pieced together in the mind. Yet here - from the Sangallo
model and its peer, the great model of Pavia Cathedral, to the working
fragments, the domes, facades and apses - we stand in direct relation to
objects resolved and integral to themselves, sharing the same space we
occupy, tangible and comprehensible. How oddly modern so much of it seems -
Brunelleschi's dome and apses for Florence Cathedral, for example, that hint
at the discrete elements and re-arrangements of a Cragg or Paolozzi.
And there are the drawings, that seem to offer direct and poignant contact
with the hand and mind of the master, as though we were there at his elbow
as the mark was made. Here is a swift, fugitive note of an idea of Bramante
for the plan of the Basilica, just the lightest indication of the mutual
organisation of space and structure and as abstract as a Mondrian. And here
again are Michelangelo's project sketch for the plan of S. Giovanni dei
Fiorentini, like a formalised, exploding flower, and his paper cut-out
templates for cornices and mouldings, convex and concave in easy and
abstracted rhythmical counterpoint. And how we weep for our own age of the
'artist's impression' and design only by benefit of the computer model, when
the architect hardly dares take up the pencil. Meanwhile St Peter's still
stands to reproach them all.

FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Triumph of Architecture Exhibition in Venice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venice has always offered some of the most brilliant architectural
experiences in Europe. This year it is also possible to experience the whole
history of Italian Renaissance architecture in one Venetian palazzo. The
exhibition, organised by Fiat's cultural institute at the Palazzo Grassi, is
a total triumph. No one with any interest in the architectural and cultural
history of Europe can afford to miss it.
The story goes that on a visit with the Pope to see the revelatory
restoration of Michelangelo's frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, Giovanni
Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, asked if the Vatican, 'had any more great
surprises ..' 'Well' came the reply, 'we do have the legendary Renaissance
model of St Peter's - perhaps the greatest architectural model in the world
 -but it is in desperate need of repair and no one ever sees it.'
From this conversation was born the idea of the exhibition. Fiat has brought
together the architectural work of Michelangelo, Raphael, Bramante,
Leonardo, Peruzzi, Sangallo and many other masters.
Antonio da Sangallo produced his final design for the greatest church in
Christendom in the 1530s. It took seven years to build the model, between
1539 and 1546, and the designer tragically died before it was completed.
Sangallo's plan for St Peter's was a major adaptation of Bramante's design,
but it was never executed and the model we see was succeeded by
Michelangelo's dynamic plan. For 450 years Sangallo's St Peter's was stored
in the Vatican and inevitably became the victim of slow decay.
Today, the restored model - four and a half metres high - stands at the
heart of the exhibition at the Palazzo Grassi. It is possible to walk under
its dome and see the detail and finishes of the interior. Because it stands
in the great central court of the palazzo it is also possible to have a
bird's eye view from above.
Once you have had the extraordinary experience of walking through the model,
you are confronted by the second wonder of the show; Michelangelo's sublime
model of his dome for St. Peter's. This is brilliantly shown suspended above
the main staircase. It would not be fair to say that the contrast makes
Sangallo's work look unsettled but the serenity of Michelangelo's design
explains why his scheme for the basilica was preferred.
The sub-title of the exhibition is 'the representation of architecture' and
it is a challenging theme for an exhibition that has to be both scholarly
and accessible. Architectural exhibitions are notoriously difficult to stage
but I have no doubt that this is the best one I have ever seen. I recall the
brilliant Palladio exhibition, that also depended for its success upon
architectural models, at the Royal Academy. But no one has ever before put
together the whole range of Italian Renaissance models in a way that makes
them moving objects in themselves and telling demonstrations of the progress
of architectural history.
A great deal of the credit for the success of the exhibition belongs to
Mario Bellini who designed it. His task was to tell the story of how
Renaissance architecture developed and how it succeeded in replacing the
Gothic style. There are 31 surviving 15th and 16th century models, each one
providing a high point in the story. They are supported by documents,
drawings, paintings and manuscripts which provide the intellectual
foundations for the buildings.
The setting is one of low light and grey walls, but there are literally
magic moments of high illumination which bring visual drama and excitement
to the complex story. There is a particular moment of clarity when you reach
the 'Ideal City' painting from Urbino which is shown at the end of a sloping
perspective, brilliantly lit in a darkened room. Paintings are used
throughout to show that people and architecture belong together.
Architecture is often used in paintings as a stage setting, framing crucial
political events or scenes of spiritual progress. Stage design and
architecture meet here to create the new world of great Renaissance palaces
or churches. This exhibition utilises the same disciplines of display and
drama to expose the story of Renaissance architectural creativity.
This great exhibition needs to be visited more than once. It brings the
third dimension to life making the buildings of the Renaissance both
comprehensible and amazing in the scale of their achievement. The catalogue
is 700 pages long but do not be daunted - the glory of the architectural
models and the soaring triumph of the great Sangallo basilica will always
remain in your mind.
Renaissance - from Brunelleschi to Michelangelo: the Representation of
Architecture: Palazzo Grassi, Venice, until November 6 (closed for mid-show
conservation July 18-August 18): sponsored by Fiat, with Alitalia.

FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Salzburg tunes in to Abbado - This month sees the
start of the music festival season. Our critics report / This year the
festival emerged with a new identity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK

<TEXT>
Salzburg's Easter Festival is dead. Long live the Salzburg Easter Festival]
Five years after the burial of Herbert von Karajan, its founder, the
festival has finally emerged from mourning with a new identity  - less
personal perhaps, but more modern and more ready to take risks.
This Easter saw several 'firsts'  - the first with Claudio Abbado as
artistic director; the first to be supervised by a foundation working for
the festival's long-term future; the first with a series of inexpensive
contemporary music concerts; and the first to divide its audience, judging
by the storm of boos at the final curtain of Boris Godunov. Karajan must be
turning in his grave.
To reassure the faithful, Karajan's widow Eliette is chairing the festival
foundation, applauding the Mortier revolution at the summer festival and
speaking of the need to avoid a museum culture.
With Abbado at the helm, there is little danger of that. Nevertheless, his
hand is constricted: to settle the bills he depends on 4,000 conservative
subscribers, mostly inherited from the Karajan era. Paying up to Sch13,200
(Pounds 780) each for a block of three symphony concerts and one opera, they
take a week's holiday and make the Easter Festival part of their social
calendar. Mass disaffection would bankrupt the festival.
How, then, does Abbado intend to assert his progressive credentials? What
does he want from Salzburg? It is now virtually the only place where he
conducts opera. After this year's Boris, to be repeated in the summer with
cast changes, there will be a new Elektra in 1995.
Last year's fall-out with Mortier over co-production plans has left the
Easter Festival needing a partner for Elektra, but both sides have
compromised over the following two years. A new Otello in the summer of 1995
will be revived at the 1996 Easter Festival, an unusual case of Abbado
taking over a production premiered by Riccardo Muti. One wonders how Easter
subscribers will enjoy paying higher prices to see a second-hand production,
albeit with Domingo replacing Ben Heppner in the title role. The Easter
Festival is back in the driving seat for the 1997 Wozzeck.
For diehard conservatives, who saw the Easter Festival as a refuge from
Mortier's summer experiments, some of this will be unsettling  - as will
plans to bring the concert repertoire into the 20th century with a programme
devoted to Shostakovich and Lutoslawski next year. This year's chamber music
series at the Mozarteum, Kontrapunkte (Counterpoints), which picked up the
Russian theme of the festival but with a modern slant, was well attended and
enthusiastically received. The big discovery for me was Sofia Gubaydulina's
Trio for harp, double-bass and percussion (1988), in which she explores this
unusual instrumental combination in delicate half-tints, avoiding the
self-conscious sound games of several other works in the series, notably by
Schnittke. Kontrapunkte may be crumbs from the rich man's table, but when
they are as well planned and executed as this (with the Berlin
Philharmonic's chamber ensembles in full array), they merit their place.
This year's main festival programme produced uneven results. Georg Solti and
the Berlin Philharmonic remain a mismatch: the orchestra sounded too plush
for Solti's coiled-up account of Shostakovich's Ninth Symphony, while the
conductor turned the third movement of Tchaikovsky's Sixth into a breathless
Stalinist march, giving the music a driven, demonic quality to the bitter
end. Abbado, whose Pathetique last summer blazed with integrity, was less
successful with the same composer's Fifth Symphony.
Boris, however, has long been one of Abbado's key works. In the hands of the
Berlin Philharmonic, Musorgsky's original music may not sound austere, but
Abbado makes it seethe with dramatic urgency. The stage director, Herbert
Wernicke, used simple ideas writ large to make a bleak statement about the
exercise of power. The back wall was a three-tier portrait gallery of
Russian rulers, from the historical Boris to the present Kremlin incumbent.
The magnificent chorus, 240-strong, began as caged prisoners and ended up a
bestial rabble in the Kromy Forest.
Anatoly Kotcherga was an almost charismatic Boris. Tall and thick-set, he
held the stage well in his tormented monologues, using his powerful lyric
bass and a tearful tremolo to expressive effect. Philip Langridge was the
slick, slippery, subversive Shuisky  - a masterful performance.

FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Boos for Birtwistle - David Murray braves the hecklers
at the revival of 'Gawain' at Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a bracing outburst of boos at the Royal Opera on Thursday, almost
before the revival of Harrison Birtwistle's 1991 Gawain concluded.
During its last dying note, a woman's voice cried 'Shame about the score]'
from a right-hand balcony, and a man in the front mid-stalls stood up to boo
as continuously and vehemently as he could manage, echoed at once by loyal
voices scattered throughout the house. Keen applauders soon redoubled their
efforts, and later - when the composer himself appeared - played their
'standing ovation' trump. (How should a dissenter retort: gesticulate, make
faces, do a tap-dance?)
For a minute or two we could imagine ourselves to be re-living some famously
contentious Diaghilev premiere like Stravinsky's Sacre du printemps. But the
most telling anecdote from Le Sacre's first night is not about old
Saint-Saens flouncing out during the preludial solo for very high bassoon
(asking sarcastically what instrument that was), nor the choreographer
Nijinsky having to shout One] two] three] from the wings because his dancers
could not hear the orchestra through the swelling hubbub.
Rather, it is Carl Van Vechten's report that when some impassioned chap
behind him began to beat upon his head in unison with the music, for some
while neither of them noticed. The Covent Garden protest was different. It
was orchestrated by Frederick Stocken, a defiantly 'traditionalist'
composer, and promulgated in the London Evening Standard (which, ironically,
made Gawain its Opera of the Year). Many people had thus been forewarned,
including everybody at the Royal Opera, and no doubt some were
sympathetically inflamed.
The traditionalist's claim is that Birtwistle is a misguided dead-end
modernist, unpleasing and unrewarding to hear, but irrationally - and
expensively - favoured by the Establishment. The modernism he loathes,
however, is not just postwar music after Boulez and Stockhausen, but
something more widespread and longer-standing; Tippett and even Britten are
among the sinners. Gawain, then, merely lies further beyond the pale.
To sympathetic modernist ears, Birtwistle's opera has actually become more
user-friendly, for it has been judiciously shortened. The long 'Turning of
the seasons' ritual in Act 1 - the purification of Gawain before he goes in
search of the Green Knight - has been trimmed and rewritten, and its
symbolic pageant simplified. It fulfills its dramatic function better and
more economically than before, and it still looks and sounds splendid. A
matching cut in the Act 2, at Gawain's return to King Arthur's court, does
no harm, and helps to bring the opera in at about two-and-a-half hours.
Most of the original performers are back. Again Elgar Howarth makes the
brazen panoply of the music resound and shiver, haunted by shrill, sustained
woodwinds and the twang of the cimbalom. As Gawain and the Green Knight,
Francois Le Roux and John Tomlinson are even more assured than three years
ago, and Marie Angel's Morgan le Fay warbles like an electrical oboe
d'amore. A newcomer is Anne Howells, beautifully in command as the sinister,
seductive Lady de Hautdesert.
The production and the designs (Di Trevis and Alison Chitty) look pristine.
The long, measured stride of Birtwistle's score remains its greatest
strength, evolving in great rolling periods. It is not much like anything
else (except other late Birtwistle, of course), but its gnomic, timeless
character imposes a potent spell; we are drawn in, and held fast.

FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Aldeburgh goes for Baroque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 1970s, any student arriving in Cambridge with a preference for Wagner
or Mahler felt decidedly out of fashion. All the advanced music students
seemed to be involved in researching medieval troubadours or then
little-known composers of the early Baroque.
Meanwhile, not far away in Aldeburgh, Benjamin Britten was giving
performances of Purcell and Bach that set new standards. His recordings of
Bach's Brandenburg Concertos and St. John Passion using chamber-sized
choruses and orchestras divided popular opinion for being light and fast.
The vanguard of early music has advanced rapidly since then, but Britten
would probably be pleased to learn that Aldeburgh is trying not to get left
behind. This Easter saw the first Aldeburgh Early Music Festival. Five days
of events over the holiday weekend were stretched rather thinly over the
whole span of early music as the definition goes these days, ranging from
12th-century pilgrims' songs to Schubert and Mendelssohn.
There have been Easter events at the Maltings for some years but this was
the first time that a specifically themed festival had been mounted. The
programme was a near sell-out and the management will be analysing the
figures to see where the audience has come from and how to capitalise on its
first-time success.
I asked Philip Pickett, Artistic Director of Aldeburgh's first festival,
whether there was a financial advantage in drawing large audiences to
concerts which often involved relatively small numbers of players. He
thought not: 'It can cost as much to hire a period-instrument orchestra as
it does one of the better provincial full-scale symphony orchestras. Some
early music specialists are greedy.'
As no financial safety-net was set aside in case of failure, the programme
was relatively safe, and unlike the June festival, this one does not aim to
occupy the intellectual high ground. What Pickett had devised was a broad
survey of what is going on in early music at the moment. The only
stipulation was that he had to use the Britten-Pears Baroque Orchestra,
formed in 1992 and comprising advanced students from the principal music
colleges, but that will not have been a hardship. The young players gave a
good account of themselves in a pair of Bach Suites and one of the
Brandenburgs under the Dutch conductor Ton Koopman.
Even among well-known groups, there was quite a range of period performance
styles to be observed. Koopman is one of the more flamboyant early music
figures and Trio Sonnerie showed the same kind of energy in their programme
of 17th-century instrumental duets and trios from Venice. Moving forward to
the 19th century, however, Hausmusik gave a pale account of Schubert's
Octet, despite the fact that this group includes some of the same players.
Why was Aldeburgh able to score a success with early music at its first
attempt? First, it must have helped that the Easter period is clear of music
festivals elsewhere. Secondly, the programme was varied and safe. Thirdly, a
decade of promotion by the record companies has made many early music
performers stars in their own right, able to draw enthusiasts to concerts of
music by composers they may not even have heard of.
Sheila Colvin, Aldeburgh's general director, says she is '99.9 per cent
certain' that she will proceed with another early music festival in 1995. If
this success encourages sponsors, she will spend the money on building up
the daytime events. And if the East coast weather plays its usual tricks,
even a hardy Aldeburgh audience would prefer a lecture programme to spending
the day dodging hailstones.

In the eyes of the public, but not academics, the major auction houses have
an outstanding reputation for scholarship. And yet their experts often
wrongly catalogue an item for sale. Often this makes little difference to
the price, but occasionally the percipient dealer can pick up for a hundred
pounds or so an object worth hundreds of thousands, even millions.
The most embarassing examples in recent years have involved Old Master
paintings and Renaissance bronzes, but in a specialist London book auction
last year an attentive browser came across a musical manuscript in a job lot
which looked as if it might be valuable. For a start there were six staves
on the page, which meant that it was English and pre-1720.
The lot cost little, but on May 26 Sotheby's hopes to make at least Pounds
300,000 from what its experts Dr Stephen Roe and Simon Maguire consider to
be the most interesting musical manuscript to have emerged in decades. The
small calf bound volume contains 21 pieces for the harpsichord in the hand
of Purcell, the only autograph keyboard music by the late 17th century
British composer yet known.
Pre-1700 autograph manuscripts are exceptionally rare. No one knows what
music in the hand of Palestrina or Scarlatti or Monteverdi looks like: no
certain examples have emerged. Hence the excitement over the Purcell. The
auction record is for another discovery, nine autograph symphonies by
Mozart, believed lost, which surfaced in 1987 and sold for Pounds 2.6m.
Fortunately for Sotheby's, and the vendor, Purcell, along with Byrd, is the
only British composer sought by the leading collectors. The fact that music
is an international language ensures that there is a global market, and
gives some protection from national recessions. But demand is selective.
Elgar and Vaughan Williams appeal little to the major German and Swiss
collectors, although Britten has some attracion. In the main the most
popular composers command the top prices - Mozart followed by Beethoven
(Pounds 1.1m for a piano sonata). And the major scores attract the keenest
interest: the market really arrived when Stravinsky's Rite of Spring sold
for Pounds 330,000 in 1982, at the height of a recession.
Like Old Masters and Impressionists the great musical scores - the Mozart,
Wagner and Puccini operas; the Beethoven string quartets; the Tchaikovsky
symphonies - are now mainly in museums and secure collections. But some
major works have yet to be pinned down. No one knows where Beethoven's
manuscript for the Hammerklavier sonata is, or whether it still exists.
Wagner's opera Rienzi is believed to have disappeared with Hitler when his
Berlin bunker was destroyed, but might have survived. Puccini's La Rondine
is another work which might leak into the saleroom one day.
The inflation in prices has naturally attracted the forgers and fraudsters.
Some of the most celebreated recent examples, like the apparant emergence of
some unknown Haydn sonatas last year, were just attempts to make
presumptious scholars look foolish. As soon as the actual manuscripts,
rather than photographs, were studied there could be no mistaking the 20th
century paper. But Christie's had to quickly withdraw half a dozen lots from
its recent auction, and there are always attempts to add a forged signature
to a composer's printed score or photograph.
Sotheby's auction is its largest ever in the field, with over 430 lots,
including manuscripts and letters by Haydn, Beethoven, Mahler and Verdi. The
recession has depressed demand, but in the main musical manuscripts have
borne up well.

SHAKESPEARE: A DRAMATIC LIFE by Stanley Wells Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20,
403 pages
THE SHAKESPEARE CONSPIRACY by Graham Philips &amp; Martin Keatman Century Pounds
15.99, 230 pages
Was Shakespeare a government spy? Certainly he seemed to know something
about surveillance on the evidence of Hamlet. The audience is not only shown
two alleged students, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, as Claudius's spies, but
also sees Polonius sending agents to Paris to spy on his son. Graham
Phillips and Martin Keatman in The Shakespeare Conspiracy argue that the
playwright, born on April 23, 430 years ago, was part of an Elizabethan and
Jacobean spy network. They explore the curious double life of William
Shakespeare Esquire of Stratford, land-owner and grain-dealer, and Will
Shakespeare of Blackfriars, the writer.
Their conclusions will raise eminent hackles in places like the Shakespeare
Institute but the whole thing makes an exciting bedtime read, an Elizabethan
gumshoe fantasy, fleshed out with much authentic period detail, which kept
me eagerly turning the pages in spite of the writers' tedious habit of
saying everything twice over. The point of entry into their argument is that
none of Shakespeare's Stratford contemporaries realised that he was a
writer.
To them he was a local business man. A 17th century engraving of the
monument beside the tomb of Shakespeare in Stratford's Holy Trinity Church
shows a mercenary looking gentleman with a sack of grain. There is no quill
pen or writing material visible - as in the monument we know. But there is
the Latin inscription comparing him to Nestor, Socrates and Virgil. Phillips
and Martin have a hard time explaining that away.
More plausibly they argue that by the end of his life Shakespeare was
severely disabled. They believe Shakespeare kept his writing career secret
because it was a cover for his spy work. Marlowe was a spy, so why not
Shakespeare? The trouble is you can argue the toss from the given data that
Shakespeare in his other career was in almost any profession you like, and
get away with it. Surely the only thing that greatly matters now is that he
 -whoever 'he' was - wrote the plays.
We know many facts about the life of Shakespeare but, as Stanley Wells,
director of the Shakespeare Institute at Birmingham University, says in his
new book, 'what we know includes very little of what we should like to
know'. We know nothing of his private life, nor do we know how an obscure
provincial teenager, with a background in the glove and wool business, got
from Statford-upon-Avon to London to become the famous
actor-director-poet-playwright.
Wells is not in the business of speculating. He does not mention AE
Honigmann's view - in Shakespeare: the lost years (Manchester, 1985) - that
the transition was via the Catholic Hoghton family at their stately home in
Lancashire, where one Will Shakeshafte was engaged for a time as a tutor and
player. Wells, a sound, sensitive Shakespeare scholar, co-edited The
Complete Works in 1986 for the Oxford Press. The volume caused a storm in
the Shakespeare teacup by its tinkerings with the texts; for example,
putting back Sir John Oldfield's name - the original of the fat knight - for
that of Sir John Falstaff. This book is likely to prove less controversial
and more rewarding.
Wells begins, asking 'Who is Shakespeare?', with the bare biographical
bones. They are the evidence for Shakespeare's marriage by special licence
at 18, to Anne Hathaway, of nearby Shottery, aged 26. Anne gave birth to a
child, Susanna, after six months of wedlock. Two years later came the birth
of the Shakespeare twins Judith and Hamnet, girl and boy, baptised in 1585.
Hamnet died aged 11 in 1596. Having lost a son called Hamnet, Shakespeare
wrote a play about a man called Hamlet who lost his father.
A section follows on the extent of Shakespeare's reading. Even here we are
not on completely firm ground. It cannot even be proved that Shakespeare
attended Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School. Wells, like most commentators,
assumes he did.
If a Shakespeare library were to be restricted to one essential work of
reference it would have to be Geoffrey Bullough's edition of the Narrative
and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare (1957-75); but that is a hefty,
expensive eight volumes and difficult to acquire (let us hope they may come
up soon on a CD-Rom). Meanwhile Wells provides a useful overview of
Shakespeare's bookish knowledge.
Anyone who buys Stanley Wells' book on the strength of the sub-title, 'A
Dramatic Life', is likely to be disappointed. After a useful survey of the
theatre at this time, all the rest is a critical commentary on the plays and
poems codified by place-names. One typically over-loaded chapter is headed
'Comedies of Verona, Padua, Ephesus, France and Athens'. But it is a
refreshing change from normal scholarly practise to discover Wells citing
individual performances by the RSC and other companies in support of his
perceptions.
Should children be made to read at least one Shakespeare play while they are
at school? From 1992 Shakespeare became a compulsory part of the National
Curriculum but there are some teachers who resist the requirement. The Arts
Advisory Group of the Royal Society of Arts, chaired by Andrew Fairbairn,
set out to investigate the matter. It took a wide variety of schools in
Leicestershire as sample. The results, given in Shakespeare in Schools
Project 1992-94 (RSA Pounds 5.00, 8 John Adam Street, London, WC2N 6EZ), are
encouraging. The report concludes that Shakespeare can be made accessible to
children regardless of their ability and that to study him 'can be an
enriching experience for all pupils aged 5-18 years'. It is good to have
that obvious fact spelt out at last with many appreciative comments from the
children.

THE QUEEN by Kenneth Harris Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 341 pages
Walter Bagehot was a lucky man. When he wrote The English Constitution, in
1867 including the famous section on the monarchy, he could have had no idea
that Queen Victoria would go through a period of intense unpopularity, yet
survive to be mourned as a supreme national symbol in 1901.
Still less could he have known that succeeding kings and queens would take
his words as holy writ. In 1894 the future George V was given a Cambridge
tutor in constitutional history. Bagehot was almost the sole text. The
king-to-be wrote in his notes that kingship in Britain is 'still a great
political force and offers a splendid career to an able monarch'.
George VI was steeped in Bagehot too and so, in those years before close
heirs to the throne went to school, was the present queen. The key passage
is that the sovereign has three rights: the right to be consulted, the right
to encourage and the right to warn. Those rights have remained gospel,
accepted by monarchs and prime ministers alike.
At least until the late 1980s, when family troubles began to beset her,
Queen Elizabeth II was a very lucky woman. She was named Elizabeth not after
Elizabeth I, but after her mother. Probably she would not have become queen
without the abdication of Edward VIII, and she would not have reached the
throne so young without the premature death of her father George VI.
She did so at a time of hope. 'It may well be', prime minister Churchill
said of her Commonwealth coronation tour in 1953, 'that the journey the
Queen is about to take will be no less auspicious and the treasure she
brings back no less bright than when Drake first sailed an English ship
around the world.'
Over 40 years later, at the very least she has stuck to the Bagehot rules
when much around her has changed or collapsed. One of the biggest changes of
all, Kenneth Harris points out, has been in the royal family itself. 'When
she became Queen, there were only her mother, her sister, her husband and
herself. By the mid-80s there were at least 20 royals.' It is the
proliferation of lesser royals, rather than the monarchy as part of the
constitution, that has caused problems.
Harris suggests that his book, simply called The Queen, is not so much a
biography, more a way of life. 'The Queen: her background and times' might
be a more pretentious title, yet it would be more accurate. The book falls
into three unequal parts. The first, best and longest covers her upbringing
and her recent ancestry and family influences. The second is a summary of
what has happened in the last 30 years or so. The third is a fairly anodyne
epilogue of the author's thoughts on the monarchy.
To a retentive memory, there will be little that is new, though even good
memories need to be jogged. I had forgotten, for example, that there is
still an unanswered question about how much the Queen was told of the
preparations for Suez in 1956. She might have been expected to warn against
the operation.
As for judgments, Harris treads successfully what Kenneth Baker once called
'the narrow strip of land that lies between sycophancy and rebellion'. 'So
long as she is there,' he concludes, 'the monarchy seems secure.' Then he
predicates a new lease of life from Prince Charles. That seems to me
dangerous ground. Practically all predictions about the future of the
British monarchy have been wrong and, like Victoria, the present queen may
last a very long time.

FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Package holiday passions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Godber's characters are moving steadily up in the world; so is his
reputation as a playwright. In terms of output he is becoming almost as
prolific as Alan Ayckbourn and other similarities have developed. Godber
commands his home ground at the Hull Truck Theatre much as Ayckbourn
commands the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough. It is a fair bet that a
Godber work in Hull will reach London.
There was a time when the environment of his plays was almost entirely
local. In September in the Rain, 1984, it seemed an adventure for the
characters to move from Yorkshire into Lancashire. Blackpool was the holiday
mecca, and a run-down hotel was where they stayed.
Now they cross to the continent. Passion Killers is the final play in
Godber's trilogy about Britons abroad. On the Piste, which takes place on
the Austrian alps, had a good run in the West End last year. April in Paris,
part of it set where its name suggests, is still running. Passion Killers
takes us to Benidorm or, as one of the characters puts it, the Spanish
Blackpool.
Hull, however, is where the piece begins and ends. Godber's characters now
have candlelight dinners at home. They also have jobs. One women is a
lecturer at Hull University. Of the two men who matter most, one is a
teacher turned journalist, the other is an executive in a bread company.
This is the move into Ayckbourn territory.
Yet Godber is a tenderer writer. Very little of his comedy is black. When
the business executive tells a lie in Benidorm - that he is unmarried -
there is a palpable sense of shock, though it turns out that the woman he is
chasing sees through him because he goes to bed with his socks on.
Tom, the former teacher, receives the most sympathetic treatment I have ever
seen given to a journalist on stage. He describes himself as 'emotionally
pathetic, reasonable, understanding, educated and soft'. When he thinks that
he is falling in love with a girl in Benidorm, he does not pursue her. 'I
wonder if it may be alright if I kissed you,' he says timidly. 'Better not,'
she replies. 'I've never been asked before."
I wondered slightly which paper Tom works for, but this is a remarkable part
beautifully played by Mark Addy. Godber himself was once a teacher; possibly
he believes that such a background must be virtuous, yet the role never
strays into sentimentality.
There are two other men in the cast, more of the football hooligan type.
They wander in and out and remind one of Godber's earlier plays, yet here
again there can be pathos: even the biggest lager louts have feelings.
The wives at home in Hull double with the women on holiday. In Spain they
are more prominent and look like young over-made up girls. In fact they are
31 and 37, having lied about their age to get into the holiday club. This
background of not telling the complete truth is one of the most intriguing
aspects of the play. Some scenes remind you of a modern, down market
Importance of Being Earnest.
Godber directs himself and the refurbished Truck Theatre looks splendid. If
you live remotely nearby this is the place to see his work.

FT  16 APR 94 / Arts: Satirical bark from Bulgakov - Regional Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Paterson as a dog? No, not really. The laconic limner of wry scepticism
or understated intensity is happier once Professor Preobrazhensky's scalpel
has worked its miracle and the stray pooch, human testes and pituitary gland
firmly implanted, is transformed into Poochikov.
Nothing becomes Mr Paterson's portrayal of the titular canine in this
adaptation of Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Heart of a Dog so much as his
leaving of it. As Pooch he wears long-johns, a Mickey Mouse nose and what
appear to be trainers covered by socks for front paws. Doggy
characteristics, even by the standards of clowning, are perfunctory. As the
'complete humanisation' of the professor's experiment he dons white spats, a
shocking pink tie and a filthy suit whose bagginess makes Chaplin's tramp
look like a Saville Row model.
This louche, leering Frankenstein of the early Soviet system uttered his
first satirical bark in 1925, waiting incredibly until glasnost for
publication in Russia itself. The scientific optimism lampooned by the
story, a Panglossian belief that all's for the best in the most materialist
of all worlds, has returned today in a new guise: genetic engineering,
apparently offering the solution to society's problems.
As in a moralistic fairy-tale by E. Nesbit, the magic goes horribly wrong,
the fantastic and grindingly mundane in sometimes hilarious conjunction. No
loveably earthy proletarian innocent - Panza, Papageno, Schweik - Poochikov
is a drunken, thieving lecher who betrays his creator. 'The real horror,' as
the professor realises, 'is that he no longer has a dog's heart but a human
one.' The brave new world that had such people in it also produced J.
Stalin.
Mark Wing-Davey's production at Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum theatre favours
bold physical strokes which tend to bulldoze over the words of Stephen
Mulrine's adaptation. Mulrine's translation of another Russian play also
seen in Edinburgh, Moscow Stations, showed a gift for haunting bittersweet
irony. There are some signs of subtlety here too, as when bureaucracy
inevitably requires documents for the humanised canine, and an identity is
created from scratch. And the newly-disillusioned of the liberated eastern
bloc may smile bitterly at lines like 'Once you've tasted the good life who
needs freedom?'
The production's taste for Expressionist grotesquerie excels with the trio
of apartment-block apparatchiks, all doll make-up and cartoon hairstyles,
and the operation itself, performed to a sound-track from Aida - 'Ritorna
vincitor]' mimes the nurse, proffering a pair of testicles to the doctor.
The differing styles may gel in time. As yet Angus Wright's passionate
naturalism as the professor's disciple stands out, balanced by Caroline
Harker's stylised, wide-eyed nurse. Bill Paterson's creditable Rab C.
Nesbitt impersonation perhaps seeks another context.

THE NEW SPIES: EXPLORING THE FRONTIERS OF ESPIONAGE by James Adams
Hutchinson Pounds 17.99, 352 pages
In Le Carre's The Secret Pilgrim, an ageing George Smiley is quick to
reassure those student spooks who fear they have no future after the
collapse of the Berlin wall: 'With each new alignment, each rediscovery of
old identities and passions, with each erosion of the status quo, the spies
would be working round the clock.'
The New Spies, as identified by Sunday Times journalist James Adams in this
far less brilliantly written piece of non-fiction on the intelligence
community, are a motley collection. They include politically correct CIA
operatives, under orders from Clinton to keep an eye on environmental abuse;
reformed KGB apparatchiks, happy to throw open their files to western
academics; and a new breed of British spies who are making every effort to
convince the public what really decent folk they are.
These spies have one thing in common: an extraordinary capacity to reinvent
themselves when faced with the threat of political extinction. The new war
they are engaged in is not an ideological struggle between communism and
capitalism, but a concerted campaign to convince politicians and the public
that, without our spies, the world would be far more dangerous and
unhealthy.
In surveying the activities of the intelligence agencies in recent years,
Adams casts doubts over the sincerity, not to mention the efficiency, of
spies old and new, while never pushing the extreme case for the prosecution:
that the world would in fact be a much better place without them.
Adams rightly asserts that the image created by the ex-MI5 spycatcher, Peter
Wright, of a bunch of 'buggers and burglars' understates the complexities of
secret services world wide. Crookery and conspiracy form part of espionage,
but they are not the whole story. Too often intelligence failings have been
the result of higher political priorities and in-built systems of government
that ensure that warnings are ignored, and rival agencies spend more time
fighting each other than protecting the national interest.
Bureaucratic inertia and inter-service rivalries between US agencies is
mirrored in Adams' account of British intelligence in Northern Ireland.
Adams notes that the single factor setting Britain apart from international
counter terrorism is not the professionalism of the IRA, but 'the
incompetence of the counter-terrorist forces.'
As for the Russians, they remain duplicitous. The public face of the new
KGB, Yevgeny Primakov, appointed by Yeltsin in October 1991, tells Adams
that the organisation has repudiated the 'old ideological model' and is now
working exclusively 'in defence of the national interest'. In practice, this
has meant the Russians embarking on economic espionage and being
uncooperative with the West in providing information on its biological
warfare stockpile.
Moscow Centre is still influenced by a basic distrust of the US and British
intelligence agencies, both of which have set up an extensive network of
agents and controllers in the former soviet republics.
And yet the new Russia has still left the new spies having to justify their
budgets. The spooks' agenda has expanded to include cooperation against
Islamic fundamentalist terrorists, nuclear proliferation in the third world,
and drugs traffiking.
Meanwhile intelligence agencies have made some attempt to streamline their
organisations and make themselves more accountable. Adams concludes however
that the internal reform of the agencies has been too limited to meet the
challenges of a fast changing world.
His book is a noble attempt to shed light on a difficult subject but not a
definitive history. Although it pulls few punches when it comes to
identifying intelligence blunders, it is inexplicably restrained when
tackling some of the murkier episodes - such as the CIA's involvement in the
BCCI affair, and the British intelligence services' role in Iraqgate.

THE CULTURE OF COLLECTING edited by John Elsner and Roger Cardinal Reaktion
Books Pounds 25, (pb Pounds 10.95), 312 pages
In one of the liveliest essays in this book, John Forrester quotes Freud's
suggestion that an old bachelor collects snuffboxes in order to pursue his
need for a multitude of conquests. Freud saw his own passion for collecting
antiquities as extravagant and reckless - a redeeming trait on which he
could draw when defending himself against charges of 'petit-bourgeois
correctness'.
The editors of The Cultures of Collecting are at pains to emphasise that
they are concerned with an activity more wild and maverick than mere
'orthodox connoisseurship'. Noah, 'the first collector', is invoked as a
figure obsessed with possessing a complete category in each and every of its
variations. In Roger Cardinal's essay, Kurt Schwitters is portrayed as a
collector untrammelled by established boundaries: Cardinal repeatedly notes
the disgusting, filthy and possibly smelly oddments that he assembled for
his collages.
Many of the illustrations support this sense of a disregard of limits.
Anthony Alan Shelton, analysing Renaissance collecting, includes among his
striking visual images an engraving of a museum in Naples, in which shells,
fish and other such exhibits cover the entire ceiling and spare wall-space.
Nicholas Thomas provides an intriguing account of collisions between
raffishness and respectability in late 18th-century perceptions of exotic
objects. The concept of curiosity, so central to the pleasure offered by
such objects, could only with difficulty be rescued from imputations of
sexual licence.
Elsner and Cardinal, however, choose as their introductory essay a
translation of part of Jean Baudrillard's Le Systeme des objets, which
hardly encourages a view of collecting as engagingly flamboyant. Assembling
objects is, Baudrillard argues, a discreet variety of sexual perversion, a
form of fetishism, a retreat from personal relationships.
The main problem with this as a starting-point for further discussion is
that it deprives the impulse to collect of the singularity that interests
the reader in the first place. Like any other human desire, this impulse
turns out to be all too easily and directly linked to sexuality and the fear
of death.
Fortunately, other essays, in examining specific assemblages of objects,
establish such connections in more oblique and beguiling ways, such as Susan
Stewart's exploration of the complex, poignant process through which a late
18th-century American artist used both his paintings and his museum of
natural objects to come to terms with the deaths of four of his infant
children.

JACK'S LIFE; A BIOGRAPHY OF JACK NICHOLSON by Patrick McGilligan Hutchinson
Pounds 18.99, 475 pages
The oddest thing about Jack Nicholson's superstardom is the way it began; or
rather for ten years did not begin. From the late 1950s to the late '60s any
fan of bargain-basement American cinema could have seen this actor in any
number of lead roles. I did myself. But dashed if I or anyone I knew back
then ever picked him out for major stardom.
He was principle juvenile in Corman's The Raven and The Terror (both 1963);
lead cowboy in two back-to-back Monte Hellman Westerns, The Shooting and
Ride In The Whirlwind (1966); prominent biker in Hell's Angels On Wheels
(1967). In every role he was the same, combining the forgettable good looks
of a young Bob Cummings (remember him?) with the acting ability of a plank
of wood.
But when Nicholson played a supporting part in Easy Rider in 1969 - the
twangy, worldweary Southern lawyer - he became an overnight sensation. Up
went the salary; up went the living altitude; and up went the adrenalin of
Hollywood gossip writers, sensing new copy in this fast-living,
slow-talking, high-rolling man from absolutely nowhere.
Patrick McGilligan's entertaining, well-researched book spares little in the
matter of cocaine, womanising and the rest. Much of this, though, is
born-again newspaper stuff, skilfully re-assembled. The real piece de
resistance is the account of Nicholson's childhood and genealogy.
He was brought up by a grandmother masquerading as his mother, even though
his real mother was alive and around. He grew up amid a sea of relatives,
mostly females beginning with 'E'. (Try to keep up with the Ellas, Emmas and
Ethel Mays). And his real father - well, who was his real father? Was it
John J. Nicholson or Eddie King or (shortest odds) Don Furcillo-Rose, who
lived and apparently still lives in New Jersey and has yet to meet his
probable son.
This is all grist to the legend, which as with all stars is more interesting
than the facts. As the great bad boy of modern American cinema, Nicholson
would have to have been born on the wrong side of the sheets. As a late
starter, who needed the right off-kilter role before maturing, he had to
have had all that multiple mothering. And as a chameleon actor capable of
every colour from antic mockery (Batman) to high emotionalism (Five Easy
Pieces, A Few Good Men) to Stanislavskian self-effacement (Ironweed), he had
to have all that warring Irish-American-European ancestry in his genes.
Rich as McGilligan's material is, one has to quibble that a whole,
consistent portrait of its subject never quite appears. There are finally
too many Nicholsons. On one page he is a pleasure-seeker who uses and abuses
women and friends, much as he uses and abuses certain substances. On
another, he is he a control freak and right-wing homophobe. Now he is an
instinctive actor, now a cerebral one; now a miser, now a spendthrift.
Greatest riddle of all: is he a Citizen Kane imprisoned by his own wealth
and fame or a Jolly Jack Star, riotously indifferent to the protocols of
celebrity?
The guessing game keeps us reading, but by final page we are still guessing.
Does it matter? Not much. En route there is plenty to enjoy and to take home
to form your own theories. I loved the account of Nicholson's Z-movie
apprenticeship under the mythic Corman: one of whose cost-saving devices was
to tear apart a script, giving each actor just his own bit. I hung on, as if
to some compulsive soap opera, to the will-they-won't-they-find-happiness
romance of Jack and Anjelica Huston (sometimes ill proof-read as Angelica).
And a collector of filmic tittle-tattle could dine out for life on tales of
the plum roles Nicholson rejected en route to stardom: from Jay Gatsby to
Michael Corleone in The Godfather.
It is only when McGilligan reaches for the final brushstroke or the Big
Statement that the book wobbles. Or when the writer draws himself up for
some clinching epigram on aesthetics. On Nicholson's three admittedly
non-brilliant attempts at directing - Drive He Said, Goin' South, The Two
Jakes - McGilligan says: 'He did not lead a structured life. He could hardly
be expected to make a structured film.'
Ah - really? Dear Vincent Van Gogh (or William Blake or Orson Welles or
Fyodor Dostoevsky), You do not lead a structured life, so you can hardly be
expected . . .

CHILDREN FIRST by Penelope Leach Michael Joseph Pounds 14.99, 302 pages
We have got it all wrong when it comes to our children. We treat them as
hobbies. We refuse to listen to their views. We closet them in faceless
daycare centres while we go out in pursuit of more money. We buy them
Reeboks and Nintendos but will not give them the guidance and stability they
need. We look down on anyone who gives up a job to be a full time parent.
Penelope Leach's portrait of children in western societies makes
uncomfortable reading. This leading childcare expert has decided that
children are an under-privileged minority, and has written a tract to
galvanise governments, schools, parents and adults in general into putting
children first.
Until now Leach's main audience has been the parent. More than three million
own a copy of Baby and Child and know off by heart the importance of demand
feeding, of never letting baby cry and of avoiding conflict with toddlers.
The author now argues that this is not enough. Society is failing our
children.
According to Leach, things start going wrong the minute a child is born. Too
often the baby is not allowed to 'bond' with its mother after birth,
probably will not be breastfed for long, and soon may find itself rudely
shoved into day care. This will be followed by a race for early development,
in which the child is forced through the hoops by ambitious parents who will
not allow them to develop in their own time. They are then disciplined by
adults who mistakenly believe punishment is more effective than example.
When children reach school, they are abandoned to overburdened teachers,
computer games and classroom bullying, with parents playing a negligible
role in turning them into moral social animals.
If this picture is accurate - and Leach asserts rather than proves that it
is - it is clearly something that we should be worried about. Yet her
message is undermined by the humourless tone in which it is delivered.
Children First is going to make some people very cross. Leach never says
mothers should not work, yet the subtext is quite clear: parents should
spend more time with their children. This is a daring thing to say to a
generation of successful working mothers who have fought for the right to a
career.
Yet Leach is not just talking about those women, but about all parents, many
of whom are having a wretched time trying to bring up their families in a
society that gives them maximum responsiblity and minimum assistance.
So what can be done? Leach argues for mass subsidies to end the growing
horror of child poverty. She argues for safeguarding children's rights, for
much longer paid maternity leave, for time off to tend sick children, and
for shorter and more flexible working hours.
She also wants staying at home to be made nicer. Families could live in
communes with relations or friends with children of similar ages. Instead of
commuting, parents could do more work at home, by telecommuting, and groups
of parents doing this together could share the care of the children, and all
local areas would have a child centre.
Most of these ideas are admirable. Yet they are going to cost a great deal
of money. Leach denies these are remedies we cannot afford - she says they
are ones we cannot afford to ignore. She makes some attempt to prove that
money spent on children today is money saved later. But mostly she expects
you to take it on trust. Her liberal neighbours in Hampstead might be
inclined to agree. But would Michael Howard?

MR VERTIGO by Paul Auster Faber Pounds 14.99, 278 pages
At first glance Paul Auster's new novel is a straightforward story of an
orphan boy from the American Mid-West who learns to fly. Yet the fact that
the book is set during the pioneering days of aviation is a sly joke on
Auster's part: his protagonist, Walter Rawley, is no more than a distant
observer of the daring new world of manned flight.
'I was twelve years old the first time I walked on water' is how Walt begins
his first-person narrative, and he goes on to relate his painful initiation
into the strange, logic-defying art of levitation. Plucked from the streets
of St Louis at the age of nine, Walt spends three years on a remote farm in
Kansas undergoing a series of ordeals devised by Master Yehudi, a sinister
Hungarian saved from outright charlatanism by a kindly streak.
Yehudi's harsh methods slowly transform the orphan into Walt the Wonder Boy,
whose aerial stunts draw astonished crowds from coast to coast. Yet Walt's
status remains ambiguous. The extraordinary gifts which Master Yehudi has
developed in him are put to no greater use than the accumulation of money,
and they fade as soon as puberty subjects him to crippling bouts of vertigo.
'You know nothing', Yehudi tells Walt, explaining why he has selected him
from the thousands of hungry kids begging on the streets. 'You know nothing
because you are nothing'. Walt is singled out not for any innate talent but
for its polar opposite, a lightness of character which allows him literally
to rise above his peers.
Walt's story is also that of his century, of turning away from confused
ideals of white America's European roots to an obsession with making money;
having lost his levitational skills, Walt winds up as the proprietor of a
laundromat chain. 'I did what no American had done before me, what no one
has ever since', he boasts, encapsulating the paradoxical spirit of the
1920s: unbounded ambition, foolish pride and child-like innocence.
This is a heavy burden of symbolism for a novel to bear and it is often a
relief to hear Walt's no-nonsense voice expostulating over Yehudi's flights
of fancy. Walt protests: 'I hate to be a party pooper, sir, but this beauty
stuff's a great big ho-hum. I mean, who cares if a place looks crummy or
not? As long as it's got some people in it, it's bound to be interesting.
Subtract the people, and what's left? Emptiness, that's what?'
This little speech points to the novel's most serious flaw. At its heart is
a cold perfection, a sense of deliberate disengagement which holds the
reader at arm's length. Mr Vertigo is a class act, but one whose impact does
not linger once the show is over.

THE MAKING OF VICTORIAN SEXUALITY by Michael Mason OUP Pounds 17.95, 338
pages
If we know one fact about Queen Victoria, it is that she was a prude who was
Not Amused. When the 15-year-old Prince of Wales kissed a girl on holiday,
Victoria was scandalised and the Prime Minister, Gladstone, made a public
statement regretting 'this squalid little debauch'. Around the same time,
the Queen invited the painter John Millais to court; but his wife Effie was
turned back at the gate, ostracised because she had formerly been Mrs
Ruskin. Yet so repressive was Victorian sexual culture that, when Ruskin had
declined to consummate the marriage, Effie had for years understood neither
that anything was wrong nor why she had no children.
Stories like these crystallise our view of a 19th century England fettered
by morality and bigotry. But what was the erotic life of the Victorians
really like? In this bold new book, Michael Mason reinterprets Victorian
sexual culture and unpicks some of its most common stereotypes.
Out for example, goes the myth of the shy courting couple who barely knew
each other: 40 per cent of Victorian brides were pregnant on their wedding
day. Out, too, goes the worn down wife who could not control her fertility -
contraception was widely used from the 1860s. Contrary to popular belief,
frustrated bourgeois husbands did not resort en masse to brothels -
prostitution declined in Victorian England - and table legs were not dressed
in frilly skirts for modesty's sake - that was a modern joke mistakenly
taken up as fact.
Twenty years ago, Michel Foucault pioneered the idea that the 19th and 20th
centuries were far more united in their obsession with sex than divided by
repressive and anti-repressive attitudes to it. This book develops
Foucault's theme. Mason sees the Victorian sexual code as progressive,
socially aware, governed by enlightened self-interest rather than narrow
moralism: in many ways close to our own. A key difference was the 19th
century belief in discipline and unobtrusiveness, values belonging to a
broad culture of social respectability and propriety. A surprising
similarity was a strong emphasis on sensual pleasure.
Explicit talk and bedroom boasts then were bad taste, but a first date was
often intimate.
When Nora Barnacle, at the turn of the century, first walked out with James
Joyce, she marched him to a quiet street, unbuttoned his trousers and
slipped in her hand. Women routinely watched men bathing nude in the sea -
often to be disappointed by 'the action of cold water'. And the Victorian
conviction that women only conceived if they reached orgasm - a view that
'dignifies female erotism' - intimated that wives were having a good time.
Mason fleshes out his arguments with statistics, medical records,
demographic data. Condoms were twice as expensive in relation to the average
wage as today, and were often advertised by direct mail to couples
announcing a birth in the press. Miners were the least likely workers to use
them. Chimney sweeps had the most short lived relations with their
concubines.
This is interesting, but it does not explain why Mrs Ruskin languished as a
virgin and the Prince of Wales got into trouble for a kiss. The serious
weakness of this study is that Mason rarely recounts stories of such human
interest. By ignoring them, he makes a potentially explosive book tepid and
unsatisfying, and misses out on crucial aspects of 19th century culture
which contributed to the making of Victorian sexuality. The result is a
viewpoint so engrossed in academic detail that it loses sight of major
issues.
The omissions are unforgiveable. There is no reference to Victorian England
as a pre-Freudian society which, unlike our own, did not regard sex as the
central human drive. No acknowledgment that the cult of female purity - see
characters such as Little Nell or Millais' 'Cherry Ripe' - tipped easily
into a code of ignorance and repression. No discussion of the effect of
popular restrictive works like Bowdler's expurgated Shakespeare. Not a
glance at the link between sexual restraint and social cohesion in the mind
of a middle-class terrified of godlessness and anarchy.
Anecdotes reveal such complex influences on sexual behaviour better than
theories and statistics. A few of them - Queen Victoria's account of 'being
clasped and held tight in the sacred hours of the night when the world
seemed only to be ourselves', say, to illustrate the happy sex life of a
famous prude - would have enormously enriched Mason's book. Without them, it
barely comes alive. Volume II about the sexual creeds of individuals is
promised, and may redress the balance. Meanwhile, Mason's thorough research
and original arguments are to be welcomed, but the field remains open for a
more comprehensive study of a fascinating subject.

FT  16 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Afrikaner food: will it get your vote? - A
look at how Boers and Malay slaves contributed to the specific character of
South African food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER PARKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the good old bad old days, when the right-wing, extra-right wing and
far-right wing had it all their own way in South Africa, election days were
feast days. On school playing fields and in scout halls across the land,
spick-and-span candidates proffered honesty and koeksisters (a kind of
crisp, plaited doughnut steeped in spiced syrup).
Party-faithful mums beamed family values as they flipped thick, frangrant
pannekoeke (pancakes) over portable burners.
In the run-up to this country's first democratic election on April 27, the
National Party has expanded on the old successful formula. Come hear us
speak, they said to the poverty-stricken newly-enfranchised masses, and
there will be food there.
So the masses came, and indeed there was food. Great pots of steaming putu
(an African staple, stiff maize porridge), vats of sweet tomato-and-onion
sous (relish), thick curls of boerewors (traditional spiced sausage) sending
fragrant smoke abroad as they sizzled over barbecues.
'We say: go to their meetings, eat their food . . . and then vote for us,'
was Nelson Mandela's rejoinder to that particular election ploy.
But perhaps the ANC, and the rest, should not underestimate the seductive
power of Afrikaner food. At its best it can steal your heart: whether it can
also steal your vote remains to be seen.
Like the language itself, traditional Afrikaner food is a composite of many
influences. It owes much to its Dutch ancestry, something to the English
fellow-colonialists, and much to the 1820 French Huguenot settlers.
But South African cuisine gets its specific character from two things: the
hot Great Trek across the vast interior, when the Boers moved inland to get
away from English rule in the Cape, and to the Malay slaves who were brought
to Cape colony 300 years ago.
Dried food - most famously biltong - is one of the successes of the Trek.
Spicier than jerky, biltong is beef or game which has been marinated in
spiced vinegar then studded with roasted coriander seeds and air-dried. It
lasted for months as the ox wagons jolted across the arid plains in search
of the promised land.
Lack of refrigeration was just one problem facing ox-wagon cooks. Lack of
cookers was another. Fresh food had to be cooked in a pot or over coals. The
barbecue - braaivleis in Afrikaans - is probably South Africa's trademark
cuisine.
Sunday afternoons in the suburbs are characterised by gourmands in witty
plastic aprons waving tongs like wands over fires. Purists get pedantic
about the perfect boerewors, or the kind of wood necessary to produce the
perfect coals. No conclusion has been reached on either front.
The other legacy of the great trek - and the fact that 60 per cent of South
African households are still not electrified - is potjiekos literally, pot
food. The settlers were hauled up Africa by oxen, which did double duty by
filling the bellies of those they transported. Veteran trek-oxen are tough
in the extreme: long, slow cooking was the only way to tenderise the meat,
and bredie, or stew, is the result.
Before leaving the Cape, the trekkers had picked up some useful ways with
spices from the Malays, which no doubt helped. The pot in question was then
 -and still is - iron-black, three-legged and round-bellied.
You fill it with whatever you fancy, and when the fire burns low, you heave
it onto the coals and sit back with beer and biltong. Some hours later, all
will be ready. More mythology attaches to potjiekos than almost any other
South African food. There are potjiekos festivals across the land, and
recipes are guarded fanatically.
A bredie does not have to be made in a potjie. Perfectly delicious ones are
dished up in restaurants which have never seen an open fire. The many forms
of bredie are well worth exploring - most piquant is tamatie (tomato)
bredie, most poetic is waterblummetjiebredie, variously translated as
pondweed stew and water lily stew.
Springtime in the Cape is marked by the appearance of sweet-scented white
water lilies. (Aponogeton distachyos). The flowers are picked in the bud
stage and impart a lovely green freshness to the mutton with which the dish
is made. Very little else is added - a handful of sorrel plucked from where
it grows alongside the lilies (OK, a squeeze of lemon will do), some
seasoning, a grate of nutmeg.
More profound than the Great Trek is the Malay influence on Cape cooking.
The Cape Malays as an ethnic group are somewhat misnamed: the slaves spoke
Malay, but came from Java. Cape Malay cuisine is thus predominantly
Indonesian in origin, although heavily influenced by Indian cooking. Since
Malay cooks were much sought after in the kitchens of the Dutch settlers,
traditional Dutch dishes soon acquired a sprinkling of nutmeg here, a puff
of cinnamon there. The harvest of the seas was scented with golden turmeric,
cumin and jeera made their way into meat marinades.
The lack of wine and brandy - both of which South Africa has produced in
quantity since the early days - can probably be attributed to the Moslem
Malay influence. But South Africa was not built on meat alone. Indigenous
vegetables include sweet potatoes, butternut, gem squash and the like.
Butternut is held to be as close to heaven as a gourd can be. Simply roasted
whole, its dense orange, sweet, smooth flesh is the perfect accompaniment to
just about anything. It is combined with carrots or apricots to make
delcious soups; steamed or boiled with cinnamon and mashed, it can melt the
most recalcitrant meat-eater.
With some exceptions, like the ubiquitous melktert - a kind of custard pie
dusted with cinnamon - and koeksisters, traditional deserts rely on the
abundance of local fruits.
Extremely popular is a date tart rather like pecan nut pie in appearance,
over which ladles of brandy syrup are poured while the tart is hot, and
which is served with thick cream.
Fruit fritters and salads are common, and stewed guavas served with custard
are what roly-poly is to boarding-school dinners in England.
The bad news for visitors to South Africa is that restaurants specialising
in local cuisine are much less in evidence than Italian or American-style
restaurants. The country's top restaurants all specialise in French fare. So
getting a South African meal in South Africa is rather like . . . well,
finding traditional British cooking in Britain.

It augured well. Opposite me on the London Underground were three young
South Africans. The men were speaking Afrikaans, but clearly the woman was
less happy in this language: 'Where do we get off?' she asked in English.
'Shepherd's Bush', said one of the men. Perhaps they too were dining at The
Rotisserie, London's South African restaurant. Like the duc des Esseintes in
Joris Karl Huysman's A Rebours (Against Nature), who learned all he wanted
to know about Britain from visiting an English tavern in Paris, I aimed to
glean the maximum amount about South African food from a restaurant in
London.
The Rotisserie did not give an overwhelmingly South African impression. I
asked the patient and good-natured manager what I should eat.
'Have the tiger prawns and the peri-peri (chilli sauce)'. He said. 'Do I get
Mrs Ball's chutney with that?' 'No, you eat that with your steak'. Steak, he
said, was a typical South African dish, which did not make South Africa
sound very different to the US, Australia or Ireland.
'You have great meat here', he said, 'but you don't know how to cook it. In
South Africa we know how to treat good meat.' The meat arrived. It had
indeed been treated; bathed in a sweet marinade which not everyone at my
table liked. Mrs Ball's chutney was also rather sweet.
The atmosphere was young and fun. There were South African wines and good,
juicy steaks; but I was going to have to look elsewhere if I was to discover
real South African food. One excellent tip I received was to call Emory St
Marcus, owner of St Marcus Fine Foods, in Putney, south London. St Marcus is
the man who supplies homesick South Africans with their needs, from biltong
to chocolate bars.
Biltong is dried meat in the manner of viande des grisons bresaola or
Bundnerfleisch. The meat is salted, marinated and dried. The word derives
from 'buttock-tongue' because it was cut from the buttock, and looked like a
tongue.
Biltong can be made from any animal. There is currently some speculation as
to whether we will see ostrich biltong in the UK once the new British
ostrich farm is up and running. Game of all sorts is used and both St
Marcus, and Susman's Best Beef Biltong in Sussex makes a venison version.
The difference between biltong and the Swiss and Italian versions seems to
lie in the marinades. Basic St Marcus biltong has a lot of coriander in the
marinade. Pre-cut, it tends to dry out. I much enjoyed the Susman 'wild
venison' - gaminess seems to add a dimension to biltong.
Also on the dry side is Droewors, which St Marcus compares to the German
Landjager.
Sosaties are South African kebabs. St Marcus makes versions from beef, lamb
and pork. The highly-spiced meat is alternated with pieces of fruit:
apricots and pineapple. More to my taste was boerewors, the finely-minced
beef sausage which comes in a coil like a Cumberland sausage. The basic
mixture of 87 per cent beef and rusk is marinated in vinegar before being
filled into runners.
Susman's supplies a good many of the top shops in London. St Marcus offers
anything from South African fruit juices and wines to some of the more
important staples of the Capetown table such as monkey gland sauce and

FT  16 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Serious socialising - Giles Kime, at the
Nederburg wine auction, on the industry's future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES KIME
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For 20 years the Nederburg wine auction has been the highpoint of the South
African social calendar. What with the marquees, hats and the cut-glass
tones of former Sotheby's auctioneer Patrick Grubb you could be forgiven for
thinking that you were at Ascot or Henley rather than Paarl Valley. This
year rain added to the illusion.
But there is also a serious intent behind the socialising. Wines auctioned
at Nederburg include some of South Africa's finest, many made especially to
be sold at the event. They are a mixture of old and recent vintages. This
year the highest price was paid for a bottle of 1962 Nederburg Cabernet
which fetched R1,100 (around Pounds 210). If anything is proof that South
Africa can produce world class wine to rival Europe, California and
Australia, then these wines are it.
This year, of the 1,400 people who attended, there were more buyers from
overseas than over before, from the UK, Scandinavia, the Far East, the US
and Canada. The overseas attendance figures reflect South Africa's new
export market which is little more than three years old, born soon after
President de Klerk's landmark speech in February 1991 that promised
political reform.
Exports to the UK alone looked set to reached 1m cases last year, compared
with 190,000 in 1990.
Nevertheless the atmosphere at Nederburg this year was of confidence tinged
with uncertainty. Like any other industry in South Africa, there is a huge
question mark hanging over next year's financial projections.
The face of South African wine has changed beyond recognition since Grubb
first picked up his gavel in 1973. In those days it comprised little more
than a mixed bag of wines of varying degrees of sweetness, sherry, some
Chenin Blanc and a bit of Pinotage. Most of what was on British wine
merchants' shelves during the dark days of sanctions was produced by the
KWV, the competent but huge co-operative.
Gradually, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the classic 'noble' varieties
began to appear. (Amazingly Sydney Back, of Paarl's Backsberg Estate,
planted the first Chardonnay as recently as 10 years ago.) The learning
curve has been vertical and some producers now make Chardonnay and Pinot
Noir that stand up well to those from Burgundy.
But it is facile to see this as being related simply to political changes.
Wines do not improve overnight because they are made in a politically
correct country.
Change was afoot when the idea of 'one man one vote' still seemed like pie
in the sky. Improvements have been helped by the end of restrictive
regulations imposed by the then powerful KWV, largely thanks to the
campaigning of advertising tycoon turned wine producer, Tim-Hamilton
Russell. It was evident to this wily newcomer to the industry that South
Africa would never fulfil its potential under anachronistic legislation and
quota systems and he worked to change this.
But at all levels of the industry, the bid to make up for time lost by
economic isolation has been speedy - from excellent high volume co-ops, such
as Vredendal and Swartland, to large, premium producers like Nederburg and
Bergkelder. They have been aided not only by expanding export markets but
also by greater contact with the outside world.
Young winemakers now travel widely, not only to the classic European regions
of Burgundy, Bordeaux and Champagne, but to California, Australia and New
Zealand. Prominent figures from the world of wine now visit South Africa
regularly, among them Paul Pontallier, director of Bordeaux first-growth
Chateaux Margaux, Robert Mondavi from California and Paul Bouchard from
Burgundy. The South African wine industry is now firmly on the world wine
map and this will be reflected in the increased quality of its wines.
But, like any other industry in South Africa, the question is not only the
problem of political instability but also whether higher taxation and wage
rises will be on the new government's agenda. As a wine-producing region,
South Africa along with Chile, Eastern Europe and Australia, shares
low-production costs relative to most others. If they increase,
competitiveness on the world market will be jeopardised.
What the industry has in its favour is the big value of its growing export
markets and the livelihoods of almost 100,000 people who rely on it.

FT  16 APR 94 / How to Spend it: An Auction house might just surprise / An
exciting exhibition and sale by young artists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those who think of auction rooms as the repositories of the dusty, the
musty or the exorbitantly expensive, the selling exhibition coming up at
Bonhams, in West London, early next month will come as a surprise. There,
lurking where normally Jacobean coffers, walnut bureaux and French fauteuils
are to be found, are the freshest, brightest and most contemporary of
objects.
There is the chance to see the work of some 130 different leading British
designers and artists. How an auction house, normally associated with things
old and secondhand, has come to be associated with one of the most lively
selling exhibitions of interesting modern artefacts, is quite a story.
It began when Bonhams realised that supplies of good quality antiques at
reasonable prices were running low and that there was a wealth of talented
designers producing imaginative new pieces but who lacked an outlet for
their wares.
Bonhams started with the auction formula - having a pre-sale view and then
selling by bids - but found that it was not the best way to sell daring
modern pieces. Many viewers were excited and interested but a little
nervous. They needed more time to browse and contemplate and so they hit
upon the idea of a selling exhibition.
Peta Levi, an ardent supporter of our best young designers - she helped
establish an exhibition at the Business Centre in Islington, north London -
was asked to be curator and it was immediately a huge success.
Levi is still collecting work together, sifting out designers, initiating
new projects for them. This year the selection seems as rich, as diverse, as
tempting as ever.
Many of the big names in modern design will have pieces there - people such
as John Makepeace, Fred Baier, Ron Arad, Richard la Trobe Bateman, Mark
Brazier-Jones, Pat Booth - and all have been asked to submit at least one
piece that costs under Pounds 500. This means that you could have an
adjustable dressing mirror from John Makepeace for Pounds 425, a wooden jug
by Fred Baier for Pounds 500, a beautifully streamlined bedside table in
maple by Lime Design for Pounds 180, a tea service by Jessica Ball for
Pounds 220.
Pieces have been chosen not only for their diversity and liveliness but also
for their quality. Everything on show dates from the 1990s and you could buy
something as small as a papier mache bowl (by Hazel Dolby, Pounds 200) or as
large as a solid English elm dining table (by Richard La Trobe Bateman,
Pounds 5,000).
If you are looking for furniture this is a chance to see some of our very
best modern makers - I particularly recommend the work of Lime Design (its
work is imbued with a calm, almost Zen-like air), Glenn Hinton (his Eye
chair in scorched carved oak, patinated copper and hide seat is remarkable)
Philip Hearsey (a marvellous organic-looking table made from forged steel
and green tinted glass) and Pat Booth (a calm and tranquil designer who uses
wood and steel with great style and simplicity).
But if you are not in the market for something as large as a piece of
furniture there are colourful jugs by Marianne H Buus and even more
colourful glass and decorative mirrors by Jennie Burns. There is jewellery
by Susan Cross, Tom McEwan, Sophe Harley, Tina Engells and Mark Woods.
If you are looking for a chandelier you are spoiled for choice - there is a
wonderful glass and copper one by Eryka Isaak (Pounds 900), a polished steel
and blue glass eight-arm chandelier by Caroline Rebecca Vivian-Metalhouse
(Pounds 1,350) and one made from clear and colour glass beads, brass and
steel by Clare Thatcher (Pounds 1,950).
It is a perfect chance to find something with character, personality or
charm for the house - the lively mirror, console table, vase, chandelier or
rug will do for it what the right scarf, shoes or hat does for a woman.
'Decorative Arts Today' will run from Wednesday May 4 to Wednesday May 11 at
Bonhams, Montpelier Street, Knightsbridge, London SW7 1HH, from 11 am to 6
pm weekdays and 11 am to 4 pm on the weekend. There is a fine illustrated
catalogue which costs Pounds 5 and allows you free entrance. Otherwise there
is an admission charge of Pounds 3.

FT  16 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Treading a tricky tightrope / Admiration of
a new clothing range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regular readers of How to Spend It will already know that I am a fan of John
Smedley knitwear. So, it has to be said, are lots of other people - from Sir
Terence Conran 'for me John Smedley represents everything I believe in', to
Vivienne Westwood 'it's the best knitwear in the world, nothing else will
do', and Paul Smith who likes 'its simplicity and quality'.
The John Smedley range has made that big step from being simply articles of
clothing - albeit extremely fine ones - to cult products. Along with Bass
Weejun loafers, Sebago docksiders, Levi's 501s, Lewis leathers and Barbours
John Smedley knitwear has become an icon of our times. Those who wear the
clothes need no logos - a fan can spot a Smedley piece at 50 yards.
Nothing becomes an icon without good cause - and the good cause in Smedley's
case is the simplicity of the styling coupled with the high quality of the
fine-gauge knitwear (Sea Island cotton in summer, botany and merino
lambswool in winter).
For years the company simply did underwear - archetypal shapes in the finest
Sea Island cotton. As underwear increasingly became outerwear, so it became
more and more visible and more kudos began to attach to the name.
As there is a limit to the number of simple vests, knickers and boxer shorts
that even the most lavish wardrobe requires, it seemed only sensible for
John Smedley to provide its fans with a wider range.
From simple underwear it expanded into what it calls the Second Skin
collection - a cunning mixture of underwear shapes, slightly updated so that
they fit more naturally into fashionable outerwear wardrobes, these offer
bra tops (which double as bra and a decent top), cropped T-shirts that skim
the top of the shoulders, shorties, ribbed vests and some sweetly
old-fashioned vests (to be worn, of course, as tops) with insets of lace
panels.
There are also grandad shirts and fine leggings that can be worn as
nightwear or underwear. Second Skin comes only in black or white and all are
only in Sea Island cotton.
Newest of all is an even more overtly outerwear range for the coming summer.
Homing in on plenty of navy and cream, with soft nautical stripes, there are
short-sleeved shirts with collars (such as the one photographed here),
flared skirts, cropped tops and waistcoats. For men there are button-through
oversized shirts, high V-neck cardigans and boxy waistcoats.
The classic polo shirt, the one that Arena magazine described as being a
vital ingredient in the 'tieless in Soho' look, has been updated with a
button and loop fastening and the roll-neck has been modernised with a zip.
So there you have it - John Smedley is treading that tricky tightrope of
trying to be timeless and classic as well as up-to-the-minute. So far it is
doing pretty well.
The best places to see a good selection of John Smedley clothing are:
Fenwick of New Bond Street, London W1, which has a splendid department given
over entirely to John Smedley wear; Selfridges of Oxford Street, London W1;
Harrods of Knightsbridge, London W1; Harvey Nichols of London W1 and good
stores around the UK.

FT  16 APR 94 / How To Spend It: Art for the sake of your living room /
Dallying with Dali
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Salvador Dali, probably the world's best-known Surrealist artist, has always
been a controversial figure but on one thing everyone seems agreed - that he
was an extraordinarily creative and original spirit.
Although he started his career as a painter after he was expelled from the
Surrealist group, for turning to a more academic style of painting, he began
to use his rich imagination on theatrical sets, shop interiors, wildly
kitsch jewellery and some voluptuously curved furniture.
His richest period for creating objects was in the 1930s, when he found
himself in Paris, surrounded by friends involved in exploring ways of
applying their artistic imaginations to works other than paintings. He began
to work with Schiaparelli and Chanel and with Jean-Michel Frank, a furniture
maker and decorator of great standing in Paris at the time. The Bracelli
Lamp, which David Gill will be showing and selling, came out of his
association with Jean-Michel Frank and was adopted by Dali for his house at
Port Lligat.
Although most of these pieces were designed in the 1930s they never went
into proper production. David Gill, whose shop-cum-gallery in Fulham Road,
south west London, is always an enterprising source of decorative and fine
arts, has brought seven pieces to this country for the first time. They are
all now in current production, each being carefully made, d'apres dessin,
with the co-operation of the Dali foundation in Spain.
They are obviously of practical use, but it is probably unwise to treat them
in the way one normally does furniture or household artefacts - they are
really Dali objects and the prices reflect that. Lamps start at Pounds 600
but the more exotic pieces, such as the three-legged Leda chair, are in the
thousands.
The Dali exhibition is small, just seven pieces of furniture, and is on at
David Gill Decorative Fine Arts, 60 Fulham Road, London SW3 6HH, until May
14. Pieces from the range can be ordered at any time.

FT  16 APR 94 / Fashion: Big men mean big business - Large-as-life suit
seekers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD RAWLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big men have enormous trouble buying off-the-peg clothes. And if they are
both heavily-built and tall they may as well forget high street menswear
stores and book a fitting at a tailor. That, at any rate, is the consensus
among men who have endured the humiliating experience of shopping for big
sizes only to come away empty-handed and feeling like circus freaks.
Philip de Pass, a sugar broker at E D &amp; F Man, the UK sugar trading company,
is 6ft 6in tall with a 38in waist and wears size 12 shoes. 'I have great
difficulty buying clothes,' he says. 'My arms and legs are too long and
almost all my suits and shirts have to be made-to-measure. Fashion and my
shape do not go hand in hand. In shops, it is a case of buying almost
anything that happens to fit.'
Tall Lazards merchant banker Simon Pryce adds: 'The only retailer that
specialises in extra long clothes is the High &amp; Mighty chain which I find
too down market. All my suits have to be made-to-measure.'
Some retailers and manufacturers are waking up to the fact that big men
could mean big business. As healthy diet and regular exercise become more
commonplace, people generally are growing taller and broader.
A report last year by health secretary Virginia Bottomley shows that obesity
is also increasing. It has risen among men from 7 per cent in 1986 to 13 per
cent today.
Historically, retailers' reluctance to cater for large men has been because
suits sized at more than a 42in chest measurement often end up in the sales.
Harrods, of Knightsbridge, had planned to open an area dedicated to big men
but came to the conclusion there was too little demand.
Its menswear buyer, Bill Christie, says: 'We stock from 36in short to 46in
long but our best seller is a 40in regular.' He finds that German,
Scandinavian and US brands are better for generously-proportioned figures.
'We sell Germany's Hugo Boss in a 46in long,' says Christie. 'The Swedish
company Eton makes shirts with very long sleeves and the US's Calvin Klein
makes jeans and underpants with a 40in waist. But if a big man wants a
Giorgio Armani he has a problem'.
Jeremy Hackett, managing director of men's outfitter Hackett, says: 'We make
suits with a 46in chest and 40in waist but they are not commercial. The
problem with large suits is maintaining the right proportions. However, our
trousers are unfinished with 37in inside legs, allowing for individual
adjustments. We also offer a bespoke service at our Sloane Street (central
London) shop.'
Rowland Gee, managing director of Moss Bros, which includes the Moss Bros,
Savoy Taylors Guild, Cecil Gee and Suit Co chains, confirms that British men
are getting bigger and he also observes geographical and socio-economic
differences in sizes. 'In the early 1980s, we sold more 38in regular jackets
than any other, but today 42in regular is the most common size,' he says.
'More men seem to be building up their torsos in the gym.'
He adds that more expensive suits sell in larger sizes than cheap suits,
attributing this to the affluent businessman's penchant for expense account
luncheons. Gee also notes that men in the north of England tend to be bigger
than men in the south and in Scotland.
The Moss Bros group shops stock ranges from 36in short to 50in regular, with
the Moss Bros hire department offering jackets to cater for a generous 60in.
Gee's experience, like that of Bill Christie, of Harrods, is that German
brands Hugo Boss and Odermark are ideal for large men, while the triangular
cut of an Armani suit is less accommodating.
'German companies analyse big men,' he says. 'They make trousers with a
higher rise to get over the belly. They anticipate that a man who buys a
44in long jacket is likely to be athletic and therefore provide trousers
with a slim waist.' High &amp; Mighty, has introduced an increasing amount of
fashionable, quality ranges in recent years. As a specialist in large-sized
men's clothes, it has a thorough understanding of its customers' needs.
Alongside its lower-priced own-label merchandise, it stocks Louis Feraud and
Odermark suits, Eton and Stephen Brothers shirts, Easy Jeans and shoes by US
company Rockport. Chest and waist sizes go up to 60in and footwear up to
size 16. Traditionally known as a store for portly men, High &amp; Mighty is
aiming to attract more tall men. It has signed up long-legged athlete
Linford Christie to project this message in its promotion campaigns.
Judith Levy, retail director, says: 'High &amp; Mighty designs clothes to
flatter big and tall men and our sales staff are trained to put customers at
their ease. A lot of big men have a poor self-image and do not like to look
at themselves in the mirror.
'Some of our customers have to keep three separate wardrobes as their weight
fluctuates. They may lose a few stone at a health farm and then six weeks
later they are big again.'
Whatever one's shape, off-the-peg clothes rarely compare with bespoke
clothes. As a 6in 4in tailor, Ozwald Boateng attracts a lot of equally tall
men to his office in Notting Hill, London.
'Everyone's shape is unique,' he says. 'It is difficult to find a suit that
fits the chest and waist without having it made. I have a small waist but a
long outside leg. If customers do not have an athletic physique, a bespoke
suit can be cut to create the illusion of shapelessness.'
Georgiana Grimston, who runs a bespoke business in Fulham, south west
London, says that, while her suits flatter their wearer, she is brutally
honest with customers during fitting sessions.
'Some men have the same chest measurement as their waist size,' she says,
'so we have to cut the cloth carefully to give a waist. Sometimes, we need
to explain that stripes elongate a tall man and large checks fatten a big
man. Their best bet is plain or herringbone cloth.'
For large men who enjoy stylish clothes, but who would not feel comfortable
squeezing into a pair of Versace jeans or a figure-hugging suit, there is
solace from the men's catwalk shows this spring and summer. The designers
message is that loose-fitting, oversized and unstructured clothes are de
rigueur this season.
Inno Aguib, menswear buyer at Browns, the designer store on London's South
Molton Street, recommends large men look at Dolce e Gabbana's over-sized
coat/jacket, which comes in beige and sand-creased linen, and Dries van
Noten's baggy pyjama-style trousers in beige linen. But remember, light
colours, like checks and television appearances, make people look bigger.

FT  16 APR 94 / Property: Frozen in a time warp - A look at the restoration
of an English mansion / Heritage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After nearly five years of preparation, work begins in earnest this spring
on saving the great half-built Victorian 'timewarp' mansion at Woodchester
Park in Gloucestershire.
However, in spite of the efforts of conservators and craftsmen, the vast
building, buried in woods in a valley near Nailsworth, will never achieve
its intended glory.
For the intention is to preserve the Gothic-revival style mansion as a
unique example of work-in-progress, rather than fulfil the grandiose
architectural ambitions of its builder, merchant William Leigh.
The grade I building is to remain 'frozen' in the state it was when the last
workmen left in 1870, leaving their scaffolding, ladders and some of their
tools behind in the forlorn hope that later generations of the Leigh family
would one day be able to afford to complete the task.
The legend is that, after the builders left, one of the family continued to
live in a completed room, surrounded by packing cases with the names of the
rooms for which the contents were destined.
But it never happened. Over the years the house became home to a colony of
rare Greater Horseshoe bats. These are housed in a section of the building
separated by an iron grill from visitors and fed by the bugs from cattle
dung - a herd is kept specifically for the purpose in the adjoining
parkland.
Formed in 1989, the Woodchester Mansion Trust has succeeded, with help from
the owners, Stroud district council and English Heritage, in carrying out
vital stabilisation and emergency repairs. This month (April 18 for two
weeks) sees the first small section of permanent restoration work.
Six masonry students from the City of Bath College will, under the guidance
of supervisor Gary Newton restore the first of six dormer windows that are
letting in water and badly in need of attention.
'Parts of the building are in remarkable condition considering it has been a
shell with a roof on for the past 124 years,' said stone mason Jamie Vans,
the trust member responsible for training the large number of specialist
craftsmen who will work on the project.
'However the architect, Benjamin Bucknall, a local man, used unlined stone
guttering and in places the rainwater system has failed catastrophically,
resulting in severe damage to whole sections of wall both inside and
outside.'
In other parts of the building the Cotswold stone slate roof has given way.
The chapel, with its soaring lines and graceful stone vaulting, is shored up
by massive timbers and will probably be one of the last sections of the
complex to be restored.
Later this year it is hoped to start work on the grand stair. 'It is a very
complicated and high-quality piece of Victorian stonework and will need
great care in the way it is restored.
The Getty Foundation has already given us Pounds 21,000 towards the work,
provided we can show them we are including training in traditional skills in
the restoration programme we are hopeful it will give us up to another
Pounds 140,000,' Vans said.
The total cost of restoring the mansion to its 1870 state has been estimated
at Pounds 3m and is likely to last well into the next century.
'Now we have our conservation master plan intact we hope to be able to make
real progress,' said Vans. 'But we are in no desperate hurry. It depends on
how fast we can raise money but above all we wish to do justice to an
extraordinary building in a magical site that has been described as one of
the greatest achievements of 19th century domestic English architecture.'

courses, and 1994 tours of the building contact the trust office, 1 The Old
Town Hall, High Street, Stroud, Gloucestershire GL5 1AP. Tel: 0453-750455.

FT  16 APR 94 / Property: Half the price of London and no gazumping, either
 -The joys of home-buying in Scotland's capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To buy a home in Edinburgh, follow the custom in Scotland's capital. Most
people go to 85 George Street in the New Town to search the notices in the
Edinburgh Solicitors' Property Centre (ESPC), preferably after first
visiting one who can 'hold their hands.'
Few use an estate agent, except at the very top of the market. Instead,
solicitors sell properties as well as conveying them, and run the ESPC as
their own co-operative property shop. It is a cheap and efficient service
where it is easy to compare homes on offer in any part of town and in any
price range.
Last year, 13,000 Edinburgh properties costing Pounds 768m passed through
the ESPC. That was 86 per cent of city sales of second-hand homes - the ESPC
also displays new homes as a secondary line - and leaves little for the
estate agents or the word-of-mouth 'invisible' market in which properties
never for sale formally are traded. If you want one of those, ask a
solicitor who offers a finding service, or an agent.
A grand Georgian town house can cost less than half its equivalent in
London. A few may reach Pounds 600,000 but most go for less, around Pounds
450,000 for a whole house in a good street. Some people live in Edinburgh
and commute to London for half the week; it takes less than 4 1/2 hours.
The central city's setting - on slopes either side of Princes Street gardens
 -is superb. The railway runs along the bottom, mostly in a tunnel. Ruling
the middle of the gardens are the classical Royal Scottish Academy and the
National Gallery, now restored to its Victorian glory inside.
On the south slope, the castle side, is the Old Town where tenements were
built 15 storeys high in the 16th century. Opposite is the rational Georgian
calm - and greater hygiene - of the New Town. Its broad, paved streets,
circuses, crescents, squares and sandstone houses with white woodwork and
black railings make this one of the most satisfying cities in Europe.
New Town houses often have flagstone floors in the hall; an oval lantern
over the stair well; and smart apsidal (curve-ended) rooms with doors also
made on the curve. Offices and flats are returning to being whole houses
again, but the big conundrum is what will happen to Charlotte Square, the
traditional birthplace of investment trusts. Two sides of it sit vacant
where the lawyers and fund managers have moved to modern offices.
The best addresses in the New Town are Moray Place, Heriot Row and Ann
Street. Unlike London, there are no big estates. Houses are freehold or, to
be more correct, feudal holdings.
Edinburgh so liked the Georgian style that it survived into the early 20th
century, giving the city a rare visual unity. Its other joys include soft
water from the tap, a small river called the Water of Leith, tartan rugs on
taxi seats, and the country and sea close by.
From the north side, you look south to the castle or north over the Firth of
Forth to the hills of Fife. Murrayfield, the famous rugby ground, is close
to the heart of the city and the old Empire music hall will soon re-open as
the opera house.
To sell through the ESPC, first discuss price, title and arrangements with a
solicitor. (It is not for nothing that Scots used to talk of him as 'my man
of affairs'). He will prepare rather plain particulars (by English
standards) and send a small notice, with photograph, to join the other 4,500
in the ESPC. For Pounds 130, the property will be displayed in the centre
and appear in the weekly list until a sale is agreed.
Buyers go to the ESPC to look at the cards displayed and numbered, like
vacancies in a job centre, and starting with properties below Pounds 30,000.
When you have found something, you take the number to a counter and receive
the particulars. The ESPC can refer you to a solicitor for a free
preliminary consultation (if you do not have one) and has a computerised
matching service to identify what suits your needs.
The solicitor will make the bid for you. In Scotland, this is run together
with exchange of contracts, which is known as conclusion of missives. You do
not make an offer subject to contract and survey, as in England. Instead,
you do the survey - which means you are serious - and then decide what to
bid.
(Here, an architect like Lorn Macneal can help. Expert in restoring New Town
houses, he can assess the property - for just Pounds 75 plus VAT - and
produce a preliminary schedule of works, with their likely costs and
possible sources of grants. These include the district council and the
Edinburgh New Town Conservation Committee, which also has a list of good
craftsmen).
The solicitor then sends a missive, mentioning a price and various legal
matters, and the vendor's solicitor replies. Once there is a written
acceptance, there is a contract. To accept more from somebody else
(gazumping) is a breach of contract under Scottish law, and the original
buyer can obtain redress. The final stage is settlement (completion in
England).
Conveyancing fees tend to be higher in Scotland than England, where
solicitors compete for business. But the marketing fee will be less -
probably 1 to 1.5 per cent. A solicitors' finding service will cost 1 to 2
per cent.
For those who prefer an agent, Rettie &amp; Co. is a new firm that specialises
in New Town houses. One on offer is 17 Drummond Place, six storeys high and
restored beautifully, for around Pounds 550,000. Prices in the New Town
turned in September, Simon Rettie says, and may now be up to Pounds 50,000
more than then. Meanwhile, a smart, two-bedroom flat at 8 Northumberland
Street in the New Town is on offer from Simpson &amp; Marwick for over Pounds
97,000.
Apart from the New Town, there are good flats for the young in such areas as
Marchmont, Comely Bank and Bruntsfield. 'Parents would feel relaxed if their
children were there,' says Richard Loudon, of Simpson &amp; Marwick. And good
parts of town for the family are Murrayfield, Newington, Grange and Trinity.
A 1900 terrace house in Murrayfield costs around Pounds 250,000 and a semi
Pounds 300,000. Good value in a glorious city.

FT  16 APR 94 / As They Say in Europe: Hair today but tedium tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a lucky country that has dull newspapers. Russia (more of this later)
is profoundly unlucky but Germany could be returning to normal. This thought
was inspired partly by the unremitting tedium of German news stories, until
the Schneider company collapse came along, and editorial comment. For four
years from November 1989, Germany seemed in danger of becoming quite
exciting. But things are changing.
Recent developments have been dominated by the burden of the past, as usual,
and by the catatonic round of elections. So far, it is one down and about 18
to go. The key question at the moment centres on Rudolf Scharping's beard;
there has been much debate as to whether the leader of the opposition Social
Democrats would become more popular if he shaved it off.
The world should know the difficulty one faces when seeking quotable
opinions from the German media. Last week, before events in Bosnia came to
my rescue, I was contemplating a comparative study on attitudes towards
unemployment. Commenting on the fall in the numbers out of work last month,
the Suddeutsche Zeitung told readers: 'It is largely attributable to
seasonal factors. Even before the end of the year, in the high point of the
recession, there were in west Germany 64,000 more registered unemployed than
in the previous month. Then it was 102,000.
'More impressive than monthly comparisons are yearly data. They, however,
show, as against March 1993, for the old federal territories, almost 420,000
more out of work, and for the new territories 120,000. So it is that the
present noticeable business recovery, which shows slight increases in
production, orders and capacity utilisation, still passes the labour market
by.' A veil shall be drawn over the rest of this complex argument. It is,
therefore, time to turn to the topic of the week and the thoughts of the
Thuringer Allgemeine on the Nato bombing of Serb troops outside the besieged
Bosnian city of Gorazde. On Monday, it said: 'Whether this will have a rapid
effect on the besieging forces is still an open question. In any case, it is
a further escalation of the war. The enforced peace in Sarajevo earlier this
year, brought about by the threat of attack and linked diplomatic pressure,
appears to have bolstered the arguments of those who want military
intervention.' In other words: we don't know if it will work, but it means a
bit more violence and some people think that might work.
The analysis in, say, a French equivalent of the Thuringer Allgemeine,
reflects similar insights and the same grasp of a complex situation. Yet,
somehow, the piling up of mixed metaphors and random questions makes it
altogether a more exciting read. Thus La Charente Libre: 'The intervention
of Nato planes at Gorazde has the character of a warning shot. But this
warning shot marks a turning point for it represents, for the first time,
the thin end of the wedge of UN military intervention in Bosnia. But will it
dissuade the Serbs from continuing their attacks? That is the question . . .
Will other aerial strikes be necessary?'
As the Bosnian imbroglio developed, one looked again to Germany and that
powerful organ which was so influential in forcing the pace of events in the
former Yugoslavia: the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Its staff have been
locked in debate as to whether the paper should change (nobody has been
known to read it from cover to cover). But it has one man who never will and
remains unique among German commentators: Johann Georg Reissmuller, who made
a vast personal contribution to smashing up the Yugoslav federation.
This week, he described how the confidence of the Serbian leadership had
grown, and concluded: 'So it is now, as the UN and the western powers wake
from their self-hypnosis, that they see that further action is necessary.
But what is there to save now (that) the Serbs in Bosnia, as in Croatia,
have as good as achieved their war aims?' Reissmuller is a rare figure in
the general run of 'on-the-one-hand-on-the-other' German editorialising.
If uneventful countries produce boring editorials, Germany could be about to
recover its role as a mammoth Switzerland. There is no similar fate in
prospect for Russia. On Wednesday, Komsomolskaya Pravda managed a riveting
analysis of the Bosnian bombing. It combined irrelevance and historical
ellipsis in perfect balance: 'Fifty-three years ago today, several hundred
German planes dropped 360 tons of bombs on Belgorod (in Russia). Air strikes
continue today. The Balkans, where the first world war began, are being
bombed. Prominent historians offer fearful but just words: 'The Balkans are
a convenient place for unleashing world wars'.'
More typical comment was to be found in Rabochaya Tribuna: 'As Russia begins
to play an increasingly active diplomatic role in the Balkans, the western
attitude towards the Serbs becomes tougher . . . Some people apparently
don't like it if Russia ceases to be an obedient executor of western
decisions and tries to play solo in the diplomatic orchestra.'
This kind of overt popular nationalism is rare these days. The Germans are
banned from such territory and the French avoid it by couching their
arguments in the form of general principles rather than paranoia.
There is only one other country where leader writers inveigh at enormous
length about not being kicked around by foreigners. But then, for the past
50 years, the British (whose newspapers are very interesting) and the
Russians have shared a unique awareness of the threat posed by foreigners.

FT  16 APR 94 / Travel: Green, clean Goa - India made easy - Confronting
real poverty is often very difficult for Europeans / A way of acclimatising
. . . gently
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By J D F JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The beggar-girl was enchantingly beautiful. She must have been at least six
years old. 'Give me shampoo]' she pleaded, seemingly close to tears. 'Give
me lipstick, give me soaps,' and she tugged again at our camera-straps.
I reflected that the beggars of Madurai had become more sophisticated since
I was last there: the younger generation was targetting the tourists in
four-star-hotel language, perhaps because it had discovered that foreigners
are now implored by everybody - by guidebooks and travel agents and aid
workers - not to listen to the pleas of India's beggar hordes. Give a cheque
to the charities, they all say: that is the most efficient way you can help.
But the beggars are usually not beautiful. There was an old man hobbling
behind the girl who wanted to show me something revolting on the end of the
stump of his arm. He didn't want shampoo; he was determined on rupees. We
struggled on through the crowd and surrendered our shoes to another old man,
this time for safe- keeping while we entered the Hindu temple, and we were
secretly relieved when our guide dispersed the crowd for a few seconds with
a flurry of gestures and curses.
This is one of the phenomena - one of the eternal truths - of India which
alarms the first-time visitor. How will we cope with the poverty? Is it true
that there are babies dying on the pavements? What are we supposed to do
when we are surrounded by a score of frantic, pleading, ragged and horribly
deformed children?
The question - the problem - can present itself at a higher and moral level.
Here am I, spending a (comparative) fortune on my own pleasure, enjoying the
luxury of sophisticated hotels in order to seek out the glories of a supreme
civilisation, while out there on the street - I glimpse them from my
air-conditioned taxi - my fellow-beings are suffering a misery which is
incomprehensible to, let alone endurable by, a European.
It is a topic which invariably comes up in dinner-party talk. There is no
shortage of people, not just those of excessive sensitivity, whose holiday
has been ruined by the sights they have seen on their very first drive from
Bombay airport to the luxuriance of the Taj Hotel.
Because India, of all the countries and cultures and civilisations of this
world, most deserves the effort, I have a suggestion:
Start off in Goa. It is India made easy.
Goa, unlike India proper, is green, well-fed, clean (up to a point),
accessible, Christian, cosmopolitan. It also has an English-speaking,
efficient and fast-expanding tourist industry. It is picturesque, it has
wonderful beaches, a splendid and unoppressive climate, and it is still
pretty cheap. The local cuisine is delicious and distinctive; it even makes
its own wine (yes, well . . .). No wonder it is in the vanguard of the
Indian government's tourist plans.
Goa has not always been a favoured British destination. Because it was
Portuguese from the early 16th century until the peace-loving Nehru sent in
his army in 1961, it did not figure in the favoured itineraries of the Raj,
like Kashmir, the Taj Mahal, Rajasthan and the Elephanta Caves. All that has
changed, and Goa is certain to continue its charter-driven boom of visitors
from Europe, particularly from Britain.
Most of the tourists come for the beaches, which, to repeat, are wonderful
and not spoiled at all by 'hippy colonies' (much exaggerated) or
never-ending offers from the locals of massage or handicrafts or coconuts.
These locals are not touts in the Mediterranean sense, irritating and
intrusive. I have one happy memory of an enormously fat and good-tempered
Australian under the parasol next to mine, being persuaded by a group of
passing youths to pose with them for a photograph because, they told him,
their village would not otherwise believe that anyone of his size could
exist. They then gave him a bunch of flowers.
The sea and the sand and the climate of Goa are of the best. But Goa is
worth journeying above the high-tide mark. The Portuguese colonial presence
produced an attractive local architectural style as well as a Christian
tradition. These come together most dramatically in the semi-deserted town
of Old Goa, inland through the rice paddies from the present capital of
Panaji. It is an essential excursion even for beach fanatics.
Old Goa boasts, under the dedicated though poverty-stricken guardianship of
the Architectural Survey of India, a collection of remarkable episcopal and
civic buildings that dates from the 16th century. In the mid-19th century
the Portuguese rulers retreated from Old Goa's diseases and moved downstream
to Panaji. Today Old Goa's hottest draw is the mummified and 'miraculously
preserved' body of St Francis Xavier, the Jesuit who arrived in 1542, went
on to continue his mission work in China, and asked to be returned in death
to his beloved Goa. He rests there today, his unravaged face visible through
a glass plate in the Basilica Bom Jesus.
By ancient tradition his body is taken into the cathedral on rare occasions
when the devout - Hindus as well as Roman Catholics, pilgrims from around
the world as well as locals - gather in their millions to venerate him. This
exposition is to happen again this year, apparently for the final time
because the corpse, at long last, is shrinking at an embarrassing rate. It
is going to be an enormous affair and, if you are not one of the
above-mentioned devout, you would be well-advised to steer clear.
Do not assume that you find only an untypical Christian culture in this part
of India. Although Portuguese rule obliged the Hindus to build their temples
inland and on a modest scale, you can get a fascinating introduction to that
religion on a scale less overwhelming and intimidating than in the enormous
temple complexes in the south.
This explosion of tourism must be particularly welcome to the Goans - an
outward-looking people who have traditionally emigrated all over the world -
because they have to face up to the decline of their local iron ore exports.
But the boom carries with it all the usual dangers, so well demonstrated
elsewhere in the world's beautiful places - pollution, falling standards,
ribbon development, crime, environmental destruction and so on. The
encouraging news is that Goa seems to be enforcing planning controls more
rigorously than elsewhere in India, with the prime aim of protecting the
beaches.
This has to be noted, as well as applauded, by the tourist. For example,
when leafing through the travel trade's brochures you need to know that for
some years hoteliers have been required to build several hundred metres
behind the sea-line. This splendid rule means that many of Goa's hotels are
set back from, and out of sight of, the ocean, which is not always clear
from the travel agents' purple prose. Watch out for those give-away phrases
like only five minutes' walk from the sand.
My recommendation is that you consider splashing out on one of the older
(and more expensive) hotels which does have a seashore position, while
consoling yourself with the thought that airfares have become ridiculously
cheap.
For instance, any good travel agent or bucket-shop will get you on to a
charter flight direct to Goa, saving the hassle of transitting through
Bombay or Delhi and the subsequent scrimmage on Indian Airlines. You then
throw away any vouchers for a guest-house on a coconut plantation and set
off at once to a room at - say - the Fort Aguada.
I promise that the Fort Aguada Beach Resort, owned by the Taj Group, is very
good indeed, and I judged it by the highest international standards. It
stands above the sea at one end of the wonderful sweep of Calangute Beach.
After it was built, in 1974, it was unfairly described by the distinguished
British architecture critic, J M Richards, as 'a sadly insensitive group of
buildings in Hollywood-Oriental style.' Today the complex has weathered well
and takes an unobtrusive place in dense tropical foliage against the
headland.
Perhaps in response to Richards' abuse, the Taj management has now built,
next door and sharing facilities, a Taj Village in a strictly Goan style of
low-level cottages surrounded by coconut palms.
Thirdly, and thanks to the Indian government's hosting of the Commonwealth
conference in 1983, there is also The Hermitage, an estate of self-contained
luxury villas up on the hill, very much intended for the FT reader who wants
to escape the crowd and can afford to. You need to book in advance for Lady
Thatcher's bedroom. By Indian standards, the Fort Aguada complex is
expensive. But it works, and it may be worth it.
After acclimatising in Goa, the first-time India-hand will be ready to
venture out into the real world. The best course is to take one of the
regular and long-established itineraries on offer. These are: the
Delhi/Agra/Jaipur triangle; the Rajasthan palaces; the north (Nepal, etc,
and, these days, Ladakh); the Hindu south.
The choice will be influenced by season as well as by local political
factors. For example, Kashmir is a no-go area at present; similarly, there
are problems with some of the Himalayan venues, and a specialist travel
agent will have to advise. The climate is an obvious decider: you won't want
to go to Goa, even, between May and September, while the north is less
attractive after, say, October. None of these things is rigid: the monsoon
does not arrive on the dot.
One good possibility, to mention just one example, would be to venture out
from Goa on the sort of south Indian tour which is available from various
companies. (Private travel is probably best attempted by second-timers or
the young).
The frequent starting point is Madras, on the east coast, which leads
inevitably to the major temples at Madurai (where there is a newly-converted
and delightful Raj-style Taj Group hotel on a hill outside that seething
Hindu town). You then set out over the mountains of pepper and coffee and
tea plantations, via the lakeside game reserve of Periyar (where you might
see elephant), to finish up, weary and triumphant after a bone-shattering
drive from coast to coast, at Cochin.
Thereafter it is either back to Goa or Bombay, or down to Sri Lanka for a
few days, where the tourist industry has been hard-hit by troubles in the
north-east. First-timers need to remember:
that Hindu culture is complex and bewildering (the current exhibition at the
British Museum is a helpful introduction);
that distances are very large and the roads bad. You must be prepared to
travel for many hours between one experience and the next;
that the price of abdominal health is eternal vigilance - and no ice - plus
a bit of luck;
that you must apply for your visa in plenty of time;
that you should take malaria pills and have a tetanus jab;
that the Indian hotel and tourist industry (on these main routes) is highly
experienced and that its standards have improved greatly in recent years;
that, love it or hate it, India - as they always and truthfully say - is
unforgettable.
J M Richards wrote one of the best books on Goa. Although dating from 1982,
it has been reprinted in India (Vikar Publishing House) and can be tracked
down with profit.
J D F Jones travelled for a part of his recent trip with Bales Tours (tel:
0306-885991), one of a number of UK travel companies that specialises in the
sub-continent.
Fort Aguada Beach Resort, London tel: 071-828-5909, or through any agency of
the Taj Hotels group. Typical low-season rates from now until June 12 would
be Dollars 70 plus 35 per cent tax per day for a double room; Dollars 60 per
day plus 35 per cent in the Taj Holiday Village; and Dollars 170 per day
plus 35 per cent in an Aguada Hermitage villa.

FT  16 APR 94 / Sport: The softest section hits hard waters - Whitbread
boats expected calm sailing, they got a shock, says Keith Wheatley / Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Punta del Este to Fort Lauderdale is supposed to be the soft section of the
Whitbread race. Sunshine sailing up the coast of Brazil and across the
Caribbean to Florida. Intrum Justitia's skipper Lawrie Smith even called it
the 'girlie leg' in a not-so-subtle attempt to wind up the all-female crew
of Heineken.
What happened was a classic example of sailing's Inverse Weather Law, often
expressed in the phrase: 'It's not usually like that here.'
In the first week at sea a massive storm tore the mast out of race leader
Tokio and sent the youth-crewed Dolphin scurrying for shelter in Rio de
Janeiro with a 1.8m split in the hull.
Even the powerful maxi-ketches, less susceptible to damage than the
pared-down and minimal W60 sloops, found themselves fighting for survival.
New Zealand Endeavour and La Poste have both suffered serious hull
delamination and been forced to slow down.
'The damage is on the waterline about 10m back from the bow,' reported NZE
skipper Grant Dalton. 'The exterior and interior skins are intact but the
inner core has sheared and is flexing alarmingly.
'We cut up floorboards and bent them around the inside of the hull over the
damaged area. Then we cut up bunks and used the piping to brace the
floorboards and stop the movement. The end result is that our navigator and
the cook have lost their bunks and a few floorboards are missing.'
Aboard Heineken the women had to cope with the yacht rock-and-rolling amid
the stench of spilt fuel.
'The bumping from these head seas has been unbelievable, as bad as Cape
Horn. One of the tanks has split and we've got the bilges full of diesel,'
reported skipper Dawn Riley.
Tokio's mishap was heartbreaking for a crew that had built a 13-hour lead
over its rivals and were working on a conservative strategy of guarding that
cushion all the way back to the Southampton finish in early July.
Chis Dickson, the young New Zealand skipper, acknowledged the severity of
the blow when he sent this Inmarsat-fax message to his arch Kiwi rival Ross
Field, skipper of Yamaha: 'To Yamaha from Tokio: All yours boys. It's up to
you to beat the Euros.'
Field took the patriotic injunction to heart. He seized the lead within
hours with some adroit tactical sailing. As the yacht approached the
north-eastern tip of the Brazilian coast it hung out to the east and then
cut in close to the coast.
'At one stage we wanted to be the most easterly boat and then we switched to
be the most westerly. That tactic gave us good wind angles as we came into
the headland and the boys sailed well,' reported Field. 'We managed to sneak
through in daylight and pick up the inshore current.'
Although Yamaha was sailing in only 8m of water at one point, Tokio was
actually alongside in the Brazilian port of Santos, close to Sao Paulo,
trying to tidy up the 11m stump of her mast into a more effective jury-rig.
Unfortunate airline schedules meant that a new mast section would take
another four days to reach Brazil. Dickson decided to spend the time
plugging up the coast and meet the new spar further north.
'We have tidied up the broken rig and now have an improved lash-up able to
carry three times the sail area of the previous jury rig which is still not
much,' said Dickson. 'But the forecast is good and we hope to make between
five and 10 knots to Vitoria.
'The crew were fantastic in Santos and worked for 24-hours without sleep to
get us out of the pits.'
At the same time engineers and boatbuilders flown out from Britain managed
to get Dolphin back to sea
after 18-hours alongside in Rio.
Modern racing yachts, and an increasingly large number of cruising boats,
have hulls built in a 'sandwich' composition. There is an outer skin,
usually only a few millimetres thick, of a hard plastic material, then a
core of foam (sometimes balsa wood) then another thin inner plastic skin.
When bonded together it is immensely strong. When the layers come apart, or
delaminate, the hull begins to flex and can simply fall apart. Almost none
of the Whitbread yachts have escaped this process. Construction
specifications will certainly be revised after the race finishes.
However, as the fleet slowly negotiates the windless Doldrums this weekend,
with Yamaha trying to preserve her 50-mile lead through a meteorological
lottery, stomachs are a bigger issue than hull technology. Because of the
slow progress on leg five, the boats are running short of food.
Aboard Intrum Justitia, Smith anticipates serious hunger. 'We cut down our
food stores on this leg to save weight and because we didn't expect these
conditions,' he said. 'We've catered for only 24 days and it's going to be
very difficult to start rationing our supplies since we are already eating
relatively little.'

FT  16 APR 94 / Sport: Warm hopes for a summer of flair - England have won
at last. Can they build on the triumph, asks Teresa McLean / Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Everyone knows England are easy to beat; ask Australia or Pakistan, visitors
and comfortable victors the last two summers, or the West Indies, hosts and
victors this winter. But at least we English have cheered up a bit. Whether
or not England can now win in Antigua as well as Barbados, there is reason
to return with just a touch of thoughtful confidence.
I find myself thinking how good it would be to have a strong personality
playing for England in his own way - a huge Colin Milburn, a fearless Ian
Botham or an elegant David Gower, untroubled by fitness training or
technique corrections, a character at the crease with enough of his own
initiative to unnerve the opposition. All that is needed to produce such
figures is that good players with strong individual styles be given room.
Perhaps Alec Stewart can serve as an example, after his epic performance in
Barbados. It is easy to see how much better he plays when he is free of
wicket-keeping duties. When he is free to bat in his own belligerent and
unpredictable style, leaving the anchor role to his captain at the other
end.
'He plays the way a West Indian would play . . . very positive,' said Richie
Richardson after the match.
Mike Atherton learnt when he was captain of Cambridge University that it is
a waste of time to try and get a uniform response from the team; all it does
is cramp team resources. Better to let individuals flourish than to try and
tame them.
Ray Illingworth, the new chairman of selectors, sympathises with this view,
believing that: 'There are not enough variations in the game and it is too
stereotyped.'
Illingworth had little in common with Gower when he captained him at
Leicestershire, but he was shrewd enough to help Gower's cricket develop by
letting him play it in his own style. The England squad, with its large
contingent of young players trying to establish themselves, needs to do the
same.
I was interested to hear some Sussex members express dismay last year at the
way they felt young Ian Salisbury's bowling had been damaged by his MCC
training before the 1992-3 tour of India and Sri Lanka. Not just the
technical problems of the artificial 'spinmats' used at Lilleshall, but also
the over-ruling of the advice he had been getting from Sussex's experienced
cricket manager, Norman Gifford.
County policy, locals claimed, had been to help Salisbury perfect his
leg-breaks. MCC coaches, on the other hand, urged Salisbury to get more
variety into his bowling, to unsettle the batsmen with off-breaks and
disguised deliveries as well as leg-breaks. Both aims make sense but both at
once unsettled Salisbury more than anyone else and upset his bowling.
The Sussex view may be no more than resentful county patriotism, but it is
certainly true that after a dismal tour Salisbury started last season in
poor form, troubled by an annoying shoulder injury. Fortunately, he regained
some of his confidence later in the summer and was picked for the West
Indies. It has not been easy for him there, not being able to rely on a
full-time spinner at the other end to turn the ball away from the bat while
he turned it in.
In Sussex, Salisbury lethal when he formed a partnership of assorted spin
with veteran off-spinner Eddie Hemmings. Killer instinct is life-blood to a
spinner and Salisbury's bowling, unlike left-arm Phil Tufnell's cruelly
flighted bowling, looks a bit polite when it is unhappy. Salisbury is one of
a number of English players who must come back from the West Indies bolder,
if more battered, prepared to play more aggressively this summer.
It is a strange affair, this summer. A split series: first half New Zealand,
second half South Africa. The last split series was in 1990, when England
managed to defeat both New Zealand and India. I never like split series, but
the South Africans did not want a full series, after their long absence from
Test cricket and their recent, fierce combats with the Australians. It will
be good to have a different Test team in England and the South Africans will
be the centre of interest.
In the 1990 split series Atherton topped the batting averages against New
Zealand (71) and was fourth against India (63), adapting well to the
changing demands. He has a penchant for keeping going, come what may. If he
can lead steadily this summer, it should help to release some of England's
unfulfilled talents.
Another trigger for this is often a good spell of fast bowling. Very fast,
like very slow, bowling can induce a touch of abandon in cricketers and if
the bowling is good, the advantage belongs to the bowlers. I look forward to
seeing Devon Malcolm competing with New Zealand's much improved Daniel
Morrison and their young paceman Simon Doull. Later he may have to bowl to
the new, confident leader of South African batting, Hansie Cronje.
Let fast bowlers buy their wickets if need be, as long as they enliven the
series by bowling fast and furious. But bowlers, fast or slow, only flourish
in co-operation with good fielders, in particular good wicket-keepers.
Illingworth was lucky enough to bowl his off-spin with Alan Knott behind the
stumps. At the 1968 Headingley Test, Knott stumped Australia's Bob Cowper,
Paul Sheahan and Noel Jarman in one innings, off Illingworth's bowling.
No wonder Illingworth has always thought of English spin bowling as an
under-used weapon of war. He will need a top-rate keeper to resuscitate it,
younger and fresher than 'Jack' Russell.
Sheahan, one of Knott's Headingley victims, used to draw spectators for his
devastating fielding as much as his batting. It was worth going just to
watch him field. I belong to the generation that remembers Colin Bland and
his fellow South African team members introducing that new brand of
fielding, with its predatory leaps, sprints, catches and, above all, throws.
It sounds as if South African fielding is still hot, especially in the hands
of Jonty Rhodes and Gary Kirsten. They field with spirit, which is as
exciting for the crowd as it is for the players.
To play with spirit is to bring victory one step nearer. England must make
spirited, challenging use of the players they already have. To that end, I
hope Atherton keeps his captaincy intelligent, looking for astute ways to
operate, in spite of the harsh baptism his leadership has received in the
Carribean. He has survived it well; he still makes plans.
I was glad when Keith Fletcher replaced Micky Stewart as England team
manager because I have always thought Fletcher was a canny customer, used to
interpreting cricket situations with an element of guile. He too has had a
rough time and needs a clear working agreement with Illingworth. Shrewd men
now abound and my worry is no longer that we are short of thinking; rather
that the thinkers may get in each others' way. Roles must be defined, so
that in plotting as well as playing everyone has room to perform with flair.
Or at least to have a go.

FT  16 APR 94 / Sport: Japanese shrine in garden of England - Derek
Lawrenson visits two luxurious and very expensive new courses / Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Masao Nagahara is believed to have made Pounds 800m from just one financial
transaction, and so finding the loose change to build what amounts to his
own private golf course, in Kent, was not a problem. Even at this time of
the year the tees and the greens are so perfect you feel almost sinful
walking on them in spikes.
Like many Japanese businessmen, Nagahara's sport is golf, and in particular
golf as it is played in the US and Britain and especially the latter. 'It is
the home of golf,' he said, with a reverence that caused his eyes to
glisten.
Nagahara's course, in which he has invested Pounds 40m, is, oddly enough
given its location, called The London golf club. Membership debentures are
available at Pounds 22,700. Annual subscriptions cost Pounds 1,250. So far
the club has 230 members and a notional target figure of 980.
'If we can get another 250 this year we shall cover our operational costs,'
Nagahara said.
He will not lose sleep if he does not. 'I achieved what I set out to achieve
before we had one member,' he said.
Two things that stand out about golf in Japan are the cost of playing, which
makes it the ultimate rich man's status symbol, and the attention to detail.
The bunkers are not just raked, there are special greenkeepers who go around
with small brushes to finish the job.
Nagahara is transplanting this philosophy to the UK. He called it 'a
blending of the two cultures.'
Another Japanese-financed venture, the Oxfordshire golf club, sums up the
approach. The initial investment was Pounds 25m. The course was designed by
the distinguished American architect, Rees Jones, his first work in Britain.
Again, the tees and greens are immaculate.
Debenture memberships for The Oxfordshire cost Pounds 26,000. The club has
300 members and wants 650. The Oxfordshire is owned by the Nitto Kogyo
Corporation, whose president, Hitoshi Matsura, plays off 14.
Matsura also owns Turnberry, where his company has spent Pounds 22m
upgrading the course so that it ranks with any in the world.
In its formative years Matsura's company made agricultural machinery but now
owns 30 golf courses in Japan, and seven in the US. He is wary of media
interest. Certainly it is easy to be critical of his approach. Are the
Oxfordshire, and the London golf club for that matter, really golf clubs
when so few will walk their fairways and populate their opulent clubhouses
this year? Nor will there be any green-fee-paying customers, unless they
have been invited by members.
The fact that some people take up debenture memberships simply because they
foresee a substantial profit merely adds to the ire of those who view these
places as elitist.
One member of the London GC explained that he joined because: 'The
debentures were Pounds 16,000 when I bought one and already the price is up
to Pounds 22,700.'
'We could really do with a few more members to create the atmosphere of a
golf club,' the London tournament professional, Peter Mitchell said. 'The
only time it is at all busy is at the weekends.'
Alex McMillan, general manager of The Oxfordshire, worked for Nitto Kogyo in
Japan. He said: 'What we are trying to establish here has nothing to do with
elitism or some out of this world facility, but something that can be
appreciated by all who play it.
'The object was to bring together the Japanese golfer and the British
businessman and an ideal way of enhancing that is by providing a golfing
atmosphere. In Japan, the golf course is a great business asset and it is a
place where a lot of business is done, and that philosophy is something we
are trying to cultivate here.'
In any case, what one man sees as an ego trip, another considers a valuable
contribution to the evolution of golf in Britain. These courses have set new
standards in terms of conditioning, for one thing. It used to be argued that
a European tour event could not be held in England before May because there
was no growth on the greens. You could hold one at either the London GC or
The Oxfordshire on Christmas Day and the putting surfaces would equal those
at Augusta.
'I have been practising at the London golf club all winter and I know they
will be better than the greens we will be putting on during the height of
the summer,' Mitchell said.
Nagahara was in heaven recently. His goal was not just to build a golf
course in Britain but also to have it designed by his favourite golfer, Jack
Nicklaus. The members were informed that Nicklaus would be coming in by
helicopter to look at his new creation, play nine holes with two of his
sons, and talk them through what he had set out to achieve.
Imagine that scenario at most golf clubs in Britain. It would have been the
talk of the clubhouse for months on end, and stories of his visit would have
entered club lore. At the London golf club, 50 people showed up. In Japan it
takes six hours to play a round because so many people are crammed on to the
courses. Such is the Japanese enthusiasm for the game.
In Britain few people play the courses the Japanese own because few people
can afford it. They are like exhibits of fine art, and like such things,
depending on your viewpoint, you can either look and admire, or you can
shake your head and wonder why anyone would be daft enough to pay such
prices.

FT  16 APR 94 / Motoring: Tamed, but still exciting - Stuart Marshall finds
that the new Porsche 911 Carrera has appeal for all / Road test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest 911 Carrera with Tiptronic is pure, triple-distilled Porsche. It
looks like a son - even a grandson - of the original 911 of 30 years ago,
and it still goes in a way that would satisfy a fast and skilful driver. But
it has been tamed. Any driver of moderate competence can now enjoy it
enormously without fear of getting into trouble.
Whenever I drive a 911, it strikes me as being more animate than mechanical.
This one made me feel as if I had been put up on a racehorse - only to find,
to my great relief, that it could be ridden as easily as a wise old hunter.
For me, there is no better transmission than Tiptronic, which is an
extra-cost alternative to the standard six-speed gearbox. It offers the
choice of fully automatic or clutch-less manual gearbox.
In town, you simply let the transmission get on with it while you
concentrate on the traffic. On the open road, you move the lever sideways
into a different slot.
Then you have a manual gearbox that makes instant, clutch-less shifts, under
full power if you wish. All you do is push the lever forward to change up,
pull it back to change down.
A tiny red tell-tale on the instrument panel lets you know which gear you
are in. If you leave your Porsche in the wrong one, electronics come to the
rescue. Say you forget to down-shift and come to a stop in fourth - Tiptonic
will pick second gear automatically for re-starting.
Tiptronic has been a Porsche exclusive for five years. Now, Audi has chosen
it for the new A8 quattro, an all-light alloy luxury saloon which goes on
sale later this year.
The 911 Carrera is a two-seater with a pair of notional rear seats that
could, I suppose, accommodate stoical children for short journeys. Normally,
though, they will be used for luggage that overflows the inadequate space
under the bonnet.
What in the average car would be the boot is full of six
horizontally-opposed cylinders with a total capacity of 3.6 litres and which
produce a lusty 272 horsepower - plus the most wonderful noises when working
hard. Early 911s had a well-deserved reputation for biting the hand that
steered them around wet corners; even now, you would not take liberties with
the mighty muscle of the latest 911 Carrera. But a new, multi-link rear
suspension and ever-advancing tyre technology combine to keep it securely on
line at cornering speeds that would have courted serious trouble in older
examples of the marque.
Brakes on 911s always have been enormously powerful; now, they are equipped
with an anti-lock system, too. And should the unfortunate driver make a
blunder, twin air-bags are there to cushion the impact.
The 45-series tyres, more than twice as wide in cross-section as they are
high, thump and bang on rough roads, but the suspension is not harsh and the
motorway ride reasonably comfortable. Build quality, panel fit and finish
are what you would expect of a car costing Pounds 53,995, plus Pounds 2,865
for Tiptronic.
At its introduction last year, Porsche called the 911 Carrera the 'ultimate
evolution of a sporting legend.' And it continues to survive despite
detractors who have said this charismatic vehicle should have been pensioned
off years ago.
Certainly, it is true that this 168 mph (270 kmh) car with rocket-like
acceleration is a sheer indulgence that can be given its head only on a
private track. But the ultimate 911? My feeling is that it ought to live for
ever.

FT  16 APR 94 / Outdoors: Hazel coppice grows anew - Country view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No-one knows how many coppice workers there were in the UK before the second
world war. But in 1956 there were only 300 and their numbers have steadily
decreased, said Hampshire county council countryside officer Jonathan Howe.
In Hampshire, however, the trend has been reversed. Howe says that 70 of the
190 full-time coppice workers in England and Wales work in his county. His
team is reviving this ancient rural industry based on hazel, a species that,
with oak, ash and yew, was viewed as a chieftain among trees in Celtic
times.
Hazel coppicing declined in the mid-19th century, pushed out by the millions
of oaks planted to supply the expanding tanning and shipbuilding industries.
It nearly died out after the second world war and the agricultural manpower
crisis it brought. Since then much coppice has been bulldozed or poisoned,
at first for agricultural purposes, then to make room for conifer
plantations.
The backbone of the revival in Hampshire has been the thatching industry and
a renewed interest in hurdles for garden fences and outdoor screens.
'The industry has attracted new entrants in the last few years, and though
some of the thatching spar makers have gone out of business with the general
decline in the building trade, many have become hurdlemakers,' said Howe.
'Hurdlemaking is really picking up after the years of recession. People are
realising that a good hazel hurdle should last 15 years - longer than its
rival willow.'
Each year Howe and his team attempt to bring 300-400 acres of coppice
woodland back into rotation. They clear derelict coppice wood, replanting
when necessary, and thin the taller, slower-growing deciduous trees.
This is the busiest time of the year for the coppice worker. Most of the
cutting is done between February and late April. Hazel rods cut at this time
are sappy and usable for several months.
Spring cutting also brings a bonus for the flora. 'The bluebell wood evolved
under traditional coppice management,' said Howe. 'This country is the best
in Europe for bluebells, which thrive in our oceanic climate,' said Howe.
'Violets, primroses and wood anemonies also thrive under the coppice system.
They have lots of sunlight for two to three years. Then all is shade for the
next few years until the coppice is cut. The alternative - the high forest
system - kills off their abundance. Under this system there is a wonderful
flush of flowers for two to three years, then as the conifers grow all
becomes dark for 60 years.'
After cutting, the hazel stools are left for seven to 10 years. 'After this
time an acre of well-stocked hazel will produce 10,000 to 12,000 rods 10 ft
to 15 ft in length,' Howe said.
Hazel rods are ideal for pea and bean sticks. They are also used in river
bank protection, using the traditional 'spiling' method - woven round wooden
stakes. Curled hazel shavings are used in potpourri.
'We are developing new hazel products such as dog kennels, tree guards, rose
arches, bowers, framed gates and bird hides,' Howe said. 'We are also
attempting to bring coppice wood into the home once more. In the past it was
not only used as the framework inside wattle and daub panels, but also for
furniture. We are encouraging one or two designers to experiment with woven
hazel panels in chairs and blanket boxes.' Details of the Hampshire coppice:

FT  16 APR 94 / Gardening: Give dahlias a chance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the main purposes of a gardening column is to jog your memory and
remind you of old truths. The old truth now is that you have about 10 days
left to plant bulbs for success in the summer.
Merchants send out spring catalogues from which some of us order lilies (too
late) and others, presumably, order gladioli. Many of the spring ideas in
these catalogues are not hardy although things like watsonia could be
wonderful in those pots which everyone now wants to display on their
balconies and round the house. But while other things are excellent for
years, fashion now seems against them.
Dahlias are not bulbs although, whenever I recommend them, most people look
ready to impale me on a semi-cactus. Certainly, those ball-shaped mauves and
oranges are truly awful, and the newer miniatures with names like Topmix or
Lilliput are no better. The trouble is that these bad varieties put us all
off.
In five months, I will again be admiring the pale yellows, whites and soft
pinks on the marvellous show stand mounted by Ayletts of Hertfordshire at
the Royal Horticultural Society's autumn show. We have illustrated it here,
and many of you have written to ask for a reminder when the buying season
comes round. It has arrived.
If you have planted new beds and are impatient about them, do please take
dahlias seriously. Groups of three or five will thicken up the back row of
your border and are really no bother if you start them now in boxes of light
soil and transplant them late in May.
In half-shade or in groups of 10 for the middle row, I like to match tall
dahlias with the old summer hyacinth. Galtonia candicans has bulbs like
tennis balls which should be planted about 4in deep on a layer of pleasant
compost. In August, they send up stems to a height of 3ft, set with
widely-spaced white flowers that resemble teeth with a winning gap. The
leaves sprawl around and are rather ugly, but you can lose them in a
surrounding border or imitate me and cut them in half without harm.
Since 1982, I have learned to lift galtonias late in autumn and store them
like dahlias, replanting them this weekend. They will then last for years.
For much quicker results, try a tall relation of the Star of Bethlehem
called Ornithogalum arabicum. It is often recommended for autumn planting
and it will try to flower in June, having spikes of white flowers with an
enchanting black eye. I learned two years ago that you could also plant them
as late as April 20 and still enjoy flowers about two months later.
Above all, remember nerines, the shocking pink Guernsey lilies which will
bring us to our senses late in September and last until the first serious
frost. Some people plant them in autumn but spring has always been my
preference. Nowadays, I choose the catalogues' ordinary bowdenii.
There are a few important tips to remember. Plant them so that the soil
comes up to the neck of each bulb, leaving a small tip showing. Choose a
sunny place where the soil is as sandy or sharply-drained as possible, and
be patient for the first two years: nerines take off in their third season
and should never be pre-judged.
Sometimes, people complain that old clumps are not flowering well. The best
advice is to give them a strong potash feed, using sulphate of potash from
early summer on.
Often, nerines are planted under walls, although they do not need extreme
protection. Here, they tend to be starved, something which they hate as much
as clay. If you dose them on potash, they remember to be miraculous once
more.
I have one last tip which is important. We all envy those wonderful carpets
of yellow achonites up the drives of genuinely old vicarages or in woods
which once led to a big Victorian house. Why do we fail to recreate them
when we plant the necessary tubers by the hundred during the autumn?
The answer is that the achonite, or eranthis, hates to be dried out and
moved round the market. The right time to plant them is during the next two
weeks when you can still buy them in green leaf from specialists.
The right tactic is to plant a few in clumps of three or four and leave them
to multiply (if they like you. If they do not, there is no point in wasting
money on hundreds in the autumn).
You might be in two minds about dahlias but, if an eventual carpet of yellow
early in spring is your desire, now is the moment to set about it.

FT  16 APR 94 / Outdoors: The workers bring out their dead - As the snow
melts in the Pennines, Gerry Northam lifts the lid on his hive and finds
signs of life / Bees in a cold climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERRY NORTHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When winter reaches the first of its false ends, with a day of unexpected
mildness, beekeepers look for a sign that life in the hive goes on. A few
pioneering worker bees appear at the hive entrance, toddle out from the warm
cluster inside and take short flights. This is the first we have seen of
them since early December, when they went into a protective huddle,
meditating rather than hibernating in a mass state of reduced animation. In
the bitter days and nights of winter, the only safe way to check that they
are still alive is to get down on all fours, press your ear to the hive
entrance and knock sharply on the side. If a small apian roar goes up like a
football crowd then, for the while, all is well. But you still wait
anxiously for the weather to turn, hoping to see bees venture out and begin
exploring.
It has been a particularly nervous winter for us waiting to learn if our two
colonies could survive in a garden perched 1,200 feet up in the Pennines at
the very margin of existence for honey bees. When we moved to this altitude
the three hives we brought with us died out in a matter of weeks and it was
only by catching a local swarm that we had any bees at all. We later divided
it to make a second colony and began our winter vigil.
The moment of reassurance arrived relatively early when both hives came
alive in the second week of February. They began tentatively, not wanting to
risk the lives of too many workers, but within half an hour they were flying
out in great numbers and returning from the snowdrops and winter heather
with tiny packs of pollen round their legs like thick woollen socks. This
was good news because pollen feeds the brood and bees taking it into the
hive raise hopes that the queen is in good health and about to begin laying
eggs for the Spring.
But this activity was soon brought to a halt by another of the familiar
chill downpours which our neighbours in Buxton, Derbyshire, regard as light
showers.
It was two weeks before we saw the bees again, but it was worth the wait for
what proved to be an extraordinary display. On the last Sunday in February
the morning was once again mild and thick snow from the previous week was
starting to melt as the elderly bees in both hives started the laborious
ritual of bringing out their dead.
One by one they dumped bodies outside their city wall and left them to rot.
For a radius of 6 ft from the entrance-board dark corpses stood out against
the snow, most of them motionless, some not quite dead and twitching
pathetically for a few minutes on an old leg or a frayed wing until, like
tiny Geralds in Women in Love, their hearts fell silent and froze. For the
few hours the snow remained, they made a stark tableau as they lay scattered
by the first of the hives' seasonal spectacles of death.
It was a further three weeks before the continuing vigour of life was made
equally apparent on opening up the hives and taking a look inside. Lifting
the roof from a beehive is an act of Zen which requires alert stillness and
a strong veil. I had both as I made my first inspection at the end of March.
Just below the roof the upper box holds 10 frames of comb and was so full of
bees that I had to take care not to crush any of them as I lifted the combs
one at a time.
Starting at the edge, two frames were still full of last season's honey
which the bees are going to need for several weeks yet. Working inwards, a
couple of frames had a crescent of white-capped honeycomb at the sides and
top, and a dense block of bumpy brown cappings in the centre where the brood
was laid, each hexagonal cell holding a growing grub. There were one or two
cells where holes had been bitten in the capping from the inside and a
little head was struggling to break through. Most of the comb on the next
two frames had not yet been capped and when I gently shook the bees off
there were hundreds of freshly-laid eggs, proof of an active and prolific
queen. Some of the eggs were only hours old, looking like minute grains of
rice pointing up from the bottom of their cells, while others had become
curved and plump after sitting for a few days in royal jelly. It will take
them less than three weeks to grow to full lifesize and emerge as worker
bees themselves.
Both hives had the ingredients of success - plenty of brood and good stores
of honey. The coming months will show how well they actually succeed here at
the edge of survival.

FT  16 APR 94 / Outdoors: Where big salmon bite - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have been goggling in wonderment at an extraordinary photograph, taken in
the summer of 1926. On either side is a rugged Norwegian, one in cap and
waders, the other showing a gleaming watch chain across his waistcoat.
Behind is a wooden cabin, with a bare mountainside. Between the two men,
arranged in four rows, are 33 salmon.
There are two notable aspects to this catch, one merely amazing, the other
well-nigh incredible. The amazing is the size of the fish; two weighed over
40lbs, six others weighed 30lbs or more, and the average of the 33 was
24lbs. What almost defies belief is that they were all caught during the
night of July 7, by one man, the Duke of Westminster.
Nearly 1,000lbs of salmon, all on fly, all on one rod, in seven or eight
hours - the mind reels.
It was quite an expedition for the duke and the chums who accompanied him on
his yacht, the Cutty Sark. In a little under four weeks, they caught 684
salmon, at an average of 23 lbs. Nor was the Duke the chief scorer. His
total of 173 was comfortably exceeded by the 208 caught by Colonel Sir North
Dalrymple-Hamilton. Of these, no fewer than six weighed more than 40lbs.
The river on which these feats of slaughter were performed lies 300 miles
within the Arctic Circle, flowing a mere 27 miles from the forested plateau
of Finnmark into the Barents Sea. It is the fabled Alta, and I am afraid the
nearest you or I are going to get to fishing it is to read about those more
fortunate than ourselves.
The story of the Alta is one of its tremendous fish, of the hardy breed of
boatmen who ply its surging waters, and of the anglers who, for 160 years,
have come to do battle. Chief among these have been a succession of Britons
distinguished by wealth, privilege, a taste for comfortable adventury, and a
prodigious appetite for catching prodigious salmon.
The first pioneer was the appealingly named Sir Hyde Parker, of Melford
Hall, Suffolk. There was a painting of Sir Hyde, somewhat romantic in
nature, which showed him kneeling in his waders beside a foaming torrent,
with a fat salmon on the rocks beside him. He penetrated to the Alta in the
mid-1830s, towards the end of a life which seems to have been largely
devoted to prowling around Europe in search of sport and artistic treasures.
We know Sir Hyde enjoyed good fishing on the Alta, and in the 1850s
intelligence about this remarkable river excited the interest of the sixth
Duke of Roxburghe. In July 1859 he sailed there, pitched camp, and in a
month caught nearly 150 salmon and grilse. It was the start of an
association which continues to this day.
Five years later - having signed a lease on the whole river - the Duke
brought a large party which included the queen's younger son, Prince Alfred,
who caught 60 salmon in his first three days, 126 in all. While the
fishermen fished each night, the rest of the guests danced aboard HMS Black
Eagle, the strains of the brass band echoing across the Alta estuary.
The Roxburghe lease was renewed in 1909 by the eighth Duke. The 1920s and
1930s were vintage years, as each summer the ninth Duke, Bobo, and the Duke
of Westminster, known as Bendor, sailed north with their families and
friends for fishing under the midnight sun.
The local association split the river into five beats. But the two dukes
returned. On his first night's fishing in 1939, the Duke of Westminster
caught six fish over 30lbs. In the same year, the Earl of Dudley had a
60-pounder. But even this monster was eclipsed a few years later by one of
the Alta boatman who caught a fish of 70lbs on fly, and another a  1/2 lb
bigger on a spoon.
Such fishing is the stuff of dreams, but the Alta continues to fulfil them -
for the happy few. Among them is the 10th Duke of Roxburghe - as keen a
salmon fisher as any of his forbears, but with rather less time to spare.
I met him recently at Floors Castle, which stands by the Tweed at Kelso. He
lent me two books about the Alta, written and privately published by a brace
of its devotees, Roy Flurie and Theodor Dalenson. All the information I have
presented comes from these absorbing volumes.
Last year the Duke and his party had 47 fish for their week, averaging
25lbs. That, in these debased times, represents fantastic fishing, and the
Duke grinned at the memory of it. And I - who have never caught a salmon of
25lbs, and will never fish the Alta - shared his pleasure.

FT  16 APR 94 / Outdoors: The aphid that made millions - The Dutch are
celebrating 400 years of tulips / Garden history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to an opinion poll, most Americans do not know where Holland is
but they can easily tell you where tulips come from.
Perhaps fewer Americans know the extraordinary history of this bloom, once
prized above the riches of princes, now produced for the millions, yet still
touched by the magic of its exotic past. Tulip bulbs saved many of the Dutch
from death in the darkest years of Nazi occupation, and they have helped to
keep them prosperous ever since.
It is understandable that the Netherlands wants to celebrate; it has chosen
1994 as the 400th anniversary of the flowering of tulips flowered in the
Dutch province of Holland (no matter that the date is doubtful) and is
marking the event with pageants, tours, an exhibition at the Frans Hals
Museum in Haarlem and one in the autumn at Amsterdam's Nieuwe Kirche,
adorned with unseasonal 'ice tulips'.
The identification of tulips with Holland goes back to the epidemic of
'tulip mania' between 1635 and the crash in 1637 (which showed remarkable
parallels with more modern commodity and price spirals). However, some say
that the warm sentiment inspired by tulips arose relatively recently. This
year is the 50th anniversary of the Hunger Winter of 1944, when the Dutch
starved under German occupation and people were reduced to grubbing up bulbs
from the tulip fields. Some restaurants are putting tulip dishes on the
menu, a gimmick which may say as much about residual anti-German feeling as
about sentimentality towards tulips.
The first recorded tulip flowerings in Holland were at Leiden, in neatly
hedged beds in the hortus botanicus in autumn 1593. They belonged to the
botanist Charles de l'Ecluse. Clusius, as he was known, was by then an old
man, head-hunted for the new university. For more than 30 years he had been
at the imperial court in Vienna, growing and studying tulips brought from
Turkey.
By 1594 tulips were being grown in grand gardens in the German-speaking
lands, in France, and England. Indeed, it is recorded that many years before
he moved to the Netherlands, Clusius sent a present of bulbs to a Dutch
gentleman. No doubt they flowered . . .
Pedantry aside, Leiden can claim to be the cradle of the Dutch bulb
industry. Clusius and his head-gardener, quaintly called Clutius, settled
down to propagating the priceless tulip collection. They sold bulbs at
exorbitant prices to courtiers and country gentlemen.
The breakthrough came only after a break-in, when thieves smashed their way
into the hortus botanicus, stole the tulip collection, and dispersed it to
the nursery trade.
Tulip growing and breeding became a passionate pursuit of rich amateur
gardeners throughout northern Europe. Because they hybridise easily and
produce 'sports' or mutations, tulips were soon being produced in an
extraordinary range of sizes, colours, shapes, and in the case of the most
expensive, with the most fabulously patterned blooms. Vividly striped,
blotched and flamed tulips (much later called 'Rembrandt' type) were the
most expensive.
By the 1620s, tulip bulbs had become plentiful enough for at least the lowly
varieties to be widely available. But the extraordinary thing about tulips
was their propensity to change dazzlingly from one season to the next.
Unique among flowers, they will spontaneously 'break' or 'rectify',
reappearing the next spring with gorgeously patterned petals. These tulips
took their place among the costliest luxuries of the day.
Grow just a few bulbs, and you could find you had the lucky break, which
made tulips ripe for an investment gamble. Without the breaking, there would
not have been the kind of interest which led to a speculative mania
notorious in the annals of capitalism.
A rampant futures markets developed, tulips changing hands many times but
only on paper. Men made and lost fortunes.
In 1623, a Semper Augustus bulb, red and white, fetched Fl 1,000 - around
Pounds 350. Average income was around Fl 150. Next year, the price was Fl
1,200; by 1635, the price was Fl 5,500. Then the massive inflation began and
in 1637, at the height of the market, a Semper August fetched the equivalent
of Pounds 3,300. One bulb cost as much as a house on Amsterdam's smartest
canal, with a coach-house and garden.
Why did tulips break? There were many theories, ranging from the influence
of the planets to insect infestation. The answer was found only in 1919. It
was a virus, TBV, commonly spread by aphids, which by breaking up the
anthocyanin pigment causes the exceptionally intense hues and patterns.
The discovery was the death-knell of the Rembrandt. The flower of the Dutch
Golden Age was merely sickly, diseased and horribly contagious. As Stanley
Killingback, a modern tulip expert remarks: 'The beauty of such flowers is
the beauty of death.' Clusius, too, noted that a broken tulip fizzles out
within a season or two. He thought the breaking was a floral equivalent of a
swansong, to reward its owner.
Tulip mania remains an astonishing tribute to the appeal of flowers that
were valued as if they were gold plate or pearls. Today, tulip prices are at
an historic low, and sales are declining. Tulip 400 celebrates a passion
which has long been waning among gardeners. In the last 20 years, the number
of growers has dropped from 15,000 to 3,510.
Yet even after four centuries of breeding, the hybridisers see a chink
ahead. Extraordinary things may yet emerge from the bulb-sheds. Tissue
culture has reduced the time it takes to bring a new variety to market -
from 20 years to around seven. In the 1930s, they used radiation to make
weird new varieties. Frans Roozen, head of the technical section of the
International Bulb Centre talk of using colchicine, a poison favoured by
Dutch witches, to cross tulips with narcissi and make 'a purple daffodil'.
Genetic engineering is a better bet for the rainbow tulips of the future.
According to hybridiser Piet Koopman of Pico Bello, the true blue tulip is a
possibility if scientists can identify the purple chromasome in the iris
family and inject it into tulip bulbs. Four centuries have taken the tulip a
long way from the small, highly priced flower which Clusius named, 'A lovely
tulip of a most elegant colour'.

FT  16 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The mother of all whistlers -
Clive Fewins meets the man who makes and sells the famous Acme brand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Simon Topman received a letter from Sweden addressed only to 'Mr
Whistle, Birmingham' he was not surprised. His company, Hudson's whistles,
is familiar to the local post office and Sweden is one of 80 countries where
the company's products are sold.
'We have been established so long and our trademark - Acme - is so
well-known that it is not uncommon to get people from the other side of the
world knocking on our door wanting to buy, or even give us a whistle,' said
Topman.
The gifts are from elderly users who want to send their trusty whistles back
'home' to the little works in Hockley, Birmingham for safe keeping. There
they join the Acme hall of fame, just like the gift from the Irish railway
guard that arrived a few weeks ago. It was an ancient Acme Thunderer, given
to him in 1915 by his father, a gaelic football referee.
'Although it had been used by two men throughout their working lives it was
still in excellent condition,' said Topman, 40, who placed it alongside the
first Acme Metropolitan Police whistles dating from 1870, and some other
rare survivors, like the only example of an ill-fated model made to imitate
the sound of a tiger. The latter was designed for the British troops in the
Burma campaign of 1941-2 to scare the Japanese.
'There was nothing wrong with the sound the device produced but it proved
too large to form part of a soldier's kit,' Topman said.
The tale of the Irish railwayman's whistle underlines Topman's worst
headache. 'I don't like to blow my own whistle too much but our brass
whistles don't wear out,' he said.
Topman's best hope is that the owners either lose their whistles or opt for
one of the cheaper plastic versions, in which case there is a chance they
might become soiled or chewed round the mouthpiece.
Not that the metal ones are that expensive. The Acme Thunderer costs less
than Pounds 3. The price underlines Topman's other headache. To make a good
profit from manufacturing such low value items means you have to make - and
sell - a lot of whistles.
'In an average year we make and sell about 4m whistles, of which abut half
are plastic and half metal,' Topman said. To achieve this - and a current
net profit of Pounds 40,000 - the company turns over Pounds 1.5m and Topman
does a great deal of travelling.
'We can't really justify a sales force, so I have to be a super-salesman and
make frequent visits to our distributors all over the world,' he said. 'I
call them whistle-stop tours. Most of our effort goes into manufacturing. We
have a full-time workforce of 58 and, apart from a small amount of foundry
work, all the processes are carried out here.'
The factory is a 26,000 sq ft turn-of-the-century building just beyond
Birmingham's jewellery quarter. Lurid green floor-to-ceiling tiles in the
listed two storey front section of the building give it the look of a
Victorian public lavatory. Behind this, in characteristic Victorian
Birmingham metal-bashing fashion, the factory mainly comprises a series of
ground-floor floor workshops, including the shop where Paul Nicholls hand
tests every whistle Hudsons make.
'He is the country's only professional whistle tester,' said Topman. 'We are
safe in saying this as we are the country's only whistle manufacturer of any
size. I wish I could say I always whistle while I work]'
When Topman is abroad the business is under the control of Mike Sharp,
co-director and production manager. The third director is Topman's father,
Arthur, 72, who has worked for the company for 37 years and is related to
the Hudson family by marriage. He visits the factory for a few hours every
week.
Sharp is responsible for putting the trill and the shrill into the 62
different types of whistle Hudsons produce. It is a task in which he finds
his clarinet playing ability (Topman is also a musician) useful. It is
important that a style of whistle like the Thunderer, that has existed for
101 years, should have a consistent sound, because devotees of a particular
type of whistle have an enduring loyalty.
'Calculating the pitch is a skilled business. Surely only a man named Sharp
can tell when a whistle is flat]' said Topman.
'Basketball and netball referees, like a whistle with a really high pitch as
the crowds are noisy and close to the players. Rugby referees like the more
macho sound of an Acme Thunderer number 58, whch has a lower pitch.'
The company makes game and bird calls, song whistles, orchestral whistles
and sirens used by drummers for producing wind effects. They also sell to
sailors, the military, and police forces in the UK and traffic police in the
US and continental Europe.
'Only about 20 per cent of sales are in this country,' said Topman. 'It's
not that we are swamped by cheaper foreign competition, simply that the UK
market is not big enough to keep us going. We certainly couldn't survive on
the UK market alone.
'Likewise we could not survive if we were to reduce our range very greatly.
We make all models to order, in batches. No single line is justifiable in
its own right, but it is vital to retain the entire range. It is important
that our customers, some of whom come to us for several different kinds of
whistle, know that we can supply all types. This spread of whistle products
also means we can achieve economies of scale, and helps to cushion us
against downturns in some segments of the market.
'In the last few years the European sports goods market has been down, but
we have been doing very well in the far east - curiously enough in some of
the countries that in the past have attempted to counterfeit our products.
Nowadays people are often wealthy and successful in some of those countries
and their sports referees and police demand the best  - or as I like to say,
guaranteed sound.'

FT  16 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Family planning - Starting up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARTH WISEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Garth Wiseman was an industrial adviser at the National Economic Development
Office until 1992. In 1986 he set up an art dealership, Wiseman Originals,
with his wife, Caroline. Now they both work full-time for the company.
There is an important element in setting up a small business which is often
neglected. The decision to start a business must be made as part of a family
or domestic plan. If both partners in a household work they can plan the
business to give it time to reach critical mass. One partner can stay in a
salaried job to provide the security of family income while the other sets
up the business to provide long-term opportunity. One partner helps to
minimise the downside while the other helps to develop the upside for the
family.
The mistake that so many entrepreneurs, and their backers, make is to
underestimate the time required for a business to become viable. This is
invariably the product of enforced over-optimism. There is a school of
thought that suggests that to create a business one has to give body and
soul. This commitment is a necessary condition but not a sufficient one.
Blood, sweat and tears will not bring its own reward. The analysis has to be
right, decisions well judged and action properly implemented.
Before my wife and I started our business as print dealers, my wife worked
for a gallery on Saturdays for no pay to gain experience and an
understanding of the business. I had worked for 25 years as an auditor, bank
lending officer and as an industrial adviser at National Economic
Development Office and so I had built up an understanding why businesses
fail and why they succeed. I had put myself through business school and had
trained in marketing and accounting. Between us we not only had a knowledge
of the specific business that we were entering but we also had the skills
necessary to create and run a successful business.
The keys to the success of our business have been:
minimising set up costs and ongoing overheads and bank borrowing,
employing of one partner only for the first few years until we reached
critical mass,
managing the household so one of us was free to see clients whatever the day
or time. (We are open 15 hours a day, seven days a week including
Christmas.)
During nearly 20 years as an industrial adviser at NEDO I never encountered
a company of the size of the family business my wife and I now run, which
has a turnover of Pounds 300,000. A lot of attention is given to setting up
small businesses but there has never been much given to those small
businesses, like ours, that are four / five years old and have weathered the
recent economic turbulence but which need help and good advice to grow
further.
Businesses do not grow in a straight line but in steps. There are points at
which a business needs to spend significant amounts of money to be able to
expand to the next threshold. For example, we reached the point where we
felt we had to invest in computers. We spent Pounds 5,000 on equipment and
consultancy to enable us to spend more of our time doing business, to allow
more people to participate in running the business, to improve our control
of the business and the amount of information we had on it.
Banks and government bodies produce fantastic promotional literature about
their schemes and facilities for new small businesses but their delivery is
woeful. I have found it difficult to obtain advice from any source that gave
me a greater insight into our business. Most of the 'counsellors' are simply
of too low a calibre and their experience is too limited to be of much use
to an entrepreneur who has to be proficient in a wide variety of skills and
must see the whole picture. When running a new small business the gradualist
approach to learning is more useful than the one-off course which encourages
people to think mistakenly that they now know all they need to know to
succeed.
My preference would be to have a hot line to a selection of experts with
whom I could discuss my problems.
The practice of the Prince's Trust of giving unlimited access to a guardian
angle is very much along these lines. It is one that government initiatives,
whether delivered through TECs or other vehicles, should adopt.
Organisations could help by appointing account managers so that
small-company managers can go direct to one individual whatever the nature
of the problem.

The table below shows how the new Pounds 10,000 transitional CGT indexation
relief might apply. (See Serious Money on page II).
The concession allows the investor to obtain relief for losses attributed
solely to indexation on sales of assets made between November 30 1993 and
April 5 1995. Such losses had been disallowed by the November Budget.
The concession will benefit only those with enough unrelieved capital gains
to need the relief. And they will have a fresh incentive to bed and
breakfast suitable shares before April 6 1995.

Your father will be taxed on the interest. You will be entitled to tax
relief (at 20 per cent for 1994-95 and 15 per cent for 1995-96 onwards) on

I am working abroad and sent recently for further details of a new
investment trust advertised in the FT. I received a brief reply saying it
was 'not permissible to despatch offer documentation outside the UK.' It
suggested that, if I was a British national I could make arrangements
through a UK financial adviser. I did not have this problem when investing
in unit trusts from overseas a few years ago.
Your problem is a comprehensive ban on the sponsoring company, or the
newly-launched company itself, inviting people outside the UK to subscribe
to a new offer unless it is approved by the non-UK country. You could make
arrangements to buy the investment trust shares through a UK financial
adviser as it, and not you, would then be making the offer to purchase
units. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Asset Management Ltd).

answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.

FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Pibs level out after plunge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After undergoing sharp price falls earlier this year, most prices of
permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) have dropped more gently since the
Weekend FT last published the table on February 26, writes Scheherazade
Daneshkhu. 'The market has stabilised in line with the gilt edged market
and, with the return of confidence, has seen a re-emergence of yield-based
buyers,' says David Barker of broker Hoare Govett.
Pibs are issued by building societies to raise capital, but they are not the
type of share that gives investors part of a company's assets. Instead, they
are loans from the investor to the society. They have no redemption date and
are, therefore, designed to pay a fixed income indefinitely. Because of
this, investors can get back their capital only by selling in the stock
market.
They have been popular with private investors because of the relatively high
income they can provide: the table shows present yields which are between
9.36 and 11.27 per cent. But if the building society were to collapse, Pib
investors would rank behind all others for repayment. There is no
compensation scheme to protect them, either.
Robin Boyle, of London-based stockbroker Dunbar, Boyle &amp; Kingsley - which
puts together a portfolio of Pibs now yielding 10.4 per cent after expenses
 -says that one way of reducing the risk of capital loss is to include zero
coupon preference shares in the portfolio. The Pibs produce the income while
the zeros (which do not pay income) provide capital growth for the fund.
Exeter Fund Managers has packaged this idea in a unit trust.

FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Staff share rules eased - Government
acts to boost ownership scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Law changes announced over the past few weeks will make it much easier for
companies to set up and operate employee share ownership trusts (ESOTs).
An ESOT is a vehicle through which company shares can be bought and
distributed among staff. The scheme is based on a successful US model called
the employee stock ownership plan and was introduced by the former
chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, in his 1989 Budget.
Corporate contributions to an ESOT are tax-deductible and, in certain
circumstances, a shareholder who sells to an ESOT can defer capital gains
tax by rolling over the sale proceeds into other assets. Despite these
attractions, the scheme has flopped, and the grand total of ESOTs is barely
in double figures.
One reason is a widespread perception by employers that the rules are too
strict. They require all staff to be offered similar benefits and the
majority of an ESOT's trustees to be chosen by employees.
Another criticism has been the requirement that shares acquired by an ESOT
must be passed on to employees within seven years. To counter this, Finance
Bill clauses accepted recently by the government have increased the period
to 20 years.
Other Finance Bill changes end the need for a majority of trustees to be
employees. Instead, there can now be a 50/50 split between workers and
others, with a casting vote held by a lawyer - or another professional -
selected by the trustees themselves.
(The Inland Revenue refers to this as a 'paritarian' trust - a word which
appears until now to have escaped the notice of dictionary writers and trust
lawyers alike).
In addition, the process of selecting staff representatives is being
simplified. Until now, employees could become a trustee only if they were
backed by more than 50 per cent of fellow workers.
The new regime utilises a first-past-the-post voting system similar to that
for UK elections. It means that even if only 200 of 1,000 workers cast
ballots, the candidate with the most votes will be elected.
A further factor holding back ESOTs has been concern that directors or
employees acting as trustees might be committing a criminal offence under
the Financial Services Act. But the Treasury has now decided that all ESOTs
should be exempted automatically from the 'collective investment scheme'
provisions of the Act.
These changes are a clear acknowledgement that ESOTs have been a big
disappointment. But, with the main deterrents removed, all companies
committed to wider employee share ownership should be taking a fresh look at
the scheme's potential benefits.

FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Rates drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BAYLIS, Moneyfacts
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many larger building societies have been lowering their variable rates in
recent weeks. The trend continues with the Leeds Permanent reducing its
rates on Bonus Gold, Solid Gold and Tessa. Smaller societies have begun to
follow: Hinckley &amp; Rugby has dropped its Tessa rate to 7.35 per cent. Even
at this figure, though, it still heads the table.
New headline rates are being introduced to attract savers to longer-term
fixed products. Newcastle has launched a market leader paying 8 per cent
yearly (7.75 per cent monthly) from Pounds 5,000. Northern Rock, its local
rival, responded by introducing a Pounds 15,000 tier to its Postal Bond
paying 7.75 per cent monthly. Monday will see Britannia launch a five-year
fixed bond paying 8.25 per cent annually, which will make this the market
leader. Again, a monthly option is available.
Escalator bonds have been introduced this week from Norwich &amp; Peterborough
and Portman. The best rates are available from Cheshire and Leeds &amp; Holbeck,
both paying from 6 per cent in the first year to 10 per cent in the fifth.
The most noticeable firming of fixed rates has been on the Guaranteed Income
Bond front. After being in the doldrums for many months, net rates have
increased by more than 1 per cent on many five-year bonds in recent weeks.
NatWest Life has increased them several times, giving it market-leading
rates at Pounds 5,000.
Premium Life and Consolidated have increased their rates and are top for
lower deposits, on one and four-year bonds respectively. The best rate on a
five-year bond comes from Eurolife, paying 6.60 per cent net from Pounds
10,000. This is equivalent to 8.80 per cent gross to a basic-rate taxpayer,
making it more than a match for similar building society accounts.

FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Simplicity, that's the secret -
Robert Langley &amp; Co, 12th in a series on fee-based advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOANNA SLAUGHTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Douglas Skene practised as a chancery barrister before entering financial
planning but, clearly, he did not choose a career as an independent
financial adviser (IFA) because he considered this to be less taxing than
the law.
Skene founded Robert Langley &amp; Co., a fee-based adviser in Leicester, in
1989 after working for the financial group Schroders and a firm of advisers
in London. He says: 'In my view, genuine comprehensive financial planning is
extremely difficult, and perhaps the majority of the financial services
industry has never accepted that. I think that is why some stockbrokers,
accountants and merchant banks have failed when they have tried to set up
financial planning arms.
'Also, there is an enormous shortage of technically qualified people with
the right skills to provide financial planning. If we could find these
people, we would have no difficulty in finding the clients.'
Skene is an associate of the Institute of Financial Planning and praises the
standards it sets. 'If everyone in the industry had to do the IFP exams, it
would be a very good industry,' he says. 'There is no doubt about that.'
He also believes that better use could be made of technology to raise
standards among IFAs. 'The advent of computer technology has offered us the
opportunity of doing what would previously have taken us a very long time to
do, but I am not sure that any of the financial planning software is really
satisfactory.
'It all comes down to simplifying something that is quite complicated. I
think I know what is required and I have, effectively, written the data base
for it.'
Skene aims to provide clients with a total planning service in which he
looks at all aspects of their financial lives, although he does not use his
legal background to usurp the solicitor's role. 'I get involved in trusts
and wills and service contracts and staff benefit legislation, but I don't
myself compete with solicitors. What I do is act as a catalyst, putting the
jigsaw together.
'When I went into the industry, I was very surprised that there were not
more people offering genuinely comprehensive financial planning advice.
There is a very big demand for this, although this demand is not generally
perceived.'
At present, Skene is splitting his business so that there is a clear
division between what he considers to be the two separate stages of client
advice. He argues: 'I think one should first look and see what should be
done. Having agreed that, one should look at the advice. I think this is a
very important distinction, and I think clients find it attractive to
separate the non-generic from the generic advice.'
Robert Langley &amp; Co. is a member of the Burns-Anderson Independent Network,
which was founded in 1988 under the chairmanship of Sir John Harvey Jones
and acquired by its 150 member firms a year ago in a management buy-out. The
cornerstone of the network's business is its research and its computerised
best advice system which, it claims, is unique. It also deals with
compliance matters for members and provides them with the underpin of
indemnity insurance.
Skene says: 'Burns-Anderson provides us with best advice research and they
collect commissions where commissions arise. At the end of the day, what
they give me is the research upon which I can make my decisions for
clients.'
Although Robert Langley is based in Skene's home county of Leicestershire,
the clients are not confined to the shires. The majority arrive after either
personal recommendation or professional - say, from an accountant or
solicitor. Skene says most 'tend to be on the wealthy side. But I have those
who have very little income. It is extremely rare that I think there is
really nothing I can do for a client.'
The firm's hourly rates range from Pounds 100 to Pounds 150. 'I think, at
the end of the day, that clients will realise the importance of going to a
fee-based adviser,' says Skene. 'Would you go to a doctor who made a living
out of commissions on pills and medicines?'
First step for all clients is a meeting to discuss their general situation
and priorities. Clients are seen by Skene or Hamish Leng, the firm's other
adviser, in the Robert Langley offices or at their homes.
Skene says: 'I suspect clients come to us in most cases because they have a
feeling that, in some ways, their financial affairs need direction and
focusing. There is a basic contradiction. People are very concerned about
their financial circumstances but very lethargic about doing anything about
them.'
After the first client meeting, Skene assesses the information and might
then arrange a further meeting 'to delve more deeply into what clients are
trying to achieve. I will then try to spell out more specifically what I
feel their options are.
'After this second meeting, I would probably write them a report. I have a
set way of doing that, which I think is very readable.' All clients are seen
at least once a year.
Robert Langley does not run a managed fund service. It either uses other
investment managers or invests on behalf of clients on an advisory basis.
Skene says: 'If I have done my job properly, I should have got to a stage
where the recommendations I make are ones that clients will agree to. When I
go wrong, it is because I have not appreciated the clients' views.' He adds:
'If I have learned anything in this business, it is that every client is
very different.'

FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising and sales promotions group,
have been performing more strongly since the start of 1994. Three directors,
including the chairman and chief executive, sold a total of 477,000 shares
between the end of March and the first week of April at prices between
650-674p. Each retains a sizeable quantity of stock.
Bolton Group, capitalised at just over Pounds 3m, is one of the smaller
players in the property sector. At present, it is a shell but its status
apparently is about to change as the old guard gives way to new blood.
Chairman Ivor Golethka, is resigning and his sale of 1.5m shares is a part
of this process. Isotron, involved in gamma radiation processing, announced
results at the end of February; these showed a modest improvement on the
same period last year. The transaction carried out by five members of the
board breaks down into three straightforward sales and two instances of
directors exercising options and selling 100 per cent of their ordinary
shares.

FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Heading towards the acid test - An
occasional series by Leslie McClements on developing a pension portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE MCCLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My pension portfolio grew by 59 per cent during 1993. By late January, it
was up by a further 5 per cent. But the tightening of US monetary conditions
early in February led to higher yields and lower capital values. Due to this
and other uncertainties, the portfolio had fallen back to year-end levels by
the end of March.
During the first quarter of 1994, the FT-SE-A All Share index, adjusted for
gross dividends, declined by 6 per cent. The portfolio's better performance
reflects its weighting of high-yielding shares which were less affected by
the general downturn. Even so, the scheme is vulnerable to higher interest
rates.
Does the recent rise in medium-term interest rates herald an upward trend?
The consensus is that short-term rates will bottom out during 1994. Some
pundits say this happened in January but, with low UK inflation, moderate
growth and lower German rates in prospect, it could be late 1994 or possibly
1995 before we see a sustained increase.
As many of the interest-sensitive stocks give very good yields, I want to
keep them until just before the upturn. Sphere and Fleming International
High Income investment trusts are at substantial discounts to net asset
values: their winding-up options in October 1995 and 1996 respectively
should support prices. Exmoor Dual, Abtrust Preferred Income and Bristol &amp;
West Pibs (permanent interest-bearing shares) are higher priorities for
disposal.
The holding in TR Property was sold in January to produce a gain of 126 per
cent. Part of the proceeds was invested in Artesian Second Commercial, an
unquoted property investment company which should give a better yield. Its
older sister company, Artesian Commercial, plans to pay a dividend of 12 per
cent. An independent valuation of its properties shows a 40 per cent
increase on the original equity investment.
The balance of the TR Property proceeds was invested in Redland. It yields
more than 5 per cent and should benefit from continued recovery in European
economies over the next couple of years. Construction companies like Laing,
AMEC and Wimpey were considered as alternative late-cycle recovery
prospects. But these shares all have lower yields, and prices in this sector
rose sharply during January, so this opportunity could have passed.
The position at Queens Moat Houses remains unclear. I wrote down the 7.5 per
cent convertible stock to 1p a share in December - any improvement on
re-listing will be a bonus. With the change in management, Pentos recovered
to 38p in mid-March. But with poor dividend prospects and the possibility of
a rights issue (confirmed recently), these shares were sold, giving a 31 per
cent loss.
The Pentos proceeds and accumulated dividends were invested in Northern
Foods. This company provides a goodyield and should have a limited downside,
with prospects for capital growth.
Several readers have asked for further details of small self-administered
schemes. My SSAS is a hybrid scheme run by an assurance company - there is a
good general description in the Allied Dunbar Pensions Guide. It charges
Pounds 325 plus VAT for its services as pensioner trustee and requires a
minimum contribution of Pounds 5,000 to its unit-linked pensions.
Some stockbrokers and investment managers offer similar arrangements without
the insurance element. These generally involve an initial fee plus larger
annual charges (Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 400 respectively in one case), and
higher stockbroking commissions. Self-invest personal pensions give many of
the SSAS advantages for an initial fee of around Pounds 300 and a similar
yearly charge.
The annual overheads for a SSAS range from Pounds 450 upwards. Large annual
pension contributions (Pounds 10,000 or more for at least 10 years) or a
sizable fund (Pounds 0.1m or more) usually are required to spread these
fixed costs. But a smaller scheme can be justified by superior investment
performance or some other advantage, such as property purchase for business
use.
In establishing my scheme, I aimed to contain costs within the 1 per cent
fund management fee which would arise with a personal pension, and to
achieve similar investment returns.
Both objectives have been exceeded to date, but the final retirement fund
will provide the acid test.

FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Longer-term loans in demand - Fixed
rates continue to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fixed-rate mortgages are continuing to move upwards because of a general
rise in fixed interest rates. Halifax's latest rates are roughly half a
percentage point higher, Abbey's are between 0.3 and 0.4 of a point higher,
while Lloyds bank has raised most of its fixed rates by 0.74 of a point.
The highest rises, according to Walter Avrili of mortgage broker John
Charcol, are concentrated in the three- to five-year fixed rate market.
'After months of rates coming down, fixed rates have been increasing, and we
may find there was a window of six months when five-year rates dropped to an
exceptionally low level,' he adds.
Halifax and Nationwide, the two largest building societies say five-year
fixed rates have been increasing in popularity at the expense of those over
two and three years. Until recently, most five-year fixed rates had been at,
or below, the standard variable rate of 7.64-7.74 per cent. But the table
shows that new five-year rates are now above this level.
Most of those listed are at 8.49 per cent (Barclays, Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester, Halifax) but Lloyds bank is offering a five-year fix at 7.99 and
Britannia one at 8.25 per cent.
Some lenders are giving special offers, such as cash refunds and free
valuations, but terms can vary substantially. C&amp;G no longer charges a
valuation fee and Abbey National will refund the valuation fee on
completion. At Nationwide, you need a 15 per cent deposit to escape the
valuation fee.
Barclays bank has introduced a new system of charging the early redemption
penalty, initially on its three-year fixed rate only. The penalty will be
based on the amount of time the fixed rate has run and the level of interest
rates when the early redemption is made.
Other lenders, such as C&amp;G, Halifax and Nationwide already reduce the size
of the penalty in the later years of the fixed rate term. On the other hand,
Halifax charges three months' gross interest beyond the term of its two- and
three-year fixed rates. 'We want customer loyalty and at least a three-year
relationship with a customer,' the society says.
Should borrowers wait to see if fixed rates will fall before making a move?
The illustration shows how important timing can be when it comes to fixing
your mortgage, although fractional changes in fixed rates will not make a
significant difference.
'Without a crystal ball, no one knows whether fixed rates will fall back to
the same levels,' says Avrili. 'There could be another window later this
year, but borrowers should ask themselves if it is worth taking the risk of
waiting and then finding rates continuing to move up.'

FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Investors eye Ghana's gold -
Ashanti's float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashanti, one of the world's largest and richest gold mines, comes to market
next week. It is a top operation in terms of production, mine life and cost
structure and, at the expected price of Dollars 20 a share, Ashanti
Goldfields Company is valued at Dollars 1.67bn.
This figure was reached by comparing Ashanti, Ghana's biggest gold group,
with major producers in Australia, North America and South Africa. The
important measurement was how much gold in the ground, in the form of
reserves, you get for your money.
Ashanti's prospective market capitalisation puts a price of Dollars 92 an
ounce on its 18m ounces of reserves, so it is being ranked below the
Australians and North Americans but above the South Africans (which it
resembles most closely). You pay an average of Dollars 160 an ounce for
North American gold in the ground and Dollars 140 for Australian - but only
Dollars 50 for a South African ounce.
Is Ghana really that much better a political risk than South Africa?
The Ghanaian government's sale of 25 per cent of Ashanti, one of the central
planks of its privatisation programme, is by no means popular with everyone
locally and has already been challenged - unsuccessfully, so far - in the
courts.
There are other risks. Any investment in a gold producer is a bet on the
price. And while Ashanti is one of the lowest-cost producers, a falling
price would inhibit its ability to fund capital investment and to pay
dividends.
Ashanti also will rely heavily for future gold production on a process
called bacterial oxidation: in crude terms, bugs eat into the ore to release
the metal. This process is relatively new to the gold industry and has never
before been used on such a big scale.
Some potential investors could baulk at putting money into a company in
which Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate now undergoing a management
shake-up, is a major shareholder and manager. Lonrho's 45 per cent stake
will be cut to 43.1 per cent.
Trevor Steel of the Mercury Gold and General fund, the top performer in its
sector last year, pointed out recently that the Ashanti float had put the
spotlight on Ghanaian gold and resulted in a re-rating of smaller companies
there. Even so, it was still possible to buy Australia's Golden Shamrock for
Dollars 53 an ounce of gold in the ground, and Pioneer Group for Dollars 35.
Nevertheless, there remains great enthusiasm for Ashanti. Lindsey Falconer,
at Ord Minnett, says: 'Emerging market funds will be interested in the
shares and Ashanti will be eligible for immediate inclusion in the new
Financial Times gold index. Assuming a price of Dollars 20 a share or less,
we expect good performance from the shares after listing.'
The mechanics of the issue are complex and only 5 per cent has been
allocated for private investors. The two intermediaries involved closed
their books yesterday.

FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: High cost of a lump sum - Company's
policy demand would have cost Gary Mead Pounds 11,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have a small lump on the skin of my right calf muscle. It has been there
more than a decade and has never caused me the slightest trouble. It has
always been the same size and has been inspected and diagnosed as benign by
at least four general practitioners.
As lumps go, it is strictly in the minor league - so why should it cost me
an additional Pounds 10,740 premium on a critical illness endowment policy,
taken out to cover a mortgage on a new house? It is a question for which I
still do not have a good answer.
Perhaps most alarming, my experience reveals the arbitrary nature of
underwriting and the lack of an agreed set of standards for insurers to
operate by.
In October 1993, we decided to buy a house using an endowment mortgage. Our
financial adviser proposed using Scottish Amicable - on the basis of
reputation, not price; in that regard, there was little to choose between
several of the major companies - and, on November 4, we applied for one of
its 'critical protection' policies. This pays off the loan if the borrower
gets any of several potentially terminal illnesses.
By late January, we had everything in place for an exchange of contracts -
but there was still no word from the company. We were holding up a sizeable
chain and were worried the house might be lost. So, I rang to discover the
reason for the hold-up.
Initially, the company blamed my former GP for failing to respond quickly to
its medical questions about me. But then I found out that while my wife had
been cleared for the critical protection option, I had not.
Why? Because of medical privacy regulations, Scottish Amicable could not
tell me. It said it would report to my GP.
In the end, I learnt - from a Scottish Amicable manager - that the hold-up
was related to the small growth on my right leg. I told the company I was
happy to be examined by its chief medical officer, or to have the cyst
removed if need be.
The company told me to go back to my GP and be re-examined. Once again, he
pronounced the cyst benign. I imagined our problems were over. Silly me.
By now, our financial adviser had suggested applying for policies -
including critical cover - to two other companies. I did so - and was then
staggered to be told that Scottish Amicable would grant me critical cover,
but only if I paid an additional monthly premium amounting to Pounds 10,740
over the 25 years of the policy.
It had taken Scottish Amicable almost three months to arrive at this
decision. Yet, within two days of receiving our application, Legal &amp; General
had approved it - with no extra premium.
How to explain such vastly different attitudes from superficially similar
insurance companies with the same information? I can assume only that, at
some level in Scottish Amicable, there is an assumption that people
desperate to exchange contracts on homes will cave in easily.
If so, it is not a very amicable policy at all.

FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Gilts regain some gloss - Government
bonds have had a rocky year. Sara Webb explains why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gilt investors have had a nasty shock, given the sharp fall in the UK
government bond market so far this year. But private investors who own gilts
should keep their cool, while those wondering how to obtain a relatively
high income might again consider buying gilts now that yields have bounced
back to such high levels.
The shake-out in the gilt market in 1994 has taken many people by surprise.
The decline in inflation during the 1990s paved the way for a gradual
lowering of UK interest rates, prompting a rally in gilt prices and an
accompanying decline in yields.
By the end of 1993, yields had reached a low and many investors and analysts
were wondering if scope remained for further cuts in the base rate or
whether the rally was running out of steam. In fact, during the first
quarter of 1994, the gilt market has tumbled for a variety of factors.
John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds, says: 'Bond markets were
ready for a correction: based on fundamentals, gilts were looking expensive
and there was an excessive degree of optimism in the market.'
Second, the US Federal Reserve sent a shock wave through the world financial
markets by raising short-term interest rates on February 4, and again on
March 22. This action was meant as a pre-emptive strike against inflation as
US economic growth gathered pace. But it led to a sharp sell-off in US
Treasury bonds and in European government bond markets.
A further reason was the fickle nature of many big investors who pulled out
when things turned sour. The UK government's large borrowing programme
required heavy gilt sales by the Bank of England last year. Instead of going
into pension and insurance funds which, traditionally, take a longer-term
view, Kendall says: 'A high proportion of those gilts went into loose hands,
such as proprietary trading desks, banks, even some companies.'
The effect on the gilt market has been devastating, with long-dated issues
doing worst: 20-year stocks have lost about 10 per cent so far this year in
capital and income combined, while 10-year stocks have lost about 7 per
cent.
So what should private investors do?
If you own gilts already, and have seen a sharp fall in the value of your
stocks, you should probably sit tight. Gilts are redeemed at par (100) so
you will get back the face value of the bond at the maturity date.
If you bought the bonds above par, though, you will incur a capital loss.
And the problem is that losses on gilts cannot be used to offset capital
gains elsewhere.
The shake-out in the gilt market and the rise in yields could mean that this
is a good time to buy stock and lock into high yields. 'Gilts look
attractive now, since there should be a recovery in the market over the
coming months', says Peter Tonkin, investment director at Towry Law
Financial Planning.
Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, adds: 'If you think
the UK is going to see high economic growth and a pick-up in inflation,
don't bother with gilts. But if you think inflation will be subdued or that
economic growth will be sluggish, then gilt yields are implausibly high.'
The March inflation figures, announced yesterday, confirm that inflation
remains under control, with the underlying rate at its lowest for 25 years.
Some bond analysts believe this should give the Bank of England room for
another cut in the base rate.
And the release of minutes from the February meeting between chancellor
Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George indicate that the
authorities were prepared to consider a rate cut if inflation stayed low and
the recovery appeared weak.
As for exactly when investors should enter the gilt market, the timing could
prove difficult. Kendall says: 'It might be too soon to buy the market at
the moment: yields are attractive, but they could well rise above these
levels and this might not necessarily be the bottom of the market.' Kendall
also feels it could be better to lock into 1996 maturities rather than very
long-dated issues because of future political risk.
But Briscoe points out that while short-dated gilts are less risky, 'if you
really think inflation is under control and will continue to fall, then you
will see better gains at the long end.'

FT  16 APR 94 / The Week Ahead: Chunnel's misplaced optimism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The numbers Eurotunnel will unveil for 1993 on Thursday will be largely
academic but it must have hoped it could announce revenues from the first
few months of operations. A full freight and passenger service will not now
be running before September/October, a delay which is costing Eurotunnel
tens of millions of pounds a month. Projected revenues of Pounds 224m for
this year now look hopelessly over-optimistic. But if the past year has
disappointed in this regard, at least considerable progress has been made
towards resolving the many disputes which have affected the project.
Morgan Crucible, the speciality materials group, is forecast on Monday to
report full-year. pre-tax profits up from Pounds 61.3m to between Pounds 63m
and Pounds 65m. The thermal ceramics business will have suffered badly from
the recession in continental Europe but the group figures will be boosted by
currency movements, recovery in the US, and growth in East Asia. On
Thursday, SmithKline Beecham reports results for its first quarter - which
might also be the best quarter of the year as the US patent on ulcer drug
Tagamet expires next month. First quarter pre-tax profits should be Pounds
347m, up 13 per cent on last time. This month's income tax increases are
expected to dominate the results of the raft of small retailers - such as
Etam, Bentalls, Austin Reed, Tie Rack and Liberty - which are reporting next
week. But it might still be a bit too early to get any meaningful
indications from the present trading statements. Most company observers will
be waiting for Sears' results on April 26.
Etam, the fashion clothing company, will be the most closely examined of
those reporting. It is expected to show a 33 per cent pre-tax profits
advance to about Pounds 14.5m, excluding property losses.

FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: How falling funds sank the greedy
stags - Speculators intended to make a killing from investment trust
launches this year. Instead, says Bethan Hutton, they have taken a beating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The investment trust stags who bounded into action at the peak of the recent
market surge in new issues may be feeling bruised and bewildered. All but a
handful of the trusts launched this year are trading now at less than their
issue price, and the few that have risen were not issues that attracted many
private investors.
Stags are a top-of-the-market phenomenon: they buy new issues intending to
unload them at a profit in the first few days of trading. They were out in
force for the launches earlier this year of the two biggest new investment
trusts yet: the Kleinwort European Privatisation trust, which raised Pounds
500m, and the Mercury European Privatisation fund, which raised Pounds 575m.
Many private investors developed a taste for stagging when British Telecom,
British Gas and the others were privatised in the 1980s. The government was
keen for the issues to do well, so the shares were priced very cheaply.
People snapped them up - and a large number unloaded them immediately,
making handsome profits.
Perhaps it was the word 'privatisation' in the titles that made people think
the Kleinwort and Mercury funds could be stagged. Perhaps it was just that
the last few trusts hyped to the same extent went to a premium as soon as
they started trading.
In any case, a surprising number of investors seem to have thought they
could outwit the market and make a quick profit on these two trusts. They
were wrong.
The problem with stagging investment trusts is that, generally, when you buy
shares in one that has just been launched, these are not backed by assets -
unlike the flotation of BT and the rest. There is only the cash put up by
you and other investors, less the expenses of making the issue - often about
4 per cent.
So, for every Pounds 1 of shares you buy, you end up on the first day of
trading with a piece of paper backed by 96p in cash. There can be no pricing
anomalies.
It is, of course, possible occasionally to stag an investment trust issue
successfully. When an issue is oversubscribed heavily, shares shoot to a
premium as investors whose applications were scaled back scramble to buy
more on the open market.
The Kleinwort trust was oversubscribed massively - Pounds 360m of investors'
money was turned away - but its near-identical twin, the Mercury fund, was
following close behind and mopping up the overflowing funds. By the time
both trusts hit the market, most people who wanted shares had got them
already.
The timing was also impeccably awful. The public offer for the Kleinwort
fund spanned the peak of the surge when investors were pouring money into
new trusts at an unprecedented rate. But the first day of trading in the
shares was February 9 - the week that a US interest rate rise rattled world
markets. And the Mercury shares came to market a month later when the
climate was distinctly chillier.
Subscribers to the Kleinwort trust who were very quick off the mark and sold
within the first few days might just have made a profit after allowing for
dealing costs. But any stag greedy (or optimistic) enough to hold on a
little longer, hoping that the share price would take an upward turn, has
been disappointed. Later sellers would certainly have made a loss.
Would-be stags of the Mercury fund did not stand a chance: packages of
shares and warrants opened at a slight discount and slid further.
The discount on the Kleinwort shares is exaggerated by their part-paid
structure. Investors had to pay only 250p up front for a package of five
shares and a warrant, with the remaining 250p due in August.
The shares were trading this week at 38p and the warrants at 31.25p, so
221.25p for the package - a discount of 11.5 per cent on the issue price.
The cash discount - 28.75p - would probably be similar if the full 500p had
been paid, making it smaller in percentage terms - about 5.75 per cent.
Timing is all-important. One of the most popular new investment trust issues
earlier in the market surge was the Fleming Chinese fund. It went to an
immediate premium, so early sellers made a profit. The share price zoomed
upwards until the Hong Kong stock market caught a cold, and has since come
back to around the issue price.
At one stage, if you had sold shares in Fleming Chinese after buying them in
the public offer, you would have made a profit of more than 50 per cent. But
if you held on, you would now be back where you started.
Discounts
The average investment trust discount hit its narrowest point in January and
has widened since (see graph). But it is still very narrow by the standards
of the past few years. Early in the 1980s, discounts of 25 or 30 per cent
were common.
The shifting level of investment trust discounts tends to magnify the effect
of any market changes. In a rising market, a share's asset value will
increase, more people want to buy it and its discount narrows, adding to the
profits. When the market turns down, asset values drop and people want to
sell - so the discount widens and losses expand.
Take, for example, a share with a net asset value of 100p that is trading at
95p, a discount of 5 per cent. If the underlying market falls by 10 per
cent, the asset value is likely also to fall by a similar amount, to 90p.
If the discount remains steady at 5 per cent, the share would then sell for
85.5p - a loss of 9.5p, or 10 per cent. But if, as is likely, the discount
widened at the same time to, say, 10 per cent, the share would then be
priced at 81p - a loss of 14p, or 14.7 per cent.
So those who bought emerging markets' investment trusts at a premium before
many of the Far Eastern markets took a tumble will now be affected not only
by the loss in asset value but also by the shift from premium to discount.
The point to remember is that this is a two-way process - what goes down can
go back up, and down, and up again. But then, no one ever promised a smooth
ride to investors in any stock market, particularly emerging markets.
Opportunities
Nigel Sidebottom, a private client fund manager with stockbroker Gerrard
Vivian Gray, says: 'I think what this sort of shake-out shows is that
investment trusts can be more volatile when markets are contracting. You can
get not only asset values dropping but discounts widening - but that can
throw up opportunities for the fleet of foot.'
As for opportunities now, he recommends some of the emerging-market trusts
which have lost their long-standing premiums, and also the Lloyd's trusts -
relative newcomers which invest in the Lloyd's insurance market and have
fallen back recently. But random movements in a volatile market mean that
other opportunities can spring up for short periods if you keep your eyes
open.
Reality has now returned to the investment trust market. New issues continue
to appear, but they are raising more modest amounts of money and having to
work harder to get it. More are falling short of their targets (see table).
A calming-down period, and some time for the market to absorb the new money,
can only be healthy. Long-term investors seeking value are no longer priced
out of the market. And the stags can retreat to lick their wounds until the
next market surge.

FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: Concession on CGT losses - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has made a last minute concession to individual investors on
the indexation of capital gains tax losses. It will allow up to Pounds
10,000 of losses caused by indexation between 30 November 1993 and 5 April
1995 for CGT purposes. This will benefit investors with unrelieved capital
gains. Anyone paying higher rate tax and with Pounds 10,000 of unrelieved
gains stands to save Pounds 4,000 tax in 1993-4, 1994-5. (See page IX).

FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: House prices rises - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Quarterly figures for the Halifax house price index show a rise of 1.8 per
cent in the first three months of this year. The year-on-year figure shows a
rise of 2.6 per cent, against a year-on-year rise of 3.8 per cent reported
in March.
The Halifax says this is further evidence of a continued gentle recovery in
house prices, and it predicts an increase of about 5 per cent during 1994.
A regional breakdown of statistics reveals that prices fell in several
regions during the first quarter. Most of these falls were small, but prices
in the North West fell back by 1.1 per cent, and in East Anglia by 1.3 per
cent. However, East Anglia saw an annual increase of 4.3 per cent, while the
figure for the North West was 1.3 per cent, and the annual increase in the
West Midlands was only 0.2 per cent.

FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: Stock prospectors wary of oil - Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock market investors keen to have a flutter on the oil price usually look
beyond the big, integrated oil majors such as British Petroleum and Shell to
smaller exploration and production stocks.
This week one of the largest companies in the sector, Lasmo, announced a
deeply discounted Pounds 219m rights issue to shore up a balance sheet
ravaged by a Pounds 794m debt. Management said strong operating cash flows
have been undermined by the steep fall in oil prices over the past year, to
current average levels Dollars 13-Dollars 14 a barrel for the benchmark
Brent Blend. Price weakness called into question the company's ability to
carry out its ambitious plans to cut its high-cost production base by
developing low-cost oil and gas reserves.
Analysts have long considered Lasmo the company in the exploration /
production sector most vulnerable to weak oil prices. Its agony as oil
prices plumeted over the past year has been marked by a trail of casualties:
in early 1993 it dropped Chris Greentree as chief executive in favour of Joe
Darby. Changes have also been made to its finance director and non-executive
chairman.
In addition its shares were among the worst performers in 1993 and it passed
its final dividend last month.
Investors may therefore be wondering whether Lasmo's plight is unique, or a
sign that similar troubles might spread to other companies in the sector.
After all, as the chart shows, the performance of the exploration and
production sector has been relatively resilient in recent months in spite of
oil prices falling to five-year lows. Furthermore, asset values in the
sector do not fully reflect oil prices at recent lows.
Analysts have mixed views on the sector, but most agree that Lasmo's case is
unique in at least one crucial sense; its investment cycle and therefore its
debt load is seriously out of synch with the oil price.
The company is entering a two-year period of large-scale development
commitments for schemes such as Liverpool Bay, a big natural gas project
which will generate significant cash after 1996. It already had financing
for Liverpool Bay and other projects, but at current prices Lasmo's
high-cost production profile makes the company unprofitable.
Analysts say a successful rights issue will give Lasmo the breathing space
it needs over the next two years.
Other exploration companies have also seen their cash flow suffer because of
weak oil prices. But most, including Enterprise, the biggest independent
explorer, find themselves at more comfortable points in the capital
investment cycle.
Does the sector deserve its relatively high valuation given the continuing
uncertainty over oil price? Brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull think
not. In a recount report they argue that investors are perpetually
over-optimistic about oil price trends: 'Equity investors . . . have been
only too keen to pay over the odds in order to acquire oil and gas reserves
via the stock market at prices which the oil and gas industry itself has not
been prepared to pay.'
The brokers add that the 'anomaly between stockmarket versus industry
reserve valuation obviously creates good opportunities for energy companies
to raise finance in the equity markets.'
Other analysts disagree. They point to recent asset sales in the North Sea
which valued reserves at Dollars 15-Dollars 17 a barrel, proof they say,
that the industry believes current prices are not a realistic long-term
prospect.
But for private investors the attractiveness of a flutter on the sector
still rests on whether they think the oil price will increase, and whether
they feel lucky.

FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: JFK: the hidden force moving the Dow - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When facts are scarce, superstition tends to fill the vacuum: and in the
absence of any clear indication of which way the US stock market is headed
next, Wall Street is being entertained by a number of more-or-less crackpot
theories purporting to forecast trends.
One of the more enchanting propositions to have been aired this week was the
one that pointed to an astonishing parallel (shown in the chart above right)
between the market's performance since Bill Clinton's election as president
and its behaviour during John F Kennedy first years in office.
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the securities house First Albany,
pointed out in a Wall Street Journal article on Thursday that both Clinton
and Kennedy were young, untested Democrats and in both cases, stocks slid
during the election campaigns as investors braced themselves for an adverse
change in the financial climate.
Yet in each case, stocks pulled out of their decline shortly before the
election and rose steeply during the presidents' first year. Then, near the
end of the first year, the trend came abruptly to a halt, and decline set
in.
In the second year of the Kennedy administration stocks slid steadily from
March to June, so if history continued to repeat itself, today's market
could expect a good deal more of a drubbing before the next upturn. Indeed,
Ned Davis, the Florida market researcher who first remarked on the parallel,
thinks the downturn will be even worse this time because peak valuations are
higher.
Is it all nonsense? Sooner or later, these parallels usually break down. But
Johnson points out that there are similarities in the fundamentals, too. In
both cases, the economy was improving after a recession, the stock market
had just had an unusually strong decade, and the Federal Reserve was leaning
towards restraint.
Parallels notwithstanding, some analysts at least cling to the hope that the
first-quarter earnings figures will give the market a lift as investors see
how quickly corporate profits are rising. But even that hope looked forlorn
when Motorola, the electronics and semiconductor company, brought out its
figures on Monday.
Continuing last year's rapid growth, Motorola reported net profits of
Dollars 298m for the quarter, an increase of no less than 46 per cent from
the comparable period. But even that was not enough for a jaded market:
investors decided it was time to take profits and flee, prompting a run on
the technology sector as a whole.
In one sense, you can hardly blame them when you look at the fragility of
the profits reported by companies hitherto regarded as bastions of
integrity. Two of the biggest companies in the US this week confessed to
bizarre goings-on that affected their bottom lines.
One was Woolworth, the five-and-dime store operator that is trying to
transform itself into a niche retailer with subsidiaries such as the Foot
Locker sports shoe chain. After earlier warning that it had launched an
investigation into the accuracy of last year's quarterly figures, it
confirmed on Wednesday that the tiny profits it reported for the first two
quarters were illusory.
The explanation, it seems, is that costs which should properly have been
taken in the first two quarters were actually deferred until later in the
year. Still to emerge is whether it was done accidentally or on purpose, and
how many heads will roll. But if a company of Woolworth's stature cannot be
relied upon to report its figures properly, who can investors trust?
The Woolworth announcement came only a day after Procter &amp; Gamble, the
consumer products giant, announced that it would be taking a charge of
Dollars 102m to net profits in its quarterly results to cover its losses on
two highly-leveraged interest-rate swap contracts that came unstuck when
interest rates rose in the US and Germany.
It is one thing for Wall Street investment firms or hedge fund operators
such as George Soros to gamble away hundreds of millions of dollars by
speculating on high-risk financial derivatives, but investors may feel
things have gone too far when a soap and nappy manufacturer starts getting
involved, too.
Procter &amp; Gamble said it was terribly sorry and would not do it again,
'reassigned' its treasurer, and said it was considering legal action against
its financial adviser, Bankers Trust. But it was all a case of shutting the
door after the horse had bolted, as far as shareholders were concerned.
Years ago, when Procter &amp; Gamble launched the world's first fluoride
toothpaste under the brand name Crest, it coined the famous slogan: 'Look,
Mom - no cavities]' If only the same could be said of its profits today.

FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: For this relief - some thanks - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two cheers] The government's belated and partial climb-down on capital gains
tax indexation losses is a blow for fairness and common sense. The proposal
in the November Budget means you can still adjust the base cost of gains to
allow for inflation, but you cannot similarly adjust losses or turn a
nominal gain into an inflation-adjusted loss. This new discrimination
undermines one of the basic objectives of stock market investment: managing
a portfolio in which the winners outstrip the inevitable losers.
This week's proposed concession, allowing individual investors to index up
to Pounds 10,000 of losses over 1993-94 and 1994-95 will be a boon to people
sufferring an embarrassment of unrelieved gains. (See page IX for the
precise mechanics).
Just one gripe. Would it not have been even fairer to cancel the proposal
altogether as far as individual investors are concerned? After all, it was
abuse by companies, not individuals, which prompted the Budget move in the
first place.
Now let us look another gift horse in the mouth. Why is it that the
competitive price-cutting in the personal equity plan market has focused on
initial, not annual, charges?
Several unit trust managers have cut or eliminated the initial charges on
Peps, the fastest-growing part of the market. Annual charges have not been
cut; indeed, they have in some cases been increased. But it is annual
charges which make the bigger dent in the long-term return on your
investments. This is particularly true for income funds, especially in a
low-inflation, low interest-rate climate.
Take, for example, an annual charge of just 1.5 per cent - quite common for
Peps. It can knock more than a quarter off the value of your investment in
just 20 years. And it is surprising how fast a fund which combines an
initial charge with a relatively modest annual charge will catch up with a
'no load' fund with a higher annual levy.
Our chart* shows what might happen to a couple of funds with different
charging structures over a 20-year period. The first is M&amp;G Managed Income,
a Pep which trumpets the fact that it has no initial charge. But it does
have penalties for early surrender and a 1.5 per cent annual levy. The
second is M&amp;G Dividend, which has a conventional 5 per cent initial charge
coupled with an annual charge of only 0.75 per cent. We did not fuss about
minor charges and have assumed growth of 6 per cent a year. After six years,
the fund with an initial charge has caught up with its 'no-load' rival;
after 20, it has outstripped it comfortably.
What makes this particular comparison interesting is that M&amp;G Dividend is
one of the funds in which M&amp;G Managed Income invests. Unless Income excels,
you would be better off in the Dividend fund.
Not that M&amp;G's annual charges are unusually high. And, to set our example
into context, we have made similar projections for one of the
highest-charging funds in the business. Knight Williams, which sells mainly
to elderly people, levies an initial 6.375 per cent on its funds and has an
annual charge of 2.5 per cent. Together, these charges eat up more than 40
per cent of your investment over the 20 years. But, again, it is the
above-average annual charge that does most damage in the long term.
What is obnoxious is not high charges as such but high charges not justified
by good performance. A system of charging more common abroad than in Britain
is performance-linking. This has a low basic annual fee, which moves up to a
higher level if - and only if - the fund's investment performance tops some
yardstick. It is a sensible formula for funds aiming to achieve capital
growth.
Why is it that so many annual fees have been creeping up? One common answer
is that they are needed to keep the financial advisers sweet. Most fund
management groups pay advisers initial commissions on Pep sales of 3 per
cent plus renewal commissions of 0.5 per cent. Why? Because most fund
management groups rely heavily on the advisers for sales.
One sizeable group, Newton, has stood out against the demand for renewal
commissions and got away with it. But, then, it does have a rather good
performance record. Its annual charges are only 1.25 per cent, with one
exception: it charges 1.5 per cent on the one fund for which it does pay a
renewal commission.
Here is one final sum on which to reflect. If we had drawn a line for 'Total
commission to financial adviser' on our chart, it would have mopped up 12.5
per cent of your investment over the 20-year period. We do hope he is worth
it.

FT  16 APR 94 / Markets: Fretful City distrusts even good news - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing better indicates the mood of the City of London than its response to
unexpected developments. When traders are upbeat - as they were during the
market's surge at the turn of the year - bad news is shrugged off, on the
basis it merely demonstrates further scope for improvement.
When sentiment is less bullish, even apparently positive moves can cause
unease. So it was on Thursday, when the Bundesbank unexpectedly lowered
Germany's key interest rates. An already weak FTSE 100 dipped even further
and although it later clawed back some ground, it still closed 14 points
down on a day which one might have expected to be good for equities.
That fall was more than recovered yesterday when hopes of lower UK interest
rates were revived by news that last months's underlying annual inflation
rate fell from 2.8 to 2.4 per cent - its lowest figure since 1967, and much
better than had been expected in the City.
One striking factor is that the markets fear interest rates on both sides of
the Atlantic are near the bottom of their long-term cycle - so any reduction
merely makes it more likely that the next movement will be upwards.
This determination to look on the gloomy side does not just contrast with
the feverish mood up until February - it also seems a long way removed from
the outlook of many executives.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, says companies are highly
optimistic about prospects for increased sales and new orders, in spite of
fears that this year's tax increases might damage the recovery. The charts
shows that the balance of companies expecting an increase in net sales over
the next three months is 60 per cent - its highest level since the second
quarter of 1989.
The recent corporate reporting season has also delivered some pleasant
surprises. Analysts at NatWest Securities say that of the 157 large
companies to have presented results since February, a balance of 30 were
ahead of market expectations.
Blue Circle Industries and RMC Group, which respectively dominate the
British market for cement and ready-mixed concrete, both confirmed the
strength of the recovery in construction by reporting profits above
expectations. The continuing buoyancy of the German building market
particularly helped RMC, while Blue Circle has resumed exports to the US for
the first time in several years.
Forte, the hotel and restaurant group, said it was seeing an increase in
business from corporate customers, although UK consumer spending was still
fragile. This upbeat note partly offset disappointment that the group wrote
down the value of its net assets by Pounds 412m to Pounds 3.4bn, after
revaluing its properties.
A fear haunting the market in recent months has been that Britain's famously
profitable supermarkets might be facing historic decline. They are under
attack from aggressive discount retailers and have started to writedown and
depreciate their expensive buildings.
Some reassurance came from Tesco, the UK's second-biggest grocery retailer,
which reported a drop in pre-tax profits but said the underlying profits
were level. Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said gross profit margins had been
forced down significantly last year, but had recently shown a pleasing
improvement.
Tesco had stemmed the flow of customers to the new generation of cut-price
discounters, such as Germany's Aldi and Denmark's Netto, by introducing 100
basic products at very low prices. Sir Ian said: 'The competition is not
going to get any easier. But it's not all about price. It is about quality,
service and convenience as well.'
The lesson that companies do not have to sell solely on price had already
been hammered home by Burmah Castrol, which increased pre-tax profits in
spite of continuing lack of demand for its fuels and chemicals businesses.
Burmah's lubricants business increased its market share sharply in a
shrinking global market, mainly thanks to marketing which reached record
levels. The group has even persuaded some US motorists to pay Dollars 4 a
quart for synthetic oil, compared with the Dollars 1.25 they are used to
paying for ordinary stuff.
Another UK business hoping that Americans and other foreigners will be
willing to pay top prices is Hamleys, the famous but expensive toy shop in
London's Regent Street which plans to come to the market with a
capitalisation of about Pounds 40m.
Hamleys was founded in 1760, and about 50 per cent of its customers are
tourists. The management wants to capitalise on the Hamleys name and has
opened outlets in London's Covent Garden and Heathrow's Terminal 4. Sceptics
doubt whether Hamleys will be able to charge such stiff prices outside its
admittedly marvellous flagship store - particularly in a sector where
retailers such as the US group Toys-R-Us have discounted prices.
This question of what constitutes value for money goes to the heart of the
apparent contradiction between stock market nervousness and growing business
confidence. Partly it is just timing: the market had already priced in a
recovery, and is now more concerned about the likelihood that interest rates
will start rising again, even if the UK rates can be nudged down a shade
more.
In spite of its 10 per cent drop from February's peak, the FTSE 100 does
seem to have found a floor at about 3,100. While the market's optimism
seemed extreme at the beginning of the year, the recent swing in sentiment
looks equally overdone. If the current fretting over interest rates settles
down, a significant advance from this level is possible.

FT  16 APR 94 / The Long View: A hedger's honeymoon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I figured there would never be another bonus like it,' said Steve the
strategist, 'so I banked it and moved on.' I could tell that Steve's
circumstances had changed: his normal fat and bulging briefcase had gone,
and all through lunch he failed to produce a single document or complain
about his global seminar schedule.
'You know I hate to follow the crowd,' he said eventually, 'but I'm afraid
this time I've jumped on a bandwagon. I've joined a new hedge fund. You know
the sort of thing, British Virgin Islands registration, pseudo-Latin name,
half the investors from Colombia, Dollars 250,000 minimum, no questions
asked. We take 20 per cent of the upside, they take 100 per cent of the
downside.'
Hedge funds did not appear to be getting a very good press, I remarked. Did
it not worry the investors that regulators might start to crack down?
'No chance, it's great free publicity' said Steve. 'Every story about a
congressional committee grilling George Soros or the Bundesbank warning
about chaos produced by hedge funds only whets the appetites of our punters.
Remember, even if they're not cocaine runners most of them take pride in
never paying a penny in tax. The idea of making billions out of central
banks, like Bank Negara of Malaysia has just admitted losing over Dollars 5
1/2 bn on currencies in two years, is irresistible.'
In fact, I said, the controversy must have usefully diverted attention from
the awkward fact that many of the hedge funds lost 15 or 20 per cent of
their assets in the global bond market crash in February and March. It
seemed odd that so many new hedge funds should now be finding support.
Last year's boom was bound to attract new entrants, explained Steve. The
successful, established hedge funds were all closed, in fact some were
returning capital so as to stay a manageable size. Therefore new investors
had to go into start-up funds without track records. Likewise the banks,
desperate to find lending opportunities, had to agree to leverage up
newcomers or see their business shrink.
It sounded, I said, like a formula for disaster. According to the efficient
markets hypothesis hedge funds should not succeed anyway. Even if you
accepted that there were a few geniuses around, who could flout the odds,
you could hardly believe that dozens more could suddenly start up and keep
winning. In fact, some intermediaries were now monitoring 800 hedge funds.
'Forget efficient markets,' said Steve. 'The concept was invented by college
professors and exploited by bank trust departments to sell no-brainer index
funds because they couldn't beat the S &amp; P 500. Anyway, nobody ever denied
that inefficiencies exist. Remember that the original hedge fund label was
devised because such funds could go short as well as long. Why be one of 99
investors looking for cheap stocks when you could be all on your own hunting
expensive ones? Why be forced to show negative returns in a bear market?
Nowadays, of course, hedge funds are really leveraged funds, multiplying the
risk, but able to cut it quickly in all significant markets because of the
growth of liquid markets in derivatives.'
The big way of winning, Steve said, was to latch on to an enduring trend,
such as the bull markets in European bonds or Hong Kong stocks last year.
You would always be top-sliced at the turn, as the hedge funds had been this
winter, but you would only lose a fraction of the earlier gains. But where
markets were only ranging rather than trending it was much harder to make
money.
'Right now,' said Steve, 'we see the big opportunities as being in the
exploitation of political risk. Remember that the mainstream investor
universe out there is risk-averse, it doesn't want to have to explain to its
boards of trustees why it is exposed to South Africa or Mexico when there
are massacres in the streets and assassinations. Therefore risk, so long as
you diversify it and control it, is fundamentally over-rewarded.
'I should know, I'm talking about my old client base, which operated
according to benchmarks which depended on relative market size. The more
expensive that Tokyo equities became in the 1980s the more you were supposed
to hold. Worse, the benchmark could be redrawn without warning. In 1992
Salomon Brothers suddenly put Italian bonds into its World Government Bond
Index and the sheep had to buy lire exposure. Imagine the relief now of
having no benchmark. We're running a race against one-legged rivals.'
It couldn't be quite as easy as that, I suggested. There was certainly
plenty of political turmoil around the world: Italy had just spectacularly
overthrown the old order, other European leaders like Helmut Kohl and John
Major were threatened, and even Bill Clinton was under a cloud. But the
political crisis in Japan had actually led to a strengthening of the yen
against the dollar, a move that had stung several of the hedge funds badly.
This week, despite the exit of Hosokawa, the Nikkei Dow had moved above
20,000. If John Major were forced to resign in the UK would he be a buyer or
seller?
'Both,' said Steve, 'but at different times. We are contrarians, we buy
uncertainty and sell confidence. Regular elections are another question. But
in the classic unscheduled resignation play we are in and out twice. We buy
into the initial political crisis, then sell into the rally that follows the
resignation. When the new leader takes power there's a sell-off, allowing us
to buy and hold for the political honeymoon. Then a few months later we'll
be out again - Balladur is still a good short, for example - and off to the
next crisis somewhere else, there's no shortage.'
I left Steve plotting a tour of the world's trouble spots. I wish him well,
but his spiel was always so much better than his forecasts. And I will miss
his slide shows.

FT  16 APR 94 / Defiant Bosnian Serbs blast into Gorazde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bosnian Serbs, defying western air power and diplomatic pressure,
blasted their way into the town of Gorazde last night and urged its Moslem
defenders to surrender.
Senior US officials, who held an emergency meeting in Washington to discuss
the enclave's virtual collapse, said the Serbs were in control of all
strategic points.
One member of Britain's elite Special Air Services died in hospital after
being evacuated from Gorazde by helicopter with serious wounds, while
another injured British soldier remained in the town after the rescue
mission treated him.
The other United Nations personnel in the town, believed to number about 14,
were taking shelter in the besieged city centre as UN authorities considered
ways to ensure their safety.
The Bosnian Serb army said it would guarantee the safety of any of Gorazde's
65,000 residents who took refuge behind its lines. This amounted to an
ultimatum to civilians to leave the city centre.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy in former Yugoslavia, told Bosnia's
Moslem leaders, who were furious over the collapse of Gorazde, that the UN
had considered ordering fresh air strikes against the Serbs but dropped the
idea after the wounded soldier was evacuated.
Mr Akashi made clear the rescue mission had been possible only because of a
short-lived ceasefire arrangement with the Serbs.
The collapse of Gorazde represents a massive blow to the prestige of the
western governments which had declared the town a safe area and pledged to
protect UN personnel.
The attackers' success in Gorazde brings them within striking distance of
their long-standing aim of linking eastern Bosnia with Serbia.
Earlier, a French jet circling Gorazde was hit in the tail by anti-aircraft
guns but managed to return safely to the aircraft carrier Clemenceau in the
Adriatic. The Bosnian Serbs denied firing on the aircraft, although they had
earlier issued threats to shoot down Nato aircraft.
The Serb stranglehold on Gorazde forced waves of local inhabitants to flee
from outlying villages into the town centre. Many of the enclave's 65,000
inhabitants are already refugees.
Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, said he hoped the Serb action
was not a 'prelude to more vigorous military action elsewhere'.
The US said last night it was sending extra troops to the former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia, bringing its presence there to about 500, but it has
made clear it will not send ground troops to Bosnia unless there is an
overall settlement.

FT  16 APR 94 / Directors may avoid forced disclosure of options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Company directors will almost certainly be able to keep details of their
share options secret because plans for greater disclosure have been caught
in a legal loophole.
A proposed new accounting standard that would have forced publication in
annual reports of the number and price of options granted to directors has
been jeopardised because of difficulties in developing a satisfactory method
of valuation.
The standard, which has provoked considerable controversy and debate between
companies and shareholders, was due to be circulated as a draft next month
by the urgent issues taskforce of the Accounting Standards Board.
Members of the taskforce had approved the text of a standard that would have
required a table showing in total and by director the number of options and
their exercise price.
However, legal advice recently obtained by the taskforce suggests that
company law requires disclosure of options only if they can be effectively
valued. Because they cannot, the lawyers say disclosure of option prices is
not necessary for compliance with the law.
The legal opinion is a severe blow to the efforts of the taskforce to push
for greater disclosure at a time when there is growing pressure for clearer
accountability of senior management and for their pay to be linked to
performance.
The opinion will also make it more difficult to fulfil the recommendations
for complete information on directors' remuneration made last year by the
Cadbury committee.
Similar reforms to boost disclosure of share options in annual reports are
in progress in the US, where the Financial Accounting Standards Board is
holding a series of public hearings.
The UK taskforce initially planned to follow the line of the US by placing a
value on the options, but concluded that there was no satisfactory formula
to provide a reliable valuation.

FT  16 APR 94 / Beleaguered Schneider files for bankruptcy: Vanished
entrepreneur's empire to be liquidated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Jurgen Schneider group, the German property empire plunged into crisis
last week after the disappearance of the company's founder and chief
executive, gave up its fight for survival yesterday and declared itself
insolvent.
The formal bankruptcy application for Jurgen Schneider AG, the company at
the heart of the vanished entrepreneur's property interests, was lodged
yesterday morning at the company's request in Konigstein, the town near
Frankfurt where Mr Schneider used to run his operations from a 19th-century
castle.
The application, which will lead to a creditors' meeting scheduled for May
17, came the day after more than 40 banks owed more than DM5bn (Pounds 2bn)
by the group convened for the first time to discuss the crisis. They decided
that the group had no viable future and pledged to undertake an orderly
liquidation of its property portfolio.
It emerged after the banks' meeting that unpaid debts to contractors and
other trade creditors amounted to an estimated DM250m. That is significantly
smaller than early estimates of several billion, but still threatens the
existence of hundreds of small businesses and thousands of jobs throughout
Germany.
The Economics Ministry in Bonn said that so far 50 companies in the
construction sector, employing 1,000 people, had said they were affected.
The company's cash resources are limited to DM5m.
Simultaneously, the Treuhand privatisation agency for former east German
state concerns said it would foreclose on debts of DM53m owed by Schneider.
Mr John Morgan, a property consultant advising three of the bank creditors
on behalf of DTZ Zadelhoff, said all the banks involved may face a total
loss of DM1.5bn.
He added: 'This is highly provisional, as there is no clear picture as yet.
Some properties can be sold at more than their book values but others can
only be got rid of at a substantial discount.'
The picture yesterday was one of confusion as bankers sought to justify the
scale of their loans to Mr Schneider while politicians fought to limit the
effects of the collapse on the small business sector, especially sensitive
during an election year.
Mr Dieter Vogel, government spokesman, called on banks to help small
companies overcome the crisis.
Bankers, however, emphasised that they wanted to limit the impact of the
company's failure on jobs and small businesses, while insisting that they
had no direct responsibility for the exposure of small businesses to
Schneider.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, the biggest creditor
with an exposure of more than DM1bn, said on a radio programme that trade
creditors had made good money from working for Schneider in the past and
that Deutsche was not responsible for their plight.

FT  16 APR 94 / Howard moves to protect confidential information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is to introduce legislation that will
crack down on industrial espionage and private surveillance by making it an
offence to gain information by deception.
The legislation, which could be introduced in the next session of
parliament, seeks to tighten the law covering the release of confidential
information, such as bank account, credit card and salary details, to
members of the public.
The new law would try to end a spate of recent events in which newspapers
and some private investigators have tried to embarrass public figures by
obtaining confidential details about them. In most cases, the information is
revealed because the investigator pretends to be someone else when
approaching banks or organisations.
A Home Office official said last night that Mr Howard was not planning to
insert the legislation in the Criminal Justice Bill that is going through
parliament, but would raise it later this year. 'The aim is to make it clear
that if you gain access to private information by deceiving someone, then
you are guilty of an offence,' the official said.
Under current law, it is an offence to offer someone money in return for
confidential information on a third party.
However, officials felt more action was needed, bearing in mind how easy it
can be to obtain personal financial details of a third party. Details of a
bank statement, for example, can often be obtained over the telephone simply
by citing the address of the account holder. Home Office officials said Mr
Howard had recently been concerned by the activities of an investigations
agency that tried to investigate Lord Ferrers, the Home Office minister. The
agency was asked to conduct its inquiries by a Sunday newspaper.
Earlier this year, Baroness Nicoll, a Labour peer, raised concerns that
several members of the House of Lords had received an offer to supply an
agency with 'details of personal telephone calls, of mortgage repayments, of
bank balances and of arrears on electricity and other bills'.
Last year, the Sun newspaper managed to obtain details of the credit card
account of Mr Norman Lamont, the then chancellor of the exchequer. However,
the way details were leaked has never been made clear.

FT  16 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Wembley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wembley's financial performance has been an action-packed game of two
halves. Competent midfield performances from assets like US greyhound racing
and Wembley stadium itself were cruelly undermined by the early own-goal of
taking on debt for expansion. The long slide into the relegation zone has
seen most of the company's supporters drift away. Now Wembley has been
rocked by asset write-downs of almost Pounds 100m, putting the company in
breach of its borrowing powers and, presumably, leaving its chairman
ashen-faced. Shareholders are being asked to approve changed powers by post,
perhaps for fear of trouble on the terraces if an extraordinary general
meeting were held.
Having disposed of sufficient assets to prevent the banks cutting the
company's defence to ribbons before half-time, Wembley needs to use the
interval to rethink tactics. It might be possible to stagger on with the
traditional debt, preference, and ordinary share formation, but it offers
little prospect of a sparkling earnings-filled second half. Nor would asking
for more money from the few remaining fans be popular, given the
management's poor record in the transfer market. A capital reconstruction
with banks swapping debt for equity would allow everyone to benefit from
future improved team performances. After the last few years, though, anyone
still in there must be as sick as a parrot.

FT  16 APR 94 / The Lex Column: BSN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's chairman, is renowned for sticking his fingers in
every pie in the French food industry. The fusion of BSN's prepared food
businesses with those of Saint Louis is another example of his deal-making
skills. The merged company, to be managed by BSN, will emerge as a powerful
competitor to Nestle and Unilever in one of the most attractive growth areas
in foods. Substantial cost savings should result from shaving a combined
FFr5bn raw materials bill. Further economies of scale should come in product
innovation and marketing. It may also help the rationalisation process at
the Vivagel frozen foods business, which BSN snapped up in December after
Unilever broke up Ortiz-Miko.
Saint Louis will be pleased to have solved a strategic dilemma. By itself,
its food business has a relatively weak market position and is facing
extreme competitive pressures. Saint Louis will retain a 34 per cent stake
in the merged venture. But it would be no surprise if BSN emerged with full
control once the stand-still agreement expires. By then, BSN should have got
to grips with the assets and know exactly how much they are worth.
The chief snag for BSN is that the deal further increases its exposure to
France just as it tries to tilt the business towards emerging markets.
Nestle and Unilever have both been active in developing countries for
decades and have established strong local businesses. It will take immense
management effort and financial resources for BSN to recapture lost ground.

FT  16 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a mixed week for long-suffering Lloyd's Names. The High Court
accepted that members agents responsible for mis-selling risky investments
should take responsibility for subsequent losses. While that ruling is
welcome, it could be difficult for most Names to prove that they were
similarly misled. Neither does the judgment have much impact on the larger
body of legal actions, which claim negligence among managing agents and
underwriters. For most Names, the chances of winning financial redress
through the courts have changed little.
More worrying is the growing number of managing agents cancelling Names'
participations in profitable syndicates. If it turns out that private
investors are being eased out to make way for corporate investors, Names
will lose the opportunity to cover past losses with future profits. It is
too early to be sure what is happening. Managing agents are concerned about
rule changes being considered by Lloyd's management. They say that giving
notice to Names leaves them greater room for manoeuvre.
But until pre-emption rights are introduced, probably next year, Names have
little protection. Even then, Names will have to fight for their rights to
any future profits. The new rules may allow agents to turn their syndicates
into, in effect, insurance companies at Lloyd's. But how the equity in such
companies would be divided between the managing agent, which provides the
expertise, and those who supply the capital remains an open question. The
issue of ownership will be hotly contested in the coming months.

FT  16 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Selling gilts cheap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even rose-tinted glasses are getting cheaper, according to yesterday's UK
retail prices data. A drop in the price of spectacles helped produce March's
0.3 per cent rise. But little rose-tinting is needed to distill a positive
message from the overall data. Upward pressure on prices remains generally
muted and there are welcome signs of easing inflation in the services
sector. Clear evidence of a weakening economy will be needed for a base rate
cut, especially now the Treasury has published details of the chancellor's
monthly discussions with the governor of the Bank. But the moment at which
the UK will have to start worrying about a US-style upturn in rates appears
to have been deferred.
That gave the gilts market heart ahead of the Bank's announcement that,
after last month's floating rate issue, it was reverting to the conventional
market for this month's auction. Still, its choice of a shortish maturity is
an indication that conditions remain fragile. The Bank obviously also hopes
that long rates will come down before it needs to tap that end of the
maturity spectrum.
One approach might have been to make the auction stock convertible into
longer-dated paper. Convertibles appeal when the market is uncertain which
way yields are heading. But if the Bank believes they have risen too far
this year, the risk is that it could be giving too much away with a
convertible. Against that background, its decision to continue funding short
makes sense. The risk remains, though, that its anxiety to pick the right
moment will prevent it locking in 25 or 30-year money at attractive rates,
even when the market recovers.

FT  16 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich up in delayed reaction
to rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Better news from the US helped bourses mount a gentle recovery, writes Our
Markets Staff.
ZURICH picked up the pace as industrials took advantage of the strength of
the dollar, and in a delayed reaction to Thursday's discount rate cut. The
SMI index rose 29.2 to 2,872.9, little changed on the week. Analysts noted,
however, that while the financial sector was firmer on the day, its
lacklustre performance in the wake of the SNB's move on rates indicated that
further market weakness could be in store next week.
Currency considerations helped Nestle SFr15 higher to SFr1,249: the group
reiterated its strategic interest in L'Oreal following the French cosmetics
group's announcement on Thursday of a restructuring of its holdings.
Ciba registered rose SFr15 to SFr945 ahead of Monday's first quarter sales
figures, and Roche certificates by SFr40 to SFr7,080 as analysts looked for
a rise of at least 20-30 per cent in 1993 earnings on Tuesday.
Strong cyclicals featured Brown Boveri, up SFr30 to SFr1,287 on London
buying. Oerlikon-Buhrle rose SFr7 to SFr168 and Alusuisse added SFr11 to
SFr656.
Against the trend, Sulzer lost SFr35 to SFr1,010 in further response to this
week's profits forecast.
FRANKFURT kicked effectively in the post-bourse for the first time in days,
the Ibis-indicated Dax climbing to 2,211.92 after a rise of just 1.71 to
2,200.42 on the official session which left it slightly down on the week.
Turnover rose from DM9.5bn to DM10.3bn. Even in the morning, Dax
constituents showed more of a pattern than in recent days, with the weakness
of banks on the Jurgen Schneider property situation more than balanced by
strength in automotive stocks.
The positive aspects of that trend were extended in the post bourse.
Daimler, just DM2 higher at DM874.50 on the session, put on another DM5.50
in the afternoon and Volkswagen moved from a DM9.50 rise to DM519.50 to one
of DM18, at DM528. VW had been strong against the market over the last
month, quarter and 12-month period, but Goldman Sachs said it had further to
go, projecting a prospective p/e of just over 7 on 1997 earnings.
PARIS closed at the day's high as the market was lifted by late futures
activity. The CAC-40 index put on 20.54 or 1 per cent to 2,159.59, for a
week's rise of 2 per cent.
Schneider was heavily sought, rising FFr23.409 or 5.4 per cent to FFr452.90,
following the release of better than expected 1993 results. The electrial
equipment group also raised the dividend, by 50 centimes to FFr7, and saw
growth continuing throughout 1994.
Saint-Louis added FFr28 to FFr1,775 on news that it was to merge its
prepared food business with BSN, up FFr8 to FFr850.
AMSTERDAM was particularly active as options expired during the afternoon,
with the AEX index reaching a session high of 428.42 before slipping back to
close up 1.43 at 425.12.
The index recorded a 2.3 per cent gain on the week.
Royal Dutch, up Fl4.30 on the day, and 3.3 per cent on the week at Fl207.50,
was the most active issue as oil prices and stocks firmed in London on
bullish expectations.
Nedlloyd, due to release figures next week, added Fl1.10 to Fl74.90. Goldman
Sachs noted yesterday that the shipping and distribution group had been one
of the market's best performing stocks recently. Most of this
outperformance, Goldman added, occured in the second half of 1993 following
better-than-expected results and forecasts of a profit in 1994, which the
investment bank estimated at Fl127m.
MILAN gave up some of an early advance in a round of brief but heavy selling
by domestic funds as the conservative alliance failed to have its nominees
elected as parliamentary presidents, and Mr Silvio Berlusconi raised the
spectre of fresh elections. The Comit index finished 13.20 or 1.7 per cent
ahead at 800.32 for a 5.9 per cent rise on the week.
Trading was again heavy as more than 180 new shares and warrants joined the
screen-based trading system, bringing an end to open outcry in Milan.
Blue chip industrial issues, which had led the market, saw their gains
restrained. Fiat rose L42 to L6,569, after a high of L6,790, and Montedison
edged L3 ahead to L1,507 after a peak of L1,558 in heavy volume of 53.9m
shares.
The telecommunications issues were a bright spot: Sip rose L48 to L4,961,
Italcable L67 to L11,539 and Cogefar L61 to L2,616. But profits were taken
in the insurers after their recent surge: Alleanza fell L296 to L18,974,
Fondiaria lost L230 to L13,935 and SAI gave up L491 to L21,693.
MADRID remained nervous about the appearance of Mr Mariano Rubio before
congress, after hours yesterday, to answer questions about his personal
financial dealings while he governed the Bank of Spain. The general index
fell another 2.78 to 318.86, 2.1 per cent lower on the week.

FT  16 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities digest
conflicting data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
With bonds holding steady yesterday amid conflicting economic signals, US
stocks finished in an even draw between advancing and declining issues,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.78 lower at 3,661.47,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dipped 0.20 to 446.18.
The American SE composite edged 0.97 ahead to 438.29, and the Nasdaq
composite added 0.67 to 727.98.
The Federal Reserve's eagerly awaited data on capacity utilisation proved to
be an anti-climax, and that was good news for stocks. The country's
factories, mines and utilities operated at 83.6 per cent of capacity last
month. The slight gain was a little less than economists had forecast.
It was a signal to the bond market that its worst fears about growing
inflationary pressures in the economy were unsupported. The news undercut
speculation this week that the Federal Reserve was about to lift interest
rates again.
But the pervading bearishness of the fixed-income markets, and a University
of Michigan survey showing improved consumer sentiment this month, mitigated
any impulse to bid up bond prices. Treasuries held close to their opening
values.
The Dow industrials quickly added 15 points, then fell back to five better,
holding that level for the rest of the morning.
The ride grew more bumpy in the afternoon. Yesterday was a 'double-witching'
session, in which options on individual issues and stock indices expired.
Reinvestment activity brought some volatility late in the day, and helped
lift NYSE volume to 310m shares.
Among individual issues, strong crude-oil prices for a second day running
boosted energy stocks. Chevron climbed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 91 7/8 ,
Mobil Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 78 3/4 and Phillips Dollars 2 to Dollars 31
3/4 .
Digital Equipment was down Dollars 6 or about 20 per cent at Dollars 22 7/8
. The stock was battered when the company surprised investors by posting a
net loss of Dollars 1.34 a share and announcing plans to cut 7,000 jobs.
Elsewhere in the technology sector, Motorola shed a further Dollars 2 to
Dollars 89 1/2 after posting disappointing results earlier in the week.
On the Nasdaq, Wellfleet Communications jumped Dollars 5 to Dollars 70 1/4 .
The computer-equipment supplier revealed that its third-quarter earnings had
doubled and declared a two-for-one stock split.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed lower as precious and base metals shares losses
weighed heavily on rebounding forestry stocks.
But some market watchers believe that an upward swing is a strong
possibility next week.
The TSE 300 composite index lost 14.90 points to 4239.95 in trade of 64.07m
shares valued at CDollars 675m.
Technical analyst Ron Meisels, president of P&amp;C Holdings, said the low
volume and almost equal advancing and declining volumes of this week's
sell-off augur well for a firmer future.
Brazil
Sao Paulo was down 4.1 per cent in moderate trade ahead of Monday's options
settlement. The Bovespa index was off 628 at 14,434 points.
Turnover was Crz238.6bn (Dollars 215.9m).

Tokyo
Political worries were brushed aside as the yen retreated against the
dollar, and the Nikkei rose on buying by foreign investors and investment
trust funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index gained 177.43 to 20,164.63 after a low of 20,050.21 and a high of
20,282.16, recording a week's improvement of 1.1 per cent.
Traders said that a government was likely to be formed next week, and
economic policies would not differ drastically no matter who was chosen as
prime minister.
The fluctuation of the yen around the Y104 level encouraged investors, the
currency closing down Y0.95 at Y103.95.
Volume was 425m shares against Thursday's 367m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 11.64 to 1,635.12, while the Nikkei 300 gained 2.04 to
299.43. Gainers led losers by 753 to 269, with 146 issues unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 5.11 to 1341.56.
Export driven manufacturers were higher on the yen's easing: Hitachi rose Y4
to Y978, Fujitsu advanced Y10 to Y1,040 and NEC gained Y20 to Y1,150.
Steels and shipbuilders were also firm, with Kawasaki Steel up Y5 to Y375
and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gaining Y4 to Y680.
Hopes of higher domestic and overseas sales supported car makers. Isuzu
Motors, the day's most active issue, rose Y14 to Y502 and Nissan Motor
gained Y12 to Y896.
Profit-taking depressed Matsushita Electric Industrial, which fell Y30 to
Y1,720 and Sony, down Y30 to Y5,950.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 183.80 to 22,475.20 in volume of 22.2m
shares.
Roundup
The region offered a mixed performance, with less exciting moves in the
bigger markets.
BANGKOK reopened after a three-day holiday, domestic mutual funds and
long-term investors bought big companies and the SET index rose 43.72 or 3.5
per cent to 1,278.98, 4.5 per cent higher on the week.
Turnover was Bt6.3bn compared with Bt2.1bn on Monday. The communications
sector, one of the most active in the market, soared by 8.6 per cent.
Communications issues, led by TelecomAsia, led the active list, rising by
Bt9 to Bt103.
TAIWAN rose 2.4 per cent on the day in active trade, but only 1.2 per cent
on the week as the weighted index closed 130.91 higher at 5,592.90.
Turnover climbed from TDollars 32.7bn to TDollars 60.9bn. The rebound was
led by textiles and financials, the former after good news for cotton
prices.
MANILA chalked up a third successive gain although profit-taking pared early
gains encouraged by the telephone stock, PLDT's rise in New York.
The composite index finished 9.92 higher at 2,769.42, up 4.9 per cent on the
week.
JAKARTA, too, saw some profit-taking, but the JKSE index ended 5.37 higher
at 472.65, up 2 per cent on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR was lifted by late buying on speculation that the government
would soon announce general elections, the KLSE composite index rising 12.36
to 1,033.66, 7.5 per cent higher on the week.
Idris Hydraulic was one of the most active stocks, rising 25 cents to
MDollars 5.35.
SINGAPORE majored in Malaysian stocks traded over the counter, which rose as
speculators returned, but the broad market was subdued and the Straits Times
Industrial index fell 25.19 to 2,212.18, still 5.3 per cent higher on the
week.
HONG KONG was slow, turnover edging up slightly from HKDollars 3.32bn to
HKDollars 3.55bn as the Hang Seng index receded 64.57 to 9,536.06, 2.6 per
cent higher on the week. Losses were concentrated in the property sector
where the sub-index fell 286.21, or 1.6 per cent to 17,368.32.
BOMBAY saw profit-taking after the withdrawal of mutual funds from the
market, and the BSE index closed 49.35 lower at 3,895.18, a fraction higher
on the week. AUSTRALIA drifted lower with the market pressured by bonds. The
All Ordinaries index shed 14.4 to 2,080.6 in turnover of ADollars 333.54m,
little changed on the week.
In the gold sector Placer Pacific fell 6 cents to ADollars 2.95 and Poseidon
Gold dipped 7 cents to ADollars 3.38.

FT  16 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Japan hopes to build on first quarter
rally - Emiko Terazono finds equity investors are cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese shares have shown surprising resilience against the recent turmoil
in global stock markets, the yen's volatility and domestic political
instability.
Share prices were supported by capital flows as overseas investors shifted
their funds from south-east Asian markets to Japan. The Nikkei index rose
9.7 per cent during the first quarter and outperformed the rest of the
Pacific Rim by 45 per cent.
The lack of downside risk compared to other Asian markets and hopes of an
economic recovery led by a rise in consumption later on in the year prompted
buying by overseas investors. During the first two months of this year,
overseas investors bought a total of Y2,250bn in Japanese stocks, countering
heavy selling by domestic corporations which were selling their holdings to
supplement slack profits.
The question is whether the strength will carry on through the second
quarter. Investors had initially hoped that domestic institutions would
start allocating cash into the stock market in the business year following
allocation meetings which started at the end of last month.
However, with bond yields still around 4 per cent, views among analysts are
currently mixed as Japanese institutions may choose to invest in the bond
market instead of stocks.
'Market conditions are likely to remain stodgy,' says Mr Peter Tasker,
strategist at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo. Although the expected weakness is
unlikely to reward aggressive selling, he says, falling bond yields and the
weakening yen, which supported stocks at the start of the year, will have
less of an impact.
Earlier this week Japan's leading life assurers, large lot investors in
Japanese stocks, warned that they would remain cautious towards equities. Mr
Toshiomi Uragami, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan, says
that life companies find stock investments difficult to justify due to the
low dividends, and that they will boost investment in the domestic bond
market.
NatWest Securities in London is more optimistic, believing that Japan is the
place to be this year because of the strong likelihood of a recovery in the
economy and corporate earnings.
Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel in Tokyo, is 'neutral' about the
market. Although he feels that stocks are looking over-expensive compared to
bonds, the expected earnings recovery is beginning to become evident and
will support share prices.
Considering the sharp falls in corporate earnings over past few years, the
recovery is likely to be huge. According to James Capel, the machinery
sector is earning less than 1 per cent of its peak profits, the car sector
less than 3 per cent and electricals less than 18 per cent. Even if the
figures do not recover the peak levels of the 1980s, an earnings rebound
will signal a jump of four to five times over the next few years.
NatWest estimates the earnings rebound to be around 20 per cent for the year
ending next March. Although the price to earnings ratio of around 100 looks
expensive on the basis of such figures, it says, looking beyond 1995 the
figure does not seem too high.
For investors looking to place funds in the stock market, the
over-the-counter stock market with its small growth stocks may offer
favourable prospects.
The immediate economic outlook on the other hand remains mixed, although
some 'green shoots' indicate that the economy has hit the bottom of its
current cycle.
How much longer will the economy crawl along the bottom? So far the economy
has been helped by a rise in consumption, led by an active housing market as
real estate companies have started to put cheap condominiums on to the
market at a time of low housing loan interest rates. Housebuying has surged,
while sundries and durable good sales connected to the housing market have
also risen. The current deflation is also encouraging consumption, at least
by volume if not by value.
Whether such activity can be sustained as more companies are forced to cut
labour costs remains to be seen. Although companies will not move to lay off
their labour forces, a jump in consumer spending large enough to pull the
whole economy out of its doldrums is unlikely. Kleinwort Benson projects
real consumption settling down into an annual growth of around 1 per cent.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, says that the
volatility of the yen could prompt policy moves which would boost the
economy. He forecasts that currency speculators are likely to step up
activity ahead of the Group of Seven talks in Naples and next month's
corporate earnings results. 'If the yen moves below Y100 it is likely to
prompt a policy response, including a cut in the official discount rate and
another supplementary budget,' he says.
If economic figures released over the next few months confirm that
conditions are steadily improving, Mr Barker says that the Nikkei could
break the 21,000 level.
But caution still prevails, and Mr Mikio Fujii of Nomura Securities says
that technical resistance remains heavy around the 21,000 level on the
Nikkei 225. 'We would need very large volumes to break through,' he adds.

FT  16 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Banks weak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Banking stocks were in a market backwater as bearish stories dampened
sentiment. The main pressure focused on HSBC whose shares fell 15 to 781p.
The selling of the leading far eastern bank was initially prompted by
comment on the resignation of four senior executives from Midland Global
Markets, the treasury and capital markets arm. Dealers added that one of the
Sunday newspapers was preparing a feature on losses in fixed income
departments as bond dealers were caught unawares by the recent hike in US
interest rates and subsequent slide in bonds. Midland Global is considered
the leading bond player among clearing banks.
NatWest Securities, also suspected of suffering because of bond losses,
dropped 3 to 474p.
Talk of an imminent interest rate cut boosted the regional electricity
companies, with good advances also being made by the generators. Strong
performances came from London, which jumped 21 to 621p, South West 20 to
645p and Norweb 23 to 673p. Eastern, which announced after the market had
closed that it had purchased 250,000 of its shares at 648p, added 3 1/2 to
647 1/2 p.
NatWest was recommending the generators after their recent underperformance.
PowerGen moved up 12 to 495p and National Power 13 to 443p, while Scottish
Hydro, up 12 at 364p, was said to be favoured by UBS.
Water stocks were mixed in low volume. A stock overhang depressed
Northumbrian, the shares coming off 12 to 623p. There was good demand,
however, for North West, ahead 6 at 517p.
The pressure on Vodafone continued, underpinned by competition fears and US
selling. The shares slipped a half-penny lower to 517p in a perky telecoms
sector. Cable and Wireless was the best performer, gaining 17 to 469p as the
group announced a joint venture in China. BT added 3 1/2 to 390 1/2 p.
BAT Industries fell 6 1/2 to 443 1/2 p as it was announced that its US
insurance subsidiary Farmers estimated that their range of probable losses
from the Northridge earthquake was between Dollars 600m and Dollars 800m
before any recoveries from reinsurance arrangements, against original
expectations of around Dollars 600m.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was weak in early trading as US investment bank
Lehman Brothers told clients one of the leading US health maintenance
organisations (HMO) was to use a new ulcer eradication treatment. This would
hit ulcer depressant treatments Zantac, Glaxo's leading product, and Astra's
Lose. Glaxo shares were off 6 at worst, but ended the day 7 better at 575p
after the company announced that its Japanese subsidiary had begun marketing
Zofran, its anti-nausea drug for cancer patients.
News and financial information group Reuters Holdings performed well on its
last day as the heavyweight stock in the Footsie. The shares lifted 19 to
1993p on turnover of 1.8m. On Monday morning a four-for-one share split
comes into effect.
Exploration and production company Lasmo improved 8 to 132p as it was
announced that Mr Joe Derby, the chief executive, had put his money behind
the company and bought 10,000 shares at 123p each.
Aran Energy was one of the most heavily traded stocks in the market. The
shares rose 2 1/4 or 10 per cent to 26 3/4 on turnover of 12m.
Clyde Petroleum improved 2 to 35p as it was confirmed that PDFM, the
investment institution, had bought 12m shares, boosting its stake to 18.8
per cent.
Hotel group Forte fell back following an overall poor reception to the
group's figures on Thursday. The shares closed 8 off at 234p on 5.3m traded.
Stadium owner Wembley reported heavy losses, although anticipation of these
saw the shares rise 1 1/2 to 12p.
Interest rate sentiment also boosted several of the larger stores stocks.
Boots advanced 7 to 546p, Sears 4 to 126 1/2 p, Kingfisher 9 to 606p and
Marks and Spencer 4 1/2 to 426 1/2 p.
Brewing and retail group Whitbread was lifted by a recommendation from
Lehman Brothers, the shares advancing 7 to 555p. News that new car demand in
western Europe has began to show some recovery boosted stocks in the motors
sector. Shares in GKN recently supported by broker's recommendations jumped
another 15 to 594p, while BBA advanced 5 1/2 to 226p. Lucas Industries moved
7 ahead to 211p as turnover rose to 5.9m; and T&amp;N raced 11 ahead to 251p
with Hoare Govett also reported to have recommended the shares. Inchcape
jumped 25 to 563p after a Robert Fleming recommendation.
British Steel ended a buoyant week by closing at a five-year high as a
clutch of brokers' recommendations continued to encourage active buying. The
shares firmed 2 3/4 to 155 1/4 p, as turnover soared to 14m.

FT  16 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Crude price lifts oil shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil stocks led the London stock market forward yesterday with Shell
Transport standing out, the shares jumping 18 to 728p on turnover of 12m.
The move puts the stock back towards its all-time high, reflecting the
strength of underlying oil prices.
One month Brent crude was back to Dollars 15 a barrel, up from the recent
low of Dollars 12.70 just after the Opec meeting at the end of March agreed
to maintain output levels. Also, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price
jumped through Dollars 16 prompting a rash of share buying in New York on
Thursday night.
The US buying led to a scramble for stock in London early yesterday morning
as traders fought to cover their short positions. The higher price also
persuaded US investment banks Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch to raise
oil price forecasts. Dealers said Salomon lifted its WTI forecast by 35
cents to Dollars 16.10. British Petroleum, also benefiting from a small
disposal, gained 13 1/2 to 390p. Enterprise, which confirmed earlier
speculation of a small find in Cambodia, improved 22 to 457p.

FT  16 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rate cut hopes drive equities sharply
higher - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good news on UK inflation, coming hard on the heels of the cut in German
interest rates and encouraging economic news from the US, raised hopes of
another reduction in UK interest rates yesterday. This set the scene for a
strong performance by the London stockmarket.
The FT-SE 100-share index, which laboured in early trading as UK
institutions held fire ahead of the crucial inflation news for last month,
took some time to get into gear but moved into overdrive during the final
two hours of trading. Towards the close, it was helped by a good showing by
Wall Street and a number of trading programmes on the buy side during the
final hour of business.
Adding to a general air of euphoria as the market closed was the
announcement that the Bank of England intends to auction government stock
maturing between 1997 and 2001 against expectations of stock maturing
between 2004 and 2006. Fuller details of the auction are expected early next
week.
By the close the FT-SE 100 index had sprinted ahead to end the session 36.6
higher at 3,168.3, extending the rise on the week to 47.5. The second-line
stocks also attracted sustained buying interest, with the FT-SE Mid Cap 250
index closing 32.5 firmer at 3,824.6.
Gilt-edged stocks were always in positive territory with the long-dated
issues up a point and more at best, responding to growing hopes that another
UK interest rate cut may come sooner than previously expected.
The market began the session in subdued fashion, with the FT-SE 100 index up
just over seven points and turnover restrained by lingering fears about the
inflation numbers. In the event the retail price index news showed inflation
slowing to show an annualised gain of only 2.3 per cent. This was below
forecasts and provided the spark for both gilt-edged and equity markets.
The former raced higher, shrugging off a sluggish performance by German
bunds, as talk of another UK rate cut gripped the market, while equities
surged higher amid suggestions that institutions had moved in to buy a
market short of stock.
Dealers reported increasing demand for the leading FT-SE stocks during the
afternoon and the 100-index reached a day's peak of 3,168.6 just before the
official close.
The head of market-making at one leading UK integrated securities house said
the market was looking in 'fine shape' as it closed for the weekend. 'It was
a dullish day to begin with but was looking very strong towards the close
when there was some sizeable institutional buying. The UK inflation news was
very well received, we've had the expected German rate cuts and the US
markets are looking healthy.'
The oil sector, which has outperformed the wider market in recent sessions,
was again strongly supported as crude oil prices topped Dollars 15 a barrel
and leading international brokers forecast average oil prices in excess of
Dollars 16 a barrel for the year.
Turnover in equities reached 698.8m shares, slightly up on Thursday's total.
The value of customer business transacted on Thursday was Dollars 1.39bn.
The bank sector of the market performed well with the exception of HSBC
where the shares were affected by suggestions that the bank's fixed-interest
trading arm had suffered after the extreme market turbulence following the
shift in US monetary policy.

FT  16 APR 94 / Markets Report: Sterling firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The release of a better than expected March UK retail inflation figure
yesterday gave rise to renewed optimism about the prospect of lower interest
rates, writes Philip Gawith.
Few observers believe a cut is imminent, but the case for an easing of
credit policy has been bolstered by underlying retail price inflation
falling to 2.4 per cent in March - in the lower half of the government's
target range.
The improved outlook was reflected in short sterling futures, with the June
contract closing nine basis points higher at 94.73.
Sterling was fairly stable with the trade weighted index closing at 79.9
after opening at 79.8. It closed in London at DM2.5233 after finishing on
Thursday at DM2.5239.
Elsewhere, weaker than expected March industrial production and capacity
utilisation figures in the US undermined the dollar. The US currency
finished at DM1.7124 against the D-Mark from DM1.7088 on Thursday.
Ireland joined the round of European rate cuts by lowering its short-term
facility rate to 6.50 per cent from 6.75 per cent.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said the good RPI
number provided confirmation that the underlying UK inflation trend was
still favourable. He doubted, however, whether it had direct policy
implications.
The recently released minutes of monthly monetary policy meetings revealed
that 'good inflation is a necessary, but not a sufficient, criterion for the
Bank of England to cut again. It would need to see a slowdown in the economy
because of higher taxes' said Mr Lyons.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 170m of late assistance to the UK money
markets. Earlier it had provided Pounds 73m assistance, compared to a
forecast shortage of Pounds 350m.
Taken together, the two US data released yesterday, were slightly weaker
than the market anticipated. Industrial production rose 0.5 per cent in
March, while capacity utilisation in mines, utilities and factories rose to
83.6 per cent from 83.4 per cent.
Although slightly below expectations, the capacity figure was not far short
of 85, historically seen as the level at which inflationary pressures are
triggered. Analysts said the data was keeping the dollar well underpinned,
but not providing fresh buying support.
Placing downward pressure on the dollar is the resurgent yen. No fresh
initiative to deal with the US/Japan trade dispute emerged from the meeting
in Marrakesh between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Mr
Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese foreign minister.
Increasingly the market is tending towards the view that the dollar will
weaken further, falling through Y100 to record lows.
Elsewhere in Europe the D-Mark finished stronger against most European
currencies. The Italian lira slipped further to L956 from L954.8 as a
squabble about the election of a speaker in the Senate renewed fears about
the prospects for a stable government following the recent elections.
The Spanish peseta finished at Pta81.61 from Pta81.31, weakened apparently
by rumours that the Economics minister would be resigning.

FT  16 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Silver's
retreat continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any hope that the silver market might soon mount a successful assault on the
Dollars 6-a-troy-ounce barrier appeared to have been abandoned by the end of
this week. As the hedge fund buyers who recently drove the metal to a
four-year high took their money elsewhere the cash price on the London
bullion market subsided to Dollars 5.25 1/2 an ounce, adding 24 cents to
last week's 22-cent fall.
The weight of recent physical selling of silver and a fall in demand in
India, the biggest market for the metal, 'suggests that Dollars 6 to Dollars
6.50 silver are unattainable levels unless the funds want to throw huge
resources into the market,' said Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch
financial services group.
Silver's weakness further undermined other precious metals. Gold ended the
week Dollars 8.95 down at Dollars 377.25 an ounce, while platinum
surrendered another Dollars 12 to reach Dollars 394.25 an ounce at London's
afternoon fixing yesterday.
The London Metal Exchange copper market tried to regain its foothold above
Dollars 1,900 a tonne (for three months metal) in mid-week. But the ground
quickly gave way after it clambered to Dollars 1,901.50 on Wednesday
afternoon. Rumours, emanating from Shanghai, that China would relax its
tight monetary policy in the near future, helped to limit the damage but by
yesterday's close the price had slipped to Dollars 1,882.50 a tonne, down
Dollars 6.75 on the week.
Chinese buying interest was the main support for the aluminium market after
it too failed in an attempt on its next upside target - at Dollars 1,330 a
tonne for three months delivery. That level was narrowly breached on Monday
but by yesterday's close the price was down Dollars 12.75 on the week at
Dollars 1,306.75 a tonne.
Yet another market to pay the price of ambition was lead. After losing its
grip above Dollars 470 a tonne on Thursday afternoon stop-loss selling
pushed the three months price to Dollars 455.50 a tonne, up Dollars 2.75
overall.
Traders at the London Commodity Exchange were meanwhile watching similar
scenes unfold in the robusta coffee market. A continuation of the technical
rally that lifted the July futures position by Dollars 74 to Dollars 1,437 a
tonne last week took that price to Dollars 1,502 on Wednesday morning, but
by then the traders were already looking over their shoulders for a downward
'correction', which they considered overdue.
They did not have much longer to wait. By yesterday's close all but Dollars
9 of the Dollars 65 gain had been eliminated and dealers were hoping for a
period of consolidation. 'The last bit of the recent rise between Dollars
1,375 and Dollars 1,500 has been very sketchy and as our previous base was
around Dollars 1,350 it would be good if we could move this to Dollars
1,400,' one told the Reuter news agency.
An altogether brighter performance was put on at London's International
Petroleum Exchange, where the prompt delivery position for Brent Blend crude
oil moved above Dollars 15 for the first time since February 3. Dealers
explained that the rally was encouraged by tighter North Sea supplies and
brisk demand.
Earlier the market had ignored a report that members of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries increased production last month. The Middle
East Economic Survey estimated the cartel's output in March at 24.99m
barrels a day, compared with the February figure of 24.76m b/b, which was
already 240,000 b/d above the agreed production ceiling.

FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: Digital suffers heavy losses and
warns of job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment, the US computer-maker, reported far heavier losses than
expected in the third quarter, and warned it would cut 7,000 jobs, or 8 per
cent of its workforce, over the next three months.
The company also announced plans for a new restructuring, probably involving
further cutbacks, by the end of its fiscal year in June.
For the quarter, Digital reported net losses of Dollars 183.3m, or Dollars
1.34 per share. Wall Street analysts had been projecting losses of about 29
cents a share, with the worst at 50 cents. In the same period last year,
Digital recorded a loss of Dollars 30.1m, or 23 cents.
Digital's share price fell about 18 per cent, to trade at Dollars 23 5/8 in
mid-session, down from Thursday's close of Dollars 28 7/8 . 'The financial
results are unacceptable to this management and obviously disappointing,'
said Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive. 'Growth in sales of
new products is beginning to overtake the declines in our other products,
but we have not yet achieved a competitive cost structure.'
Sales of computers based on Digital's new Alpha microprocessor represented
almost half of total systems revenues in the quarter, excluding personal
computers, he said.
However, total revenues for the quarter dropped 6 per cent to Dollars 3.26bn
from Dollars 3.45bn. Product sales were down 1 per cent, while service
revenues declined 11 per cent.
The drop in service revenues surprised Mr Palmer, who said Digital had
failed to anticipate a sharp decline in its maintenance business, as
customers replaced older data storage devices with more reliable models.
For the nine-month period, Digital reported a net loss of Dollars 338.6m, or
Dollars 2.50, compared with a net loss of Dollars 364.5m, or Dollars 2.81, a
year ago.

FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: CBoT votes to opt out of
revamped Globex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of directors of the Chicago Board of Trade have voted not to
participate in a restructured Globex. The move effectively ends a fractious
five-year partnership between the exchange, Reuters, and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, and creates a potential competitor for the system.
The exit by the world's largest futures exchange further clouds plans for
the ambitious Dollars 200m project, created by Reuters as a vehicle for
round-the-clock, round-the-world futures trading.
In the two years since its launch, Globex has not met its volume or
globalisation targets, and only France's Matif has made significant use of
the system.
The CBoT says it plans to pull its contracts from Globex on April 30. After
then, only Matif and CME contracts will remain on the system.
Ms Rosalyn Wilton, Reuter's managing director for transaction products,
said: 'We're obviously disappointed by the CBoT's decision. We believe the
new Globex agreement goes a long way to provide an equitable arrangement for
new exchanges to join.'
Participation by London's Liffe is thought to be critical to Globex's
future. Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive, said: 'I certainly think
Globex would have more credibility if it included CBOT.'
Meanwhile, the CBoT plans to list its financial futures contracts for
after-hours trade on its own local computer network, and may extend that
trading using Bloomberg Financial Services terminals, in competition with
Globex.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, topped the US executive pay league
in 1993 with earnings of Dollars 203m  - not far short of the company's net
income, which fell 63 per cent in the year to Dollars 299.8m, according to a
survey published yesterday by Businessweek magazine. It was the highest
annual compensation for an executive anywhere in the world.
However, some Dollars 202.3m of Mr Eisner's compensation stemmed from the
exercise of stock options dating back to 1984. His salary was only Dollars
750,000 and he received no bonus as Disney's earnings fell. He is regarded
as having done an excellent job for shareholders, lifting Disney's
capitalisation from Dollars 2.2bn to almost Dollars 23bn over the past
decade.
The second highest paid executive was Mr Sanford Weill, chairman of
Travelers, the financial services group, who received Dollars 52.8m, all but
Dollars 4.3m through the exercise of stock options. Third was Mr Joseph Hyde
of Autozone with Dollars 32.2m.

FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: German bank plans derivatives
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Commerzbank, the smallest of Germany's big three banks, yesterday announced
plans to set up a subsidiary for trading in derivatives. Mr Martin
Kohlhaussen, chief executive, said the unit, the first in Germany, would
increase the bank's involvement in vibrant derivatives activities.
He said: 'There is no reason to leave the lion's share of this business in
the hands of our international competitors.' He said the new company, to be
called Commerz Financial Products, would have offices in London, Paris, New
York, Tokyo and Singapore, with its headquarters in Frankfurt.
CFP will have start-up capital of DM100m (Dollars 58.8m). The bank plans to
bundle all its existing derivatives activities - with the exception of
currency-related products - under the roof of the new organisation. Last
year, the total volume of derivatives business, including currency
transactions, was DM487bn, 171 per cent of the balance sheet total.
Excluding currency transactions, derivatives volume was only 84 per cent of
the balance sheet, with credit exposure of a net DM3bn.
The announcement came as Commerzbank rounded off the reporting season for
German banks by announcing a 25 per cent rise in operating profits, to
DM1.13bn last year, after taking account of provisions for bad debts.
Mr Kohlhaussen attributed last year's lively increase to robust growth in
interest income (up 12 per cent to DM4.85bn) and fee income (up 22 per cent
to DM1.96bn), as well as record results on own-account securities trading.
Trading income more than doubled to DM550m.
Provisions against bad debts fell 14.9 per cent to DM1.77bn, in spite of the
depth of the German recession. Mr Kohlhaussen said this reflected profits on
the sale of problem-country debt.
Partial operating profits had shown 'good double-digit growth' in January
and February.

FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: Recovery hopes fuel Solvay stock
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Solvay, the Belgian chemicals group, yesterday soared to a record
high after the market predicted it would recover from heavy losses unveiled
earlier.
The shares closed at BFr16,075 on the Belgian stock market, BFr275 higher
than the previous day, and more than 3 per cent stronger than at the start
of the week.
The surge, which took some analysts by surprise, came after the group on
Thursday unveiled a total consolidated loss of BFr6.9bn (Dollars 196m) for
1993. The loss, which had been widely predicted, compares with a
consolidated profit of BFr9.9bn the previous year.
Solvay yesterday blamed BFr2.95bn of the loss on restructuring costs. They
related to the closure of several plants last year, resulting in the loss of
2,500 jobs.
However, the other reason for the loss was a decline in European chemical
sales and prices, the group admitted. Although the group's turnover rose 14
per cent in the US, and 27 per cent in Asia last year, it fell 11 per cent
in Europe.
A large part of this loss stemmed from the poor performance of the plastics
sector, which recorded a BFr2.27bn pre-tax loss in 1993. Conditions in the
soda ash business, where Solvay is the world leader, had also been
difficult.
The result seems likely to fuel demands among the European chemical sector
for tighter trade controls on east European imports of PVC and soda ash. Mr
Daniel Janssen, Solvay chairman, heads a campaign calling for the European
Commission to impose tough anti-dumping penalties.
Mr Janssen said yesterday the dividend would be maintained at BFr500 per
share, and predicted better results this year. Sales and profits prospects
for Solvay's main alkalis sectors were improving, he said, and prices
appeared to be bottoming out in the caustic soda sector.
Meanwhile, cost-cutting in the western European soda ash business, and
strong growth in the exports of US soda ash production to south-east Asia
and Brazil should also help recovery, Mr Janssen said.
These views were endorsed by the Belgium stock market, where analysts said
Solvay's fortunes could only improve.

Aker shares

<TEXT>
The shares of Aker, the Norwegian cement, oil and technology group, plunged
yesterday on the Oslo bourse following revelations that it faced a NKr2.4bn
(Dollars 324m) insurance claim over the sinking of a concrete gas platform
in 1991. Bringing the claim is a group of insurers seeking to recoup payouts
for the accident.
Aker's A shares closed down NKr10 to NKr96.50 on the news; B shares lost
NKr11 to NKr95.50; and free shares shed NKr10 to NKr97.50 in active trading
which saw 5.4 per cent of Aker's total share capital changing hands.
Aker's Norwegian Contractors unit was building the Sleipner A platform for
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, for work in the North Sea Sleipner
gas field.
With the edifice nearly complete, the substructure was being submerged
during preparations for towing to the field when one of its three shafts
took in too much water, causing it to sink rapidly.
The claim by a syndicate of underwriters and captive insurers is being led
by Vesta, the Norwegian unit of Skandia Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest
insurer. Ancon, the insurance company of Exxon, is also involved. Exxon's
Norway unit, Esso Norway, is the second-biggest shareholder in the Sleipner
field.
Aker said yesterday it considered the claim to be unjustified, as no new
information had emerged since initial investigations into the cause of the
mishap.

FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: BSN and Saint Louis to merge top
lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BSN and Saint Louis, two of France's largest food groups, are to merge their
ready-to-serve food businesses to create a company which will rank third in
Europe with sales of FFr8.4bn (Dollars 1.4bn). The new group, to be called
Panzalim, will combine BSN's Panzani division and the Euralim prepared food
operations of Saint Louis.
BSN will have management control of the company and hold 65.5 per cent of
the capital. Saint Louis will hold the balance.
Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's chairman, described the alliance as 'a logical
step' which would allow both groups to strengthen their position in an
expanding sector. Panzalim will control about 10 per cent of the western
European market for prepared food, behind Nestle of Switzerland and
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group, which both control about 13 per cent of the
market.
'Prepared food is one of the big areas of growth in the food industry,' said
Mr Riboud, who forecast the market would expand by about 5 or 6 per cent
annually over the next 10 to 15 years. 'Nowadays, people want a restaurant
at their home with a choice like a menu,' he said.
Mr Riboud said the new company would offer canned, frozen and chilled food,
pasta and sauces. The principal brands to be included in the new group
include William Saurin, Panzani, and Vivagel.
Of the FFr8.4bn combined sales, about FFr6bn will come from prepared foods,
and the rest from pasta and sauces.
Mr Bernard Dumon, chairman of Saint Louis, said the brands and products were
complementary, and that the creation of Panzalim would also strengthen the
geographical presence of the two food groups. As well as the French market,
BSN is strong in Italy and is expanding rapidly in east Asia. Saint Louis,
which already has a strong presence in frozen foods, is an important player
in the Spanish market.
According to Mr Riboud, the alliance will provide economies in the joint
purchasing of ingredients and in investment in research and innovation.
Describing the prepared-food sector as 'the cosmetics side of the food
industry', he said the establishment of brand identities and innovation had
become increasingly important.
Panzalim's largest markets will be Spain and France. In France, the company
will have a market share of about 26 per cent, while it will control about
30 per cent of the Spanish frozen ready-to-serve market.
BSN said it did not expect opposition to the deal from competition
authorities in Brussels, because the markets remained divided between
several large producers.
Food industry analysts in Paris described the deal as a positive move which
would accelerate expansion of the two groups in the prepared food market.
Shares in Saint Louis rose strongly, from FFr1,747 to FFr1,775. BSN's shares
climbed FFr8 to FFr850.

FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle mills bid turns sour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Efforts by Bundaberg Sugar, the Australian sugar company owned by Tate &amp;
Lyle, to acquire two Queensland crushing mills for ADollars 121m (Pounds
58m) were dealt a severe blow yesterday when shareholders in one of the
mills voted against the lift-ng of a restriction which limits the number of
shares which any single investor can hold.
In the wake of the decision, one of Bundaberg's Sydney-based advisers said
that he understood that the bid for that mill, and possibly for both mills,
would now be allowed to lapse.
There was no immediate comment or confirmation of this from Mr Geoff
Mitchell, Bundaberg's managing director.
The vote centred on the South Johnstone mill, the smaller of the two and in
which Bundaberg holds a 2.7 per cent interest.
At a shareholders' meeting approximately 82.45 per cent of the votes were
cast in favour of retaining the limit - which is set at 3.2 per cent of the
mill's equity - while only 17.55 per cent were in favour of lifting it.
In voting down the proposal, the mill's current owners - who, for the most
part, comprise the local Queensland cane growers - effectively blocked the
bid from proceeding further. Bundaberg had already indicated that its
ADollars 14 a share offer was final.
By contrast, Bundaberg has not said that its offer for the Tully mill is
final, but the board of the larger mill has been as vehemently opposed to
the takeover as the directors at South Johnstone, and Bundaberg lacks even a
small shareholding in the Tully mill.
Opposition to the bids came largely from local cane growers who were
concerned that the running of the mill and its associated facilities would
be changed under Bundaberg's ownership, with more emphasis put on its
short-term profit performance, rather than on the service provided to
growers.

FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Further stinging accusations at Regina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for the bees at Regina took another surprise turn with
revelations that the royal jelly company paid consultancy fees to Major
Ronald Ferguson, father of the Duchess of York, as part of its costly foray
into polo sponsorship. The information was provided in one of two letters
sent to shareholders over the extraordinary meeting on April 23 which will
dictate board control.
Mr Shiraz Malik-Noor - the spurned former head-of-the-hive who is aiming to
get voted back - hit out at the stings of the current board. He claimed that
the battle started over unwarranted pay rises demanded by his detractors.
Mr Paul Geoghegan, chairman, and Mr Tony Shakesby, finance director,
attempted to push through 20 per cent pay rises on their Pounds 50,000
salaries. Mr Malik-Noor, then earning Pounds 77,000, succeeded in
restricting the rise to 2 per cent.
Mr Malik-Noor also defended his track record in developing international
contacts. He is attempting to reinstate himself on the board, and appoint
new directors who would ensure his control.
By contrast, Mr Geoghegan's letter points to the 60 per cent fall in
turnover since Mr Malik-Noor took control. It compares the Pounds 218,000
spent on US marketing against a corresponding 84 per cent drop in US sales.
Shareholders have succumbed to Mr Geoghegan's chain of letters (three so
far). He has received 99.6 per cent support from the 765 proxies that have
arrived to date.
However, Mr Malik-Noor, the major shareholder, claims support for up to 40
per cent of the shares. The only certainty is that there will be a sizeable
bun fight at the jelly company's EGM.

FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;W creates cables venture with Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications group, and the Chinese government
yesterday announced in Beijing a joint venture to develop, install and
maintain international submarine telecommunications cables.
The venture, Sino-British Submarine Systems, is capitalised at Dollars 27m
(Pounds 18m).
The directorate general, telecommunications, of the China Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications will hold a 51 per cent stake. The balance will be
held by Great Eastern Telecommunications, a joint venture between C&amp;W and
Hongkong Telecom.
The new company is the first cable venture of its kind between a UK company
and China and underlines C&amp;W's commitment to the Asia Pacific region as its
prime focus for investment over the next decade.
Hongkong Telecom, owned 57.5 per cent by C&amp;W, is the most profitable part of
the group accounting for Pounds 554m of its Pounds 829m operating profit
last year. Earlier this year Mr James Ross, chief executive, said HKT's free
cash flow would be devoted to investments in Asia-Pacific.
The deal also reinforces the growing relationship between the Chinese
authorities and C&amp;W. The agreement was signed by Lord Young, executive
chairman of C&amp;W Group, and Mr Luen Zhengxi of the Chinese telecommunications
directorate general.
The intention is to acquire a deep ocean submarine cable installation and
maintenance ship, the Flexservice 3, at present used by C&amp;W Marine. The
venture will acquire a smaller cable ship and support vessels owned by the
Chinese. S-BSS will own and operate an 11-acre port area in Shanghai.
The immediate objective is to allow China to maintain the new China-Japan
fibre optic cable system inaugurated in December 1993.

FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Merchant Retail acts on Normans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of Merchant Retail Group have initiated a restructuring programme
at subsidiary Normans, the food retailing division, to 'improve its
profitability and maximise cash generation'.
Since last November Normans has been available for offers but none has been
received which has been in the best interests of shareholders and it had
been decided to retain it, directors stated.
They propose to make provisions in the accounts, for the year ended April 2,
of some Pounds 3.5m for the effects of the restructuring. These comprised
principally redundancy costs, and stock and equipment write-downs.
Although not completed, a valuation of group properties reveals a diminution
in the order of Pounds 8.6m. As a result of this and the reorganisation
provision, distributable reserves would be eliminated, and there is no
payment of the ordinary dividend for the present year, or the preference due
on July 1.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BICC, the cables and construction group, has sold Vero Electronics, its
Southampton-based electronic packaging, power supplies and printed circuit
board manufacturer, to a management-led buy-out group for Pounds 33m.
Sir Robin Biggam, chairman, said the disposal 'marks a further stage in our
strategy to concentrate on our core businesses of cablemaking and
construction'.
Vero, which was acquired by BICC in 1979 but has subsequently been expanded,
reported operating profits of Pounds 3m last year on sales of Pounds 66m. It
employs 1,200 people.
About 70 per cent of turnover comes from the manufacture of electronic
packaging boxes, enclosures and racks which are mainly used in the
telecommunications, data communications and networking industries.
In addition, Vero supplies the niche markets for plug-in power supplies and
specialist printed circuit boards.
The management buy-out team is led by Mr Brian Gay, managing director, who
re-joined Vero in January having previously worked for the company for some
22 years until 1987.
He is leading a core buy-out team of six, together with some 40 other
managers who will be subscribing for shares in the company.
Some Pounds 15m of equity for the buy-out is being provided by Mercury
Development Capital and Candover Investments, split equally, while the Royal
Bank of Scotland is providing bank facilities totalling Pounds 16m.

FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wembley losses double to Pounds 66m -
Write-downs and weak balance sheet behind sharp setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wembley, the debt-burdened stadium and greyhound track operator, yesterday
blamed large property write-downs as pre-tax losses for 1993 almost doubled
from a restated Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 65.7m.
The company said it no longer had any distributable reserves and, following
its first property valuation in three years, admitted net assets were now
worth Pounds 98.3m less than the Pounds 175.1m reported last time.
Faced with borrowings of Pounds 152.1m - equivalent to almost three times
shareholders' funds - the balance sheet proved too weak to absorb the
write-downs and the company was forced to set Pounds 48.3m against operating
profits.
Together with a further Pounds 3.2m charge for refinancing banking
facilities, exceptional items totalled Pounds 51.5m.
Those charges undermined operating profits of Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 12.7m) on
continuing activities and contributed to operating losses of Pounds 39.2m,
against a Pounds 3.7m gain last time.
The company was also hit by banking covenants requiring a Pounds 40m debt
repayment by March 31 this year, which it met only by selling non-core
subsidiaries for Pounds 24.4m and, since the 1993 year-end, disposing of a
50 per cent stake in Pacer CATS, the computer ticketing concern, for Pounds
15m.
Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, said: 'We've been to hell and back. We were
fighting uphill to make every disposal.'
He also warned that the company - which is unable to pay the dividend on
both its ordinary and convertible preference shares - could be in breach of
its borrowing powers and would be seeking shareholder approval for revised
terms.
In addition to the Pounds 40m repaid so far, the company is committed to a
further debt reduction of up to Pounds 39.5m by the end of this year and Sir
Brian said the board was considering a court application to approve a
financial reconstruction.
Any refinancing would be used not only to reduce borrowing but to provide
fresh investment for its three divisions.
Of those divisions, the Wembley complex saw operating profits decline from a
restated Pounds 7.1m to Pounds 5.1m as bookings for the arena and stadium
declined.
The greyhound business reported virtually flat profits of Pounds 5.8m
(Pounds 5.5m), and profits in leisure services - including Pacer CATS - fell
from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 1.9m.
Group turnover declined 21 per cent to Pounds 150.5m (Pounds 191.4m)
including a contribution of Pounds 21.6m from discontinued operations.
Describing the results as a 'watershed', Sir Brian said prospects this year
were improving and it had resolved its dispute with the Football Association
over sponsorship and television revenues.
A 10-year advertising contract has been signed with Coca-Cola and the
disposal programme was said to be largely completed.
Losses per share, however, increased from a restated 15.4p to 26.6p and Sir
Brian conceded 'we've got a big challenge ahead'.
The shares closed up 1 1/2 p at 12p.

FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: The lure of a blank sheet - The
introduction of a new accounting guideline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A growing number of British companies are starting to take advantage of a
rather unusual new accounting guideline: one that leaves them with a blank
sheet in their annual report to fill as they see fit.
It is called the Operating and Financial Review, and it represents a radical
departure for the UK Accounting Standards Board from the normally
prescriptive standards it has produced in the last three years.
The idea is to give the accounts back to the management, allowing companies
to describe and explain their financial position in a balanced way rarely
seen in the generally bland and upbeat statements currently provided by
chairmen and senior executives in annual reports.
'They should put the flesh on the bones of the accounts,' says the board's
Mr Simon Peerless. 'Accounts are a complex technical statement for the
specialist. The OFR should be what makes them mean something to a wider
audience.'
There is undoubtedly a need to help the less sophisticated reader. Mr Stuart
Valentine, director of research for ProShare, the wider share ownership
promotion body, says: 'The annual report is such a forbidding document. It
is not easy to understand. Most people don't do more than glance at it.'
Since 1980, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has required public
companies to produce a management discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A) with its
annual filings. But the statements are highly prescriptive, and often
produce little more than a restatement of figures and ratios readily
available from the accounts.
By contrast, the ASB, which first issued draft guidelines on the OFR in
April 1992, has tried to avoid a legalistic framework. It allows companies
to be as free as they choose in their descriptions. 'It's interpretation,
not the blindingly obvious, that we're after,' says Mr David Tweedie, the
ASB's chairman.
According to an analysis earlier this year by Company Reporting, the
Edinburgh-based monitoring service of company accounts, 62 of the FT-SE 100
companies already have some form of financial review. Among the better
examples are British Airways, Tomkins and Thorn EMI.
However, in the majority of cases, reviews tend to be short, rarely discuss
the difficulties with the business, and neglect important issues. For
example, only 40 per cent mentioned cash flow, a vital topic and one now
served with a new accounting standard.
One of the better examples of companies adopting the OFR so far is Bass, the
brewing, hotels and leisure group. In the 1993 accounts it covers 8 pages,
illustrated with graphs, describing each of the divisions, pensions,
interest, tax, foreign currencies and exchange rates, treasury policy and
capital structure, cash and assets.
Mr John Booth, financial controller, says the OFR was modelled on the
company's MD&amp;A, but with a freer format. 'There has never been anything to
stop companies publishing this kind of information, but in the past
financial reviews have largely been PR statements. One of the benefits of
the OFR is that it almost forces you to bring out some of the negatives.'
One institutional investor says of the Bass report: 'It has a crispness and
clarity and it is financially focused. It shares management's intentions
with shareholders and shows where investment is focused.'
He says it fulfils his aims in an OFR, which are to gain an understanding of
the company and its position in its markets, and future development and
investment plans. The statement can prove the basis for better discussions
at meetings with the company.
Investors point more sadly to the latest accounts of Hanson, the
Anglo-American conglomerate. There are glossy colour pictures in abundance,
but the text is rather more sparse and uninformative. Mr Martin Taylor, a
vice chairman of the company, says: 'The OFR is a suggestion, it is not
mandatory. We are very happy with what we disclose. Our filings with the SEC
are 60 to 70 pages long. Those who are interested can get copies.'
One problem with the OFR is what to do if companies refuse to comply.
In the US, the SEC takes a tough line, often sending back accounts to be
rewritten and threatening penalties. In April 1992, it reached a legal
settlement with Caterpillar for failing to disclose in its management
discussion that one-quarter of 1989 profits were non-recurring.
The UK shows no signs of attempting any similar enforcement. Although the
ASB produced the guidelines, it believes the OFR is not part of the
statutory accounts over which it has jurisdiction. There is little sign that
the Stock Exchange or the Department of Trade and Industry would intervene.
The hope is that companies will act responsibly, although for every good
example of an OFR, judging by the US experience, there are other instances
of businesses which have clearly manipulated the intention.
An academic survey published last year suggested that while US companies
were good at describing historical events, few provided forecasts and
projections that were useful and accurate. When the directors made
projections, they tended to ignore or incompletely report those that were
negative.
There is one remaining difficulty: the audience for the OFR. Mr Booth at
Bass admits that he is not sure to whom the text should be addressed. A
survey last year of readers of its annual report found few private
shareholders got beyond the chairman's statement.
Despite the emphasis on the less well trained investor, it seems that
analysts and institutional investors - who are supposedly better equipped to
read the accounts - may be the most likely beneficiaries.

FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Campari incurs Pounds 8.6m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Campari International yesterday exceeded the losses predicted in its latest
profits warning in January. The leisure and sportswear company ann-ounced a
pre-tax deficit of Pounds 8.6m for 1993 on dwindling turnover; it achieved
profits of Pounds 1.11m in 1992.
The directors saw little sign of optimism for this year. 'Sales and forward
order performance remains disappointing for the first half, with projected
revenue and contribution slightly below budget,' they said.
Campari has lost more than 80 per cent of its market capitalisation since
Wing Tai, the Singaporean textile group, bought a 29.9 per cent stake in
1990.
The impact of recession has led to a string of profit warnings, and the
share price closed 1p lower yesterday at 46p, having traded at 150p a year
ago.
Turnover fell 12 per cent to Pounds 47.5m (Pounds 54.2m). Excluding currency
movements, the decline was 8 per cent; sales to continental Europe account
for 74 per cent of the total.
Net assets fell 46 per cent to Pounds 12.4m, although the company still has
net cash of Pounds 400,000. The fall was partly due to the reduction of
stock levels from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 7.5m, including a Pounds 1.2m
provision for write-downs. There were also goodwill write-downs.
New management has been attempting to tackle costs. It has already
eliminated Pounds 4.4m from overheads, and is focusing on reducing the
number of suppliers and on tighter management of working capital.
Losses per share emerged at 83.2p (earnings of 0.79p). The dividend is
omitted; a total of 12p was paid in 1992.

FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Emap acquires Cap Nationwide for Pounds 18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap, the media group, yesterday announced its largest move so far into
information-based publishing with the Pounds 17.9m purchase of Cap
Nationwide Motor Research.
Cap specialises in the publication of vehicle price guides for cars, lorries
and motorcycles - information that is provided through monthly books,
computer disks and on-line services.
The Cap titles include the Black Book, covering car prices, the Red Book,
covering commercial vehicles, and the Green Book for motorcycle and marine
prices.
The deal is being paid for half in cash and half in loan stock.
In the year ended last September, Cap achieved profits before tax of Pounds
1.4m with more than 90 per cent of revenues coming from regular
subscriptions.
'Cap represents Emap's first acquisition in information-based publishing and
its biggest development in this market so far,' Mr Colin Morrison, chairman
of Emap Business Communications, said yesterday.
Since the acquisition two years ago of most of the titles of the Maxwell
Communication Group in a Pounds 32m deal, Emap has been expanding in the
sector.
Its business communications division, formed in February by bringing
together the business publishing and exhibition interests, has an annualised
turnover of some Pounds 100m.

FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rodime appeal after disk lawsuit setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rodime, the Scottish disk drive pioneer whose future depends on licensing
its technology and on successful claims against companies which infringe its
patents, has suffered an adverse judgment in a lawsuit with Quantum, the US
disk drive maker.
Rodime is to appeal against the judgment, but warns that failure could
reduce future licensing and patent infringement revenues.
It would significantly cut both the number of disk drive manufacturers using
Rodime technology without a licence and the volume of infringing disk drives
subject to royalties under Rodime's patents.
Mr Peter Bailey, managing director, admitted that if the appeal failed it
would be a 'severe setback' for Rodime.
Yesterday Rodime shares halved in value, falling 16 1/2 p to 15p. The shares
have attracted much speculative attention in recent months, reaching a peak
of 51 1/2 p, having been relisted at 1 3/4 p in August 1992.
The company had patented aspects of the 3 1/2 inch disk drive which it
pioneered but later ceased to manufacture.
The Minnesota district court, however, has now declared invalid certain
claims of Rodime's '383 US patent', its principal disk drive patent. Quantum
had sought a declaratory judgment on the patent.
Rodime said it was not clear what bearing the Quantum judgment would have on
its own lawsuit against Seagate, another US disk drive maker, which it is
suing for continued wilful patent infringement. In that lawsuit, before the
California district court, Seagate has filed an identical motion to that of
Quantum.
In 1993 Rodime incurred losses of Dollars 2.14m (Pounds 1.46m) before tax.
Yesterday it said its bankers had indicated that they would continue
providing working capital to fund litigation.
The company said it strongly believed, on legal advice, that the Minnesota
judge's order should not have been granted and will appeal to the federal
appeals court in Washington DC early next week. The appeal is expected to
take no more than a year.

FT  16 APR 94 / Legal jousting is the game of the Names: The scale of two
court victories by Lloyd's insurance market victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Sword-Daniels, a dentist who joined the Lloyd's of London
insurance market in 1987, this week cracked open a bottle of champagne. 'I
burst into tears,' he said, after celebrating the first good news since he
was warned, four years ago, that his investment had turned sour.
Two significant court victories this week offered a glimmer of hope for
thousands of members such as Mr Sword-Daniels, who are seeking compensation
to cope with crippling financial demands.
After several years of stress and personal tragedy a judgment in the High
Court on Wednesday brought some hope to individuals under pressure to pay
their share of the enormous losses at Lloyd's during the late 1980s.
In a second case, on the same day, the House of Lords ruled that two 'action
groups', representing members of some of the highest loss-making syndicates,
could sue the agents who acted for them.
'There are moments when you get so depressed it is like looking down the
barrel of a shot-gun,' said Mr Sword-Daniels, whose losses are now estimated
at more than Pounds 500,000.
He is one of two Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally
underwritten the insurance market, who was awarded damages in the High Court
against H G Poland, now called KMR Services, the members' agency which
looked after their interests at Lloyd's.
Mr Sword-Daniels says he had asked H G Poland to place him on underwriting
syndicates involved in conservative, low-risk business, but was in fact
placed with some of the highest-risk syndicates. Mr Richard Brown, the
second Name in the case, requested some higher risk business but claims his
agent still failed to provide adequate professional advice.
For distressed Names, who are deploying a variety of legal tactics in their
efforts to win compensation for heavy losses, the settlements were the first
sign that the tide might be turning in their favour.
They also set a precedent in that the award included not only compensation
payments in respect of past losses (the size is still to be decided in the
high court), but also a highly unusual indemnity against losses incurred in
the future.
The award was a fillip for Mr David Tiplady, of the law firm D J Freeman,
which represented Mr Brown and is overseeing similar claims by another 28
Names. He said he has been approached by other Names seeking to emulate Mr
Brown's success.
Mr John Startin of Hexstall, Mr Sword-Daniels' lawyer, said: 'It is an
important route if there is a serious hiccup with the group actions.'
However, the initial celebration among Lloyd's names after the High Court
case has been followed by a sober realisation that its impact will be
limited. Others seeking to follow the route taken by Mr Sword-Daniels and Mr
Brown will have to prove their cases on the individual merits of each,
demonstrating that their requests for conservative underwriting were
ignored.
That may be difficult, partly because few instructions from Names to
managing agents were committed to paper; most were conducted by word of
mouth. There is also the possibility that the members' agent will appeal.
As a result, Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group,
lays more stress on the second legal victory for Names this week  - won by
his group, along with the Feltrim Action group, in the House of Lords.
This threw out an attempt to block the action groups' claim that their
members' agents were contractually liable for negligent underwriting. It
cleared the way for the Gooda Walker case to begin in the High Court on
April 26, and the Feltrim case in October.
Mr Deeny represents more than 3,100 Names allocated to the four heavily
loss-making Gooda Walker underwriting syndicates on Lloyd's who are suing
for more than Pounds 600m.
But the Action Group's approach to litigation is different from that of Mr
Sword-Daniels and Mr Brown. They believe that, if they can prove that they
were the victims of negligent underwriting, this will lead automatically to
compensation for all the Names involved in their legal action. 'We just have
to prove that a few underwriters were negligent and that's it,' says Mr
Deeny.
He warned that the publicity surrounding the High Court decision risked
causing false expections: 'It could lead to hundreds or thousands of Names
trying the same approach, which is going to be a wasted effort.'
But it is too late for other Names to join the Gooda Walker and a number of
other action groups. 'The doors closed on our action last September,' said
Mr Deeny.
Moreover, Names who have not already begun legal proceedings will have to
wait for redress as the courts are clogging up with Lloyd's-related
litigation. 'Anybody who decided to begin today will go to the back of the
longest queue in the world,' said Mr Deeny.
Even for those who are in the action groups, Mr Deeny did not expect any
quick surrender from the members' agents. 'The errors and omissions insurers
(who cover Lloyd's agents against legal awards for negligence) dare not
settle. They take on every point, fight every issue and hope to burn out
some action groups.'
Mr Tiplady, Mr Brown's solicitor, added: 'If the agents fight every claim it
will be expensive and time-consuming. It's very nerve-wracking being
cross-examined.'
The only other legal option which might have been open to Names was to sue
Lloyd's for failing to regulate the market adequately. However, under the
act of parliament which sets the statutory framework for the insurance
market, Lloyd's is immune from litigation  - a point already upheld by the
courts.
There was one non-legal alternative: an omnibus out-of-court settlement
proposed by Lloyd's at the end of last year, which offered Pounds 900m to
cover claims of Pounds 3.2bn. At the time, Mr David Rowland, the chairman,
doubted whether Names would have the stamina to pursue legal action. But,
believing it was too small, Names voted in February to reject the
settlement.
However, even if the Names prove successful in winning their legal cases
against members' agents, there is a sting in the tail. Few are likely to
receive back all the money they seek because the value of members agents'
insurance cover is far less than the losses incurred by the Lloyd's market.
The first to win their cases may take the lions' share of the funds
available in what some Names describe as a 'dash for cash'.
Each claim that is settled will add to the demands being made on Names
because many are on syndicates that underwrote errors and omissions
business. Meanwhile, Lloyd's will continue to pursue the Names to meet their
obligations on the market. The likely result is that, alongside any lucky
Names able to win awards in time to pay off their debts, there will be many
losers.

FT  16 APR 94 / Rose blooms in Bosnian sunlight: The contrasting roles of
the UN commander and Lord Owen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is that Rose? But he looks so young]' The Bosnian woman's admiration was
shared by the soldiers on to whose armoured personnel carrier General Sir
Michael Rose had just made a spectacular leap. The general, who three days
earlier had called Nato into its first action against ground targets, has
become as popular with many Bosnian Moslems as Lord Owen, who followed him
out of his Sarajevo headquarters, is unpopular.
Indeed, the news of Lord Owen's arrival in Sarajevo on Wednesday morning had
been greeted with derision and dismay by Bosnian officials. They thought
that Lord Owen had been consigned to the dustbin of history two months ago,
at the time of the Nato ultimatum. Yet now, in the very week when Nato
aircraft had struck twice at Serb positions around the besieged enclave of
Gorazde, the EU mediator was back, accompanied by his silent UN sidekick Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg.
Lord Owen had, of course, merely stepped to the wings for these past two
months. It is true that since February little had been heard of the
international conference on former Yugoslavia (ICFY), of which he and Mr
Stoltenberg are co-chairmen. But Lord Owen has visibly enjoyed being back in
a media spotlight which during the past two months had deserted him in
favour of Mr Charles Redman and Mr Vitaly Churkin, the US and Russian
special envoys, and General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia.
But, says Lord Owen, the ICFY has never ceased to exist; all the
negotiations that have been going on are technically under its aegis. He had
always argued that the peace process could only make headway if governments,
especially the US and Russian governments, involved themselves in it. That
they have now done so he regards as a boost rather than a setback to ICFY's
work.
Meanwhile, Lord Owen has not been idle. In particular, he has kept in close
touch with Serbia's president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic. Both Serbia and the
Bosnian Serbs clearly see Lord Owen as more sympathetic to their interests,
or at least understanding of their concerns, than other western negotiators.
They see his reappearance on the scene as a sign that their tactics are
succeeding.
Clearly the Serbs were not pleased with the turn of events in Bosnia since
the Nato ultimatum in February. True, their compliance with the ultimatum
was made less humiliating by the simultaneous arrival of Russian troops in
Sarajevo; and the terms of the ceasefire in Sarajevo were not unfavourable
to Serb interests, as it has tended to consolidate Serb control of the
suburbs and environs of the city.
But Russia's failure to protest when Nato shot down four Serb aircraft for
violating the no-fly zone on February 28, followed the next day by the
US-brokered Moslem-Croat agreement, must have been a blow to the Serbs. For
most of the past year Serbs and Croats had been co-operating against the
Moslems in central Bosnia.
Now the Croats, though not actively fighting on the Moslem side, have become
benevolent neutrals. Supplies of all sorts can now reach the Moslems much
more easily from the coast, and the Bosnian army no longer has to fight two
enemies at once. This has enabled the Bosnian army to make small but
significant gains in north-central Bosnia at the Serbs' expense, notably
around Maglaj, which 'ceased to be an enclave and is now a finger, indeed a
swollen finger', in the words of the UN special representative, Mr Yasushi
Akashi.
Meanwhile the UN protection force (Unprofor), under Gen Rose's charismatic
leadership, has been interpreting its mandate in a more robust and muscular
way which the Serbs do not like. Although Gen Rose was not directly involved
in Nato's February ultimatum, he used it skilfully to increase his own
authority  - warning the Serbs that it was in their interest to co-operate
with him if they wished to avoid a direct confrontation with Nato.
Indeed during March the Bosnian Serbs were on the whole co-operative and
appeared genuinely anxious to avoid such a confrontation. But they may
simply have been postponing a showdown until they were ready for a spring
offensive in the area of greatest strategic concern to them: the largest
remaining Moslem enclave in the east of the country, which was also the only
one still effectively defended by government forces and from which the
Moslems were capable of harassing Serb communications between eastern and
southern Bosnia.
The Serbs have successfully kept westerners guessing about their
decision-making processes. Some western observers believe there are serious
divisions either between the political and military leaders among the
Bosnian Serbs, or between the Bosnian Serb leadership as a whole and Serbia
proper.
Others believe that Mr Milosevic keeps all the strings in his own hands, and
that the Gorazde offensive could not possibly have happened without his
approval if not active encouragement.
If the latter school is right, it may have been connected with Mr
Milosevic's concern about unrest in the Sandzak, a region shared between
Serbia and Montenegro (the two partners in the Yugoslav federation). The
Sandzak has a large Moslem population, some of whose leaders say openly that
they would like to join Sandzak to neighbouring Bosnia.
Similarly, observers disagree on whether the Serbs hoped or intended to
overrun Gorazde, or merely to neutralise it, as they have done with the
other eastern enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa. In the latter case, the
Bosnian Serbs are now close to realising their goal, and their brinkmanship
in staging a confrontation with Unprofor appears to have paid off.
By calling Gen Rose's bluff and obliging him to call in Nato airpower to
defend UN personnel, they have succeeded in putting him on the defensive.
Last week the general was bending over backwards to avoid escalating the
crisis.
He stressed that he had only called in 'close air support' to defend his own
men and not (as the next paragraph of the same UN Security Council
resolution allowed him) to defend the 'safe area' of Gorazde itself;
he pointed out that the Security Council had never defined the extent of the
safe area, implying that his mandate only obliged him to defend the town
itself and not the area round it;
he suggested that his forces had killed more Croats and Moslems than Serbs
by firing in self-defence in the course of the war;
he insisted that Unprofor is a neutral peacekeeping force and 'not here to
fight anybody's war';
and he even refused to display concern over the detention of UN observers in
Serb-held territory (which his spokesman described as 'an administrative
matter').
When reports reached Gen Rose on Thursday morning that the Serbs had begun
shelling Tuzla airfield  - which is in another safe haven and has UN troops
stationed on it  - it was clear that he had to weigh the pros and cons of
calling for further air strikes. Happily, in that case, the shelling stopped
after Nato planes had buzzed the area without dropping any bombs.
Last night, however, a grimmer moment of truth arrived. The Serbs renewed
their offensive in Gorazde, the Moslem defence crumbled, and the fall of the
town appeared imminent. Even worse, from Gen Rose's point of view, two of
his own cherished SAS soldiers, whom he put in to Gorazde two weeks ago to
monitor the battle and act as forward air controllers for eventual air
strikes, were seriously wounded; and a French reconnaissance plane was hit
by anti-aircraft fire.
How the UN and Nato would respond was still unclear last night. What did
seem clear, however, was that both Gen Rose and Lord Owen had underestimated
the destructive fury of the Bosnian Serbs.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Libraries go up for grabs' (April 13), makes fascinating
reading. It will be interesting to see whether contracting out the service
to 'bookish entrepreneurs' will achieve more than a well-run public service.
According to published figures, libraries in Brent cost each resident Pounds
15.60 a year and on average each person borrows five books a year. In
Hampshire, to take an example, the service costs each resident Pounds 11.22
and on average each person borrows 11 books a year. I do also wonder what
the 70 administrative staff saved in Brent were doing in the first place]

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CAROL TONGUE MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Goodhart's candid and accurate appraisal of the German social
market model ('There's still life in the old model', April 12) was
heartening, swamped as we often are by an insular and sometimes xenophobic
tabloid media in the UK.
The overriding message is that, to achieve change, partnership and consensus
are vital. Confrontation and adversity between various players in the UK has
often hindered constructive economic labour market change. In my east London
constituency I find an amazing willingness of key players, ie local
authorities, London East Training and Enterprise Council, social partners,
those from the voluntary sector and educational institutions, to work
together in developing projects that will advance economic and social
regeneration.
I hope it will be this model of regional partnership, a model supported by
the European Commission, that will ensure successful economic and social
renewal, based on the consent of all interested parties.

FT  16 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nothing clear-cut about exporters'
agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr S L SIDKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article concerning the new commercial agents regulations
('Representative selection', April 5) suggests that from January 1 key
exporters have reason to fear that their overseas agents may challenge them
in the British courts. Unfortunately this situation is far from being as
clear-cut as the article makes out.
The reason for this lies in a particular provision inserted almost at the
last moment into the regulations which were made last December. This change
provides that the regulations apply in relation to the activities of agents
in Great Britain. At the same time, it is stated that the regulations do not
apply if the parties have agreed that the agency contract is to be governed
by the law of another member state.
What is to happen where a UK exporter appoints an agent in, for example,
Greece under an agency contract subject to English law is unstated. It would
appear that the regulations will not apply and the English courts will not
be able to entertain actions based on them.
On this basis, UK exporters have little to fear. The difficulty arises where
local law in the agent's country seeks to supersede English law in order to
provide protection to the agent in a situation where the regulations do not
provide it.
This is not a new situation for UK exporters. We have for many years been
faced with this difficulty in certain European countries, particularly
Germany.
UK exporters now have a choice. They may take advantage of this lacuna in
the regulations and hope that local law cannot intervene to protect the
agent. Alternatively their agency contracts may expressly adopt the
regulations. This would be on the basis that it is possible by contract to
avoid the excesses of the protection which the regulations give to agents.

FT  16 APR 94 / Strike] A good hit: An upsurge for tenpin bowling companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Menacing, robotic creatures rush at visitors to Bass's new tenpin bowling
centre in Washington, Tyne and Wear. Customers with steady aim can squeeze
the trigger and watch the aggressors explode.
Those who find this too frightening can take off their virtual reality masks
and play a more conventional video game, or have something to eat or drink -
or do some tenpin bowling.
By adding new activities such as virtual reality games to their traditional
offerings, tenpin bowling companies have enjoyed a large upsurge in activity
since the mid-1980s, after nearly two decades of declining attendances.
In the 1960s, there were over 130 bowling centres in the UK. By the
mid-1980s, there were fewer than 50. There are now more than 200. A report
by Mintel, the research organisation,published last year, found that 10.4
per cent of the adult population were active tenpin bowlers, against 2.1 per
cent in 1985.
Over the past year or two, operators say the bowling business has become
more difficult as the recession has cut consumer spending and as the novelty
of the new electronic games has begun to wear off.
Companies such as Bass and First Leisure are, however, continuing to invest
in new centres. Mr John Conlan, First Leisure's chief executive, says one of
the solutions to the drop in spending is to change the electronic games
every few months so that regular customers do not become bored.
Mr Conlan, whose company has recently opened new centres in Reading and
Maidenhead, believes the solid customer base established by the bowling
industry makes it an attractive long-term business.
Tenpin bowling itself has not changed much over the past 20 or 30 years. The
lanes, the balls and the bowling shoes all look much as they did decades
ago. Old-time bowlers will notice some differences, however. They will no
longer have to mark the number of pins they knock down on a card; computers
will do it for them, showing the score on a screen.
Another innovation are rails that can be pulled out at the sides of bowling
lanes to prevent balls rolling into the gutters. These are used by novice
bowlers and by the children's parties which are an increasingly important
part of the bowling centres' business.
At some of the new centres, bowlers can tap an order onto a computer
keyboard and have fast food or drinks delivered to them while they play.
Apart from electronic games, some of the centres have pool tables. At First
Leisure's new Maidenhead centre, customers can wander through rooms
decorated to resemble the medieval past or the high-technology future,
playing games based on the Channel 4 programme the Crystal Maze.
Only about 50 per cent of a bowling centre's turnover now comes from
bowling, according to Mr Adam Fowle, managing director of Bass Leisure
Entertainments. The rest comes from food, drink and the other activities.
The success of bowling centres since the 1980s has resulted from the leisure
companies' strategy of turning them into places people go for an evening
out, rather than for a single activity, he adds.
Many of the new bowling centres are next to shopping malls. Bass's
Washington bowling centre has one of the company's bingo halls next to it.
First Leisure's Reading bowling centre is next door to one of its
discotheques. Many of the discotheque customer drop into the bowling centre
for a drink.
Mr Fowle says research carried out by his group indicates that, to attract
people to bowling centres or other leisure facilities, companies have to
offer their customers security against crime. It is not their personal
safety people are worried about; it is the fear of what might happen to
their cars while they are bowling, drinking or eating.
The Washington centre car park is surrounded by fearsome looking spiked
railings. It is well-lit and watched by cameras and security guards.
Mr Fowle says: 'It's a question of getting into the minds of people that
this is not a place to steal cars. The police say that, if you establish
this straight away, it doesn't develop into a problem.'
Mr Fowle says there are few security problems inside bowling centres.
Security guards and cameras play their part. But he says more important is
the presence of families and children, which acts as a deterrent to
aggression despite the free availability of alcohol.
Mr Fowle says 80 per cent of his group's bowling customers are under 35 and
from an ABC1 background. On average, they spend Pounds 15 a head per visit
to the bowling centre.
Other bowling groups regard this figure as high. They say Pounds 5 a head is
more typical and argue that bowling appeals to a wide cross-section of
people: competitive bowlers, families with children and teenagers.
Mr Roger Mavity, chief executive of the leisure division of Grenada, which
has 24 bowling centres, says: 'Increasingly, the ABC categories are not
relevant to these kinds of activities. Most teenagers have a level of
disposable income that would have been impossible to imagine if you turned
the clock back a generation.'
Bowling's appeal is helping to return the industry to growth again, he says.
But he cautions: 'Trying to look too far ahead in leisure is difficult.
Tastes can change faster than five-year plans allow for.'

FT  16 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A solution to Russia's ills requires
common sense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor IRA SOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Despite enormous pressure from governments of the Grou of Seven
industrial countries (possibly with the exception of Japan), the
International Monetary Fund is to be congratulated for limiting the loss -
only Dollars 1.5bn this time - from the most recent tranche of ill-conceived
and poorly-administered disbursements to 'rescue' Russia. If the west had
signed on to the plan advocated by Jeffrey Sachs (Personal View, March 31)
over the past few years the losses could have escalated to 10 or even 100
times that amount.
Russia does not need a stabilisation fund, debt relief or, worst of all,
charity. What is in short supply is common sense and truth. Russia has
enormous mineral and agricultural resources. It needs to be told, preferably
by domestic experts, that the country is bankrupt (to use Professor Sachs's
analogy) because its world-class assets are under-performing, or worse,
non-performing.
If the Russians want to enjoy the marvellous benefits of modern technology -
that is,increases in the material standard of living - they are going to
have to find their niche in the fiercely competitive world economy, as have
Taiwan, South Korea and, more recently, Chile and Mexico. They must also
produce goods at internationally competitive prices and acceptable quality
standards.
If their current bankrupt 'system' of industrial organisation, labour
relations, public finance, property rights and government intrusions in
economic life - not to mention what passes for fiscal and monetary policies
 -prevents them from getting closer to this objective, it is obvious what
has to be done.
Throwing good money at a failed system flies in the face of common sense.

FT  16 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: DSS view of cards not a smart
marketing move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER G THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The failure of the government's efficiency unit to swing the social
security department behind 'smart' cards suggests it should improve its
customer marketing focus ('DSS resists identity card scheme for benefit
claims', April 14).
Rather than position this initiative as a means of reducing benefits fraud
the real potential for a citizens' smart card would lie in the avoidance of
the seemingly endless and repetitive form-filling of personal data
associated with most people's contacts with government-run institutions.
The value of the time potentially saved by the many could far exceed the
savings from eliminating fraud by the few]
By emphasising the advantages to consumers of public services (and even
making the card optional), civil liberties concerns need not be more acute
than those relating to other forms of smart plastic which are gaining
consumer acceptance.

FT  16 APR 94 / Leading Article: Chancellor drops a veil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke inspires almost as much nervousness in
the City as he does among the ranks of the Eurosceptics on the Tory
backbenches. Yet time and again he has shown a capacity not only to
surprise, but to swim with the tide of bien pensant economic opinion. Having
set out to rebalance the economy with an unexpectedly draconian fiscal
package in his first Budget last November, he has now voluntarily ceded an
element of control over the conduct of monetary policy to the Bank of
England. That is the main implication of his decision this week to accept
the recommendation of the Treasury Select Committee to publish the minutes
of his monthly meeting with the governor, Mr Eddie George.
True, it would have been a much bigger surprise if Mr Clarke had been the
one arguing for restraint before February's compromise decision to cut
interest rates by a quarter of a point. Instead the minutes confirm that the
chancellor's bias is on the side of growthmanship, while Mr George's
predilection is for the central bankerly hair shirt. This week it was the
chancellor's preference that appeared to gain in plausibility, on the basis
of lower-than-expected retail price inflation numbers. Such a pleasant
further surprise on the inflation front suggests that price competition in
the retail sector remains fierce and that the disinflationary story that
ceased to excite the markets back in February is by no means over and done
with.
Downward move
The chancellor could also argue  - and no doubt will  - that the recent
slide in equities and bonds has, in itself, contributed to a tightening of
monetary conditions by causing the cost of capital to rise. Since early
February, UK gilt yields have risen more than comparable yields in any other
country in the Group of Seven, apart from Canada. That is no compliment to
the credibility of British economic policymaking. But taken together with
the Bundesbank's decision to cut both the Lombard rate and the discount rate
on Thursday, it does suggest that the case for a further downward move in UK
rates has strengthened.
Yet the behaviour of the markets also underlines the limits to the
discretion enjoyed by the 'authorities'  - the appropriately opaque
collective noun under which the perpetrators of UK monetary policy have
traditionally cloaked their joint identity. The monetary tightening imposed
by the markets over the past two months has more than offset the loosening
over which Messrs Clarke and George argued so robustly. In a global capital
market, policy credibility is judged minute by minute. One false move and
investors will take away at the long end of the bond market what the
chancellor has tried to give away at the short end.
Moreover, against the background of an overhang of debt from the late 1980s,
the potency of monetary policy does not work symmetrically in terms of its
ability to curb or stimulate economic activity.
Genteel recovery
A fall in nominal short-term interest rates from 15 per cent in late 1990 to
5 1/4 per cent today has so far produced a very genteel recovery. Yet a
small increase in rates could exert a disproportionately depressing effect
on demand because the personal sector has failed to spend its improving cash
flow on reducing its borrowings. From its 1990 peak to the end of last year,
debt as a proportion of the personal sector's income fell from 116 per cent
to just 111 per cent.
There is, as Ian Shepherdson of Greenwell Montagu points out, a positive
side to the personal sector's balance sheet vulnerability. When the time
comes to confront genuine inflationary pressure in the economy, monetary
tightening will need to be much less aggressive than in the late 1980s
because of the debt sensitivity. But in an economy with spare capacity, that
is not the chancellor's present worry. On the fiscal front, meantime, the
markets are also on their guard for any signs of backsliding.
While the current year's public sector borrowing requirement is expected to
come in well under target, next year is another challenge. The Treasury is
already making the ritual hostile noises about the public spending round: no
room for pre-electoral tax cuts without better departmental housekeeping now
is the line.
Yet the striking feature of UK fiscal policy is how Mr John Major's
political weakness has reduced his ability to stand up to the spending
pressures around Whitehall. At the same time the campaign to reverse the
secular upward trend in public spending through fundamental expenditure
reviews appears to have lost impetus. The promise of Mr Michael Portillo,
the chief secretary to the Treasury, to set a large cat among the
free-spending pigeons now seems strangely unthreatening to the more
profligate ministers.
The picture of Mr Clarke that emerges from the newly published minutes is of
a robust chancellor who feels he is in charge. Yet there is a growing sense
of drift in his own fiscal backyard. He may need to surprise us yet again
before too long.

FT  16 APR 94 / Hard to make a sum of the parts: Jurek Martin asks whether
Clinton has an overall strategy for foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The very senior White House official was in a reflective mood this week. Of
course the US had 'clear strategic goals' for foreign policy - and he ticked
them off as any good adviser should  - but he conceded this was a whole new
world, lacking any 'existential' threat. 'We really are making case law as
we go along, setting precedents'. Even the most intractable peacekeeping
problems, in nations tearing themselves apart, had to be seen not in
isolation but as components of a whole. A document under preparation, known
as Presidential Directive 13, would make the connections, he said.
There has rarely been a trickier time to define the whole than now. In the
last week alone President Bill Clinton's foreign policy plate has been piled
ever higher with disparate courses  - Bosnia, Russia, Ukraine, North Korea,
China, Japan, Rwanda, Haiti, even the accidental shooting down of US
helicopters by US jets over Iraq  - each commanding attention but all
demanding apparently different responses. It is a menu which could test the
limits of coherence.
It also tests a president whose background and passions are not in foreign
affairs. As public opinion polls consistently show, this does not render his
country uncomfortable, though it distresses the foreign policy
establishment. Les Gelb, one of its pillars both as a former New York Times
columnist and now as head of the private Council on Foreign Relations,
sniffed in a recent article that the country might be 'content', but there
were 'smouldering concerns' among the 'experts and pundits' which he pleaded
with Mr Clinton to address by providing a strategic vision of US leadership.
The Gelb hypothesis, allied to the drumbeat of attacks on individual members
of the president's foreign policy team, has been a constant refrain for a
year. One well-known Harvard professor last month began a lecture on
'Clinton's foreign policy' with the words: 'This may be the shortest seminar
on record.' Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, was pilloried for
having been 'humiliated' yet again, this time by the Chinese crackdown on
dissidents when he was in Beijing last month. William Perry, the new
secretary of defence, took some hits for saying he could not conceive of a
military intervention in Gorazde, a week before US Nato jets bombed Bosnian
Serb emplacements.
The administration mostly responds by restating a handful of its
fundamentals, especially the linkage of domestic and foreign policy, by
putting economics in the front rank of diplomacy. This approach is not
trouble-free, with many of the US's leading trading partners suspicious of
any lapse into mercantilism, a charge that US officials dismiss as nonsense.
But the president's last big foreign policy speech was in Brussels in
January and it was aimed at Europeans, not Americans. Anthony Lake, national
security adviser, did speak with precision about Bosnia 10 days ago and so
did Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary of commerce, on China policy in a
carefully vetted speech supporting the Christopher line last Monday. Yet
mostly there is an inclination not to mix it on the opinion pages but to get
on with business at hand.
The view from the inside, culled from a series of interviews with
unidentifiable administration officials this week, does in fact look
different, even allowing for the inevitable spin. But the broad message is
also endorsed by one influential western ambassador, who argues that the
president and his men are now getting their foreign policy act together
better.
Each item on the long laundry list of issues, however, has the potential for
becoming seriously soiled again. None is more immediately caught in the
wringer than China  - 'in a jumpy mood', according to one official  - with
Mr Clinton's own deadline for the renewal of most favoured nation (MFN)
trading status less than two months off. Contrary to much speculation that
the US is looking for a way off the hook of the president's insistence that
China improve its human rights policy in order to retain trade benefits, the
current Washington word is deliberately different.
'Whatever you think about linkage,' said one official, 'there is an
executive order of the president, which is a commitment.' Sanctions falling
short of cancelling MFN present legal and practical problems, said another,
'though it may not be harmful to have the Chinese know that there are
intermediate options'. There was nothing by way of concession in Mr Garten's
speech, even though he represents the government department most sensitive
to US business interests. Speaking in the presence of China's trade
minister, he stated: 'It must be said that bonds between China and the US
are not based solely on commercial considerations.'
But the official who found China 'jumpy' detected 'no spillover' from MFN
into Beijing's willingness to help solve the problem of North Korea's
nuclear ambitions. The US has little idea exactly what China is doing to put
pressure on Pyongyang, but 'it is a clear question of Chinese self-interest
 - they want North Korea to be reasonable and they want us to be patient' by
not demanding UN sanctions.
In fact the UN and International Atomic Energy Agency clocks are ticking,
with the Security Council due to consider North Korea again next month.
Still, officials insist the US will do nothing hasty, offsetting the stick
of sanctions with the carrot of a third round of bilateral negotiations.
Though its messages change almost daily, the latest from Kim Il-Sung's
redoubt at least emphasised jaw not war.
A similar qualified optimism even applies to Russia  - and not only because
Moscow's adverse reaction this week to the Nato air strikes on Bosnian Serbs
was considered modest. An administration specialist on the Russian economy
suspects Vik-tor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, is 'beginning to hold it
together' economically and politically. He has been bolstered by the Dollars
1.5bn IMF credit and by private telephoned consultation with US
vice-president Al Gore.
Mr Chernomyrdin's political position in the centre, on this view, keeps the
old communists from collaborating with Vladimir Zhirinovsky's nationalists
more effectively than would a purely reform-ist government.
The official also denies any disarray in administration policies towards
Russia, which seemed to be reflected in a far harder line on economic reform
by the Treasury than by the state department, specifically by Strobe
Talbott, the Russian expert and now deputy secretary. 'Strobe may have been
too cute by half' with his 'less shock, more therapy' pronouncement last
December, but reports of policy differences were 'so overblown'.
Through the mediation of Vitaly Churkin, its special envoy, Russia is still
being helpful on Bosnia, but the US approach is to a degree at the mercy of
daily circumstances, highlighted in a week which began with Nato air strikes
and ended on a mixed note. Mr Churkin's efforts to get the Bosnian Serbs
back to negotiations offered hope if endorsed by Moscow, but some UN
peacekeepers were held quasi-hostage, Sarajevo came under sniper fire again
and hostilities threatened to break out in other Moslem enclaves.
But at least Mr Lake, in a speech last week, sought to provide some
underlying guidance on when the US might intervene and how. 'Direct threats
to our nation or our people require us to be prepared for a unilateral
military response. Iraq's attempted assassination of President Bush fell
into this category and we did not hesitate to respond on our own.
'A second category justifies only a limited use of force and generally under
international auspices. Peacekeeping would generally fall under this
category. A third category may require our strong diplomatic engagement but
not the deployment of our forces.'
Mr Lake's formulation does not answer every question. The administration has
already imposed tight conditions on the dispatch of any US peacekeeping
contingent to Bosnia (in his second category) and, even if they are met, no
troops would leave without some form of approval from Congress. The senior
White House official drew lessons from congressional endorsement ahead of
the Gulf war. 'I'm not say ing that, in legal or constitutional terms, we
have to have congressional support, . . . but the Gulf model is very much in
the mind of congressional leaders who are now more open to the idea of
Bosnian involvement than before.'
Such an assertion may be debated. The Gorazde air strikes were welcomed by
some long-standing critics of US Bosnian policy, such as the New York Times.
But they also brought a welter of contradictory warnings about being too
little to make a difference (from Laurence Eagleburger, former secretary of
state and long sceptical of intervention) and about slippery slopes (mostly
from isolationists on both left and right). Pictures of the slaughter in
Rwanda and the accident in Iraq also do nothing for the cause of
humanitarian intervention.
It is also far from clear how the Lake formula on US intervention would be
applied to Haiti, which is rapidly moving again to the front burner of
foreign policy problems. The pressure on the administration to 'do
something' about the military regime in Port-au-Prince escalated this week
in the face of growing evidence of atrocities. Randall Robinson, respected
head of the Transafrica Forum, a Washington lobby, started a hunger strike
by accusing the president of moral bankruptcy. Congressman David Obey from
Wisconsin, no gung-ho firebrand, demanded that the US invade Haiti to
restore democracy.
All this is not coming from the foreign policy ivory towers but from Mr
Clinton's friends, which hurts. It is also coming from states such as
Florida, which this week sued the federal government to recover some of the
costs it has born in sustaining hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants,
many from Haiti. This administration says that it always listens to domestic
voices on foreign policy  - Mr Clinton certainly did to the Greek lobby
protesting at US recognition of Macedonia.
Applying a grand policy vision to all the above, not to mention Japan's
political dramas, would be a tall order. But at least Mr Clinton and his
team might be consoled by the fact that the grand old man of US diplomacy
does not think it necessary. George Kennan, the diplomat-scholar, reflected
at a 90th birthday party recently on what advice long-dead great statesmen
might give the current generation grappling with an array of problems. 'Each
has to be judged on its merit. Discard, then, this traditional American
fondness for trying to solve problems by putting them into broad categories.
What you need are not policies  - much less a single policy. What you need
are sound principles . . . that accord with the nature, the needs, the
interests and the limitations of our country.' Good advice, but easier said
than done.

FT  16 APR 94 / Man in the News: Deal-maker with a dark side - FT writers on
a disappearing property wunderkind / Jurgen Schneider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES, DAVID WALLER and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until this week, the most obviously fake element in the make-up of Jurgen
Schneider was his highly mobile toupee. A businessman facing ruin after this
week's disappearance of Germany's top-rank property king  - leaving a heap
of debts so far estimated at around DM5bn  - recalls a recent social
encounter with the wandering hairpiece.
'I was chatting away to him, mesmerised by that appalling rug, watching it
sliding slowly forwards. His wife pretended to pat him on the back of the
head and, believe you me, watching it slide back up was pretty unnerving,'
he says. 'Now he's pulled the rug on me.'
Just one of thousands of contractors  - architects, engineers, builders and
furnishers  - facing hefty losses or worse from Schneider's difficulties, he
remains philosophical. 'All my research told me he was dodgy, but I took a
chance.'
He was not the only one concerned about the vanishing Frankfurter's
credibility. Managers at a leading non-German bank were approached for a
loan last summer. But its credit committee had heard too much on the
grapevine and turned him down.
Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chairman of Commerzbank, badly burned in Britain's
Canary Wharf fiasco, said yesterday that Schneider had approached his credit
department to top up existing loans of a good DM100m. He was turned away on
the basis of information he supplied.
Contractors, architects, consulting engineers and other suppliers based
around his palatial headquarters in Konigstein have long refused to do
business with him. They freely accuse him of highly dubious methods to raise
financing and, above all, to avoid paying his bills.
One creditor, who claims to have an unpaid invoice for DM3.25m, says the
slightest fault in completed work could lead to a refusal to pay. Payment
delays of six months are said not to have been uncommon.
Authoritative German media reports suggest this was among the most common of
his tactics: squeezing over-blown credits out of his big lenders by
presenting them with inflated estimates of the rentable area  - and
therefore the potential rental income  - in his 75 grandiose retail, hotel
and office projects.
None of this appears to have troubled Schneider's Konigsteiner neighbours:
the front-rank German bankers and folk who until this week shared with him
the pleasures of life in the Taunus hills above Frankfurt, and this week
declared themselves 'thunderstruck'.
Bankers may have been impressed by his legendary tight-fistedness with
creditors, but they apparently failed to consider that it might have
signalled something more sinister than assiduous cost control: liquidity
problems.
If they had cared to listen, they might have heard the rumblings back in
1992, when he broke for the first time with his tradition of renovating
grand buildings and letting them at grand prices. He sold the
centrally-placed Furstenhof office building in Frankfurt to a Japanese group
for an estimated DM450m. That building, incidentally, stood empty until
recently and is now rented by Dresdner Bank, which, it emerged this week is
one of Schneider's leading creditors.
The banks might also have weighed their outstanding credits against
Schneider's income forecasts in the light of a steady softening in German
rents over the past 18 months. CIP, his group's management arm - believed to
be 30 per cent controlled by Schneider himself and 70 per cent by an
anonymous foundation  - still claims 'going' prices for retail space in
central Leipzig are DM200 a square metre. Rivals, on the other hand, suggest
DM120 to DM150 is closer to the mark.
Other signs of possible trouble included his decision last year dramatically
to slow for six months all work on one of his grandest designs  - the
restoration of Wiesbaden's Rose Hotel. Last February, Schneider attracted
unwelcome attention when a group of trade creditors went to court and
successfully forced him to pay up.
A qualified construction engineer, the 59-year-old Schneider only attracted
the wider public gaze after unification in 1990, when he moved quickly to
pick up prime but dilapidated properties in eastern cities like Leipzig.
Before that, he had built up his business more quietly from a small start in
1981. The family concern, headed by his father, Richard, closed in the late
1980s. Industry observers say the closure was followed by a worsening of
relations between the two men.
The conclusion now being drawn by observers is that the banks felt they
could ignore rumour and rumblings  - common enough at the best of times in
the property business  - secure in the knowledge that their debts, thought
to be the lion's share of the total which has so far come to light, were
secured against 80-odd of the classiest properties and sites in Germany.
The conclusions being drawn by unsecured creditors and their employees are
less complacent. 'The so-and-so has left us high and dry,' said a workman
collecting his tools from the stilled Bartels Hof site in Leipzig. 'There we
were, thinking the great man from the west would come with money and jobs
and make the city a great place. Now look what has happened . . .'
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, not noted for his sensitivity, has for once been
quick to pick up on the scale of the crisis facing the thousands of
employees and unsecured creditors.
With one eye on federal elections and another on the recent near-catastrophe
in which banks prevented the collapse of the Metallgesellschaft group only
with a DM3.4bn rescue package, he reminded the banks their responsibilities
extended beyond their profit and loss accounts. He also ordered a review of
insolvency laws which can leave unsecured creditors with no real recourse.
Schneider, meanwhile, has disappeared without leaving any evident trail.
Colourful press speculation say he and his wife, Claudia, plus baggage, his
favoured Gucci shoes and other trappings (including spare wigs), could be
anywhere between Switzerland, Barbados and Iran, depending on the range of
his private jet.
He has also left the wreckage of the ingenious corporate structure he
erected within his privately-held empire which only now may come under real
public scrutiny.
According to a creditor with more than two years experience of Schneider's
eccentric ways, the main parts of the business present two contrasting
faces. The dark side is represented by Technoteam, a contracting division
owned by the man himself. 'They have a terrific reputation for getting the
job done by squeezing and beating the hell out of sub-contractors,' the
contractor says.
But they appear not to be so efficient at the subtler business of
controlling overall contract costs. That may in part be due to the erratic
ways of Schneider himself, who last year, part-way through the Wiesbaden
Rose Hotel project decided that instead of a five-star hotel with 220 rooms,
it should be a 77-room super-luxury hostelry  - 'the best in Europe,' he
said.
He also decided a three-level underground car park would enhance it even
further. The hole was accordingly dug and equipped with mechanical lifts and
gear for getting cars in and out, at an estimated cost of DM10m. Only later
did Schneider realise that guests leaving a 150-head corporate dinner party
might not appreciate three-minute delay incurred in getting a single car in
or out.
The more acceptable face of the group was represented in the world outside
the hurly-burly of the building site by CIP, which managed and let completed
properties, and is now the vehicle which creditor banks hope to use to
salvage the maximum from the wreckage. 'They seemed very competent,' one
source says, adding that Schneider himself was also a far less dramatic
character than some would have the world believe. 'No, he was very calm,
almost paternal. He was hard but fair . . . Hard on his team, too. Directors
were expected to be at his morning meetings by 6am and ready to start 'work'
at 7am.'
But at top-level negotiations on contracts, he was invariably flanked by a
tough young lieutenant, who often gave the impression he was a lawyer  - an
impression blurred by his penchant for 'simplistic, brutal contracts', not
to mention a tendency to thump the table and yell.
In contacts with the outside world, the veneer was perfected by Schneider's
demeanour and the reputation of an aide from the noble von Lambsdorff
family, internationally known thanks to the political career of Otto, former
leader of the Liberal Democrat family.
But the polish has been brutally scraped away by the events of this week.
The empire which supported Schneider's extravagant habits and the
foundations and bursaries which lent him a philanthropical air has been
exposed as just another of his many unfinished projects  - an impressive
facade on the outside with a big hole behind it.

FT  16 APR 94 / Ashdown urges free information on uses of taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called for full
hypothecation, or earmarking, of tax revenues to help overcome public
distrust of politicians.
Delivering the Williamson memorial lecture at Stirling University, Mr
Ashdown said that only a 'fundamental change' in the way politics was
conducted could restore public trust in government.
'Finding ways to recreate a sense of value for taxation must be a central
element in rebuilding confidence in, and reconnecting people with, the
political process,' he said.
'There is no reason why the government, on its tax demands, should not
follow the directive it has given to town halls to set out where individual
taxpayers' money goes.
'Then we could go further, with public spending generally aspiring to the
clarity and symmetry of a road toll  - a specific charge levied to maintain
a specific facility.'
Mr Ashdown said the aim should be 'that taxpayers see themselves as the
nation's shareholders  - required to come to a consensus decision, not on
how much money to contribute to a pool from which random sums are later
drawn, but on whether to set aside particular sums for clearly defined
purposes'.
Mr Ashdown's comments represent the clearest commitment by any of the main
political parties to hypothecation. They also mark a significant advance on
the Liberal Democrats 1992 general election manifesto, which limited the
party's commitment to earmarking to education spending.
The government remains strongly opposed to hypothecation, mainly because of
strong opposition from the Treasury, which fears that earmarking would
reduce the flexibility of economic policy and make public spending cuts
harder to achieve.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, has indicated sympathy for limited
hypothecation, but the Labour party is unlikely to commit itself before the
conclusion of its policy reviews.

FT  16 APR 94 / Boost for Labour's reflationary activists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour activists pressing for a strongly reflationary economic policy were
given a substantial boost yesterday when Mr John Edmonds, general secretary
of the GMB general workers' union, accepted presidency of the Full
Employment Forum.
The forum, founded by Mr Bryan Gould, MP for Dagenham, has campaigned
strongly for a big increase in borrowing to reflate economic demand and a
more relaxed approach to inflation.
Mr Edmonds said he had agreed to replace Mr Gould, who is returning to his
native New Zealand, to help maintain pressure on Labour to put full
employment 'at the top of the policy agenda.'
Mr Edmonds was careful to minimise differences between himself and the
leadership, noting that he was 'encouraged' by recent statements on economic
policy by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor.
However, he endorsed Mr Gould's call for the next Labour government to
increase borrowing by 'about' Pounds 10bn above the level inherited from the
Conservatives, including the release of accumulated local authority capital
receipts.
Echoing the leadership, Mr Edmonds said it was not reasonable for the
government to demand detailed economic policies at this stage of the
electoral cycle.
However, he also backed leftwing pressure on the leadership to set targets
for investment and cuts in unemployment during the life of the next Labour
government. He emphasised that 'the policy of full employment must be
credible in every sense'.

FT  16 APR 94 / PM's secret pals forced on display
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major may be increas-ingly friendless at Westminster, but he still
has some well-heeled, if secretive, friends in the business world.
They struck a bizarre blow for the embattled prime minister yesterday,
paying Pounds 4,212 for a two-column advertisement in The Times to honour
the second anniversary of his 1992 general election victory.
The advertisement consisted of a reprint of last Saturday's Financial Times
editorial comment on Mr Major  - which cost the well-heeled supporters a
further Pounds 350 plus VAT in syndication fees. But the stunt backfired,
mainly because of the businessmen's attempts to hide their identity, signing
the advertisement 'the friends of the prime minister'.
The advertisement was placed by Mr Alan Gold, a London public relations
consultant, for a group called Friends of the Conservative Party, based in
Fortune Green Road, north-west London. The building's occupants, a
professional photographer and a firm of chartered accountants, denied all
knowledge of the group.
Eventually, it emerged that the advertisement was paid for by Mr Benjamin
Perl, a businessman who runs Foframes, a photograph frames manufacturer in
Mr Major's Huntingdon constituency. Mr Perl is understood to be a friend and
admirer of the prime minister. Associates said he felt Mr Major was being
badly treated by MPs and parts of the press.
But political observers were mystified by his choice of the FT leader as
support for Mr Major. Some thought it was a hoax, partly because of a series
of spelling mistakes which did not occur in the original.
The leader credited Mr Major with achievements on inflation, Ireland and
Europe, but also noted the humiliation of Britain's ejection from the
European exchange rate mechanism, and the shortcomings of the back-to-basics
and law and order campaigns.
It concluded: 'Mr Major will always lack charisma and his last two years
have been unfortunate, occasionally inept.'
A statement issued through Mr Gold said that Mr Perl and his associates
'read and respect both The Times and the FT, but felt that the FT's
editorial deserved a wider readership'. It added: 'The fact that that the
editorial gave a fair and balanced viewpoint in no way diminishes their
unqualified support for and admiration of Mr Major.'
The prime minister appeared less than impressed by Mr Perl's efforts.
Downing Street said he was 'bemused and surprised' by the advertisement.

FT  16 APR 94 / Fierce street fights loom in leafy suburbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ealing, Enfield, Brent, Croydon  - for most people, these names conjure up
little more than quiet, leafy and nondescript suburbs of London. But over
the next three weeks, the boroughs on the outskirts of the capital will be
the focus of some of the most intense local election campaigning.
The outer London boroughs comprise the last large patch of Conservative blue
on the local authority electoral map of the UK. In 1990, the last time
London took part in local elections, the Conservatives lost ground around
the country but retained control of 13 of the capital's 32 borough councils.
Suburban boroughs, such as Croydon, have never been anything other than
Conservative. Others, such as Barnet, are archetypal Tory territory. To lose
them would be disastrous for the party's image at a time when it holds only
one county council.
According to Professor Patrick Dunleavy, of the London School of Economics:
'The Conservative London boroughs have represented an important bridgehead
for the party in local government.' Serious Tory losses would worry the many
MPs with constituencies in these areas, adding to pressures on Mr John
Major's leadership.
For Labour, the campaign also poses a difficult challenge. The party's
defeat in the last general election was largely put down to its inability to
make headway in the affluent south of England. If it were unable to take
many of the Tories' council seats, doubts about Labour's electability in the
south would intensify.
The Tories hold several of the London councils by small majorities. In
Ealing, which went Tory in 1990, Labour needs five seats to gain control. In
Enfield it needs three.
A single-figure swing against the Conservatives in London could lose them
Harrow, Croydon and Redbridge. Doublefigure swings would dislodge them from
Barnet, Bexley and Bromley.
The nature of the contest will vary from borough to borough. In Croydon and
Enfield, a straight, old-fashioned contest is expected between Labour and
the Conservatives. Labour believes this is fertile ground, containing
middle-class voters who were Labour supporters in the 1960s.
In the more affluent suburbs of Sutton, Harrow and Barnet, the Liberal
Democrats will be very strong challengers to the Tories. In Labour-held
Greenwich, a strong showing by the Liberal Democrats could create a hung
council. In Kingston-upon-Thames, the Liberal Democrats have the best chance
of wresting the council from the Conservatives.
A strong showing by the Liberal Democrats at the expense of Labour may help
reduce the Conservatives' embarrassment in the face of serious losses. Prof
Dunleavy says: 'At the end of the day, the Tories might still contain the
misery of their defeat by saying 'Look what happened to Labour'.'

FT  16 APR 94 / Judge raises Maxwell insider dealing fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New evidence has emerged that Robert Maxwell was using share dealings with
company pension schemes to earn profits for his private interests long
before financial pressures threatened his empire.
As a result, the pension schemes may have a higher claim on the assets of
Maxwell Communication Corporation in liquidation than other creditors had
believed.
A High Court judge, meanwhile, has raised the possibility that Maxwell may
have had inside information when he made the share dealings more than seven
years ago.
The events in 1986 and 1987 have only come to light after a dispute between
the trustees to the Maxwell company pension schemes and Price Waterhouse,
administrators to MCC.
High Court documents show that pension schemes controlled by Maxwell bought
shares in Beecham, the drugs company, from Philip Hill Investment Trust
(PHIT) in September 1986, a week before Maxwell's British Printing and
Communications Corporation (BPCC)  - as MCC was then known  - completed its
agreed takeover of the trust.
Less than two months later, after Maxwell had raised cash by selling other
assets of PHIT, BPCC bought the shares back from the pension schemes for a
short period during which Beecham's share price rose sharply. He sold them
back to the pension schemes on March 2 1987, earning a Pounds 17.5m profit
for BPCC.
Mr Justice Vinelott, delivering a judgment on the matter last February,
questioned whether Maxwell may have had inside information when he decided
to keep the Beecham shares.
Mr Justice Vinelott wrote: 'When all the facts are known, the conclusion may
be that the sale to MCC on December 15 was made at a time when Mr Robert
Maxwell had good reason to believe that the market price of the shares was
likely to rise substantially and that the purpose of the purchase and resale
was simply to ensure that the increase in price benefited MCC and not the
pension funds.'
The 12.46m Beecham shares were by far the largest single investment in the
PHIT portfolio, according to the PHIT annual report for the year to the end
of March 1986.
The chairman of PHIT was Lord Keith of Castleacre, who was also chairman of
Beecham. Beecham was engaged in a restructuring exercise which resulted in
sharply improved earnings around the time of the share transactions. In the
following year, it merged with SmithKline, the US-based pharmaceuticals
company.
Mr Justice Vinelott said in his judgment that, although the PHIT portfolio
was liquidated by Goldman Sachs on behalf of MCC, 'Lord Keith was anxious
that the shares of Beecham should not be placed on the market and exacted
from Mr Robert Maxwell an undertaking or assurance that they would be
retained as a long-term investment'.
At the time, Goldman Sachs announced that it had sold the PHIT Beecham
shares to pension fund investors, but did not disclose their connection to
Maxwell.
Lord Keith said this week that he had sought an assurance that the Beecham
shares be placed in safe hands because 'my interest was to see to it that
they were sold in an orderly fashion'. He added: 'What I didn't want was a
great block of shares floating in the market.'
Lord Keith said he strongly doubted that Maxwell had any inside information.
Moreover, he said, he could not recall Maxwell ever asking him about affairs
at Beecham on any of the very few occasions when the two met. 'He was just a
punter,' Lord Keith said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Owners of all large ships, not only laden oil tankers, will be liable to pay
compensation for pollution caused by oil spills under a bill approved by the
Commons yesterday.
Mr David Harris, Tory MP for St Ives, who introduced the merchant shipping
(salvage and pollution) bill, said it would remove an anomaly that had
benefited owners of large container or passenger vessels.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer confidence fell in March, reflecting potential unease before this
month's tax increases, a survey by the Birmingham Midshires Building Society
says.
The poll, by ICM Research, asks consumers about their intentions to make
substantial purchases, such as a car, a TV or a cooker, over the next six to
12 months. The figures are then converted into an index, which fell from 108
in February to 105 in March (August 1991=100).

FT  16 APR 94 / Market spirits buoyed by good inflation figure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The good news on inflation in March came as a relief to markets that had
been disappointed by the February figures. Not only did the headline and
underlying rates fall, but analysts believe that the core measure of
inflation, used by the Bank of England, also declined.
The Bank's inflation measure, known as RPI (Y), excludes the effects of tax
as well as mortgage interest payments. Although the Bank only publishes the
measure every quarter, Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets,
calculates that the rate fell to 2.1 per cent in March, from 2.5 per cent in
February.
Food prices rose by 0.6 per cent between February and March, according to
the Central Statistical Office, but the annual rate of growth in food prices
dropped back to 0.2 per cent, the lowest since May 1983. Increases in
seasonal food prices were offset by a low rate of growth in non-seasonal
food.
Two areas  - household goods and clothing and footwear  - continued to show
rebounds from the January sales. Together with food, these components
contributed 0.25 percentage points to the RPI's 0.3 per cent monthly
in-crease.
Price falls were recorded in a couple of areas: household services, where
the main influence was British Telecommunication's abolition of the morning
peak-time rate; and personal goods and services, where the chief cause of
the fall was a decline in the price of spectacles.
Inflation is likely to rise next month as a host of special factors affect
the index. The imposition of value added tax on fuel will add about 0.37 per
cent to the RPI. The Central Statistical Office does not at present intend
to take account of customers who pre-paid fuel bills to avoid VAT.
The reduction in mortgage interest relief will add 0.24 per cent to the RPI,
although not to the underlying rate. Council tax bills were 9 per cent lower
than poll tax bills, a factor which knocked 0.3 per cent off the index in
April 1993. The benefit of that change will drop out of the annual
comparison, and this year's increase of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent
will add a further 0.1 per cent. However, April 1993's excise duty
increases, which pushed up the RPI by 0.5 per cent, will also drop out of
the annual figures.
The cumulative effect of these measures will add around 0.5 per cent to the
index. However, since core measures of inflation may have slowed since April
1993, the headline rate may not jump by the same amount. Greenwell Montagu
is expecting the headline rate to rise to 2.6 per cent while Goldman Sachs
thinks it will increase to 2.7 per cent.

FT  16 APR 94 / Thames divides stormy voting waters: Controversy and apathy
may wash away ruling parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The inner London boroughs of Lambeth and Westminster, facing each other
across the Thames, have both in the past year been the subject of damning
reports from the Audit Commission, the government's watchdog for councils.
It is now up to their voters to decide whether these 'local' issues are
important.
The councils are political opposites. Lambeth gained notoriety as a 'loony
left' Labour council during the 1980s, while Westminster, under the
leadership of Dame Shirley Porter, was a Conservative flagship.
According to the district auditor, Lambeth made more than Pounds 20m in
unlawful payments to contractors. The council is making efforts to put its
house in order, but Liberal Democrats still hope to take advantage, claiming
that victories in six local by-elections have put them on course to capture
the borough.
They claim they have 'Big Mo' on their side  - a reference to the 'momentum'
US presidential candidates try to achieve in primary elections  - while a
'scandal-plagued and exhausted' Labour is 'running scared'.
In January, the auditor gave a provisional opinion that Westminster City
Council was guilty of 'gerrymandering' by selling council houses in marginal
wards to Tory voters.
Dame Shirley and nine other officials and councillors, one of whom has since
committed suicide, were found provisionally liable for repaying Pounds
21.5m. Labour is the only other party on the council, and could gain.
But most local elections are decided on national issues, and that looks
likely to happen in both Lambeth and Westminster this time. Scandals seem to
have served only to increase disillusionment with the political system as a
whole.
On the Lambeth Walk estate, typical of the council blocks run by Lambeth,
canvassers are putting the scandal factor to the test.
Through the bars of his door, one man voiced his hatred for the Labour
council to Ms Sally Prentice, a Liberal Democrat councillor: 'You want to
get them out. It's murder around here.' A woman, angry about problems in
buying her flat, said she opposed the Labour administration in Lambeth, but
not the national party, and would vote Liberal Democrat 'for the council,
but not for parliament'.
Disillusionment prevails. One white-haired woman rasped: 'I don't think it
makes any difference who runs it, do you?' Gesturing angrily at a broken
window catch, awaiting repair for more than five years, she said: 'Last time
I even voted for the Militant.'
Like many others on the estate, she disliked the Labour council but was
planning not to vote at all. The Liberal Democrats could break through, but
mobilising the doubters will be a tough task.
In Westminster, Labour activists are cautious about their chances of winning
the borough. Millbank was the only ward allegedly gerrymandered by the
Conservatives which Labour managed to hold in 1990. With Victorian terraced
homes of the wealthy and influential  - including several Tory MPs  -
backing on to inner city estates it appears a world away from Lambeth.
But canvassing the neighbourhood last week, Mr Peter Bradley, a Labour
councillor, met with similar anger, disillusionment and uncertainty.
Mr Buckfield, 47, a resident in the Tachbrook Estate, a block of social
housing in Pimlico funded by the Peabody Trust, told him he had grown tired
of the scandals. 'I have stopped voting. I am disillusioned. What's the
difference if you're in power or the Conservatives?' he asked, before
cheerfully promising his wife's vote for Labour.
Referring to an earlier controversy when Westminster sold three cemeteries
for 15p, he said: 'Lady Porter got away with selling the graveyards and
moving people out. You can't reverse these things.'
In Ponsonby Place, an elegant street of family homes near the Tate Gallery,
residents were surprised to see Mr Bradley on the doorstep because they did
not realise an election was imminent.
'I have not given it much thought yet,' said Ms Atlanta Pollock, a young
professional who thought that 'local government is hideously corrupt'. And
she added: 'Sorry, what is gerrymandering?'

FT  16 APR 94 / Tangled technological debate on Channel 5's fate: Raymond
Snoddy reviews the options and complex arguments over the development of
digital TV services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, has
urged the government to make up its mind as quickly as possible on whether
to go ahead with Channel 5.
In a letter to Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, he warns that
there is a limited window of opportunity for such a channel and that the ITC
wants to decide next month whether to re-advertise the franchise. More than
a year ago the ITC turned down the only bidder for the channel, mainly on
the grounds of inadequate investor commitment.
If a decision to try again is taken next month it would create at least the
possibility of a new television channel, capable of reaching three-quarters
of the population, being on air by the end of next year.
The decision on the future of a channel encouraged by the 1990 Broadcasting
Act has become tangled in a net of passionate arguments about the future
technology of broadcasting, the ambitions of the Department of Trade and
Industry's industrial hopes for digital TV, and powerful vested interests.
At the heart of the argument is the debate over whether it is wise to go
ahead with the last possible national television channel using existing
analogue technology or whether all available spare frequencies should be
reserved for the rapidly advancing digital technology.
Nearly everyone involved in the dispute acknowledges that all television
pictures will be digital one day. By turning television pictures into a
stream of digits, the language of computers, the pictures can be compressed
and at least four channels squeezed into the space presently occupied by
one.
The debate is over the cost and pace of change and, above all, over what can
be offered economically to attract viewers to new digital services given the
public's multi-billion pound investment in television sets.
Many engineers believe the crossover period  - when new services and the
traditional channels such as ITV and BBC1 will have to be broadcast
simultaneously  - could be as long as 15 years.
There is disagreement among engineers over the extent to which an analogue
Channel 5 would pre-empt the development of digital services. Mr Gary Tonge,
ITC controller of engineering, believes the effect would be marginal.
A decision is on hold until the Radio Communications Agency completes a
study on the issue for the DTI, which has control of frequency allocation
and a strong interest in promoting a new digital television industry.
Supporters and detractors are lining up in a predictable way.
ITV is expressing interest in new digital channels mainly because it wants
to kill off Channel 5, which would compete for advertising revenue. The BBC
is taking its traditional stance: if there is to be a new world of digital
television with several hundred television channels the corporation would
like to be part of it.
The British Radio &amp; Electronic Equipment Manufacturers Association is
against Channel 5 using existing technology because it wants to sell the
digital technology to consumers. The Incorporated Society of British
Advertisers is equally adamant that there should be a conventional Channel 5
to provide more competition for advertisers.
Perhaps the most powerful argument of all has come from Channel 5
Broadcasting, one of the consortia planning to bid for the licence if it is
advertised.
Channel 5 Broadcasting brings together Time Warner, the US media giant, MAI,
which controls Meridian the ITV company for the south of England, and
Pearson, owners of the Financial Times. Its business plan envisages spending
Pounds 600m on programmes over five years.
NBC, the US network company, has also expressed interest in putting together
a consortium to bid for the licence and there are almost certainly others
who have not yet declared their hand.
Earlier plans for Channel 5 envisaged using two channels, 35 and 37, now
used for tuning in video recorders. This would have meant an estimated bill
of Pounds 70m for retuning video recorders which otherwise would have
suffered from interference from the Channel 5 signal.
Work by the ITC and NTL, the former IBA engineering division, suggests that
using spare frequencies in some areas and different frequences for small
relay transmitters in others could reduce the retuning bill to between
Pounds 5m and Pounds 20m. This would virtually free channel 35, which could
be used for digital services, but only for single national ones with no
regional variations.
BBC engineers have been exploring the prospects of using these
'single-frequency networks' for extra channels but Mr John Birt, BBC
director general, is emphasising that no policy decisions have yet been
taken and that the BBC would be unable to fund future digital services from
the licence fee.
As Mr Philip Lavin, controller of BBC engineering policy, said at a
conference this week, it is relatively easy to introduce digital
transmission but ensuring widespread adoption of digital receivers by the
public is much more difficult.
He added: 'It is crucial to recognise that technical feasibility must not be
confused with commercial viability.'

FT  16 APR 94 / Brokers fined for Kuwaiti deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Record fines have been imposed on two stockbrokers who earned bonuses of
about Pounds 1m each for helping to sell assets of a Kuwaiti client after
Kuwaiti assets were frozen in August 1990 following the Iraqi invasion.
The client is believed to be the Kuwait Investment Office, the investment
arm of the Kuwaiti government.
The two men, Mr Anthony John Edward O'Sullivan and Mr Lucas Van der Ploeg,
were managing director and executive director at London-based Sassoon
Europe, a subsidiary of Singapore-based stockbroker Sassoon, which is itself
49 per cent owned by the KIO.
The Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulatory body for the
industry, said yesterday that the two liquidated 'a large holding' from the
client's portfolio in the Dutch and German markets through Sassoon Overseas,
a related company in Hong Kong.
'They succeeded in selling some DM1bn of the portfolio over two days and the
proceeds were paid to the client despite the freeze orders.'
The SFA said both received payments in Dutch guilders equal to about Pounds
1m which were not disclosed to Sassoon.
They also helped a 'senior employee' of the same client earn additional
income through a 'skimming' operation  - they wrote up contract notes to
purchase securities, mostly French equities, at inflated prices.
The senior employee had threatened that the client's business with Sassoon
would dry up unless the two men agreed to the operation.
The men earned about Pounds 500,000 each from the activities while roughly
Pounds 2m  - the difference between the actual and reported price for the
securities  - was paid into Swiss numbered bank accounts on behalf of the
senior employee.
The pair have since made restitution for their part of the benefits from the
skimming operation.

FT  16 APR 94 / Employees back bus company sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the UK's largest and most successful companies operating under an
employee share ownership plan (Esop) yesterday reverted to the status of an
ordinary company when the takeover of the Yorkshire Rider bus company by
Badgerline was approved in an extraordinary general meeting.
Since October 1988 the employees of Yorkshire Rider have owned 49 per cent
of the shares in the company but voted 2,847 to 684 in favour of selling to
Badgerline, the Avon-based operator.
Yorkshire Rider made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.9m on turnover of Pounds
83.9m for the year to March 31 last year. The employees had been negotiating
to buy part of the 51 per cent stake owned by the management when Badgerline
offered Pounds 3.80 a share.
The unions initially rejected the bid but most employees will receive around
Pounds 6,000 after tax for the stake which cost them nothing in 1988.
There was some resistance to the sale from those who wanted to increase the
employee stake and give the workforce an equal voice on the board.
One of the two worker directors, Mr Mohammed Taj, publicly opposed the sale,
but the other worker director, Mr Adrian Arthur, supported it.
One union official said: 'It really did make a difference. A lot of people
had started to feel that they really did own the company. We were starting
to do away with all the us-and- them feelings, now we've thrown it all
away.'
Mr Malcolm Hurlston, of the Esop Centre in London, said: 'It is always sad
to lose an Esop but it shows that employees can earn the wages of capital.
Employees do not normally get a large lump sum when their companies are
taken over.'

FT  16 APR 94 / Japanese ahead in first new-car customer survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE MOTOR INDUSTRY CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JD Power, the leading US automotive consumer research group, has launched
its first UK customer satisfaction survey of buyers of new cars and is
planning to expand the service to include other markets in Europe.
The results of its first UK study, which was published yesterday, show that
Toyota, the Japanese carmaker, has achieved the highest level of overall
customer satisfaction.
The motor industry in Europe has previously resisted JD Power's attempts to
expand from its base in North America preferring to use its own privately
syndicated quality and customer satisfaction information.
These data have always been guarded with strict confidentiality by the
manufacturers and have never been made public.
JD Power's study has measured car owners' attitudes both to the quality of
their vehicles as well as to the service and care they receive from their
dealers.
The top half of the rankings in the study is dominated by Japanese producers
with Mazda and Honda in second and third places, Daihatsu fourth equal,
Subaru seventh, Mitsubishi 10th and Nissan in 13th place.
The highest ranked European producer is Mercedes-Benz at fourth equal, with
Saab eighth, Skoda ninth and BMW in 11th position. Hyundai of South Korea
was in 12th place with Proton of Malaysia fourth equal.
The performances of the leading volume carmakers in the UK  - Ford, Vauxhall
(General Motors) and Rover  - are all ranked below average in the study
along with Peugeot, Citroen, Volkswagen, Renault, Audi, Fiat, Lada, Volvo,
Seat and Suzuki.
The JD Power studies, first launched in the US in 1981, have been a driving
force in improving quality in the US car industry.
Greeted at first with intense scepticism and hostility they helped to
convince the big three US carmakers  - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler  -
that they were lagging far behind their Japanese rivals.

FT  16 APR 94 / Land Rover to create 600 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Land Rover, the division of the Rover group, is increasing production by 8
per cent and creating 600 jobs at its Solihull plant in the West Midlands.
The company, the leading European manufacturer of four-wheel drive sports
and utility vehicles, is increasing output of its Discovery range by 14 per
cent.
The Discovery is being launched in the US this month and is expected
eventually to quadruple Land Rover's US sales. Output is being raised in
response to the US launch as well as to meet rising demand in the UK and in
several other smaller Land Rover markets worldwide.
Rover, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, expects Land Rover production to
reach a record 85,000 this year. The previous production peak of 68,621 was
reached in 1990.
Output rose last year by 19 per cent to 68,159 from 57,332 a year earlier.
Land Rover increased its workforce by 600 last year and introduced a second
shift at its Solihull plant in the autumn.
The further 600 jobs, to be added this spring, will raise the Solihull
workforce to more than 9,000.
Output of the Discovery is to be raised from 1,050 to 1,200 a week from the
beginning of May. Total output, including the Range Rover and Defender
ranges, will be increased from 1,800 to 1,950 a week.
Land Rover expects sales of the Discovery in the US to total more than 6,000
this year and more than 10,000 in a full year. US sales of the Range Rover
and Defender ranges rose by 16 per cent to a record 4,907 last year out of
total worldwide sales of 73,527.
In the autumn the company is launching a new generation Range Rover, which
will become the group's flagship luxury four-wheel drive vehicle.

The Russian parliament's lower house last night unexpectedly passed the
Russian budget, but proposed large increases in spending which the
government is unlikely to accept, John Lloyd reports. The resolution also
called for the government to bring forward the 1995 budget by September of

1994 budget until March.

FT  16 APR 94 / Former Soviet states bow to Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia yesterday stamped its authority over the other 11 members of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, winning formal approval for its role as
peace-keeper and guardian of the CIS borders. At a CIS summit chaired by
President Boris Yeltsin, Moscow's influence was reasserted in a series of
landmark economic and political decisions which capitalised on the smaller
republics' keenness to re-establish severed links and gain access to Russian
markets.
Russia won formal control of most of the Black Sea Fleet, over which it has
quarreled bitterly with Ukraine, and persuaded Kiev to associate itself with
the 'economic union' that links all 12 CIS states.
The decision to grant Russia at least 80 per cent of the fleet, with a final
division to be agreed in 10 days, follows several days of escalating
tension, with each side accusing the other of seizing naval installations by
force.
In a separate indication of Russia's increasing self-assertiveness,
diplomats in Brussels said they no longer expected Moscow to join the
Partnership for Peace arrangement proposed by Nato in the near future.
Russia had earlier indicated willingness to sign up next week, but its
attitude has cooled since the Nato air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs,
which were carried out without consulting Moscow.
Mr Pavel Grachev, Russian defence minister, said yesterday he now regretted
his earlier enthusiasm for the Partnership for Peace idea.
Nato diplomats said the latest Russian moves confirmed their impression that
President Yeltsin was now keener on consolidating influence in neighbouring
republics than on building fresh links with the west.
Summing up yesterday's CIS accords, Mr Yeltsin said: 'These steps should not
be the end, but the beginning of economic integration.'
In a vivid illustration of Russia's dominant position, the Central Asian
states as well as Georgia and Armenia agreed formally that Russian troops
should police their borders together with their own forces.
Ukraine and Moldova have also signed a memorandum which goes in that
direction.
All agreed Russia should send peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia, the breakaway
region of Georgia, and they urged the United Nations to bless the idea as
soon as possible. They said the CIS might proceed unilaterally with a
peace-keeping operation if UN approval was not forthcoming.
In a further symbol of Moscow's authority, it was agreed that Russia remain
chairman of the CIS for the rest of the year rather than switching chairs
after six months, as has been the rule.
The CIS leaders agreed on an Interstate Economic Commission to inject some
discipline into the plethora of agreements signed yesterday and at previous
meetings, aimed at integration of their economies. These included agreements
gradually to lower customs barriers with the eventual aim of creating a
customs union.
Mr Yeltsin, who appeared fitter after a trip to Spain, warmly commended the
economic union signed between Belarus and Russia earlier this week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Freedom Alliance headed by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi yesterday
failed to obtain a majority vote in favour of their candidate for the key
post of Senate speaker.
This represented a serious rebuff to the Alliance and underlined the
difficulties a proposed Berlusconi-led government would face in obtaining
the necessary vote of confidence in the Senate.
'The government cannot govern if its policies are not shared by both houses
of parliament,' Mr Berlusconi warned after the vote. 'If this happens, there
is no choice but to go to the polls to seek a new majority mandate. . . but
I hope this can be avoided.'
In two rounds of voting yesterday on the opening of Italy's 12th post-war
legislature, Mr Carlo Scognamiglio, the Alliance candidate, obtained fewer
votes than Mr Giovanni Spadolini, outgoing speaker and former Republican
premier.
On the first round, Mr Scognamiglio, an economist and former Liberal senator
who defected to Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, obtained 153 votes against Mr
Spadolini's 156 from a total of 315 elected and 11 life senators. On the
second round, each obtained one more vote.
The Alliance - composed of Forza Italia, the populist Northern League, the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance and the small Christian Democrat Centry
Party - on Thursday decided to back its own senate candidate rather than
seek a broader agreement with other parties. This position had been strongly
canvassed by the League and was accepted with reservations, since some
within Forza Italia had wanted to back Mr Spadolini as an institutional
figure.
Another round of voting will be held today. . If the Alliance loses the vote
again, it may have to drop Mr Scognamiglio.
Ms Irene Pivetti, the Alliance's 31-year-old candidate for chamber of
deputies speaker, looked set to be voted in. Andrew Hill adds from Verona:
Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's outgoing prime minister, yesterday warned
that a new government should not tamper with the broad framework for
economic recovery established in the last two years. Mr Ciampi told 2,000
Italian entrepreneurs there were 'no short cuts on the road to economic
well-being'.

FT  16 APR 94 / France urges 'hard core' of EU members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday proposed a formula by which it hopes to incite all its
European Union partners to follow its lead in adopting all EU policies as
defined by the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's European affairs minister, suggested that,
'when the decision is made to pass to monetary union, certain European
countries, including France and Germany, should propose the status of 'new
founding members of Europe' for the largest possible number of countries
applying all the (Union) policies, in the monetary, security and social
fields.'
Acknowledging such a status would create yet another division between EU
states, Mr Lamassoure said: 'The distinction would not last for ever.' He
hoped creation of a club of founder-members of the new Europe would have a
'contagious' effect in drawing along laggards in its wake, so that
eventually all would have the same status.
Mr Lamassoure's proposal, made in a speech to the annual conference of the
Assocation for European Monetary Union, was vague, implying that self-styled
founders of the new Europe would be linked more by a political declaration
than any new version of the Treaty of Rome, which launched the European
Community in 1957. Because of this, officials from the UK and Denmark, which
have important opt-outs from the Maastricht treaty, played down its
significance.
But it appears to mark a shift in French policy towards Europe. French
ministers - particularly Mr Alain Juppe, who as foreign minister is Mr
Lamassoure's senior - have tended to accept, even vaunt, the new 'variable
geometry' of Maastricht that lets countries opt in and out of the treaty's
monetary, defence and social commitments.
However, in the wake of French criticism of Germany for being too soft on
the Nordic countries in recent accession negotiations, Mr Lamassoure's
remarks seem to reflect a growing French feeling that a hard core of EU
members must take a stand to prevent European integration becoming ever more
ragged.
On prospects for monetary union itself, Mr Lamassoure said the decision
about which countries would be fit to adopt the single currency would be
essentially a political one, saying, for instance, it was inconceivable that
Belgium, whose debt far surpassed the Maastricht guideline, would not be a
founder member of the currency union.
Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Bank of France governor, added that Maastricht's
debt criterion 'could perhaps be looked at more closely'. For his part, Mr
Reimut Jochimsen, a Bundesbank board member, said: 'It may be relatively
easy to enter the final stage (of monetary union), but whether it will last
is open to history', echoing the German constitutional court's warning that
so sacrosanct were the Maastricht criteria that they could be used to expel
countries from the currency union.
Mr Trichet forecast that 'the gradual lowering of short-term interest rates
in Europe will be continued. . . without (in the case of France)
jeopardising the stability or credibility of the currency'.

Workers at Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank recently baled out by
the government in a controversial FFr44.9bn (Pounds 5.2bn) rescue, yesterday
rejected proposals to shed up to 3,800 jobs in France over the next three
years.
Credit Lyonnais's branches throughout the day were disrupted by strikes and
stoppages by staff protesting against the cuts. Several hundred employees
staged a demonstration outside the group's grandiose headquarters on
Boulevard des Italiens in Paris before a morning meeting between Credit
Lyonnais's unions and management.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, who in November was appointed by the government to
chair the bank, last month called on its 38,000 French employees to accept a
radical rationalisation plan as part of his efforts to bring Credit Lyonnais
back into the black after a FFr6.9bn net loss last year.
The proposals include the loss of 1,000 jobs in France this year followed by
the loss of 2,100 to 2,800 posts over the next two years. The Peyrelevade
plan is by far the most dramatic cost cutting initiative in the French
banking industry.
Mr Peyrelevade has claimed that a large proportion of the proposed cuts
could come from natural wastage such as early retirement and transfers to
part-time working. However the banking unions, which earlier this year
staged an industry-wide strike against less radical cuts, are concerned
that, if Credit Lyonnais accelerated its rationalisation, other banks might
follow suit.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will focus its
attention more sharply on financing east and central Europe's private banks
and budding entrepreneurs if bank governors and shareholders in Europe and
North America approve the bank's new strategic plan at the annual meeting
here.
The revised strategy for the slimmed-down bank, now headed by Mr Jacques de
Larosiere, former managing director of the IMF, was drawn up after the
resignation of Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's first president. This followed
a stormy annual meeting in London last year and attacks on over-spending,
excessive bureaucracy and neglect of the needs of fledgling entrepreneurs.
The new focus has already upgraded the merchant banking aspect of the bank's
activities, headed by Mr Ron Freeman, a former US investment banker, at the
expense of the development banking side. The EBRD was always intended to
focus at least 60 per cent of its spending on private projects, not to
replicate traditional infrastructure projects financed by the World Bank and
EIB.
The bank's potentially strategic role in financing the reconstruction or
clos-ure of eastern Europe's dangerous Soviet-designed nuclear power
stations has also been frustrated by legal delays.

Mr Mariano Rubio, the man whose signature stands next to the King of Spain's
head on the Pta10,000 (Pounds 50) banknote, yesterday sat facing a committee
of MPs on live television accused of speculating on the stock market,
holding a secret account, evading tax and using privileged information.
In an atmosphere of growing nervousness in the Socialist administration
about the potential fallout from the affair, Mr Rubio, former governor of
the Bank of Spain, told deputies he was 'not aware' of having held a
clandestine account or having cheated the taxman.
Presented with allegations from the conservative Popular party that he had
bought shares in Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) shortly before a hostile
takeover bid for the bank in 1987, he told the congress's economy and
finance committee: 'I have no idea how these purchases could have happened.'
The bid by Banco de Bilbao subsequently failed.
Ms Luisa Fernanda Rudi, Popular party spokeswoman on the committee, told Mr
Rubio his replies had 'clarified little or nothing'.
Mr Rubio's business affairs returned to the forefront of Spanish political
debate last week when the daily El Mundo alleged he salted away profits from
stock investments in a Pta130m account hidden from the tax authorities.
Mr Rubio was governor of the central bank under the Socialist government
from 1984 to mid-1992, when he was linked to a controversy surrounding a
failed banking venture, Ibercorp. The bank was run by a close friend, Mr
Manuel de la Concha, who controlled Mr Rubio's equity portfolio.
Questioned about Ibercorp's affairs yesterday, Mr Rubio said the bank had
been closely supervised and that 'things are discovered always too late'.
The former bank governor, smoking and stumbling over his replies, appeared
extremely tense and uncomfortable.
The affair is all the more embarrassing for the government since it
coincides with a separate parliamentary investigation into alleged illicit
enrichment by the former head of the paramilitary Civil Guard, Mr Lus
Roldan, who resigned last year.
The opposition has seized on these controversies to accuse the government of
widespread Italian-style corruption.
The Rubio affair has brought into question the future of Mr Carlos Solchaga,
Socialist parliamentary leader and former economy minister during Mr Rubio's
governorship.

Poland's western government creditors in the Paris Club have put into
operation the final phase of a deal aimed at halving Poland's sovereign
debt. Under the second tranche of the Paris Club agreement Poland's
sovereign debt, estimated at Dollars 28.7bn (Pounds 19.6bn) by the Finance
Ministry, is to be reduced by around Dollars 3.4bn while interest payments
in coming years are to run at below market rates. However, the creditors
'reserved the right to review their decision' to make sure it is compatible
with debt reduction agreement Poland struck with the London Club of

owners of Dollars 12.3bn Polish commercial debt, unhappy at the 42 per cent
London Club debt reduction, to accept the arrangement, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
Britain's chancellor, said on a visit to Warsaw yesterday.

Chile's central bank yesterday took an important step towards opening up the
capital account by relaxing rules governing the raising of capital abroad
and the remittance to Chile of export earnings. Required risk
classifications for Chilean companies issuing bonds or American Depository
Receipts abroad have been lowered, while the minimum issue amount has been
halved to Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m). The long-awaited easing of restrictions
also allows Chilean exporters to leave up to 15 per cent of foreign exchange
earnings abroad, against 10 per cent now. This will be raised to 20 per cent
in six months. Private pension funds, which marshal Dollars 16bn of savings,
can now invest 4 per cent of assets abroad, up from 3 per cent.
'Liberalising the capital account is good news because it makes Chile look
more mature economically and financially,' said Mr David Lubin, economist at
Samuel Montagu. He said the aim was probably to keep capital flows neutral.

Japan's tax authorities have sent Ciba-Geigy Japan, a subsidiary of the
Swiss chemical and pharmaceuticals group, an additional tax charge of Y5.7bn
(Pounds 37m) for allegedly inflating royalty payments to its parent company
between 1990 and 1992. The move is the latest by Japan's national tax
administration agency to extract penalty taxes from foreign multinational
groups operating in Japan believed to have transferred locally made profits
overseas.
Ciba-Geigy said the assessment was unjustified and outrageous with regard to
international taxation standards, and it would use all possible avenues to
oppose it. 'In this matter Ciba-Geigy has the full support of the Swiss
authorities,' it said. Last week Japanese tax authorities agreed to
reimburse AIU, the US insurance company, for some of the back taxes
collected under the transfer pricing tax rules following discussions with US
tax officials.

<TEXT>
South Korea yesterday offered a key concession to encourage North Korea to
resume international negotiations on nuclear inspections. Seoul decided to
drop a demand that the two Koreas must first exchange special envoys before
North Korea is allowed to hold another round of high-level talks with the US
on the nuclear issue.
North Korea's refusal to exchange envoys has blocked progress in achieving a
diplomatic solution to the nuclear inspection dispute. The concession is
likely to increase pressure on North Korea to accept inspections of its
nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency before an early-May
deadline. The US has offered to hold new negotiations with North Korea on
possible diplomatic recognition if Pyongyang permits the IAEA inspections.
The IAEA is likely to seek renewed contacts with North Korea next week on
full inspections, which were halted in mid-March.

The US yesterday suspended for at least 24 hours all fighter patrols over
the 'no-fly' zone in northern Iraq where two US jets shot down two US
helicopters on Thursday, killing 26 people. Flights by Awacs radar aircraft
are not affected. Mr William Perry, defence secretary, said he had ordered
an immediate review of all operational procedures, including those mandating
'hair-trigger' responses, in the three areas where the US participates in no
fly zones  - northern Iraq, southern Iraq and Bosnia.
Mr Perry said that the fighter pilots' failure correctly to identify the
helicopters in clear air was a major factor in Thursday's accident. No voice
contact between the fighters and helicopters was established, he said. The
White House reacted strongly to Republican criticisms that the Clinton
administration's cuts in defence spending had contributed to the accident,
saying 'attempts to politicise the tragedy are highly inappropriate'.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US industrial production rose 0.5 per cent in March, slightly less than
expected, but figures for previous months were revised higher, indicating
solid economic growth in the first quarter. The rate of capacity utilisation
in manufacturing rose to 82.8 per cent  - close to the level historically
associated with upward pressure on inflation.
The Federal Reserve said output in several industries had picked up sharply
after weather-related weakness in January and February. But the overall
increase in output was held back by a drop in production of motor vehicles
following a surge in preceding months. Vehicle output fell to an annual rate
of 13m units last month against 13.9m in February, the highest level of
output in any month since the 1970s. Industrial output was also depressed in
March by a decline in electricity production after an unusually cold winter.
Excluding vehicles, factory output rose 1 per cent in March following a 0.3
per cent gain in February and unchanged production in January. Overall
industrial production rose 5.1 per cent in the year to March.

FT  16 APR 94 / GATT: Uruguay Round completed after 8 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MARRAKESH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Governments from more than 120 countries yesterday drew a line under almost
eight years of complex and often fraught negotiations by signing their names
to the Uruguay Round. The world's most ambitious trade liberalisation
package is expected to boost global economic output by at least Dollars
235bn by the year 2002, according to estimates by the Gatt secretariat after
it takes effect next year.
As ministers unsheathed pens at the concluding conference of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, their tributes to what had been achieved,
their regrets about what had not been agreed and their prognoses for the
future were overshadowed by wonderment that the enterprise had been
completed at all.
Some saw more than just a further step towards global economic integration
and re-affirmation of multilateral rules which have governed world trade for
almost half a century. Mr Sergio Abreu Bonilla, conference chairman and
foreign minister of Uruguay, where the round started in 1986, yesterday
claimed it would underwrite political stability, above all in developing
countries.
Yet for all the ritual declarations of unity and goodwill in Marrakesh,
there have been conspicuous reminders that the squabbles, rivalries and
jockeying for national advantage which threatened more than once to scupper
the talks remain as fierce as ever.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, may have moderated his language
for the occasion. But he still insists his government has neither totally
renounced the right to unilateral trade sanctions, nor relaxed its
aggressive campaign to open Japan's markets, which other governments
consider contrary to the spirit  - if not the letter  - of Gatt.
The developing countries, meanwhile, have refused to swallow assurances from
ministers of industrialised countries that their demands to place workers'
rights on the world trade policy agenda were not protectionism in disguise.
Nor have repeated claims by Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, that
everyone will benefit from the Round removed worries in the poorest
countries that some of the gains will be at their expense.
For the European Union, Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, has somehow
contrived to present himself as a shrewd and purposeful negotiator. That is
a remarkable feat, given that the governments he is employed to represent  -
and above all the French  - often seemed bent on undermining him by
squabbling among themselves or trying to unravel previous agreements.
But at least the EU enlivened proceedings with a memorable impersonation of
a pantomime horse. On the eve of the Uruguay Round signing ceremony, the 12
staged an acrimonious row about German banana imports, which France then
turned into a minor crisis by threatening not to approve the new Gatt
agreement to liberalise public procurement.
Like all farces, this one ended  - more or less  - happily, with liberal
applications of Brussels fudge. But not before other EU ministers had vented
their spleen on Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, for keeping
them waiting at the negotiating table late into Thursday evening while he
ostentatiously dined with friends in Marrakesh.

FT  16 APR 94 / EU patches up bananas dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union yesterday papered over an internal row about banana
imports, which had threatened to overshadow the signing of the Uruguay Round
trade accord and could have jeopardised a parallel international agreement
to liberalise public procurement.
The dispute was sparked by Germany's concern that by signing the Uruguay
Round, it could prejudice the outcome of a court case it has brought which
challenges the EU's new banana import regime.
France had said that unless Bonn withdrew the case, Paris would hold up EU
approval of an agreement in the Gatt to open to international competition
public contracts worth more than Dollars 300bn a year.
The conflict was defused when the 12 agreed to a Commission statement
recognising Germany's right to pursue its legal case but prohibiting it from
linking bananas to approval of the Uruguay Round.
France said it was satisfied but German officials said they would continue
their fight for the right to import more Latin American 'dollar' bananas.

FT  16 APR 94 / South African Elections (April 26-28): Zulu king holds key
to peace in Natal - The colourful traditional monarch has to be taken
seriously
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watch out for King Goodwill Zwelithini. It is easy to dismiss the
slow-spoken king, hereditary monarch to South Africa's 9m Zulus, as merely
the toy of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party
and chief minister of the KwaZulu black homeland.
But the king will live on after apartheid - and talks with him will continue
despite the spectacular collapse of all other constitutional negotiations
this week. Chief Buthelezi will soon have lost his position as KwaZulu head,
and Inkatha will be in the extra-parliamentary wilderness. But the threat
which King Goodwill poses - of inflamed Zulu nationalism - will endure.
Indeed, the new government will face few more dangerous challenges.
That is why Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, has
spent so much time trying to woo King Goodwill. For the king is Inkatha's
biggest political asset, the key to unlocking the support of millions of
traditional Zulus. Recent opinion polls show a steady decline in support for
Chief Buthelezi, but a rise in support for Inkatha. This seems to be
explained by a surge of allegiance to the king - cleverly provoked by Chief
Buthelezi himself, who dragged the king on to the political stage to demand
Zulu autonomy once Inkatha's efforts to negotiate regional devolution had
failed.
The ANC responded by trying to strike a separate peace with the king, to
isolate Chief Buthelezi and neutralise the threat of Zulu ethnicity. So far,
this has failed, because the ANC tried to entice the king with no more than
what one local columnist called 'the trinkets of monarchy': the promise of
pomp and circumstance, and a ceremonial role.
There can be no such cheap deal with the king to bring peace to KwaZulu and
the surrounding Natal province. If he poses a real threat to stability - as
the ANC seems to believe - a substantive and not a symbolic solution will be
needed to remove it. And that will mean satisfying Chief Buthelezi as well
as King Goodwill.
Not since the days of King Shaka, the 19th-century founder of the Zulu
nation, has so much attention been paid to the Zulu monarch. Goodwill, the
eighth Zulu king, was installed in 1971; within a decade, he had been
subdued by Chief Buthelezi, his uncle, who castigated him publicly before
the KwaZulu legislative assembly and threatened to cut his stipend when he
thought the king was nurturing independent political ambitions.
Since then, he has used the king cleverly as a focus to build a new Zulu
nationalism, now the basis of Inkatha's support. Dressed in leopard skins,
or the double breasted suits and dark sunglasses so beloved of African
leaders, King Goodwill regularly stirs Zulu pride with complaints of
slights, real or imagined, to the nation and its monarch.
This is powerful stuff, in a country where the trappings of modern
industrial society only thinly mask the more traditional world - at least in
KwaZulu/Natal - of tribal chiefs and spirit healers. Even ANC radicals
believe Inkatha can use the institution of the king to undermine a new
government, as well as to provide an alternative power base for Chief
Buthelezi. As prime minister to the king, a role he has long filled under
Zulu custom, the chief will at least have a phone, fax and photocopy machine
in the king's palace.
For his part, the king says he is preparing for the final fight to liberate
the Zulus from decades of foreign oppression, under the British, the
Afrikaners and soon the Xhosa-dominated ANC. That may sound like bluster -
but it is a brave person who ignores it.

Poland's western government creditors in the Paris Club have put into
operation the final phase of a deal aimed at halving Poland's sovereign
debt. Under the second tranche of the Paris Club agreement Poland's
sovereign debt, estimated at Dollars 28.7bn (Pounds 19.6bn) by the Finance
Ministry, is to be reduced by around Dollars 3.4bn while interest payments
in coming years are to run at below market rates. However, the creditors
'reserved the right to review their decision' to make sure it is compatible
with debt reduction agreement Poland struck with the London Club of
commercial bank creditors last month. This is to put additional pressure on
owners of Dollars 12.3bn Polish commercial debt, unhappy at the 42 per cent
London Club debt reduction, to accept the arrangement, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
Britain's chancellor, said on a visit to Warsaw yesterday. The Poles expect
to complete the London Club deal in the autumn but some Polish debt holders
have protested that the agreement is too generous to Warsaw.
The Paris Club yesterday agreed to reschedule Dollars 200m of Bulgarian debt
repayments due in the year to March 1995. The move follows an agreement
between Bulgaria and the International Monetary Fund signed this month.

South Africa's commercial capital, Johannesburg, is bracing for further
violence after the youth wing of the Inkatha Freedom party said yesterday it
would stage a mass protest in the city from Monday, write Patti Waldmeir in
Durban and Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
The Inkatha Youth Brigade said it would enforce a work stayaway on Monday,
adding: 'Anyone who comes to town will do so at their own risk.' It was not
clear that the national leadership of Inkatha supported the stayaway. But
after the last Inkatha march on Johannesburg, in which 53 people died,
residents of the city are likely to take the new Inkatha threat seriously.
Inkatha protest actions will take place in Johannesburg throughout next
week, the last week before polling starts in the first all-race elections.
Mr Charles Loliwe, the Youth Brigade's Johannesburg chairman, said Inkatha
would march on the headquarters of the African National Congress, the
offices of the Independent Electoral Commission, police headquarters and the
South African Broadcasting Corporation. It would also stage a sit-in at the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
Police said such marches would be illegal under emergency regulations.

FT  16 APR 94 / Hint of recovery in Japan's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's econonomy showed a tentative sign of recovery yesterday, with the
first decline in corporate bankruptcies for four years.
The number of company failures fell 2.9 per cent to 14,019 in the fiscal
year to the end of March, said Teikoku Databank, a credit research group.
Companies' liabilities also fell, by 10.7 per cent over the same period to
Y6,650bn (Pounds 43bn), the second consecutive year of decline.
The result appears to support the Bank of Japan's belief that the worst is
over in the country's longest economic slowdown since the war. However,
Teikoku said the number of corporate collapses specifically caused by the
recession rose 14.6 per cent, showing that times are still hard for some.
Optimists believe a rise in housing starts and consumer spending is paving
the way for Japan's first post-war consumer-led upturn.
Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, vice minister at the government's economic planning
agency, said yesterday signs had emerged in recent months that the economy
would 'continue growing with greater brightness' this year.
Small businesses, often the first to feel economic change, this week told a
survey by the Association of Shinkin Banks that the decline was halting.
Shinkin credit banks specialise in small business lending.
But a reminder of the economy's continued fragility came yesterday when the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry revised down its preliminary
estimate of industrial production for February.
Output fell by 0.1 per cent from January to February, instead of rising by
0.2 per cent.
By comparison with February last year, output fell by a revised 4.4 per
cent, said Miti. Officials said the change was due to lower-than-expected
sales of pharmaceuticals, whisky and lumber products.

FT  16 APR 94 / Inflation rate falls to 2.3%: Shares rally as sharp fall in
underlying figure raises hopes for easier borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp fall last month in Britain's annual rate of underlying inflation
raised hopes yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer,
might soon be able to cut interest rates.
Speculation about a cut helped shares to rally, with the FT-SE 100 index
rising 36.6 points to close at 3,168.3. The June long gilt future was up
nearly a point.
The underlying inflation rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments,
fell to an annual 2.4 per cent in March from 2.8 per cent in February,
according to the Central Statistical Office.
The annual rate of increase is at its lowest level since the present
reporting series began in 1975 and is thought by CSO statisticians to be
lower than at any time since November 1967. Furthermore, underlying
inflation is in the lower half of the government's target range of 1 per
cent to 4 per cent for the first time since that goal was set in October
1992.
Analysts believe that the news on inflation, which followed disappointing
numbers in February, is a necessary  - but not a sufficient  - condition for
a rate cut. Bank base rates were cut in February by  1/4 point to 5.25 per
cent.
Minutes of monthly meetings between Mr Clarke and Mr Eddie George, governor
of the Bank of England, published this week, show that the two men agreed in
early March that rates might be cut if inflation was under control and
economic activity showed signs of weakness.
Although the former has been achieved, recent economic statistics, such as
manufacturing output figures, have been relatively buoyant. Next week's
publication of retail sales and unemployment figures will therefore be
scrutinised for signs of slowing activity.
Speculation of a near-term cut in rates was increased yesterday when the
Bank of England announced that its next auction of gilt-edged stock would
have a short maturity. Short-dated gilts would be made more attractive by a
rate cut. The headline rate of annual inflation fell only slightly to 2.3
per cent in March, from 2.4 per cent in February.
The retail prices index rose 0.3 per cent between February and March, with
rises in the prices of food, household goods and clothing being offset by
declines in telephone charges and spectacle prices.
April is likely to see a rise in the headline rate, as value added tax on
fuel and the reduction in mortgage interest tax relief push up the index and
last year's fall in local-government tax bills drops out of the comparison.
The Bank said it would auction gilts with a maturity of between 1997 and
2001 on April 27. Details of the issue will be announced next Tuesday. The
Bank is also adding Pounds 150m at 164 1/2 to an issue of 2 1/2 per cent
index-linked bonds due 2011, and Pounds 100m at 116 5/16 to an issue of 2
1/2 per cent index-linked bonds due 2024.

FT  16 APR 94 / Treasury retreats on CGT measure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government said yesterday that individual taxpayers could continue
temporarily to take account of inflation when calculating losses for capital
gains tax purposes. The change could benefit higher rate taxpayers by up to
Pounds 4,000.
The government's retreat on one of the most unpopular measures in the
November Budget follows pressure from Conservative backbenchers and angry
private investors.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, has put forward an amendment
to the Finance Bill to give 'transitional relief' to individuals caught
unawares by his Budget measure to end, with immediate effect, the indexation
of losses.
Before the Budget, companies and private individuals were able to adjust
capital gains and losses for inflation. The Budget continued to allow
indexation of gains.
Yesterday's concession will apply to individuals and trustees but not to
companies. Investors will be able to use indexation to create or increase
losses by up to Pounds 10,000 on sales between November 30 1993 and April 5
1995. A higher rate taxpayer who used the maximum allowance would save
Pounds 4,000.
Mr Nick Brown, a Labour front bench Treasury spokesman, said yesterday's
move was 'an attempt to buy off the protest of fairly well-to-do widows and
orphans'.
Individuals can report total capital gains of up to Pounds 5,800 per year
without paying capital gains tax (CGT). The Inland Revenue estimates 125,000
taxpayers will pay CGT for the 1993-94 tax year, and projects CGT receipts
of Pounds 1bn from individuals.
Mr Maurice Parry-Wingfield of accountants Touche Ross said: 'The private
investor will be thankful for this small mercy which is probably as much as
can be realistically expected given the government's stated intention to
crack down on what it sees as avoidance and raise revenue.'
The Inland Revenue said the indexation allowance for losses had been 'widely
exploited for tax avoidance purposes by both companies and individuals'. It
estimated that without the Budget change, the Treasury would lose Pounds 3bn
a year by the end of the decade. It puts the cost of transitional relief at
Pounds 45m.
The original Budget proposal to scrap the indexation of capital losses is
understood to have been one of the main points raised with Mr Clarke by
Conservative MPs serving on the finance bill committee.
Mr John Butterfill, Tory MP for Bournemouth West, said yesterday MPs were
still concerned that removing indexation was a 'blunt instrument'. They
hoped that a more sophisticated way of stopping tax avoidance could be
found. He welcomed yesterday's measure but said some Conservative MPs had
hoped for a higher indexation allowance.
Mr Brown said the amendment did not tackle the principle of whether to
withdraw indexation of capital losses. He said it 'merely provides a small
transitional relief'.

FT  15 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ashanti puts the gold back into
the Gold Coast - Paul Adams on next week's flotation of the jewel in the
crown of Ghanaian mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Ashanti Goldmines Corporation is floated on the London Stock Exchange
next week the Ghanaian government will have put in place the most important
part of its privatisation programme.
It already has divested most of the State Gold Mining Corporation's stakes
in local mines, usually retaining 10 per cent of these ventures. In the case
of Ashanti, the jewel in the crown, it is reducing its shareholding from 55
per cent to 31.3 per cent.
Since new mining laws in 1986 opened Ghana's moribund mining industry to
foreign capital and expertise, Australian mining companies have been
particularly ready to lead the way with investment and management, bringing
with them their expertise in open pit mining.
For example, the share price of Golden Shamrock in Australia has risen
sharply since in late 1992 it began producing gold at the Iduapriem mine,
some 100km south of Ashanti.
Golden Shamrock is the main shareholder in Ghanaian Australian Goldfields, a
Dollars 65m joint venture with the International Finance Corporation and the
Ghanaian government. The mine, which in 1992 had more than 1m troy ounces of
proven and probable gold reserves, is producing about 110,000 ounces a year.
Two junior Australian companies, Ranger Minerals and Associated Goldfields
are also investing in the region. Ranger has raised ADollars 27m for Abosso
Gold Fields, a mine close to Iduapriem. Kiwi Gold Fields is financing a
small property south of Ashanti. Meanwhile, the Southern Cross mine has been
acquired by Obenomase Gold Mines, 90 per cent owned by Turnbull Doyle
Resources of Australia, which is seeking a stock market listing.
Some South African companies have also been attracted to the region by the
relative political stability of Ghana and low production costs. Gold Fields
of South Africa bought Tarkwa gold mine in western Ghana from the state
mining corporation last year and since July has doubled production to 4,000
ounces a month while halving the workforce to 1,400.
Johannesburg Consolidated Investments is to manage Prestea, near Tarkwa, at
present state-run. Billiton, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group owns the
Bogosu mine, one of the assets Gencor of South Africa hopes to acquire from
the oil group. Bogosu is producing about 100,000 ounces of gold a year.
Cluff Resources of the UK is developing a 30,000-ounces-a-year gold mine at
Ayanfuri, west of Dunkwa. Further north, Pioneer Corporation, another
Australian company, has taken over the mine at Teberebi and increased the
production rate from 160,000 ounces last year to 240,000 ounces. The
Canadian group Bonte Gold has bought an alluvial gold mine and begun trial
production at about 1,200 ounces a month.
Of course none of these can compare with Ashanti, one of the world's richest
gold mines. Ashanti's production has increased threefold since 1986 from
242,366 to 770,410 ounces in the financial year ending September 1993. The
company's expansion programme is ahead of schedule and it expects output to
reach 1m ounces by 1995, which would make it one of the the world's top 10
gold producers.
Ashanti's 1993 after tax profits were Dollars 90.5m, up from Dollars 60.6m
the previous year. Production costs are in the lowest 20 per cent worldwide.
According to Mr Sam Jonah, Ashanti's chief executive, the mine is poised for
substantial expansion. 'There is no reason why this mine should not go on
producing 1m ounces a year for the next 50 years,' he says, 'particularly
now we have an aggressive exploration programme for the first time in our
history.
'The aggregate of the company's proven and probable ore reserves has
increased to 18.1m ounces from 16.8m. For five years running new delineated
gold reserves have exceeded production.'
Ashanti has just acquired a 140 sq km concession for exploration, adjoining
the existing 256 sq km at the Obuasi site, about 180km north of Accra. Last
year cash operating costs were Dollars 173 an ounce, rising to Dollars 253
if depreciation and royalties were included, against an average market price
over the year of Dollars 357 an ounce.
Industry analysts rate Ashanti as one of the world's finest gold prospects.
Its strength lies in the variety of ore deposits extracted from both deep
mines and open pits. Material is treated by four separate processing plants.
The open pit operations, begun in 1990, cut production costs and funded the
investment in the underground infrastructure, which is expensive to develop
but opens the way to much bigger deposits.
Apart from the volatility of the gold market the investment risks in Ashanti
are linked to Ghana's political future. President Jerry Rawlings' government
has been the leading exponent of economic liberalisation in black Africa,
but the favourable investment in Ghana will depend on a continuation of his
policies, backed by the International Monetary Fund.
Ashanti's recovery in the 1980s and the current Dollars 305m Ashanti Mine
Expansion Project have been funded partly by the IMF's offshoot, the
International Finance Corporation and participating lenders. The management
believes that the flotation will free Ashanti from the 'shackles' of the
IFC, giving it the flexibility to develop mining operations elsewhere in
Ghana and abroad.
Since the 1970s Lonrho has been the other major shareholder in Ashanti, with
45 per cent, and has managed the operations. The company's first flotation
is a complex transaction, with two offers on the Ghanaian stock exchange and
one in London. When dealing starts next week the shares will be tradeable
simultaneously in both markets.
The company is taking the opportunity to raise new money by issuing 3.5m new
shares, which will dilute Lonrho's holding to 43.1 per cent. The Ghanaian
government and Lonrho have undertaken, subject to certain exceptions, not to
increase or decrease their shareholdings for two years. The government will
retain a 'golden share' to protect Ghana's national interest.
International advisers to the flotation, stockbroker James Capel and
merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, have indicated a price range between Dollars
17 and Dollars 20 a share, which values Ashanti at Dollars 1.42bn to Dollars
1.67 bn. The price will be finally be fixed when dealing starts in London on
Tuesday.
Shares worth at least Dollars 68m are being offered to Ghanaian and other
West African investors. This is equivalent to 45 per cent of the previous
total capitalisation of companies quoted on the Acra stock exchange, and is
over 10 per cent of Ghana's total bank liquidity. Some 10,000 Ashanti
employees are to receive five free shares each in the floatation.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Spain to float part of Endesa
holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Grupo Teneo, the Spanish state holding group, is to place up to 10 per cent
of its equity in the profitable Endesa electrical utility on the market next
month, in an international public offering expected to raise Pta180bn
(Dollars 1.3bn).
The offering, which will reduce Teneo's shareholding in Endesa to around 65
per cent, will be weighted towards Spanish institutions and especially
towards retail investors. It will, however, include tranches for the US,
Europe and the rest of the world.
The four-week registration period for potential domestic retail buyers of
Endesa shares opened yesterday.
Teneo said the international tranches would be reduced if there was a strong
enough demand among small Spanish investors.
At present, US institutions hold nearly half of the 25 per cent of Endesa
equity that is traded. Teneo said one of the objects of the offering was to
increase the number of Spanish shareholders in the utility.
Mr Javier Salas, Teneo's chairman, said the income from the share disposal
would be directed towards consolidating the public holding.
The income is particularly needed by Iberia, the national airline, whose
losses last year were chiefly responsible for a sharp fall, to Pta3bn from
Pta21bn, in Teneo's net earnings.
Endesa, which raised its net profit last year by 9.9 per cent to Pta116.8bn,
is the dominant player in the highly-regulated domestic electricity market.
Together with its affiliated companies, it produces more than half of
Spain's electric power and distributes around 40 per cent.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Derwent buys Heronproperties for Pounds 33m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heron Group has raised Pounds 33.4m from the sale of seven properties to
Derwent Valley Holdings, taking the value of asset disposals by the property
and trading group to more than Pounds 250m since June last year.
Derwent's shares fell 20p to 588p on the announcement. The company plans to
fund the acquisition partly through a 1-for-3 rights issue at 500p to raise
Pounds 18.6m net.
The portfolio includes 4 properties in the west end of London, where 85 per
cent of Derwent's existing portfolio is situated.
Mr John Burns, managing director, said the properties had been
'hand-picked'. The deal will enhance Derwent's income, offering an initial
yield of 10.3 per cent, falling to 9.5 per cent in September, as a result of
lease renewal.
However, as a result of shares being issued at a discount to their 544p net
asset value, Derwent's asset value per share will fall to 528p.
Mr Burns said the portfolio offered a balance of long and short leases,
enabling Derwent to add value through active management. There is also
longer-term redevelopment potential for some properties.
The company completed a Pounds 17m placing in mid-1993, and has since
invested Pounds 57m in the UK property market, including the latest
purchase. Its gearing will rise to 60 per cent.
Heron said the property sales, made by its Heron Corporation subsidiary, had
been at values above those in its business plan.
However, under its restructuring agreement, the property proceeds are tied
to Heron Corporation's own debt. It will not affect Heron International
bondholders, who currently face a request for deferred interest payments,
primarily because of the impact of declining European property values.

FT  15 APR 94 / Ford to take full ownership of Hertz and raise payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ford Motor, the US vehicle manufacturer, announced yesterday that it is to
take full ownership of its subsidiary Hertz, the world's largest car rental
company, by buying out Sweden's Volvo and the company's management, which
together own 46 per cent.
Ford also confirmed it was selling its troubled California savings and
loans, First Nationwide Bank, for Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 745m) to
Dallas-based First Madison Bank. The carmaker also announced a 12.5 per cent
increase in its quarterly dividend - the first change since it cut the
payout in April 1991.
Ford recently increased its stake in Hertz from 49 per cent to 54 per cent
through the purchase of a 5 per cent stake held by Germany's Commerzbank. It
will now pay Dollars 145m to Volvo for its 26 per cent stake, consisting of
common and preferred stock, and will buy out the management's 20 per cent
holding for an undisclosed sum.
Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said the deal was part of its strategy
of sharpening its business focus. It would also improve the company's net
debt figure.
Ford said it regarded rentals as a core part of its car business. The deal
ensured excellent exposure for its products. About 70 per cent of Hertz's
vehicle purchases in the US come from Ford, while the US carmaker supplies a
third of its European fleet. Last year Hertz had net income of Dollars 53m
on turnover of Dollars 2.85bn.
Ford added that First Nationwide was being sold at a small premium above
tangible book value. Ford would take a Dollars 440m charge against
first-quarter earnings, mainly to reflect non-recovery of goodwill, as well
as reserves for losses on retained assets. Ford bought First Nationwide in
1985 for around Dollars 500m and rapidly ran into property loan problems.
Ford's quarterly dividend was raised from 40 cents to 45 cents from June 1
and the company also declared a two-for-one stock split.
The three Detroit carmakers all cut their dividends in early 1991 in the
midst of recession. Chrysler was the first to announce a raise - of one
third - unveiled in December, but GM has yet to move.

FT  15 APR 94 / (CORRECTED) BSI changes quality standard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 21st April 1994) appended to this article.
The British Standards Institution has bowed to criticism that it is
unresponsive to the needs of smaller companies by promising to make
certification for the BS5750 quality assurance standard simpler and cheaper.
BSI Quality Assurance, the BSI's certification arm, said companies with less
than 10 employees would pay a fee of Pounds 990 for registration and Pounds
710 for the subsequent annual assessment - a reduction of about Pounds 200
in both fees.
CORRECTION
There has been no change to BS5750, the quality assurance standard, as
implied in last Friday's FT.

<TEXT>
Pharmacia, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday scotched rumours of
a possible delay in its privatisation, saying the industry ministry had
given the go-ahead for the sale of the state's 46 per cent holding in June.
The move could raise as much as SKr14bn (Dollars 1.8bn), making it Sweden's
biggest privatisation. Around half the shares are expected to be offered to
foreign institutions.
Mr Jan Ekberg, chief executive, said the mode of privatisation had not been
finalised, leaving open the possibility that the state might issue warrants
or options to buy shares. The prospectus will be issued on May 24.
Mr Ekberg said the company, one of the world's top 20 drugs groups with 1993
pro-forma sales of SKr27.4bn, would also be seeking a listing in the US.
There had been talk of the sell-off being postponed due to worries about the
size of the offer, and unsettled market conditions.
Volvo is Pharmacia's other main shareholder, with a 28 per cent stake.
Antonia Sharpe adds: Pharmacia plans to access the syndicated loan market
with a Dollars 500m five-year revolving credit facility. JP Morgan and Union
Bank of Switzerland will act as joint arrangers.

Perstorp, the Swedish specialty chemicals and plastics group, reported
strong progress in the six months to February 1994, lifting profits after
financial items to SKr270m (Dollars 34.07m) from SKr114m in the same period
a year ago.
The group said rationalisation, greater penetration of new markets, and the
weakening krona had helped to compensate for poor market conditions in
Europe.
All six divisions increased sales, lifting total group turnover by 24 per
cent to SKr4.99bn.
Mr Gosta Wiking, the president, said that full-year earnings were expected
to 'substantially exceed' last year's SKr331m level.
'The European economy remains weak, but many factors indicate that a
levelling-off is in progress,' he noted.
Sophus Berendsen, the Danish majority shareholder in Rentokil, the UK
company, has proposed an increase in the dividend to DKr4.00 from DKr3.50
per share after increasing net profits last year to DKr1.21bn (Dollars 180m)
from DKr465m in 1992, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
Pre-tax profits increased to DKr2.04bn from DKr. 1.21bn and turnover was up
to DKr9.87bn from DKr7.77bn.
The increase in the group's earnings reflects Rentokil's acquisition of
Securigard, the UK security company, and Berendsen's acquisition of Lucas
Fluid Power, the hydraulics group.

FT  15 APR 94 / World Trade News: Asea Brown Boveri wins Dollars 1bn
Malaysia power deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, has won a
Dollars 1bn contract to build a turnkey 1300MW combined-cycle power plant at
Lumut in the Malaysian province of Perak.
The contract is believed to be the largest awarded to power suppliers
worldwide in recent months, and underlines the importance of the
fast-growing Malaysian market for power equipment, due to the country's
strong economic performance.
It comes six weeks after Malaysia imposed a ban on UK companies bidding for
public contracts in protest at reports in the UK media of corruption. The
ban was a blow to UK power equipment suppliers and contractors such as
Rolls-Royce and John Brown, although contractors have been hoping they could
still win orders from private customers.
The Lumut order was placed by Sikap Energy Ventures, a Malaysian independent
power producer. There were no rival UK bidders to ABB.
The gas-fired plant will be Malaysia's largest combined-cycle power station,
and ABB said it would supply about 11 per cent of the country's electricity
needs.
Construction will begin immediately and the first stage of the project is
due to be operating by July 1996, with the rest ready by July 1997.
The station will be equipped with six ABB gas turbines, two steam turbines
and eight associated electrical generators. It will incorporate ABB's
low-NOx burners to produce high fuel efficiency with low emissions.
Earlier this week, Westinghouse Electric of the US announced a contract
worth more than Dollars 100m from Korea Electric Power for power generation
equipment at a 300MW power plant to be built at Ilsan, South Korea.

Fifty American, European and Asian companies agreed yesterday on technical
standards for home digital video cassette recorders, which provide better
picture quality and cleaner copies of tapes, AP reports from Tokyo.
The agreement means average consumers could be able to buy a digital VCR as
soon as early next year, industry officials said.
A conference in Tokyo that included the leading Japanese makers announced
standards for VCRs used with conventional televisions and for those used
with Japan's high-definition TV system, called Hi-Vision.

FT  15 APR 94 / EU 'should help draw in central European states'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union should set up new structures to help integrate central
Europe and to circumvent vested interests which could prevent these nations
joining the Union for at least two decades.
This is the conclusion of a report for the European Commission published
today by Richard Baldwin of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, the
independent think-tank.
Mr Baldwin says present arrangements consist of bilateral Association
Agreements, which link the central Europeans separately to the EU. These
allow limited access to the EU market, but do nothing to promote
intra-central European trade and inhibit investment in the region.
Beyond the Association Agreements lies the far horizon of EU membership,
promised for an unspecified future at last year's Copenhagen summit of Union
heads of government. But in between, Mr Baldwin said 'there is nothing to
get us from here to there.'
He argues that two concentric circles should be built around the EU core
gradually to integrate central Europe.
The outer circle would include all central Europe and provide a duty-free
zone for industrial products. Any liberalisation in one member would have to
extend to all others, promoting trade on a pan-European basis. Mr Baldwin
says this move would make trade policy more predictable and entice
investors.
A second circle, an Organisation for European Integration, closer to the EU
for front-runners like Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics
and possibly Slovenia, would spread the single market to the region. Free
movement of labour would be excluded but any central European country could
move into this circle as soon as it was ready.
Although Germany, due to take over the EU presidency in July, is expected to
push for Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics to join by 2000,
Mr Baldwin believes this will be resisted.
He estimates the cost of their entry in 2000 in farm and regional subsidies
would be a net Ecu58bn (Dollars 65bn) and that these four countries would
need to grow at 6 per cent a year for two decades to reach 75 per cent of
average EU income.
Mr Baldwin notes that EU farmers and poor regions would fight entry, richer
member states will baulk at the implied 60 per cent increase in their
conributions to the Union budget, and small EU members will resist dilution
of their powers in the inevitable reform of EU voting rules which would
follow.
The need to broaden the current structure has already established itself in
the Commission's current review of central Europe policy. But Mr Baldwin's
analysis underplays the extent to which security concerns could propel
faster integration of central Europe. Equally, his consideration of
integration costs ignores the fact that the bulk of current regional aid to
poor EU member states flows back to the richer countries as construction
contracts and equipment supplies.

FT  15 APR 94 / Electronics giants reach accord on digital VCR design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A costly battle over the design of the next generation of video cassette
recorders has been averted by an agreement on technical standards between
the world's leading consumer electronics companies.
The accord, reached in Tokyo yesterday by the 50 members of the HD Digital
Conference, is expected to avert a standards war of the kind that marred the
introduction of analogue video recorders.
Sony had led the way with its technically superior Betamax format but
eventually - in what was an expensive failure - had to concede defeat to
JVC, which was more successful in persuading video film suppliers to use its
VHS standard.
Mr Andrew House of Sony, acting as spokesman for the companies, said in
Tokyo that digital technology would change the VCR industry 'in the same way
that digital has changed the music business by replacing vinyl records with
compact discs'.
Other members of the HD Digital VCR Conference include Matsushita and
Toshiba of Japan, Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France. The
computer companies IBM and Apple of the US are members because digital VCRs
can be used to store computer data.
The standards are for high-definition digital VCRs, which use the binary
digits ('bits') of computer language rather than analogue signals to record
images and sounds. Digital VCRs will give greatly improved picture quality
and make for cleaner tape copies.
Industry executives believe digital VCRs could be in the shops as early as
next year. They are expected, however, to be expensive, with some estimates
putting the cost of a machine at up to Dollars 3,000.
Digital VCRs have been used by professionals for some time, but until
recently were too large for domestic use. The new machines will use tapes
about two-thirds the size of a conventional VHS cassette with 4.5 hours
recording time. Smaller versions will be possible.
VCR manufacturers have been encouraged to agree a standard among themselves
because the costs and risks of taking the wrong development path are
increasing. Manufacturers feel they should be able to develop products safe
in the knowledge that they will not be wrong-footed by the success of a
competitor's technology.
Consumers, equally, should be able to buy the new machines with the
confidence that they will not be left with obsolescent products if another
technology captures the market.
The agreement covers standards for VCRs used with conventional televisions
and for Japan's high-definition television system. The conference said
standards for a future HDTV system now being developed in the US should be
ready by the end of the year.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (13): Thatcher-style public relations -
Profile / Tansu Ciller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister is running behind schedule. The man with the face like a
cooked ham is a British public relations adviser who used to work for Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, her British former counterpart. Another adviser is on the
phone to Elle magazine in Germany about the possibility of doing a cover
story during Mrs Tansu Ciller's trip to Bonn.
Unfortunately, Mrs Ciller's policy achievements have often failed to match
the aplomb of her public relations.
She is certainly not the 'agent of change' that one western ambassador
suggested. But for all her lack of experience, she has a strong instinct for
survival. Her party's narrow victory in local polls on March 27 is largely
put down to her popularity. The man on the street says that she should be
given the benefit of the doubt. It is hard to find a shopkeeper who blames
her for the economic mess - though that is not the view in the boardrooms
and banking halls of Istanbul.
Mrs Ciller is a walking contradiction. A successful, independently wealthy
woman in a male-dominated, Moslem society, she seems equally at home donning
the headscarf in deference to Islam or a football scarf in support of the
soccer team Galatasaray's short-lived but heroic run in the European Cup.
Her rise to power owes much to the patronage of Mr Suleyman Demirel, the
former prime minister, whose election to the presidency paved the way for
Mrs Ciller's leadership victory.
Mr Demirel was reportedly impressed by her robust criticisms of the late
Turgut Ozal, then Motherland party prime minister, when she worked for
Tusiad, the businessmen's association. During the election campaign of 1990,
Mrs Ciller was frequently photographed on Mr Demirel's right hand. It worked
for the six-times prime minister. His True Path party won the election,
though without an outright majority. What perhaps he did not count on was
having to give Mrs Ciller a senior cabinet position.
After more than 10 months in office, Mrs Ciller's hold on power is still
something of a mystery. Her impetuous management style has shaken the crusty
bureaucrats in Ankara. The casualty list is impressive - two central bank
governors have resigned since she became prime minister. The former head of
the state planning organisation has become one of her most virulent public
critics.
Her victory in the True Path party congress in June 1993 over Mrs Ismet
Sezgin, nominally the choice of Mr Demirel, is largely unexplained.
She seemed genuinely puzzled when asked during the campaign how many party
MPs could be relied on to vote for her. One senior DYP figure says none of
the cabinet supported her candidacy.
Mrs Ciller, a 48-year-old former Istanbul economics professor, is in many
ways a political 'naif'. The Turkish press has been kind. Despite rumours
about her husband's irregular business dealings - particularly about the
collapse in the 1980s of the Istanbul Bank, of which he was a director -
there seems to be no Whitewater waiting to engulf the prime minister.
Cynics point out that Mrs Ciller helped the newspapers financially with
generous tax breaks and investment incentives just before the leadership
challenge.
Her economic policies will continue to be under close scrutiny, but her
political ideas remain obscure. Her strong line on the Kurds clearly served
her well in the local elections. Indeed, one of the most lasting impressions
of her administration has been the way she has accommodated the military -
in the fight against the Kurds and in the more parochial matter of pay rises
for the armed forces and the extension of the service of General Dogan
Gures, the chief of general staff.
Gen Gures was among the first of the public figures to applaud Mrs Ciller's
recently unveiled austerity package.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (12): On the last lap to a customs union -
John Murray Brown assesses a move that will have a great impact on the
country's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 20 years of fitful progress, Turkey and the European Union seem
finally to have embarked on the last lap to a customs union. The visit to
Ankara in early February of Sir Leon Brittan, the EU external affairs
commissioner, has given a new momentum to the project. If all goes to plan,
the trade barriers are scheduled to be lifted in 1995, marking the most
important change in Turkey's business environment, and a further milestone
in its bid for full EU membership.
Considerable adjustment is required not just to Turkey's budget but also to
the trade balance with the EU and to those sectors of industry most
vulnerable to import competition.
Implementing a customs union is difficult at the best of times, but Turkey
is trying to do so with its own domestic economy in turmoil.
Recent turbulence in Turkish currency markets has forced the government to
devalue the lira by 12 per cent. Commission officials believe the crisis has
made it all the more urgent that Turkey address the structural problems of
its economy before lowering its guard to its EU competition. On many counts
 -inflation, interest rates and the public sector deficit - Turkey diverges
from the European norms.
Some Turks wonder whether the attempt to integrate the country's economy
with the EU is too ambitious. Nevertheless, Sir Leon asserts that customs
union will have a stimulative effect. However, he warns that without
underpinning the recent devaluation with an austerity programme, Turkey is
in danger of dissipating the gains that might accrue from customs union.
Turkey might make a better case for financial adjustment funds to help ease
the process of economic integration. The Turks point out that they will be
the only country to enter a customs union without first being a full member.
As long as Greece continues to use its veto to block the flow of Ecus,
Turkey could soon be 'the only country between the Straits of Gibraltar and
the Sea of Japan not to get EC aid,' as one official once put it.
Currently the only assistance available is under the EU's renovated
Mediterranean policy, a regional assistance programme framed in the late
1980s less with Turkey in mind than to counter the growing threat of
large-scale migration from the Maghreb countries of North Africa.
Yet, despite the inevitable pain of transition to a more deregulated
economy, Turkey's commitment to trade liberalisation has always been
motivated more by political than economic imperatives. Unlike some of the
Nordic countries, Turkey's political parties, with the exception of the
Moslem-backed Refah or Welfare party, all support the objective of closer
ties with Europe.
Though Turkey's application for full EU membership was politely shelved in
1989, western officials believe there is little realistic prospect of
accession in the foreseeable future. But Ankara is all too aware that any
slip-up in its customs union timetable in 1995 would damage even those
distant ambitions, at a time when Turkey is already losing ground to a queue
of eastern and central European countries.
In some sectors, convergence is already happening. In financial services,
for example, Turkey has already adopted many of the EU banking directives.
As the number of foreign companies setting up joint ventures with local
partners picks up, national brand names are giving way to international
products.
Both Turkey and the EU have compelling reasons for seeing the negotiations
through to a successful conclusion. For the EU, customs union will mark a
further deepening of trade relations. Turkey is a dynamic regional trade
hub. With a population of 60m, the country is already the EU's ninth largest
export market.
What is more, over the past decade the Turkish economy has enjoyed average
growth of more than 6 per cent, higher than any member of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development. Last year, two-way trade exceeded
Dollars 20bn. In Brussels, Turkey is viewed as a vital partner in the newly
emerging economies of the Black Sea and central Asia.
If there is to be a permanent solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute, then
here too Turkey will play a big role, controlling as it does much of the
region's vital water resources.
The move to a customs union will not be easy. The World Bank, in an article
in its Economic Review last year, suggested a customs union would 'have
little beneficial effect on welfare'. The impact of trade reform seems
certain to exacerbate the already wide disparities of income between
Turkey's prosperous western seaboard and the poverty-stricken eastern
provinces.
The economic case for trade liberalisation is that it will stimulate
efficiencies, deepen Turkey's industrial base and encourage foreign capital
investment in sectors where Turkey has real comparative advantage, such as
processed foods, retailing and light industries such as vehicle components.
However, the exercise presents a big challenge for the Turkish economy.
Treasury officials estimate that the move to lower tariffs could reduce tax
revenues by as much as Dollars 3bn a year. As the barriers come down,
imports are set to rise by a further Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn, adding to
the trade account deficit, which in 1993 was already at a record Dollars
14bn. In the current financial environment, it has been hard for Turkish
companies to make the sort of long-term investments in upgrading technology
needed to weather the increased foreign competition.
For foreign investors too, the customs union is forcing a rethink of
strategies. Until now, most foreign companies have been attracted to Turkey
because of the size of its market, its large population and, most important,
because of the protection offered to an investor. With customs union, the
market share of local producers is likely to come under pressure from
imports. Moreover, until the government tackles the problem of inflation,
which is as high as 70 per cent, and real interest costs of 30 per cent, the
occasions where it pays to site plant in Turkey rather than to import will
remain rare.
Just to complete the administrative workload Turkey faces an awesome agenda.
The urgency is underlined by the fact that all of this has to be completed
by November, when a ministerial meeting of the Turkish-EU association
council is due to set a final date for completion.
Several problems remain to be ironed out. Further reductions are needed to
arrive at a zero tariff for EU goods and the adoption of the common external
tariff (CET) applied to all incoming goods - the fact which distinguishes a
customs union from a free trade agreement. From a sample of 501 industrial
items, the commission estimates that the effective protection levied against
EU goods is still about 15 per cent. The Union, since 1973, has provided
duty-free access for all Turkish industrial goods, except textiles which
remain restricted by quota.
There are issues in the political arena, too. Real doubts remain that the
Turkish parliament, given its poor record of passing legislation, can meet
the legislative timetable to bring trade and industrial policy into line
with that of the EU on issues that range from intellectual property rights
to competition and state aid policy. The commission insists that until the
necessary legislation has been approved and actually implemented, the
customs union will not be fully working. Both sides are giving renewed
impetus to the process through the EU-Turkish parliamentary group - normally
the forum for European attacks on Turkey's human rights record.
But the main obstacle is likely to come from Turkey's large protected
industries including cars and consumer electronics. Having prospered behind
high tariff barriers for so long, these are understandably reluctant to lose
their privileges and confront the cold blast of import competition. In the
car industry - Turkey assembles locally-made Fiats and Renaults - protection
levels are still around 30 per cent. A report commissioned by the car
manufacturers' association suggested that Turkey would need another five
years of protection to recover the cost of investments in new models now
being undertaken, in expectation of the increased competition.
Paradoxically, the threat to the car industry is not so much from EU imports
as from eastern and central Europe, with the Czech Skoda and the Russian
Lada already making inroads, and likely to penetrate further once the 10 per
cent CET for cars from third countries is adopted.
The commission's position is that if the car industry wins a delay in the
timetable past 1995, then European textile manufacturers will almost
certainly argue for the retention of quotas. 'What's sauce for the goose is
sauce for the gander,' as Sir Leon Brittan put it.
The narrow victory won by Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, in last
month's local elections has given the government a breathing space. But the
commission is certainly under no illusions as to the difficulties in
bringing Turkey into a customs union.

<TEXT>
Talking to Osman Unsal, it is easy to forget the country is grappling with
its worst financial crisis for a decade.
Just back from yet another trip to south-east Asia, he sounds like a
born-again capitalist who has seen the promised land - in his case the tiny
island state of Singapore.
A former Citibank employee, with a taste for monogrammed shirt cuffs, Mr
Unsal is today the government official the business community loves to hate.
For Mr Unsal, 39, is a key confidant of Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime
minister.
His lack of years has already been the cause of one humiliation: bureaucrats
in Ankara succeeded in blocking his appointment as Treasury head on the
grounds that he had seen insufficient time in the civil service. Since the
announcement of the austerity package, Mr Unsal has been replaced as acting
under-secretary at the treasury, moving instead to the prime ministry.
Mr Unsal made his name as head of the foreign investment department under
the former Motherland party administration. His connection with Mrs Ciller
goes back further - she was his professor at the Bogazici University.
It is his public finance strategy that is widely blamed for fuelling
overnight rates, which led to high borrowing costs, causing a dramatic
contraction of business activity, and leaving the banking sector gasping for
breath.
His bid to restructure the government's domestic debt is seen as the main
cause for the collapse of the Treasury bill market.
In the wake of January's 12 per cent devaluation and the subsequent currency
turmoil, interest rates on government bills have shot up to 125 per cent,
and even at that rate there is little demand. The Treasury is selling less
than TL100bn at its Wednesday auction compared with an average figure of
around TL20,000bn last year.
Mr Unsal's strategy had a certain elegance. By lengthening maturities, the
government set out to ease its debt service burden. The side-effect,
however, was that the repeated cancellation of the weekly auction has left
the market with an overhang of Turkish lira - one of the main factors
fuelling dollar demand, and leading to the run on the currency.
'I didn't say that interest rates should come down. I just said for one-year
paper I'll pay more. We were lucky to do that. If we had gone into this
crisis with heavy three-month funding for the Treasury, we would have been
in deep trouble. But in nominal terms, it's the same as last year or even
less than last year.
'I don't think we have a problem,' Mr Unsal avers, pointing to a 30 per cent
increase in foreign investment approvals in 1993. 'On the contrary, with the
customs union (with the European Union) Turkey will be a production centre,
a stepping stone, the penetration point for the markets.'
His personal conviction has so far failed to persuade the markets. The lira
has lost close to 35 per cent in the wake of the 12 per cent devaluation in
January.
Mr Unsal is keen to stress that whatever has happened was a collective
decision. 'It wasn't fair to blame me. We had hourly meetings or daily
meetings, with the central bank, the state planning organisation and with
finance.'
He prefers to put a more positive gloss on what has happened. 'Because of
our inability to borrow in the last two months, our projected stock of
Treasury paper will be something like 22 per cent of our GNP, when it was
quoted in the budget at 26 per cent.'
Turkey's problems, he asserts, are short-term. 'To lose the confidence of
the market can happen in just one day. To rebuild you may need more than one
day. But the public should realise, the banks should realise, it's normal to
have such disturbances.'
Mr Unsal appears equally confident that the banking sector can ride out the
crisis. 'If you make money with your short position, you may lose with your
short position, and that's a fact of life,' he says.
But he is sensitive to the suggestion that his policies contributed to the
currency crisis. 'Everyone needs a reason for a problem,' he says, searching
for an explanation. 'Tax was certainly one aspect. If you start taxing some
of the instruments and not others, you create a disturbance to the advantage
of one and disadvantage of the other.
'Treasury paper was used as a tax shelter. In late November, when the tax
rumours started, that's when the banks started to cover their positions.'

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (10): A meteor falls to earth - Anne
Counsell on the stock market fall-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to an Istanbul analyst, 'the PMT set off the market's decline and
it was all downhill from then on.' He is not talking about hormones. 'Post
Moody's Tension' on the Istanbul stock market resulted in an evaporation of
confidence and the disappearance of funds.
The acronym and the trading room banter belie the financial fall-out of
recent months. The parlous state of Turkey's public finances was highlighted
by Moody's rating agency in mid-January when it downgraded Turkey's
long-term debt rating from BAA to BA1, considered a 'junk' rating. This was
briskly followed by Standard &amp; Poor's which reduced its long-term foreign
currency rating from BBB to BBB minus.
The Istanbul Stock Exchange 60-share composite index ducked and dived with
the ensuing upheavals on the foreign exchange market as Turks rushed to buy
dollars and interbank overnight interest rates rose to 150 per cent.
By early February the index had sunk 30 per cent from its high of 28,300 in
early January. There was no respite - inflation figures turned sharply
upwards and the second central bank governor in six months resigned. The
stock market dropped a further 23 per cent to hover uneasily around the
13,000 level.
Trading volumes all but collapsed as traders retreated to lick their wounds
and await the outcome of municipal elections. Turnover plummeted to TL1
trillion (Dollars 56m) from an average of TL4 trillion in early January when
the market was at its high.
On the almost empty trading floor, boards are locked within half an hour as
prices hit lower limits for the day - a far cry from the halcyon days of
last year when traders streamed into the rundown stock market building near
the dockside. Last year, Istanbul was a darling of the emerging markets,
rising by a meteoric 194 per cent in dollar terms and outperformed only by
Poland in the emerging markets league.
In November, the high levels of foreign interest and recognition of the
market's own regulatory system resulted in the Istanbul market joining the
two dozen exchanges in the world granted the status of 'designated offshore
securities market' by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Last year, everyone was buying on expectation, now they are selling on
reality,' says Mr Ozkan Gokdemir, general manager of Carmen Investment.
The shares of many companies have fallen below their book values. Erdemir,
an iron and steel producer which last year invested Dollars 1.5bn in new
plant and equipment, could be bought outright for Dollars 350m when its
shares fell to their low of 15 cents.
Mr Kosta Zamani, of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's
private sector lending arm, is cautiously optimistic that the market will
improve over the long term. However, he expects a prolonged recovery for the
market due to the perilous economic conditions. 'The economy hasn't been
mismanaged,' he says. 'It hasn't been managed at all.'
The next few months, he believes, will be critical. Much will depend on
whether the recent austerity package is sufficient, credible or can be
implemented, especially the political difficult closure of several
loss-making state enterprises.
Mrs Ciller's track record on the economy has been less than glowing and the
stop-start privatisation programme has left the market sceptical. In happier
days, the stock exchange hoped that privatisation would boost the hungry
market with new issues. Today brokers are doubtful that the programme will
succeed, noting that more has been spent on studies than has been realised
by sell-offs.
In March, a report by the Istanbul-based Turkish Young Businessmen's
Association said the success of privatisation would depend on political
resolve, noting that 'officials approach privatisation as an independent
issue rather than as part of an economic improvement plan'. By way of
encouragement, the report pointed out that 'privatisation programmes had
been implemented successfully even in countries with worse economic
indicators than Turkey.'
The consensus, however, is for a semblance of stability after the volatility
of recent months. A few of the optimists hope that the economy will be on an
even keel by the time the stock market moves to its expansive, new premises
in the Istinye business district of Istanbul. Those with more bearish
tendencies note that the move has already been delayed by six months, as has
the change-over to a fully automated trading system.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (9): One-way street for imports - Car
manufacturers' fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's vehicle manufacturers are reluctant to be guinea pigs. The unique
and unchartered prospect of customs union with the European Union without
full EU membership has little appeal to an industry which has enjoyed high
tariff barriers, a growing market and government incentives.
'We are not opposed to competition, nor are we against customs union,' says
Professor Ercan Tezer, secretary-general of the carmakers' association
(OSD). 'We do not want to delay customs union. All we are asking for is a
reasonable period to adjust within a proper programme and schedule.'
The industry is worried that sudden deregulation will be a one-way street,
resulting in a flood of imports, especially from eastern Europe, Japan and
Korea. Lada and Skoda already account for over 50 per cent of the import
market and this would climb rapidly if Turkey were to adopt the EU's common
commercial tariff for third countries.
The OSD, which represents Turkey's 15 passenger, commercial, light goods and
tractor manufacturers, has been lobbying the government and Brussels for a
reprieve. It recently commissioned a report by McKinsey's, the US management
consultancy, which concluded that the industry needs another five years to
consolidate its investment programmes and prepare for customs union.
The motor industry has been Turkey's fastest growing manufacturing industry
with an average annual growth rate of 12.5 per cent between 1987 and 1992.
In terms of production, it ranks third after food processing and textiles
and provides employment for more than 0.5m people.
The two largest companies, Tofas - a joint venture with Fiat - and Oyak
Renault together enjoyed a market share of 73.9 per cent in 1993. Total car
sales in 1993 were 441,829, a 40 per cent increase over 1992 with demand
fuelled by Turkey's high growth rates, the availability of credit and rapid
urbanisation. In addition, the number of cars per 1,000 people stands at 35,
one tenth of the average in western Europe, highlighting the potential for
sales growth.
So why the fuss about customs union? The runaway rise in production and
sales flies in the face of the general European trend, which has been quite
in the opposite direction.
'There has been a long-term programme of investment in the Turkish car
industry,' says Mr Jan Nahum, general manager of Tofas. 'Twenty-two years
ago there was no auto market, even 10 years ago a viable auto sector was
unimaginable.'
Tofas, which in 1993 cornered 44.1 per cent of the domestic market, produces
three main series - the Bird, based on the Fiat 131, the Tipo and the Tempra
series with different models in each category. Tofas and its main
competitor, Oyak Renault, are the only producers achieving close to optimum
capacity.
In order to benefit from economies of scale and to remain competitive, the
two producers have been improving their production, expanding capacity and
modernising their manufacturing and assembly lines. Both argue that they
need more time to establish their projects and to consolidate these
investments.
Tofas plans to introduce the Uno series to its range in the last quarter of
this year. The company has spent over Dollars 140m of its Dollars 500m
allocation for plant modernisation by reinvesting retained earnings and
credits in the industry.
Renault is also expanding its range in Turkey - adding the Renault 19 to its
existing 9,11,12 and 21 series. The launch is scheduled for September and
falls within a Dollars 300m investment plan for increasing capacity and
modernising its plants.
The spur to investment and modernisation has also been prompted by the
arrival of other producers, attracted by the growing market and keen to
establish a foothold in Turkey before the advent of customs union.
The local Ford licensee, Otosan, began producing the Escort model late last
year following a Dollars 25m investment programme at its Istanbul plant. A
joint venture between Turkey's Sabanci Holding and Toyota of Japan is
building a production plant near Istanbul while Honda and Hyundai have
recently obtained government approval for two new car plants under 50 per
cent joint ventures with local concerns.
Hard on the heels of these new investments came a damaging blow. The auto
industry's anxieties over the possible effects of customs union were
heightened at the start of this year when the sector experienced the shock
of a sudden, steep drop in sales. The 12 per cent devaluation of the lira
and a sharp rise in interest rates stopped car sales in their tracks.
Consumer lending virtually dried up and car sales fell during January and
February, leaving manufacturers with mounting stocks, an almost unknown
phenomenon in Turkey.
The economic uncertainty had an immediate and brutal impact - Tofas workers
were put on paid leave and Renault cut production by bringing forward paid
leave and working a shorter week.
The country's economic difficulties were compounded by the political
uncertainty with no prospect of an upturn in sales until well after the
municipal elections at the end of March. The unexpectedly good showing of
prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller at the polls and the prospect of a
stabilisation programme provide only the faintest glimmer of hope for the
car industry.
'Disastrous' is the most frequently used adjective to describe the first
quarter of 1994 for the industry. The possible effect on investment together
with the prospect of lay-offs have armed the sector with more ammunition to
argue for an adjustment period to customs union. Meanwhile, other industries
are joining the chorus, cautioning that customs union may not be as
beneficial as at first appeared.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (7): Caught between a rock and a hard place
 -Anne Counsell on Ankara's predicament in the conflicts of the Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intently gazing westwards towards Europe in the hope of economic and
political engagement, Turkey remains constantly mindful of its geographic
location, regional importance and fractious neighbours.
It is therefore somewhat piqued that the west appears less than sympathetic
to Ankara's predicament as an 'interface' with the Middle East, quite apart
from other complicating factors arising from its position abutting Central
Asia and the Balkans.
'We are caught between a rock and a hard place,' says a foreign ministry
official, mildly rebuking the western notion of Turkey as an area of calm in
a troubled sea. Additionally, the place and relative weight of Turkey in US
and European foreign policies on the Middle East is a source of both hurt
pride and confusion for Ankara, which senses an often arbitrary treatment of
Turkey's 'special position'.
Associate membership of the Western European Union (WEU) is cited as an
illustration of a perceived failure of co-operation with Europe, for it
gives Turkey a seat at the table but with no guarantees.
As well, Turkey is resigned to a prolonged - if not futile - wait for
membership of the EU, and has felt slighted as Nordic and east European
countries leap-frog the queue.
There is a strong, although understated, displeasure that Turkey is
considered merely a buffer between Europe and the Middle East rather than a
true friend. This sentiment has gained ground as the country continues to
experience the sharp end of the United Nations embargo against Iraq
following the Gulf War.
'The Gulf War was not between Iraq and Kuwait and Turkey,' said Mr Hikmet
Cetin, the Turkish foreign minister late last year. 'But now everyone is
gone and Turkey is being penalised.'
This message was taken up by Mrs Tansu Ciller, the Turkish prime minister,
during a recent visit to Washington where she emphasised Turkey's economic
losses resulting from the continued closure of the 986km pipeline running
from the Iraqi oilfields of Kirkuk to Turkey's southern coast. It has not
been used since August 1990 when Turkey turned off the tap in compliance
with the UN trade embargo against Iraq. About 7m barrels of crude is trapped
in the pipeline, of which 3.2m belong to Turkey.
Mrs Ciller put the total cost to Turkey at around Dollars 20bn, including
direct revenue and royalties losses of Dollars 2bn annually. Indirect losses
include the halt in supplies of cheap petroleum for domestic consumption,
the steep fall in tourist numbers, pipeline construction costs and
outstanding trade debts. In addition, mounting unemployment in the
south-east has, in turn, created further economic difficulties and
exacerbated problems of migration and terrorism.
The pipeline also faces corrosion as well as attack from Kurdish groups.
Turkey wants the pipeline emptied of oil and made ready for immediate use
once the embargo is lifted. It has suggested a framework for doing this in
co-operation with Iraq. This scheme was politely turned down by the US,
which said it could only be done within existing UN Security Council
resolutions.
To add insult to injury, the UN sanctions committee has allowed Iraq to
export 50,000 barrels a day of crude and 20,000 b/d of fuel oil to Jordan
because of the kingdom's economic difficulties. 'Which side was Jordan on in
the Gulf War?' asked a senior Turkish official pointedly, adding that Turkey
had followed the western line to its own detriment.
There are indications that Turkey is reshaping its Middle East policy. It is
assuming a higher profile in Arab-Israeli relations, Iraq and in finding a
solution to the region's water problems. At the same time Ankara is taking
account of its domestic situation - in particular the cross-border
activities of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) - but it is also toeing the
west's diplomatic line.
Turkey has conveyed to the US its view that Ankara should resume a 'business
as usual' approach with Baghdad. This does not entirely complement the US
State Department's declared dual containment policy towards Iraq and Iran
and the strong US line precludes Turkey from developing normal ties with
either. It is an uneasy position for Turkey, which views PKK containment as
more vital than the US concern of ensuring that Tehran and Baghdad do not
obtain nuclear weapons.
The Kurdish issue is intrinsic to Turkish foreign policy. There are
significant Kurdish populations in Syria, Iran and Iraq, a factor which
intermittently swings from being a binding force between the littoral states
to a source of tension and disagreement.
Relations between Turkey and its Arab neighbours have increasingly been
governed by the Kurdish issue. Ankara is opposed to an independent Kurdish
state but holds out the possibility of an autonomous area in northern Iraq
if the people wish to return to 1974 autonomy or some other form of
self-government.
The location of PKK resistance groups in northern Iraq is a source of
constant antagonism to Ankara. In January, more than 50 F16 and F4 Turkish
jets attacked the PKK base at Zaleh on Iraq's border with Iran. The attack
may have been carried out with the help of Iran, which closed escape routes.
Aware that good relations hinge on control over PKK cells, Turkey and Iran
have improved co-operation on security matters. Iran's main worry is the
Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq group, which has also been active in Turkey.
Turkey's main 'misunderstanding' with Syria also centres on the PKK. Ankara
has stated it cannot accept 'state terrorism' and cross-border PKK
activities remain a sticky issue despite Syrian measures against PKK bases
in Beka'a, forcing the closure of camps, which were relocated to Zaleh.
The issue is complicated by disputes over the Southeastern Anatolian Project
(Gap) for irrigation and dam development. Syria has been known to increase
support for the PKK if it thinks Turkey is being inflexible over the water
issue whilst Turkish officials maintain that water rights are not to be
negotiated as a trade-off against the PKK.
Under a 1987 protocol, Turkey agreed a supply of 500 cubic metres per second
until the completion of the Ataturk dam. The reservoir has been filled but
without agreement on 'allocation'.
Ironically, Syria is negotiating the purchase of electricity generated from
the dam it vociferously condemned. This deal may precede the long-vaunted
idea of a Middle-Eastern power grid in concert with Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq.
Syria's territorial claims over the Turkish province of Hatay in southern
Turkey are largely in abeyance, for now. Large maps of 'Greater Syria' which
jostle for wall space with portraits of Hafez Al Assad's in Syrian
government offices, have more of a sentimental than cartographical value.
The relative thaw in Turkey's ties with its Arab neighbours is somewhat of a
diplomatic coup but it is muted by Ankara's awareness that the Baathist
regimes in both Syria and Iraq have long exhibited antipathy towards Turkey
and that Iran is distrustful of Turkey's secular, western approach.
Historically, relations between Turkey and its Arab neighbours have been
clouded by the conflict between the ideas represented by Arab nationalism
and those of the Ottoman empire. Turks felt betrayed by the Arabs after WW1
while Arabs have long considered Turkey a less-than-benign colonial power
which strangled its Arab provinces during the Ottoman empire.
Turkey's policy objectives in Central Asia have been limited by its desire
not be seen as a 'counter balance' to Iran. Turkey and Iran are of a similar
size and population and both have an ethnic mosaic of Azeri Turks,
Turkomans, Arabs. Whilst Iran's Shi'a structures have unified minorities who
suffered repression under the Shah, Turkey's secularism and comparative
tolerance are an anathema to Tehran.
There is speculation that Iran and Saudi Arabia may be funding mosques and
educational foundations which could assist the rise of Turkey's Islamic
movement. The Alevi minority, a Turkish version of Shi'ism, remains a
simmering issue with Iran and there are intermittent clashes between the
orthodox Sunni Muslims and the Alevis, about 15-20 per cent of Turks, mostly
in the centre and east of the country.
The official emphasis is on economic ties. Turkey and Iran have also been
discussing the extension of a pipeline to carry natural gas from
Turkmenistan to Europe and the proposed construction of another pipeline to
carry Iranian natural gas to Europe through Turkey. Also, Turkey has shown
interest in buying Iranian crude in return for Turkish goods and services.
Of late, there has been a flurry of activity between Turkish and Israeli
officials, accompanied by warm, even gushing, tributes. Turkey, which has
long taken an even-handed approach to both Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, has upgraded its relations with both following
progress in the Middle East peace process and has committed Dollars 52m in
exports credits and cash for the West Bank if a peace accord is reached.
Turkey was one of the first countries to recognise the state of Israel, and
has maintained ties since 1949, balancing this with support for the
committee of Palestinian rights and recognition of the state of Palestine
declared by the PLO in 1988.
Ankara has been involved in five multilateral working groups on the peace
process, although it was largely a spectator in the initial proceedings.
Turkey's ambition to construct a peace pipeline carrying water to Jordan,
the West Bank and Lebanon remains on hold owing to questions of cost
effectiveness - desalination of sea water is presently a cheaper option.
A pilot project is also under way to ship drinking water from the Manavgat
river near Antalya on the Mediterranean coast by sea to Israel, using large
plastic 'bags'.
Relations with Israel gained momentum with the visit of Israeli president
Ezer Weizman in January. A host of agreements from double-taxation to trade
were initialled including a three-way tourism pact between Turkey, Israel
and Egypt.
Co-operation with Israel on terrorism, however, was not rapturously
received. When Mr Cetin visited Jerusalem last year, Israeli officials
avoided a commitment to provide intelligence or take joint action against
Kurdish rebel bases.
During his visit, Mr Weizman said: 'Turkey talks to everybody.' However,
Turkey is anxious not to be viewed just as a 'talking shop' or a neutral
venue. It wants to ease the strains of 'living in a tough neighbourhood'.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (8): 'Stifling' barriers may fall to winds
of competition - Textile Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's textile industry is ready and waiting, if not champing at the bit,
for customs union with the European Union. Extensive preparations for the
1995 deadline have been made and a timetable for the reduction of import
duties is nearing its target of zero.
The industry has long awaited the removal of the 'stifling' tariff and
non-tariff barriers to trade, in particular the quota restrictions which
Ankara has considered both arbitrary and a violation of the 1964 Turkey-EC
association agreement and the 1973 additional protocol.
Buyers and shippers of textiles and apparel have also caught the industry's
infectious enthusiasm for customs union. 'No more quotas, no more form
filling, no more phoning up to be told I can't have a re-order because quota
limits have been reached,' said a ready-to-wear buyer for high street stores
in Britain.
However, as the appointed 'zero' hour has neared, the road to free trade has
developed ruts, potholes and other obstacles to jolt its travellers.
Turkey's application for EU membership continues to gather dust on the
shelves in Brussels as Nordic and east European applicants nudge Turkey
further down the queue. For many Turkish industries, the prospect of customs
union without the benefits of full EU membership and economic integration
has increasingly been perceived as half-way to nowhere.
The country's textile industry is also wary that the EU may retain some
quotas on Turkish imports or use restrictions on the textile sector as a
lever to prise open Turkey's other more reticent sectors.
The vehicle industry and durable goods manufacturers have been lobbying for
more time to prepare for the full effects of competition which will squeeze
their market share. The recent deterioration of the economy has fuelled the
case for some form of delay or prolonged phase-in period and there has been
mounting speculation of slippage in the customs union timetable.
Brussels has not committed itself to the elimination of quotas, an issue
which will ultimately be decided by EU member states. Turkish producers are
worried that Portugal and Spain may seek to retain some restrictions to
protect their domestic industries.
The quota issue is crucial to the textile and apparel industries which are
Turkey's largest foreign exchange earners, with combined exports of Dollars
5.4bn in 1992. The share of total export earnings has risen steadily from 30
per cent in 1989 to over 37 per cent in 1992. The EU buys 72 per cent of
Turkey's textile and apparel exports and 26 per cent of the country's total
export earnings originate from textile and apparel exports to the EU.
The industry is growing concerned that something less than full union will
be enacted. Import competition combined with any vestiges of export
limitations could devastate an industry which has been struggling to
overcome a host of problems and a prolonged period of upheaval.
Turkey's recent rapid growth and high rates of investment have coincided
with recession in its main export markets. Spiralling inflation, high
domestic energy costs and rising raw material prices have reduced Turkey's
competitive edge in the textiles sector and its rising export figures have
been hard-won. The difficulties have been exacerbated by increased market
penetration from Asian producers.
Over the past three years, textile exports have been falling both in volume
terms and more steeply in dollar terms. This has been offset by the rapid
rise in apparel exports which have climbed from Dollars 2.4bn in 1989 to
Dollars 4bn in 1992.
'In recent months, the issue of EU quotas has been less of a headache than
the domestic economy,' says Mr Mustafa Boyacioglu of the Istanbul Apparel
Exporters Association (IKTIB) which represents its 10,000 members producing
over 80 per cent of exports in the sector.
Currency instability, the lack of a coherent economic programme and rising
costs have deterred investment for several months. Last August's export
incentives to increase export financing, improve export credit terms,
rebates on utility costs and extra cargo flights to avoid the disruption of
the overland route via former Yugoslavia have been almost negated by the
deteriorating economic situation.
Inflation, which last month reached an annualised rate of 73 per cent, is
expected to cloud the textile sector's wage negotiating round, which begins
in September. The threat of strikes loomed large during the last semi-annual
round when average monthly wages were Dollars 246. The textiles groups are
better organised than the apparel sector which is mainly comprised of small
to medium-sized businesses with a high turnover of employees. The
forthcoming round is expected to be bruising and some employers suggest that
heavy wage demands would be the nail in the coffin for competitiveness,
possibly leading to many closures.
Cotton prices also remain a stumbling block. Although there are efforts to
build a market, futures and hedging have not been developed and domestic
cotton harvests have dropped by 75 per cent, from 1.1m bales in 1983 to
276,000 bales for 1993-94. The area planted to cotton has fallen from
300,000 hectares in 1982 to 75,000 hectares in 1993.
Reduced government support for prices has caused a shift in cotton
production from the largest cotton-producing area of Adana towards the east
where wage costs are lower. The cotton yarn industry is also migrating
eastwards, with some ventures spilling into the central Asian republics for
cotton milling and processing which rely heavily on cheap labour to survive.
The domestic retail market for Turkish cloth and fabrics has declined with
the shift towards value-added products such as ready-made garments.
Foreign clothing producers have been eyeing Turkey's youthful and
increasingly fashion-conscious market but have been kept at bay by import
duties of around 40 per cent. EU garment sales to Turkey in 1992 amounted to
only Dollars 36m but would rise rapidly after customs union when import
duties would be zero.
Several EU clothing groups, notably Italian producers, have sought to gain a
foothold through licensing agreements to market their products in Turkey and
in the Turkish speaking areas of the CIS. Pancaldi of Italy last year signed
a five-year agreement worth over L18bn.
The Turkish apparel sector is confident that it will be able to withstand
the impact of full competition by doubling its exports within five years of
the EU lifting quota restrictions. It is, however, acutely aware that its
present advantages such as a mature and broad product range, a skilled
workforce and quick response and re-order times need to be backed up by
further investment and modernisation. Without the latter, Turkey's leading
industry will be unable to face either the challenges or the opportunities
of the full customs union it has been waiting for.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (9): A world leader in its field -
Manufacturing profile / VA Eisenbahnsysteme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention Austria to railway technology buffs and they will think first about
Plasser &amp; Theurer, the formidable family firm that makes a machine that
simultaneously pulls up old track and lays down new.
But Austria has another company that dominates a niche in the international
railway technology business. VA Eisenbahnsysteme, formerly part of the
state-owned Voest-Alpine steel and engineering group, is a world leader in
the manufacture of points (switches) for high-speed and heavy-duty rail
lines.
It also makes other sophisticated rail-related equipment, such as trackside
devices for detecting overheated rolling stock axles (hot boxes).
Until 1989, VAE was just a division within Voest-Alpine, sharing facilities
and management with the group's tunneling equipment division at Zeltweg in
the middle of Styria. The first switches were made there in 1866.
Its reputation for quality was such that it had very large market shares,
especially with European railways.
So when VA bosses began looking internally for candidates for privatisation,
the points business rapidly emerged at the head of the list.
A proper corporate structure was set up and the company launched itself more
systematically into overseas markets. VAE was convinced that demand for
railway infrastructure was on the verge of huge growth in many countries.
At an early stage, the decision was made to carry out expansion through
subsidiaries and joint ventures rather than export, not least because of the
bulkiness of the products. VAE has moved rapidly, thanks in part to nearly
Sch500m in new equity provided by a partial privatisation in December 1992
and a rights issue last November. It now has outlets in the US, Canada,
Australia and Hungary.
The group's product line is vast, covering every conceivable type of point
for tram lines, cog railways, cable railways, standard railways and even
some that serve rail lines of more than one gauge.
Its success is built on sophisticated welding techniques and cast steel
crossings that make its points more durable than those of its competitors,
and on its know-how for designing the extremely gently curved points that
trains can negotiate at up to 200kph.
In 1992, after a one-year inspection, it was awarded the ISO 9001 norm by
Lloyds of London for its quality assurance system.
The group also makes electronic point diagnosis systems which provide
constant surveillance and set off alarms when trouble is detected.
Group sales and profits have grown rapidly in the past three years. Last
year, consolidated net income jumped 18 per cent to Sch81.3m on sales up 21
per cent to Sch1.7bn, and the directors are forecasting further growth this
year.
After a difficult start at Sch915 in a weak market in December, 1992, the
shares have been among the best performers in the Austrian market. They rose
to a peak of Sch1,585 at the end of last year and the trend continued in the
first quarter of this year.
The state holding company OIAG is expected to sell its remaining 26 per cent
stake in the group in the autumn.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (8): Tough adjustments ahead - The
agriculture sector is uncompetitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A collective sigh of relief greeted the news that Austria's negotiators in
Brussels had finally reached agreement on European Union membership terms
covering agriculture.
A 'good' deal was seen in Vienna as crucially important if the government
was to win support for a June referendum on joining the EU. In the event,
most politicians saw last month's outcome to the negotiations as positive
for Austria, and more importantly it was perceived that way by much of the
public.
Even so, the government will be hard put to calm local fears about the
impact of joining the EU. Austria's uncompetitive agriculture faces some
tough adjustments.
The EU deal allows Austria to continue to subsidise its farmers for a period
with generous financial help from Brussels, but it also requires Austria to
open its market to competition with prices aligned on EU prices from day one
of membership. There will be no soft transition period.
Austria will be able to limit imports of cereals, poultry, pork and milk
over a four-year period. It was granted an annual milk production quota of
2.5m tonnes - less than the 2.9m tonnes it had originally sought but seen as
an acceptable compromise in Vienna. A sugar quota of a little over 390,000
tonnes roughly meets real annual sugar production rather than the
theoretical 450,000-500,000 tonnes claimed in the negotiations.
Mr Franz Fischler, agriculture minister, says the immediate cost of reducing
prices to EU levels will be about Sch4bn. The EU is expected to provide
about Sch2.8bn in environment-designated financial help in addition to
standard support from its regional and social funds.
It is also hoped farmers will benefit from free access to EU markets, but
the benefits may be delayed until Austria develops both better marketing and
distribution networks.
Meanwhile, Mr Fischler is confident that Austrian agriculture can succeed
with new products and markets. 'Austria can develop niche markets for
environmentally sound produce. Biological farming production in Austria
already is the biggest in Europe,' he says.
Adjustment will be difficult but, he says, Austrian agriculture was already
facing difficult changes under the new General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. Even if Austria did not become a member of the EU, its agriculture
would face serious problems. 'Access to traditional markets in the EU would
be limited and burdened with duties. Reduction of subsidised export
quantities by 21 per cent and export subsidies by 36 per cent as stipulated
in the Gatt agreements would worsen Austria's position,' said a recent
agriculture ministry report.
Austrian agriculture is hampered by difficult local conditions, low
productivity, narrow markets and poor distribution networks. Migration from
the land at an annual rate of about 5 per cent also threatens long-term
prospects. With a farmer's average income less than half that of an
industrial worker, considerable incentives will be needed to keep people on
the land.
There are about 270,000 farms in Austria, most of which are family owned.
About half are smaller than 10 hectares and 45,000 are smaller than three
hectares. One in three farmers works full time on their farm, and two thirds
rely on a second job to supplement their income. Altogether farming employs
about 5.5 per cent of the population, although it contributes only 2.4 per
cent of gross domestic product.
Local climatic and land conditions make farming more difficult than in other
European countries. More than 64 per cent of agricultural land is in
mountain areas, and more than 60 per cent of farmers are Alpine farmers - a
higher proportion than in any other EU country. Mountain land is difficult
to tend, the use of machinery is limited and much of the work has to be done
manually.
Because it is economically and socially important for Austria to keep people
on the land - a large number of farmers help to sustain the economically
vital tourist industry - farming is encouraged with a wide range of
subsidies, and by any estimate, support will be needed for years to come.
Modernisation and productivity improvements are likely to be slow.
Further down the food chain, the domestic food processing industry faces
similar problems. Mr Werner Teufelsbauer, director of economic policy at the
Austrian Economic Chamber, says both sectors will experience a shock as
markets are opened up and protection ends.
He says Austria's exclusion from the EU for 20 years has not prepared it for
the challenge and opportunities of a much wider market. It will take time
and money to establish new market systems. Meanwhile, 'quite a lot of
companies could go bankrupt or be bought up by French or German ones,' he
says.
The food processing industries employ about 40,000 people, but make mainly
basic products on an uncompetitive scale, he argues.
An example of things to come is provided by the rapid inroads of German
producers of dairy products who have picked up 15 per cent of Austria's
market in milk and yoghurts in the three months since the European Economic
Area came into effect last January. Other sectors will face similar
challenges.
Mr Alois Mock, the foreign minister who headed Austria's negotiating team in
Brussels, is more optimistic. He says conditions for farmers, and especially
mountain farmers, will improve during the transition as a result of the
agreement. But no-one doubts there will be pain as well as benefits. 'There
will be tougher competition and we will see restructuring at the local
level,' he says.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (7): Hotel owners feel the pinch - Patrick
Blum reports on the tourist industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One in every 20 foreign trips taken anywhere in the world leads to Austria,
according to official tourism statistics. But while this testifies to the
strength of Austria's tourism industry, the past two years have not been
good years for hotel owners and tour operators.
The recession in Germany, devaluations in Britain and Italy, and a decline
in the number of travellers from the US, combined to depress foreign
currency revenues to Sch156.2bn last year, down from the record Sch161.2bn
in 1991.
Arrivals and overnight stays were down in every province except Styria, in
spite of considerable investment and marketing efforts. Officials hope that
with Europe now gradually pulling out of recession, this year will bring
better results, thereby helping improve declining profit margins.
Any improvement would also help accelerate recovery for the national
economy, which in turn would encourage more Austrians to spend time away
from home and boost domestic tourism.
A few statistics give an indication of the industry's economic and social
importance.
Revenues from tourism account for about 8 per cent of gross domestic
product, rising to 15 per cent of GDP if the leisure industries are
included.
About 164,000 workers are employed directly in restaurants and hotels;
another 100,000 are self-employed and, if workers in related activities
including in boutiques, travel agencies, and leisure facilities, are
included, the number of people employed directly and indirectly in the
industry swells to about 400,000 - representing about 13 per cent of the
total workforce. The net Sch61bn foreign revenue income from tourism - after
deduction from what Austrians spend abroad - covers almost 62 per cent of
the country's deficit in traded goods.
Official policy is to encourage moves up-market by offering better
accommodation and service, and catering for special interests or 'hobby
tourism'.
This includes special programmes for tennis, water sports or golf and for
those interested in fishing, riding, or who want to improve their health and
looks.
There is an 'Allegro Austria' programme dedicated to music lovers, and there
are special programmes for families with small children. 'These programmes
have been very successful,' says Mr Michael Raffling, head of the hotels and
restaurants section in the Austrian Economic Chamber.
To take advantage of Austria's plans to join the European Union next year,
the government recently announced that it would invest Sch3m-Sch4m in a
special campaign throughout Europe on the theme of 'Come and see the new
member'.
Meanwhile, the number of high standard hotels of five and four stars has
risen steadily since the early 1980s from just over 100,000 in 1981 to
163,664 last year.
The number of two stars and single-star hotels has declined by about 100,000
to 278,916 in the same period. The number of middle range, three-star hotels
has risen by about 50,000 to 240,146.
Most tourists come from western Europe with visitors from Germany accounting
for 67 per cent of overnight stays, followed by visitors from the
Netherlands with about 8.7 per cent; Britain with 3.8 per cent; Switzerland,
the Benelux countries, and Italy whose share of overnight stays is down by
more than 22 per cent.
There has been a steady flow of visitors from the former communist states of
central and eastern Europe, raising the occupancy rates for cheaper
accommodation.
Spending by east Europeans has grown since the early days immediately
following the collapse of communism when many visitors came on one-day coach
trips to look at the city and spend practically nothing.
The opening up of eastern Europe has brought some competition for Vienna
from Prague and Budapest, but generally it has had positive effects, as more
people have wanted to travel in the region. Many visitors want to combine a
trip to the three cities. Agents are increasingly offering 'magic triangle'
programmes, especially to visitors from the US.
Outside the main cities, competition from the former Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and other east European countries is limited by the range and quality of
what they can offer, and while Austria is more expensive, it offers better
service and infrastructure and a wider choice of activities in a cleaner
environment.
Decades of investment and training were needed to make Austria's tourism
industry one of the world's most successful, but it still faces a number of
problems.
Efforts to stagger domestic holidays have had little success so there is
still overcrowding at popular spots, particularly in the winter.
The costs of environmental protection for a wide range of activities - from
waste disposal to ski runs - are rising rapidly. Community services and
labour costs are also rising fast.
'The introduction of the five-day week in 1992 has noticeably increased
costs,' Mr Raffling says.
Environmental concerns can also make promotion more difficult. One idea was
to have summer festivals in all the provinces, but it has met strong
opposition from environment groups.
However, Mr Raffling says there is also a positive side which can be
developed to Austria's advantage. 'On one hand it creates a lot of problems,
but guests are also becoming more and more environment conscious, and we are
well placed to meet that demand.'

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (5): Education - must try harder /
Industry's needs are not being met
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE COUNSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Academics and educationists award Turkey's state education system good marks
for effort, but lower grades for an inconsistent approach, lack of qualified
teaching staff and patchy provision of facilities.
Mirroring the political swings and roundabouts, there have been 63 ministers
of education in 70 years, each making a mark by overhauling, reversing,
amending or merely tweaking the system.
Nevertheless, there have been strides in improving the literacy rate from
only 10 per cent 50 years ago to 80.7 per cent in 1990. There are, however,
marked differences between the literacy rates of men and women, the young
and the elderly as well as in urban and rural areas.
The development of educational facilities has been constrained by population
growth, migration and urbanisation. Widespread birth control slowed the
birth rate from 2.49 per cent in the late 1980s to 2.0 per cent in 1990,
which is still high in European terms. Thirty-five per cent of the
population is under 15 years of age. The age distribution pattern has led to
high unemployment rates among young people with nearly 65 per cent of the
jobless aged between 22 and 29 years old.
Family size is declining in higher income families, but rural families are
still large. The south-east has the highest population growth in the
country, which is politically significant as most people in these areas are
Kurdish.
School building programmes have sometimes lagged behind the rapid
urbanisation, leading to double shifts at some urban schools while those in
the villages have been emptied of pupils. In the cities population is
growing by 4.5 to 6 per cent a year, amounting in 1990 to 61.3 per cent of
the country's total.
Spending on education devoured 19.2 per cent of the budget in 1990, second
only to general public services at 25.2 per cent, and more than defence at
11.7 per cent. The cost of compulsory education between the ages of six and
14 is borne by the state, but parents are expected to contribute towards the
cost of books or additional facilities - so that the poorer areas, which are
in the most need, fall further behind.
Turkey's educational system of primary, middle, general and vocational high
schools and universities, has a declining enrolment rate from one stage to
the next. Efforts are being made to provide easy transfer between
vocational, technical and general secondary programmes and to tailor
education to developments in industry. 'We have a big hole in the middle,'
says Professor Mehmet Saglam, president of Yok, the Higher Education
Council. 'There are more than enough good engineers, but far too few able
technicians.'
The ministry of national education concedes that 'it has not been possible
to reach the planned targets to train the needed manpower'. Repeated calls
for more technical and vocational schools at the secondary level have been
heeded by Mr Nevzat Ayaz, the minister of education, who has been promoting
the recognition of 'skills' through apprenticeships, industrial placements
and adult education.
The chasm between education and the needs of commerce and industry has
become acute in many sectors. Last year, the Turkish Maritime Educational
Foundation (TDEV) campaigned to raise Dollars 8m to improve officer
training. Citing a disparity between growth in the merchant fleet and
education, the foundation said the training bottleneck hampered efforts to
increase tonnage and Turkey's share in the shipping market.
The TDEV succeeded in securing private and government funds for classrooms
and facilities while the Merchant Marine Academy, run by the Istanbul
Technical University, replaced its four-year course with a 2 1/2 -year
sandwich course, leading to an expected 200 deck and engine-room officers
graduating from the college every year, double the present number.
In higher education, there is stiff competition for university places. Out
of 1m applicants, only a third secured a place last year, despite annual
intake increases and the creation of new universities. From only 19
universities in 1982, there has been a threefold increase to 57, of which
four are private, while student capacity has risen from 49,000 to 173,000.
As a result, there is a lack of qualified lecturers and academic staff and
the student to lecturer ratio has grown rapidly.
In stark contrast to the austere, Dickensian state universities, the
recently established private universities are bright and dynamic. Bilkent
University, modelled on private research universities in the US, is
epitomised by its energetic rector, Mr Ali Dogramaci. Its rapidly expanding
campus, where all the teaching is in English, is funded through a foundation
comprising an array of companies from printing plants to furniture
producers, which also act as suppliers to the campus.
Yok was established in 1982 as a co-ordinating and policy making body to
develop Turkey's higher education system. Under its umbrella, the
Inter-University Committee is responsible for improving standards and
supervising research, higher degrees and other academic matters. Members of
the council and the committee are predominantly drawn from academia, with
one third of the 21 seats appointed by the government.
There remains a deep-seated suspicion over the role of Yok among those who
believe it is a hangover from the military coup of 1980 when right and
leftwing activism was rampant at the universities. But this is countered by
Prof Saglam who stresses the education council's academic credentials and
its metamorphosis since its formation.
The universities are conscientiously apolitical; neither faculty members nor
students are permitted to be active members of political parties. As Seyfi,
a student at the technical university in Istanbul says: 'We are here to be
technical, not political.'
The universities, however, cannot isolate themselves from the current debate
over Kemalist doctrines, democracy and the secular nature of the republic.
Although out of the headlines, the issue of whether women should wear
headscarves on campus remains. Turkey's secular constitution tolerates the
expression of religious beliefs but draws the line at open identification
with the principles of an Islamic state. The universities are at odds over
when a woman's insistence on covering her head becomes a political
statement.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (6): Prestige goes on the line - John
Murray Brown on the army's role in political life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Necip Torumtay resigned at the height of the Gulf War as head of the
Turkish armed forces in 1990, he issued a statement alluding obliquely to a
'matter of principle'. It was never clear what exactly the principle was.
The Turkish press, nonetheless, applauded the general's action.
A comparable incident, of a military chief walking out over a disagreement
with an elected government, would be hard to find in most western
democracies, except perhaps in France in the 1960s during the army's
challenge to President de Gaulle over his Algerian policy.
But Turkey is, of course, a little different. And its army has always
enjoyed a special place as the self-appointed guardian of the country's
democracy and its secular traditions. However, even here in a society which
retains a deep affection for its soldiers, there are signs that things are
changing.
The process of transformation goes deeper than a simple internal debate
about military strategy to cope with the post-cold war realities. It has an
impact on doctrine, on the composition of the army and its equipment, and
the role of the army in Turkish society.
For the complex strands that make up modern Turkey, whether the growing
Islamic consciousness, or the tension between modernism and tradition,
almost certainly have their mirror image in the messrooms of Turkey's armed
forces.
Turkey has the second largest army in Nato, after the US. In all, the
Turkish armed forces comprise 560,000 troops and the army can call on a
further 1m reservists. The budget, agreed by parliament, was around Dollars
5.4bn in 1994, equivalent to 10.5 per cent of the national budget.
There are a number of other sources, including money from the Defence
Industry Support Fund and the Foreign Military Sales from the US. In
addition, the Armed Forces Pension Fund (Oyak) has assets in a car assembler
(together with Renault of France), in several cement companies and, most
recently, a majority stake in an Istanbul trade finance bank.
The restructuring of the armed forces' inventory has two elements - to
upgrade the technology and to streamline sources of supplies. In line with
this, the F-16 fighter aircraft assembler plant at Murted outside Ankara is
being beefed up. The programme is winning support under the Dollars 4bn Gulf
Defence Fund, set up under US sponsorship in the wake of Kuwait's liberation
to utilise Saudi and other Arab finance to strengthen Turkey's defence
industry.
The need to beef up the fire power of Turkey's armed forces and enhance its
mobility has been the subject of countless Nato studies. However the TV
pictures of US smart technology deployed against Iraq shocked the military
top brass, and highlighted the limitations of Turkey's armed forces and
their reliance on out-of-date western hand-me-downs.
The technological debate about hardware has given new impetus to those
calling for the abandonment of conscription in place of a more professional
corps. In Turkey military service has traditionally been a form of remedial
education for many of those from poorer homes. It has also inculcated a
sense of patriotism, and imbued generations of young Turks with the tenets
of the social and political reforms instituted by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the
founder of the republic. As Mehmet Ali Birand in his book, 'Shirts of
Steel', makes clear, a stint of military service also does wonders for the
calorie count of the average Turkish farmboy.
There is, on one level, the tension between the goals of a conscript army
and those of a professional corps. There is also the inevitable tension
between 'laicism' and Islam. In this context, the army has refused to allow
children from the Imam schools into military academies and continues to
operate a fairly rigorous system of vetting to prevent the armed forces from
being infected by Islamic extremism.
More dramatically, there are telling signs that the army's appeal and its
prestige may be waning. A few years ago, the idea that Turks would actively
seek to get out of military service was unthinkable. Today draft dodging,
US-style, is an increasingly common phenomenon, as people try to avoid being
sent to the conflict in the south-east. Newspapers have taken a certain glee
in exposing the fact that the current chief of staff's son is shirking
military service. The army is not happy about it, of course. When Mehmet Ali
Birand used the topic as a subject for his current affairs programme, 32nd
Day, he was hauled before a military tribunal and two of his journalists
were charged.
The make-up of the regular Turkish army - the graduates from the military
academies rather than the conscripts - is changing, too. The intake are no
longer the products of the ruling elite as in Ottoman times. The social
composition reflects the changes in society at large. Indeed, western
defence experts believe the current class are more often the sons of
non-commissioned officers rather than of generals and colonels. For many
Turks, particularly from poorer backgrounds, an army career provides upward
mobility and an escape from the backwardness of rural life.
On the other hand, today's officers seem more ideologically hidebound to
Kemalist ideas. Birand's book on the Turkish army points out that the
Kemalist curricula actually increased sharply in response to the 1980 coup
d'etat.
Often, this has manifested itself as condescension towards the elected
politicians, who are perceived as unreliable, inconsistent and too eager for
popularity.
There is also a feeling that national defence policy is too important to be
left to the civilian politicians. Despite returning the country to democracy
in 1983, the military is still at the centre of Turkish political life. The
constitution gives the army extensive powers. The army chief is subservient
only to the president. The defence minister has little sway. General Dogan
Gures, Turkey's chief of staff, must be the nation's most photographed
personality, usually captured standing alongside Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime
minister.
At the centre of the problem is the tension between an army which is
militarily effective and one which is politically reliable. The history of
the three military interventions between 1960 and 1980 gives the debate
added poignancy.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (5): Global expansion - Manufacturing
profile / Lenzig
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<TEXT>
It is always a surprise to find 'the largest' of anything in a small country
such as Austria.
Lenzing, the viscose, plastics and papers group based in the eponymous
Austrian town near Salzburg, for example, is the world's largest producer of
viscose, the wood pulp-based fibre that is the raw material for rayon and
other woven and non-woven products.
Viscose has not been a growth sector for some time. On the contrary, the
world market has long hovered around 2m tonnes a year, and prices are
frequently under pressure as a result of competition with other fibres and
low-cost producers in developing countries.
But Lenzing, in which two Austrian banks have large minority shareholdings,
has followed a deliberate policy of increasing its concentration on viscose
 -which now accounts for three quarters of its Sch8bn annual revenue.
In the past two decades, the number of viscose producers in Europe has
dropped from 25 to seven, but Lenzing believes the remaining three majors,
including Courtaulds of the UK and Hoechst of Germany, can thrive on the
basis of high quality products and service.
So it has consistently built up its capacity, and last year surpassed Birla
of India to become the world's largest producer, with annual capacity of
268,000 tonnes in plants in Austria, the US and Indonesia.
The group has combined this expansion with a big commitment to research and
development of new products, and is on the verge of large scale production
of a new cellulose-based fibre called Lyocell.
In the early 1980s, the group was looking for ways to make better fibres
from dissolving pulp. Viscose has a relatively poor image and an unpleasant
smell and the production process requires a number of nasty chemicals,
including carbon disulphide and caustic soda. Lenzing has had to spend
Sch2.1bn since 1988 to make its mills environmentally friendly.
The answer, it hopes, is Lyocell, a fibre developed in the early 1980s by
Akzo, the German chemicals group, that uses N-Methyl-Morpholine-Oxide (NMMO)
as a solvent.
For one thing, the production process is an energy-efficient closed loop,
with both the NMMO and water being recycled. Lyocell fibres also have
greater wet tenacity than viscose and better form stability.
Lenzing is one of only two companies - the other is Courtaulds - that have
licences to use the basic Lyocell technology. Courtaulds has developed a
fibre called Tencell, which has soft, peach fuzz characteristics.
Lenzing has been moving in a different direction, trying to perfect a fibre
that will enable it to compete effectively against cotton and silk in
high-quality, high-volume clothing lines, such as shirts, blouses and
dresses.
In 1990, it started up a pilot plant in Lenzing to produce what it calls
Lyocell by Lenzing.
By last year, the product was so good that the group could sell the 200
tonnes annual capacity at roughly two times the price of viscose.
Within the next few weeks, the group hopes to win approval of its
supervisory board to invest more than Sch1bn in a full-scale 20m
tonnes-a-year plant. A rights issue to finance it would be necessary, as the
group's balance sheet has been weakened in the past few years by its heavy
investments in pollution control equipment.
Moreover, in 1992, weak fibre prices undermined margins and the group fell
into loss and a further loss occurred last year.
Undaunted, Lenzing continues to develop its viscose business. In August,
1992, it bought a 45,000 tonnes-a-year viscose plant in Tennessee from BASF
and has since boosted capacity to 60,000 tonnes. Expansion of its plant in
Indonesia was also completed in 1992 and a further Dollars 100m expansion is
under consideration.
Last autumn, it won a Sch350m contract to build a 20m tonne viscose plant in
China, with options to participate in the sector at a later stage.
And last month, it entered a 100,000 tonnes a year dissolving pulp joint
venture in Brazil with Klabin Fabricadora de Papel e Celulose and the
International Finance Corporation to secure raw material supplies for its
viscose plants throughout the world.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (4): A hectic year for the politicians -
Vienna fears delays in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year is proving to be even more eventful than expected for Austrian
politics. Provincial elections in March saw a surge in the protest vote and
support for the extreme right and the Greens at the expense of the
establishment parties.
Shortly afterwards, the European Union's unseemly debate on how to block
decisions within the EU threatened to undo months of careful campaigning to
win public support for Austria's EU membership bid. Both events will make
the government's life more difficult.
A referendum on EU membership is set to take place in June - the favoured
date is June 12 to coincide with Europe-wide elections to the European
parliament. If all goes well, Austria could become a member on January 1
next year. But Vienna fears that delays in Brussels or in the European
parliament could upset the timetable and reduce domestic support for
membership.
The row within the EU over blocking rights had a negative impact on local
opinion. 'It looks bad. People can't understand what it's about. They are
asking why should we join this mess,' says one official.
This is a far cry from feelings three weeks earlier when Mr Alois Mock, the
veteran foreign minister who headed Austria's negotiating team, was given a
hero's welcome on his return from Brussels following agreement over
membership terms.
Differences with the Commission over agriculture and transit traffic which
threatened to derail the talks were successfully overcome in a deal that
most politicians considered good, although it was immediately, and
predictably, denounced by the Greens as a sell-out.
The results of the negotiations strengthened support for membership with the
latest opinion polls showing more than 50 per cent in favour, and around 30
per cent against, with a diminishing number undecided. An extensive
government campaign in favour of membership has had a positive impact -
officials are optimistic about the referendum, provided 'the EU doesn't
break down or there isn't another mismanaged crisis as in Bosnia,' says
another observer.
'If nothing (contrary happens) over the next 2 1/2 months, the outcome will
be positive. It could even be a much as 55 per cent in favour,' says Mr
Erhard Busek, the conservative vice-chancellor. Ironically, the strength of
current support for EU membership has raised fears that people will not
bother to vote.
The government also has other worries. Elections to provincial parliaments
in Carinthia, Salzburg and Tyrol on March 13 turned out worse than expected
for the social democrats (SPO) who lost ground across the three provinces.
The conservative People's Party (OVP) fared relatively better, increasing
its vote in Carinthia but losing voters in Salzburg and Tyrol. The new
Liberal Forum failed to make a breakthrough or win any seats.
The victor was Mr Jorg Haider, the youthful-looking populist leader of the
right-wing Freedom Party (FPO). The Greens also did well, although they were
helped by local factors.
The FPO - which under Mr Haider's leadership has veered firmly to the far
right with emotional campaigns against immigration - won more than 33 per
cent of the vote in Carinthia and was a close second to the social democrats
whose share of the vote fell 8.5 per cent to 37.4 per cent.
Mr Haider wanted to win back the province's governorship which he was forced
to relinquish three years ago after he made a speech apparently endorsing
Nazi employment policies. But in spite of the FPO's strong showing, neither
the social democrats nor the People's Party appear willing to enter into a
coalition with Mr Haider.
The FPO also increased its share of the vote in Salzburg and Tyrol, and its
success will give a boost to Mr Haider and his party for next October's
general election.
The Greens were the other 'winners', increasing their share of the vote to
10.5 per cent in Tyrol and 7.2 per cent in Salzburg province. Ms Madeleine
Petrovic, the Green party leader, said the results provided 'the best
starting position for the general election', although support in Tyrol may
have been heavily influenced by a mixture of concerns over lorry transit
across the province, the local farmers' future once Austria joins the EU,
and fears over foreigners buying up property.
Whatever the reasons, the results did not bode well for the two government
coalition parties. Mr Franz Vranitzky, the social democrat chancellor,
admits that his party may have taken its electorate too much for granted -
'March 13 was a warning for the October elections.'
The SPO's supporters did not vote, and he says the party will have to work
hard to reverse that trend.
Both parties expect to lose some support at the general election, but Mr
Busek is confident about the outcome: 'It will be very similar. The
government parties will lose a bit, with the social democrats losing more,
but there is no alternative to a (grand) coalition,' he says.
An alliance with Mr Haider's freedom party is politically impossible -
'Haider has put his party out of political business. The FPO can't be in any
coalition,' says Mr Busek. The Liberals also look weak and, in what is still
a strongly Roman Catholic country, may have been damaged by a debate in
which they pressed for a full separation of church and state.
Mr Busek says that, for all its drawbacks, the current coalition offers
stability at a time when Austria faces important changes, and this may be a
winning argument.
The debate over EU membership has caused divisions within the Greens and
FPO, with Mr Haider's business backers worried about the potential
consequences of economic isolationism. The FPO leader said he would not tell
supporters how to vote in the referendum, though a large majority of party
members rejected EU membership in an internal party poll this month. About a
quarter of the Greens also favour membership, and opposition to joining the
EU has been politically weak and primitive, with wild claims about
bureaucracy, corruption and the loss of thousands of jobs as result of
membership.
Mr Busek and, it seems, a large proportion of the public, are unimpressed -
'what counts is not what the parties say, but how people feel, and that's a
good thing in a democracy.'

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (6): Focus on EU entry terms - The
agreement to join will open a new era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of Austria's diplomatic energies in the past year have been directed at
negotiating the terms of entry into the European Union. There was no
doubting the immense satisfaction in government and business circles at the
settlement reached early last month.
However, the country has also remained active on other fronts, particularly
concerning what it calls its neighbourhood, the countries of central and
eastern Europe. It has also participated in the multilateral Middle East
peace negotiations. And it has once again suffered an embarrassment with its
state president.
The agreement to join the EU, provided it is ratified by a national
referendum in June, will open a new era in Austrian political and economic
affairs.
Mr Alois Mock, foreign minister, said after the conclusion of the
negotiations that entry would enable Austria to regain its place at the
heart of Europe after 40 years of forced neutrality.
'Thanks to its historical relations to the countries of central and eastern
Europe, Austria will be able to make an important contribution to the
policies of the union in this region,' Mr Mock said. The country's economic
and social stability, its hard currency and highly-trained workforce should
also contribute to the integration process, he said.
As expected, the sticking points among the nearly 400 negotiating topics
were agriculture and trans-Alpine transit, but Austria won satisfaction on
both. A particularly aggressive sugar lobby won quotas beyond their
expectations. 'At times, we thought we were in a sugar negotiation, not an
accession treaty,' an Austrian diplomat says wryly.
On transit, serendipity appeared in the final tense stages of the
negotiations when on February 20 the Swiss voted to ban all transit lorries
from their Alpine passes from 2002. EU negotiators realised they had no
choice but to concede to Austria's demand that the existing bilateral treaty
forcing gradual reductions in lorry emission over the next decade.
The EU also magnanimously encouraged the European Investment Bank to help
finance a Sch80bn rail tunnel through the Brenner pass to take the pressure
off the motorway there. The upshot is that the immediate impacts on Austria
of joining the EU look relatively modest. Manufacturing industries have
already adjusted because of the activation of the European Economic Area
(EEA) at the beginning of this year.
Mrs Maria Schaumayer, president of the Austrian National Bank, has served
notice that the Austrian schilling will remain tightly tied to the D-Mark.
Mr Mock believes the biggest impact will be on farmers, whose lot will
improve because of specially targeted national aid.
He also looks forward to the breakdown of quasi monopolies in many consumer
product sectors as competition from EU producers increases. Already,
Bavarian milk producers are upsetting the Austrian retail milk market,
reportedly taking up to 15 per cent of the market.
Another area that will change is Mr Mock's own department from which some
800 bureaucrats are expected to be despatched to Brussels to work in the
European Commission.
Apart from its relations with the EU, Austria's main external preoccupation
at the moment is with the nearby countries of central and eastern Europe.
Austria has tried in many ways to support their economic and political
reconstruction because, as Mr Mock puts it simply, 'Their stability is our
stability.' He points out that Austria's trade with Slovenia is already
greater than its trade with Russia, and the government continues to try to
mobilise support in other western European countries for financing
infrastructure developments in these countries.
Austria has been particularly concerned about the former Yugoslavia and from
1990 to 1992 when it was in the UN Security Council, it made several
proposals, such as the setting up of security zones and the sending of
preventive peace forces, that were subsequently adopted.
However, sensitive to the complexity of neighbourly feelings, it has
refrained from sending its own peacekeeping troops to Bosnia. Instead, it
has sent troops to other trouble spots such as Rwanda, so that other UN
forces would be available to serve in Bosnia.
The Middle East is another area of Austrian interest, following the long and
sometimes controversial policy of the former chancellor Bruno Kreisky to
promote ties with Arab countries. Dr Kreisky was the first western leader to
invite Mr Yasser Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation leader, to
Europe, and the PLO's first representation in the West was opened in Vienna.
Last June, Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, signalled a return to a more
balanced policy, becoming the first Austrian chancellor to visit Israel. He
provided the long-demanded formal apology for Austria's involvement in the
Holocaust. 'We share moral responsibility because many Austrians welcomed
the Anschluss, supported the Nazi regime and helped it to function,' Mr
Vranitzky said in a speech to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
'We admit to all that has happened in our history and to the deeds of all
Austrians, be they good or bad. Just as we claim credit for our good deeds
we must beg forgiveness for the evil ones, the forgiveness of those who
survived and the forgiveness of the descendants of those who perished.'
Austria's relations with Israel and many other countries were made awkward
in the late 1980s because of the efforts by Mr Kurt Waldheim, its president,
to cover up his record as an officer in the German army during the second
world war.
Mr Waldheim finally stepped down in mid-1992, making way for Mr Thomas
Klestil, the polished former chief of the Austrian diplomatic service.
Mr Klestil has worked hard to restore external links, making visits to
several countries. But his value, too, came in doubt last winter when he
admitted publicly that his marriage was in trouble because he was having an
affair with an official in his office.
He dithered for some time over how to handle the situation and ended up
losing both his wife and his mistress.
