FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (2): Austerity deal poses test for Ciller -
The economy faces a tough year ahead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The bubble seems finally to have burst. After two months with the currency
all at sea, Turkey's conservative-led coalition has been forced to batten
down the hatches and administer a major stabilisation programme which, if
implemented in full, would be the most comprehensive restructuring since the
now infamous January 24 package of 1980.
With the lira still reeling despite overnight rates at one point as high as
1,000 per cent, the government abandoned its attempts to prop up the
currency and faced up to the inevitable.
The jury is probably still out on the merits of the austerity package
unveiled on April 5 by Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, but there is
little doubt that 1994 is going to be a tough year for a nation which has
long been accustomed to buoyant growth rates.
The political constraints will be considerable. Mrs Ciller's junior
coalition partners, the Social Democratic Populists, although endorsing the
package publicly, are known to be unhappy about certain of its clauses -
particularly as regards privatisation. The main opposition Motherland party,
ANP, may also initially prove truculent, although western diplomats point
out that Mr Mesut Yilmaz, the Anap leader, could win some credit for
supporting the programme if it succeeds, while distancing himself
sufficiently if it comes a cropper.
The package comprises two parts - stabilisation measures such as price
increases on government-controlled commodities, an investment freeze and
one-off tax charges on the rich, and the longer-term structural measures
such as privatisation and closures and reform of the state farm support
system. Mrs Ciller has for the first time introduced an explicit fiscal
target, which in the first three months envisages a TL38,000bn reduction in
the budget deficit through cost savings and increased revenues.
In parallel with the fiscal programme, the central bank is to introduce a
new monetary programme. These measures are underpinned by moves to
strengthen the bank, increasing its autonomy and reducing the extent to
which it has to fund the budget.
How Mrs Ciller meets the targets remains to be seen. In the short term the
only way to make large cuts in public expenditures - barring a wages freeze
on which the prime minister remains a little vague - is through cuts in
capital investment in projects. In addition, a substantial slice of
legislation, affecting individual state enterprises and the tax changes,
together with the changes in the central bank law, has still to be passed by
parliament.
Mrs Ciller remains adamant that the growth rate will not be imperilled by
the harsh stabilisation measures. 'The economy will not stop,' she said on
state television when unveiling the package. Most economists beg to differ.
The recession is already taking effect. Even before the announcement of the
large increases in petrol prices as part of the package, Turkey's car
production ground to a near-standstill. Consumer demand is set to dry up as
spending power is eroded by the rapid devaluation. This may take some heat
out of the inflation rate, which is expected to rise sharply over the next
three months as the impact of the price increases starts to be felt.
This will inevitably have a dramatic effect on living standards,
particularly for manual employees. The recession could be very painful for
cyclical industries such as cement and construction services, says Mr Emre
Yigit, head of research at Global Securities. The banking sector has been
devastated by the collapse of the lira, with many banks caught holding lira
assets in form of lending to Turkish companies while most of their
liabilities are in foreign currency.
The 'dollarisation' of the Turkish economy has been one of the more alarming
developments of recent years. Today half of the total deposit base is in
foreign currency. In a recent, much-reported case, a woman seeking a divorce
from her husband insisted in court that the settlement should be in dollars.
Civil servants rush to the banks and foreign exchange shops to unload their
lira.
Public desire for dollars reflects a deeper concern about economic
management and the condition of public finances. Mrs Ciller has still to
demonstrate that she can rectify the situation.
Pressure has been building for some time. In 1993, the economy was already
showing signs of overheating - in the second quarter the economy grew by 12
per cent. The growth was fuelled by the rise in imports financed by
increased foreign borrowing, much of it short-term by Turkish commercial
banks. The result was a record high trade account deficit reaching Dollars
14bn by the end of 1993.
The need to finance the current account is one explanation for the sudden
jump in Turkey's foreign indebtedness in 1993. Total debt reached Dollars
66bn by the end of the year after a spate of bond issues as the Treasury
sought to avoid borrowing from the domestic markets, where high interest
costs represented an increasing burden on the budget. The availability of
foreign credits also allowed the Treasury to restructure its domestic debt
by lengthening the maturities.
For the commercial banks, there was also a large increase in short-term
foreign funding. Given the differential between domestic interest rates and
inflation, Turkish banks have long been used to funding their loan book
through offshore borrowing.
The demand for dollars is also trade-driven, as Turkish exporters increased
market share. The situation was sustainable as long as there remained
confidence in the lira. However as soon as that collapsed, more and more
people wanted to hold their savings in dollars.
The banks were left in a vicious circle, having to find assets to match the
increase in dollar liabilities. With banks allowed only to lend limited
amounts to a list of registered trade companies, they were left with few
options but to lend the deposits as lira loans. The resultant erosion of
these assets merely forced banks to raise domestic bank rates to compensate.
With the currency continuing to suffer the jitters, it is clear that Mrs
Ciller must move swiftly to convince the markets. Turkey's foreign debt has
been downgraded by both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's twice since the start
of the year. The government's freedom to borrow will almost certainly be
more constrained.
The international bond market for less developed countries such as Turkey
has already become more difficult after what appears to have been the
turnaround in US rates. Turkey was forced to 'pull' a Dollars 750m global
bond in March. Plans to float bonds in the state telephone monopoly,
convertible into shares in the underlying company assets, will in all
probability suffer the same fate.
The global bond was meant to set a benchmark for the PTT issue, although
many bankers expressed scepticism about whether the deal could work given
the fact that the PTT's privatisation remains blocked by the courts.
Evidence of the mounting liquidity crisis was there for everyone to see
throughout 1993 with the government rescheduling payments to contractors,
and with the Treasury's public finance department living hand to mouth to
meet the next civil servants' salary payout or interest payments on the
country's foreign debt.
A telling sign of the impending difficulties came on March 21 when the
Public Participation Administration (PPA), the state agency in charge of
privatisation, came close to defaulting on some Dollars 400m worth of
revenue-sharing certificates, after the Treasury refused to extend the
amounts to the PPA. As a result, the agency had to go to interbank markets
for Dollars 200m.
The certificates are two-year bonds issued by the PPA in lieu of payments to
road contractors. The bonds were denominated in lira but indexed to foreign
exchange. It remains a moot point whether the bonds are considered a foreign
or a domestic liability, but the momentary panic among the banks holding the
paper was an early warning of the problems to come.
Against this background, the local elections were like a self-imposed
deadline with the government wary of introducing radical measures before the
polls, while making it clear to its foreign audience that it intended to
move swiftly once the result was in.
The government's credibility is clearly on the line. It is now left to the
prime minister and her new Treasury undersecretary, Mr Osman Birsen, to
prove that this time they mean business.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (4): The region's reluctant activist -
Foreign Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<TEXT>
Few areas of the world have seen such dramatic change. From the collapse of
communism, to the emergence of the new Black Sea states, and now to the
historic endgame being played out in the Middle East, there appears to have
been in almost permanent state of flux in the region round Turkey.
It is not hard to find Turks today who long to recreate the cold war when
the country was a stalwart flank of western defences. Turkey's position at
the crossroads of Europe and Asia means it still commands a key importance.
However for Turkey, such strategic certainties are a thing of the past. The
Moslem world's only Nato member is today groping for a new identity, to
build onto and complement the traditional twin pillars of its foreign policy
 -its security relations with the US and its deepening political and
economic ties with its partners in Europe.
The result is that for the first time since the birth of the republic in the
1920s, Turkey is starting to play a decisive, if somewhat reluctant, role in
its immediate neighbourhood - in the Balkans, in the conflict in the
Caucasus, and not least in north Iraq.
Devising a comprehensive policy framework for such a patchwork of relations
presents special problems. Firstly, many of the bordering states were once
part of the Ottoman empire and carry with them the natural suspicions of
former subjects. In North Iraq, the Kurdish question presents a particular
challenge given Turkey's own large and troubled Kurdish minority.
There is also the problem that Turkey, however much it tries to project a
regional policy, is all too often seen as siding with its co-religionists.
Related to this is the danger that policy is too often driven by the
pressures of public opinion. The bloody events in Bosnia-Hercegovina and to
a lesser extent in Azerbaijan's conflict with ethnic Armenian forces in
Nagorno Karabagh have caused the sort of popular outrage not seen since the
intercommunal violence in Cyprus which eventually prompted the Turks to
invade in 1974.
Given such a background, western diplomats believe Turkish policy has been
both cautious and realistic. There are nonetheless a number of clear policy
objectives. With the increasing volatility of regional politics, it is no
longer possible to adopt the sort of benign neglect which once characterised
Turkey's stance to its neighbours.
With the end of the cold war, and the preoccupations of the Europeans with
their own internal wrangling, Turkey needed a new role. Saddam Hussein's
invasion of Kuwait seemed to throw up the bit part Turkey wanted. Thrust by
geography, into supporting the allied war effort, the Gulf conflict seemed
like a defining moment in Turkey's relations with the west. Today a more
cynical appraisal is heard as Turks complain of the economic costs and the
vital dangers posed by the creation of the Kurdish entity in north Iraq.
Turkey's relations with the former Soviet satellites presented equal
difficulites. However, the creation of the Black Sea economic agreement did
much to convince these new friends that they were not just exchanging one
form of domination for another. Relations with the Arab world will continue
to be tempered by colonial grievances and strategic calculations relating to
Turkey's control of much of the region's water. Yet even here, Turkey has
made efforts to forge ties, particularly economic ties, and is actively
supporting US efforts to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
More broadly, the real test has been how to match Turkey's security concerns
with those of its western allies. As the ongoing disagreement over Bosnia
has shown, these interests do not always coincide.
In the Balkans, Turkey's policy goals are particularly complex. On one
level, there is the security concern that the crisis could suck in other
regional countries - Greece, Albania and perhaps Bulgaria, which would bring
the conflict much closer to Turkey's borders.
The popular perception is that the west's inaction is part of a bid to rid
Europe of its Moslem populations. As a Moslem country, which sees itself as
European, Turkey can hardly stand idly by. At a popular level the crisis has
served to highlight what is perceived as western double standards towards
the Moslem world, and has inevitably fed the resentment that many Turks feel
towards their European 'friends'.
What is needed is a policy framework that is both consistent and
comprehensive. In late 1992, Turkey played host to a conference in Istanbul,
attended by almost all the regional countries to the Yugoslav conflict. By
so doing, Turkey staked its own claim to be considered as a Balkan country.
It also implicitly rejected the notion that a solution to the conflict could
be found only through the good offices of international bodies such as the
United Nations and the European Union.
Today the international community appears to have inched round to Turkey's
long-held view that Serbian aggression has to be met with force. However, in
Ankara this is little cause for satisfaction. Too much innocent blood has
already been shed.
For Turkey, the threat of the 'spill-over' from the Bosnian war is not
simply a theoretical question; it is a matter of vital national interest.
The country's anger at the west's failure to stop the slaughter is all the
more acute given that Turkey, as a Nato member, is nominally a party to that
western inaction.
'The approach of the EU from the start has been how to divide
Bosnia-Hercegovina into three. We believe the EU has never tried to maintain
an integral Bosnia-Hercegovina. This is not justice for Bosnia,' says one
senior Turkish official.
With some feeling he describes the London conference hosted by Mr John
Major, Britain's prime minister, as 'mere window dressing'. He is equally
forthright about the Geneva peace process. 'We are no part of that plan. All
it has achieved is to prolong the fighting.'
The Turks are bitter for a number of reasons. As a former Ottoman
dependency, Turkey feels a moral responsibility to Bosnia. At home, this
sense of kinship is heightened by the presence of a 2m strong Bosnak
community - Moslem Slavs who settled in Turkey in the early 1890s when the
territory was annexed by the forces of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
Moreover, having recognised the independence of Bosnia, the Turks insist
that the international community is morally bound to help preserve the
integrity of the republic's borders.
Upholding the sanctity of borders is in many ways the guiding principle of
Turkish foreign policy, whether in underpinning its arguments in Bosnia or
in the Caucasus or in its own refusal to concede the need for a more
flexible line on Kurdish demands for autonomy. However, sticking to this
principle places Turkey in a potentially awkward dilemma, particularly if
the conflict spreads to Kosovo, where Turkey would have to decide on the
'rights' of the ethnic Albanians who make up 90 per cent of this formerly
autonomous Serbian province.
Taking a longer view of the Bosnian crisis, Ankara is all too aware that the
tragedy could be taken up by the more Moslem radical states, jeopardising
Turkey's influence within the Islamic movement. Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkey's
foreign minister, has frequently voiced his fear that the tragedy in Bosnia
could become the focus in the future for an outbreak of international
terrorism against western interests.
On more than one occasion, Turkey has felt uncomfortably out of step with
its allies - the west's refusal to lift the arms embargo to allow the
Bosnian Moslems to defend themselves being the most clear-cut example.
The long-term danger is that by increasing Turkey's sense of rejection, it
will merely play into the hands of anti-western Islamic interests. The
west's perceived double standard towards the tragedy in Bosnia, if not the
overriding cause, was definitely a contributing factor behind the dramatic
gains made the Moslem-backed Refah party in last month's local elections.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (3): A shock for the secularists - Election
setbacks for the main parties may lead to political realignment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month's municipal elections may well prove to have been a watershed in
Turkish politics.
The historic victory of the Islamic-based Refah party (RP), both in
Istanbul, the largest city and in Ankara, the capital, has shattered the
cosy complacency of the secularist establishment. The continuing collapse of
the leftwing vote, with the three centre-left parties together polling
little more than 25 per cent, has further underlined the point.
What was also alarming for Turkey's western friends was the growing
popularity of the neo-fascist Nationalist Action party (MHP) which polled
8.8 per cent, more than trebled its 1989 vote and took control in several
municipalities in eastern Turkey.
Mrs Tansu Ciller's True Path (DYP)party won the election by a slither from
its rightwing rival, the Motherland party of Mesut Yilmaz. But it was the
Islamic vote that caused the stir. With just one shift in the prism, a deep
shadow has been cast over Turkey's political scene.
Some Turks are putting a brave face on developments. The result, they say,
will act as a catalyst for a long- overdue realignment of Turkey's fractured
political landscape - on both right and left. A more alarming analysis is
that this marks Islam's political coming of age, an event which could change
the whole course of Turkey's pro- western democratic development.
The RP has control of 28 of the country's 76 city councils, prompting Mr
Nemettin Erbakan, its leader, to boast that 66 per cent of the population
will now be under his party's administration. The party's performance,
doubling its vote over local polls in 1989, is likely to have a considerable
fall-out. Mainstream parties will be forced to reappraise their strategies.
The army, as the self- appointed guardian of Turkey's secular pro-western
identity, will be watching events with particularly close interest. Turkey's
western allies will be asking if the country is going the way of Algeria,
where Islamic extremists seemed poised to take power by the ballot box until
the army intervened to suspend the elections and arrest the activists.
From Turkey's mainstream parties, a variety of responses seems possible.
Firstly, the splintering of traditional voting patterns is certain to revive
the debate about the need for electoral reform, to counter the Islamic
challenge.
After all, as many secular Turks will point out, the RP only polled 18 per
cent of the national vote, coming third, yet took control of more city
councils than both the DYP and Anap put together. This fact alone may force
the right wing to reconsider the logic of a merger.
Electoral reform would, of course, require a two-thirds majority in the
450-member parliament. Judging from the lack of consensus on most
legislative issues to date, this may be hard to achieve.
One option is to introduce a two-tier system, modelled on the French system.
The Turks have already tinkered end- lessly with the current arrangement,
most recently in 1991, when the then Anap government introduced changes in
the barrage system to discourage fringe and regional parties. To look at the
line-up for last month's local polls, the safety mechanism would appear to
have come undone.
The proliferation of parties is bewildering. In all, the Turkish electorate
had to choose between 12 parties, encompassing centre, right and left,
social democrat, and the extremes of neo-fascists, Socialists and Islamic
radicals. The notable absentee was the Kurdish based Democracy Party, DEP.
Its withdrawal from the election was in some part responsible for RP's
strong showing in the Kurdish-speaking south-east.
In Turkey party distinctions often appear highly artificial, and frequently
have more to do with personality than policy, something which is
particularly true of DYP. For more than three decades the DYP and its former
incarnation, the Justice Party, has been in the gift of one man, Suleyman
Demirel.
It was Mr Demirel's bitter rivalry with his one-time economics adviser,
Turgut Ozal, the former president and Anap founder, which kept the parties
apart. With Mr Demirel's accession to the presidency last June and Mrs Tansu
Ciller's emergence as DYP leader, many commentators are wondering whether
the way is now open for a merger on the right.
The election will have created even more urgency. The RP has stolen votes
from DYP and Anap, both of which once represented a broad church, a fusion
of the strands that make up the rightwing vote in Turkey from Islamic
conservatives, to hardline nationalists and laissez-faire liberal
progressives.
Another possibility is that both conservative parties will ignore the logic
of creating a merger and merely move to the right in a bid to accommodate
the Islamic vote and undercut the RP.
The prospect of a merger of left-of-centre parties seems more distant. All
the parties - the SHP, the Republican People's party (CHP), and the
Democratic Left party (DSP) of former prime minister Bulent Evevit - claim
to be the true torch-bearers for the secular reforms introduced by Turkey's
founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, after he abolished the caliphate.
The SHP, with more to lose after its sweeping win in 1989, took a
particularly severe drubbing, losing Izmir and Adana, in addition to
Istanbul and Ankara. The DSP polled just 8 per cent nationally while the CHP
managed only 4 per cent.
Whatever happens, the long-term survival of the current coalition must be in
doubt. At a personal level, Mrs Ciller, the DYP prime minister, has little
in common with Mr Murat Karayalcin, the leader of the secularist SHP.
The coalition appears to have outlasted its usefulness. For one thing, the
alliance had nothing to do with the current leaders of the respective
parties. It was largely the creation of Mr Demirel and Prof Erdal Inonu, the
former deputy prime minister who stepped down as head of SHP in November,
paving the way for Mr Karayalcin's election.
Divisions over policy - whether it is the Kurds, the economy, or the place
of Islam in society - have strained an already uneasy cohabitation.
Ironically, the one issue where the SHP stood its ground was over the draft
for the new anti-terror draft law. In this case, negotiations broke down
over DYP's refusal to include crimes against the secular nature of the state
as treasonable. Both parties were in agreement over the hardline remedy for
separatist offences.
The divisions are certain to widen. Mrs Ciller has already issued what
amounted to an open invitation to Mr Yilmaz to start merger talks. However
the immediate question is how will Mrs Ciller accommodate the Anap leader.
More than most of the mainstream party leaders, the clever but humourless Mr
Yilmaz has been badly wounded by the election results. But given the state
of the economy, he may be reluctant to join forces, fearing to get tarred
with the same brush as Mrs Ciller.
Municipal polls, of course, have no direct bearing on party strengths in
parliament, although according to one expert, the RP vote would translate
into around 150 seats in parliament at the next general election. The party
currently has 40 MPs.
Much will depend on how well the RP does in managing the affairs of
Istanbul, a city which has proved a notorious graveyard for the reputations
of many parties - most recently the outgoing SHP administration.
The central government's ability to make life difficult is not
inconsiderable. New cash constraints can be imposed. The near-bankruptcy of
many administrations today can be traced to the face that many were forced
to borrow, some on international markets, with the result that
municipalities are today facing severe ongoing debt service problems.
If RP comes unstuck, Turkish voters are unlikely to turn out in their droves
at a general election for a party that cannot put water in Istanbul's taps
or keep Ankara's municipal rubbish dumps at a safe distance from the city
centre.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (2): Nimble exporters saved the day - Ian
Rodger examines the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as if Austria gave the recent European recession a miss.
The final figures are not in yet, but it is likely that the country did not
even accumulate three successive quarters of declining output last year, and
the net gross domestic product decline for the full year was probably only
0.25 per cent.
This is a much better performance than everyone but Mrs Maria Schaumayer,
the president of the Austrian National Bank, expected. Mrs Schaumayer, it
may be recalled, brushed aside talk of hard landings last year, saying that
any landing would be of the softest velvet.
Even the quasi-official Austrian Institute of Economic Research (Wifo) was
too negative, carrying a 1993 forecast of a full 1 per cent decline until
mid-autumn when it detected an export recovery.
What seems to have happened is that Austria's nimble exporters responded
rapidly to the slump in demand in their main western European markets,
especially Germany and Italy, and aimed their efforts more at eastern
Europe, the US and the Far East. Thus the net fall in exports last year
could be limited to 4.5 per cent in spite of a 9.1 per cent slide in exports
to European Union countries.
Exports to eastern Europe have grown very rapidly in the past three years
and now account for 13 per cent of the total. Hungary is the country's
fifth-largest market after Germany, Italy, Switzerland and France. Exports
to the US were up 24.5 per cent after two years of declines.
Mr Helmut Kramer, Wifo director, suspects that analysts were so impressed
last year by the difficulties of some of the country's big companies - such
as Austrian Industries, OMV and Leykam - that they failed to notice that
smaller and medium sized companies were doing surprisingly well.
Mrs Schaumayer agrees. 'There is a deeply rooted misconception that we are a
country of farmers and civil servants. We have a lot of really successful
industrial entrepreneurs,' she says.
Productivity has also improved, at least with respect to Germany, thanks in
part to the willingness of trade unions to agree moderate settlements last
autumn.
The other factor in last year's resilient performance was a rise of 2 per
cent in domestic demand. This was partly explained by some government pump
priming early in the year, but mainly, it seems, by maintained consumer
confidence. Austrian authorities point out that they were careful to avoid
wallowing in the kind of excessive pessimism that could be observed in
Germany and tended to make things worse.
Perhaps because of the mildness of the downturn, inflation remains the
Austrian economy's biggest problem. Unemployment, the scourge of most other
European countries, shows no sign of raging through Austria. It averaged 4.2
per cent on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
calculation method last year and is forecast to rise to 4.6 per cent this
year as manufacturing industry continues to emphasise productivity
improvement. 'We expect unemployment to continue to rise steadily but
slowly,' says Mr Werner Teufelsbauer, chief economist at the Federal Chamber
of Commerce.
Inflation, on the other hand, is still at 3.1 per cent and Wifo is
forecasting that it will average 2.75 per cent in 1994.
Mr Kramer says that about a third of the pressure on prices comes from
increases in tariffs on public services and another important portion from
the strong demand for housing and the related recent liberalisation of rent
control laws.
However, he is distressed that market forces have been slow to work in the
past year since the effective revaluation of the schilling and, more
recently, the start-up of the European Economic Area (EEA).
Prices of many imported industrial inputs and consumer products remain
unnecessarily high. Perhaps it will take time for both EU sellers and
Austrian buyers to realise that the country's entry into the single market
through the EEA creates opportunities for both.
'Our small and medium sized companies are not accustomed to being in a
buyers' market. It will take them a while to learn to bargain,' says Mrs
Schaumayer.
The other relatively important problem is the public sector deficit. The
government's plan to bring the federal deficit down from 5 per cent of GDP
in 1986 to 2.5 per cent this year has been quietly jettisoned.
Good progress was made until 1992, when it was down to 3.25 per cent, but
last year the deficit grew again because of various recessionary influences,
the introduction of new social security spending and the failure of
privatisation revenues to meet forecasts.
The budgeted Sch60bn deficit was raised to Sch80bn in the autumn, and Mr
Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister, said last month it would end up at
Sch98bn, some 4 per cent of GDP.
This year's budgeted deficit is Sch80bn, but with federal elections and a
tricky referendum on joining the EU in prospect, the government is unlikely
to be in the business of imposing pain on anyone. Next year, Austria has to
start making net contributions to the EU budget as well as compensation
payments to hard-hit industries, especially agriculture.
Nobody pretends that Austria's fiscal problems are anything like as severe
as those of most other western European countries. If the healthy finances
of the provincial governments are taken into account, the aggregate public
sector deficit is pretty close to the Maastricht requirement that it not
exceed 2.5 per cent of GDP.
But economists would like to see the government pushing hard to cut spending
now that economic recovery is under way.
Initially, the recovery is expected to be fairly modest. Wifo is forecasting
only 1.5 per cent GDP growth this year, and some economists believe it is
being too optimistic.
Mr Kramer says the export performance is better than expected, and he
believes export growth will exceed the forecast 3.8 per cent.
Domestic demand, on the other hand, will remain weak, with the only stimulus
coming from income tax cuts that came into effect at the beginning of the
year. Corporate capital spending, after two years of decline, will probably
rise modestly.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (3): Financial scene is still bubbling -
The bloated banking sector is being consolidated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Austrian financial scene continues to bubble - even though the stock and
bond markets have gone quiet in recent months after surges last year.
The most significant, not to say startling, event of recent months has been
the climax of a three-year battle over the future of GiroCredit, the former
Girozentrale, the country's third-largest bank.
Giro has been a headache for Austria's bloated banking system since the late
1980s. The central clearing organisation for the country's large savings
bank sector, it became excessively ambitious in the 1980s, spending more
time on ill-considered expansions in international capital markets than on
looking after its savings bank customers and owners.
However, as it was doing so, the two largest savings banks, Zentralsparkasse
and Erste Oesterreichische, were busily building up their shareholdings in
the bank. By the late 1980s, they together counted for a small majority,
thus upsetting a delicate Conservative-Socialist balance that had long
prevailed in the Giro supervisory board.
The significance of this change was that both Zentralsparkasse and Erste
objected to Giro remaining a competitor on what they considered their turf -
capital markets and retail banking - and they began to use their power on
the board to curb the bank's executives.
In late 1991, Zentralsparkasse, which is controlled by the socialist
municipal government of Vienna, took over the ailing Landerbank, and turned
itself into a universal bank, Bank Austria.
This seemed to clear the way for Conservative Erste to merge with Giro and
resolve the impasse, and negotiations were held. However, they soon broke
off, allegedly because of bad blood between executives of the two banks, but
more likely because the proud and successful Erste, with a balance sheet
only three-fifths the size of Giro's, was unwilling to play second fiddle in
the merged concern.
A year later, Giro executives, chafing under the continuing stand-off in
their supervisory board, proposed another attempt. Erste was persuaded to
put together a consortium of big provincial savings banks that would buy out
Bank Austria's 30 per cent stake.
The negotiations proceeded at a stately pace reflecting the general lack of
enthusiasm for the project until two months ago when Bank Austria became fed
up with waiting for a solution and launched a formal bid of its own for
control of Giro.
It rapidly became apparent that Bank Austria would win. The smaller savings
banks could hardly be blamed for taking Bank Austria's cash rather than
having to put their own money into a new Giro holding company in which their
influence over Giro would be diminished.
Bank Austria's plans for Giro are not yet clear, but it is likely to strip
the bank down to its central clearing function. Among Bank Austria
strategists, this structure is already known facetiously as Giro-Lite. Other
departments - leasing, factoring, capital markets - will be merged with its
own.
Giro's retail branches, ironically acquired with the takeover of
Oesterreichisches Credit-Institut from Bank Austria two years ago, will
probably be sold off to friendly savings banks.
Whatever happens, the operation will certainly result in a significant
consolidation of Austria's bloated banking sector. As such, it is welcomed
by other bankers looking for less cut-throat competition than they have had
to live with for many years.
With the resolution of the Giro problem, the focus now turns again to
Creditanstalt-Bankverein (CA), the country's second-largest bank. The
Austrian government has undertaken to sell its 70.5 per cent voting stake in
CA, but last year turned down two concrete proposals that were put to it.
CA executives favour a wide distribution of the shares in international
markets but Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister, would rather place a
large minority stake with a strong international bank. Mr Lacina says he
wants to complete the sale this year.
That could turn out to be difficult if the current pipeline of new issues in
the Austrian capital market remains full. Also, banking securities are no
longer the favourites they were a few months ago.
The market is now absorbing one of the biggest initial public offerings ever
seen, a Sch3bn issue from Mayr-Melnhof, a large, family-owned recycled paper
and board group. This issue is, among other things, proof that the intensive
effort of the past two years to breathe new life into the capital markets is
paying off.
Among the more important reforms that came into effect at the beginning of
this year was the abolition of the wealth tax. Previously, it was a
disadvantage for a wealthy family to have a quoted value on its assets.
Analysts say other family-controlled companies are soon likely to follow
Mayr-Melnhof's lead.
Voest-Alpine Technology, the plant engineering arm of the former state-owned
Austrian Industries, is the next big issue in the pipeline, with the
privatisation of a majority of the shares scheduled for mid-May. VA-Tech's
net income jumped by a third last year to Sch925m on sales of Sch22.5bn.
The state is also planning to sell later in the year its remaining 26 per
cent stake in VA Eisenbahnsysteme, a railway technology company which was
partially privatised in late 1992.
Other candidates still on the near term privatisation list include
Vorarlberger Illwerke, a regional power utility that is to be sold to the
Vorarlberg provincial government.
Further capital market reforms are also in the works. Following the
amendment of the criminal law last year to make insider trading a criminal
offence, the focus is now on prohibiting the use of anonymous bank accounts
for securities transactions and creating a surveillance authority similar to
the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
These moves are likely to occur following the national elections expected in
October. In the meantime, Austrian capital markets leaders are planning
seminars in London and New York in May to explain the progress they have
made.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (1): Europe links questioned - At a
watershed in its relations with Europe, the secular republic has been shaken
by the election success of an Islam-based party. Turkey is suffering an
economic crisis, and the economic promised land is not yet in sight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<TEXT>
Three little words - 'Turkey in Europe' - create surprising convulsions
among academics whenever they come together to discuss the subject. For many
Turks may feel themselves to be European, but in terms of geography if
nothing else, Turkey is also an Asian, Middle Eastern, Levantine even a
Balkan country.
Today some inhabitants are beginning to question their claims to be European
as the country grapples with its worst economic crisis in a decade, a
growing Kurdish rebellion and the fall-out from the electoral challenge to
Turkey's political mainstream of last month's dramatic gains by the
Islamic-based Refah party (RP).
Ask a Turk today where he comes from, and his answer is as likely to be
Bosnia or Azerbaijan as Istanbul or Ankara. And this is not a reflection of
Turkey's mounting refugee intake. 'There are Kurds and non-Kurds' is how one
Turkish diplomat described his country's ethnic breakdown - and only half in
jest.
The confusion over identity is certainly sharpened by the unhappy experience
of the Turkish workers in Germany who have been the subject of extremist
attacks. Seeing itself as both European and Moslem, Turkey is also outraged
by the west's indifference to the suffering of Bosnia, where Turks have
links of both history and kinship.
However, the real challenge is closer to home. The twin cocktail of a
Kurdish and Islamic threat is shaking the foundations of the secular
republic carved from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire.
Turkey has come a long way from the dark days of the military coup in 1980.
Some Turks may even feel they are in sight of the economic promised land.
However, recent events have dented that self-confidence. If the mounting
economic and political problems are left untackled, there is a real danger
that these could deepen the sense of self-doubt and give sustenance to
Islamic and nationalist forces, putting in peril the whole pro-western
thrust of Turkish policy.
Such a prospect is deeply worrying for the west, since Turkey is an
important ally and an increasingly big commercial partner. However, it is no
longer enough just to be in the right place at the right time. The end of
the cold war has changed strategic priorities. The US is reviewing its role
as it downgrades its military presence across Europe as agreed at last
year's Nato summit.
Turkey's relations with Europe are also at a critical turning point. Ankara
is due to enter a customs union with the European Union next year. However,
there must now be doubts whether the deadline will be met given the current
economic turmoil.
Turkey applied for full membership in 1987 and was politely rejected two
years later. But today there is little realistic prospect of early
accession. Indeed, Turkey is not even considered in the current round of
enlargement talks, a point which makes it all the more important that Turkey
does not slip up on its customs union commitments.
Diplomats also point out that with the accession of Nordic and Scandinavian
countries, the European Union is likely to become more, not less, sensitive
to the issues of human rights, an area where Turkey has made too little
progress. In February, Turkey's friends in the west looked on in amazement
as parliament lifted the immunities of six MPs from the radical Kurdish
party, five of whom could now face the death penalty for publicly espousing
the Kurdish cause. The incident provided a sharp reminder of the draconian
military laws limiting freedom of speech which are still in place in a
country seeking full EU membership.
Turkey certainly has little room for error. In Mrs Tansu Ciller, the country
has a youthful and energetic prime minister. However, her political
inexperience has been starkly exposed by the ongoing crisis.
The prime minister's decision to adopt a hard line towards the Kurds may
have a certain logic, since a more moderate policy might unleash the growing
nationalist fervour. But Turkey's refusal to countenance any kind of reform
is jeopardising its foreign policy prestige at a time when its ability to
influence regional events is greater than ever. With 4,000 civilians,
soldiers and guerrillas killed last year in a war costing Turkey an
estimated Dollars 7bn a year, the present bloody stalemate cannot be
sustained.
On the economy, many blame Mrs Ciller's policies for precipitating the
collapse of the currency, which forced her to announce the austerity package
unveiled earlier this month. Mrs Ciller still has to steer through a raft of
legislation on privatisation and tax changes to underpin the programme. She
also has to accommodate an increasingly vociferous union movement which
feels under threat from the package. A period of social unrest seems
inevitable if the measures are to be adopted in full.
In some important respects, the Turkish economy is already diverging from
European norms. Inflation is more than 70 per cent, and will probably rise
to more than 100 per cent as the recent price increases take their toll. The
public sector borrowing requirement is now running at 16 per cent of gross
national product.
Neither the republic - nor even its private sector - can go to the
international debt markets in the current uncertainty. Turkey's credit
rating has already been downgraded twice this year by both Moody's and
Standard &amp; Poor's. The day when foreign correspondent banks cut off lines of
credit is fast approaching.
With basic commodities such as tea and sugar, as well as petrol and
household gas prices rising by up to 100 per cent as part of the package,
the Turkish public will soon begin to feel the pinch. Workers at the
Zonguldak coalworks and the Karabuk steel mills - state companies earmarked
for possible closures - are both poised for industrial action to protest
against the austerity package.
But the view from Brussels is that Turkey's private sector can ride out the
storm, although with labour being stood down and production flat, if not
declining, it will certainly be difficult to make the investments required
to upgrade technologies so as to compete with European imports.
For the politicians, the danger is that some private sector companies will
demand a reprieve from the deadline, which commission officials warn would
unravel the whole process.
The government's own task is to see if it can staunch the huge losses
suffered by the public sector, without which much of the real benefits of a
customs union will be dissipated.
A successful implementation of the stabilisation measures is vital to
restore international confidence in Turkey's economy, and in Mrs Ciller's
leadership. It is also crucial to ensure that the economic problems do not
deepen, thus playing into the hands of Refah, who have successfully
projected themselves as patrons of the dispossessed.
For the local election result on March 27 underscores a stark demographic
fact. In Istanbul and, equally dramatically, in Ankara, the RP came to power
backed by the 'sans culottes' of Turkey's newly-spawned big city slums -
much the same section of voters who backed the fascists and the communists
in the 1970s.
'It's no longer a financial crisis. It's no longer an economic crisis. It's
a political crisis,' was how one Istanbul banker put it.
The Turks are a long-suffering lot. Faced with such a maelstrom, many less
resilient and less phlegmatic societies would probably have cracked under
the strain. Yet for Turkey to survive the crisis, the government must grasp
the nettle of reform.

FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Austria (1): New challenge in Europe - The
recession came and went so fast that many Austrians now wonder whether it
happened at all. Even the most bullish of officials find it hard to explain
why their country escaped so lightly from the European downturn
</HEADLINE>

Austrians tend to be cautious, but there is no hiding the general feeling of
relief and optimism, not to mention surprise, at having left behind so
quickly the country's worst recession for more than a decade.
The recession came and went so fast that many Austrians now wonder whether
it happened at all, although rising unemployment is a reminder of the
country's vulnerability to external economic developments. But even the most
bullish of officials find it hard to explain why their country escaped so
lightly from the European downturn.
One explanation is that Austria continued to benefit much more than
initially thought from the opening up of the former communist states in
central and eastern Europe. While growing exports to eastern Europe could
not fully compensate for declining trade in traditional western markets,
they reduced the impact of the downturn. Domestic demand also held up
relatively well, with public and private consumption boosted by tax reform
and an acceleration in planned government expenditure on infrastructure and
housing. There were other factors. Wage rises were moderated by fear of
unemployment, although at 4.2 per cent of the work force, the proportion of
people without jobs is well below that in other European countries.
Many sectors of the economy are still sheltered from international
competition, and the predominance of small and medium sized companies -
which proved to be much more flexible than the large mainly state-owned
groups - also helped. Many companies were able to switch markets and adapt
production relatively easily.
Whatever the reasons, Austria's recession - with gross domestic product
declining by about 0.25 per cent in 1993 - will have been one of the
shortest and mildest in Europe. A modest recovery is forecast for this year,
although as growth picks up again in Europe, especially in the important
German market which takes about 40 per cent of Austrian exports, Austria
should be well placed to reap the benefits. Growth may turn out stronger
than the 1.5 per cent forecast.
Austria will also be well placed to benefit from European Union membership -
expected on January 1, 1995 - which will give it full and free access to the
Union's expanded internal market and strengthen the country's attraction as
a base for foreign investment. Good infrastructure and telecommunications, a
skilled and disciplined labour force - strikes are practically unknown - a
pleasant environment, and a government eager to encourage foreign
investment, have already enticed many companies to establish themselves in
the country.
Since the fall of communism in central and eastern Europe, Vienna's role as
a regional base for western multinationals has been strengthened.
But membership will also bring costs. Austria's inefficient agriculture and
food processing industries are in for a shock as protective barriers come
down and prices are aligned with those in the rest of the EU.
For the country's farmers, the blow will be cushioned by state and EU
subsidies during the next few years, but the speed at which German milk
producers gained local market share as the European Economic Area came into
force on January 1 this year is an indication of the competitive pressures
Austrian producers will face from now on.
The same is true for other industries where one of the biggest challenges
comes from low-cost competition from central and eastern Europe.
Manufacturers of sensitive products from cement to fertilisers face a tough
future as eastern producers undercut prices even for the most economic and
modern of Austrian plants.
Traditional industries will find it increasingly difficult to compete
against producers benefiting from labour costs of almost one tenth those in
Austria. This has encouraged a growing number of Austrian companies to
internationalise their operations by moving labour-intensive production to
neighbouring countries.
'For the cost of running a small factory with 50 workers here, you can move
to Bratislava and employ more than 200 workers,' says a businessman. Austria
has emerged as the largest western investor in the region in terms of
numbers of joint ventures established.
EU membership will also accelerate the pace of restructuring. Productivity
gains in recent years have helped the most exposed sectors to adjust to
international competition, but further improvements will be needed if
Austria is to remain competitive as a business location.
Mr Franz Vranitzky, the social democrat chancellor, says that raising skills
and quality will be central concerns of the next government after general
elections in October. 'In Europe, it is increasingly difficult to maintain
employment. Every structural change has ended with a decline in industrial
jobs. We would not be well advised to copy eastern Europe (with cheap
labour). We need a high level of development, of education and skills,' he
says. Openness and competitiveness will be the most important factors in
securing future prosperity, he adds.
Good intentions, however, are not always easy to live up to. Last year, the
government overshot its spending targets by about 60 per cent with the
budget deficit rising to just under Sch100bn, representing about 4 per cent
of GDP. The worsening deficit was due to lower tax revenues, a virtual halt
in the privatisation programme, and rising social outlays for unemployment.
The deficit should come down this year as the recovery strengthens and
privatisations get under way again. Moreover, the deficit is not as serious
a problem as in other European countries, and it would represent only about
2.5 per cent of GDP if the healthier provincial government finances were
taken into account. Inflation, at 3.1 per cent, is falling slowly.
Economists would like to see the government make greater efforts to cut
spending, but with a referendum on EU membership and a general election due
later this year, improvements on this side are likely to be modest.
The EU referendum is scheduled for June, and the future of the coalition
between the Social Democratic Party (SPO) and the conservative People's
Party (OVP) will be tested in general elections in October.
Baring surprises, the referendum should come out in favour of membership,
with Austria joining on January 1. Opposition to joining has so far remained
fragmented and weak, and opinion polls suggest that a clear majority of
voters favour membership. The Greens and Mr Jorg Haider's Freedom Party
(FPO) on the extreme right are opposed to membership, though they are
divided on the issue.
The greatest threat to a positive outcome may be complacency, with people,
especially socialist voters, not bothering to vote - 'for the right or wrong
reasons, the EU has not been a very attractive product to sell,' says
Chancellor Vranitzky. It is widely perceived to have failed in its
peace-making efforts in Bosnia; it is identified with the international
recession; and it has much higher unemployment than Austria. The recent
quarrel over minority votes was unedifying.
'So it takes an extra effort to convince our people that as a model it's an
improvement,' he says.
Uncertainty over the referendum's outcome worries business - 'if we don't
join, foreign investment will dry up. If there is no foreign investment,
there'll be no technological transfer. And if there is no technological
transfer, we will not be able to modernise our economy and compete,' says a
local banker.
Officials, however, believe they have secured sufficiently attractive
membership terms and enough concessions from Brussels on agriculture and
transit lorry traffic to win majority support for membership.
The general election will present the ruling parties with a different
challenge. Their popularity has steadily declined since the 1980s as an
increasing number of voters has grown tired of the old system under which
the social democrats and conservatives have shared out power and patronage
among themselves.
Dissatisfaction has boosted the Freedom Party and the Greens, but the FPO's
xenophobic anti-immigration campaigns have effectively ruled it out as a
coalition partner, while the Greens and the Liberals remain too small to
exert much influence. The most likely outcome of the elections remains
another grand coalition.

FT  15 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: BSkyB benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that satellite broadcaster BSkyB was partly to repay investors after
raising Pounds 500m, helped leading shareholders Pearson, Granada and News
International, the UK arm of 50 per cent shareholder News Corp.
Pearson, which will receive Pounds 81m, saw its shares gain 5 to 645p, while
Granada, which will get Pounds 64m, added 11 at 556p. News International
improved 8 to 278p.
Huge turnover of 6.5m shares surrounded Aegis, the media and communications
group, after a two-way pull on the stock developed. The company reported a
loss of Pounds 18.1m against a loss of Pounds 10.9m the previous year. Some
analysts said that all the bad news was out in the open and the company
poised for recovery. The shares held steady at 23 1/2 pp.
Building materials group Blue Circle Industries continued the run of
excellent results from the sector, announcing preliminary profits above most
analysts' expectations. BCI shares touched 339p before ending 6 higher at
333p. Sector specialists were particularly pleased with the company's
performance in the US and said they expected substantial profits upgrades to
follow the results.
RMC advanced 12 more to 978p, boosted by good results announced on Wednesday
and additionally helped by Bundesbank interest rate cuts. Redland, like RMC
heavily involved in the German market, moved up 8 to 556p. Caradon was a
lone poor performer in the sector, the shares slipping 8 to 347p in the wake
of a big selling order.
Shares in British Steel hit a 5 year high adding 3 3/4 to 152 1/2 p, after
Goldman Sachs issued a buy recommendation. Turnover rose to 18m, to make it
one the most active stocks.
Market watchers attributed some of the day's buying to institutions that had
attended a company presentation on Wednesday hosted by Cazenove.
Vodafone attracted fresh bouts of selling pressure from the US where
investors focused on the potential threat to the established cellular phone
companies from Orange, the new service being launched at the end of the
month by Hutchison. Vodafone shares 8 1/2 to 517 1/2 p after good turnover
of 4.2m.
The Scottish generators were given a rough ride in a generally weak
utilities area as BZW, the investment bank, downgraded the two stocks.
Scottish Hydro fell 19, or 5 per cent, to close at 352p, while Scottish
Power dropped 13, or 3.3 per cent, to 379p.
Textile group Lamont lifted 9 to 433p following a sharp rise in annual
profits to Pounds 11.4m from Pounds 6.4m previously.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo fell 6 to 568p as US investment group Morgan
Stanley added its weight to the gloomy views overhanging the company and
reiterated its sell stance. Glaxo options were also the most active with the
equivalent of 2.2m shares traded.
News of an Office of Fair Trading inquiry into the supply of some Japanese
electronic goods to warehouse retailers upset Dixons, with the shares off 5
1/2 at 197 1/2 p. The OFT probe is reported to be looking at the suppliers'
reluctance to provide goods to the discount groups. BZW was said to be among
the sellers.
Allied Lyons jumped 19 to 571p with 7.6m traded, with Smith New Court said
to be positive. Grand Metropolitan, off 7 at 458p, was undermined by news of
the loss of a US contract to a subsidiary of Guinness, up 2 at 171p.
Whitbread put on 5 to 549p.
Engineering group IMI jumped 12 to 355p, with Smith New Court upgrading
profit expectations.
Reg Vardy put on 13 to 209p, after issuing an upbeat trading statement ahead
of today's analyst visit to the group.

FT  15 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy turnover in Clyde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil exploration group Clyde Petroleum was the centre of attention for much
of the session as the Seaq ticker revealed that some 13.4m shares, equal to
3.4 per cent of the issued capital, had been sold into the market. The
shares were sold at 29 1/4 p, a discount of around 10 per cent to the then
ruling market price, and 12.5m were subsequently placed at 30 1/4 p. Clyde
was one of the market's most active stocks on Wednesday when a block of 3m
shares was believed to have changed hands. Clyde shares yesterday closed a
penny off at 33p.
There was no confirmation regarding the possible identity of the seller
yesterday. Recent hints that George Weston Holdings might have been
unloading stock was dismissed by oil specialists, but there were strong
suspicions that Fidelity, the US investment group, which recently sold a
small block of stock, could have been the big seller.
Clyde was the star of a busy oil sector inspired by oil prices moving
towards the Dollars 15 a barrel level. However, they later slipped back as
news of the downing of two US helicopters over Iraq came into the market.
Sentiment was given a further boost by news that Salomon Brothers, the big
US investment bank, had increased its current year oil price forecasts to
above Dollars 16 a barrel. A line of 5.5m nil paid ex rights shares in Lasmo
were chased by at least four leading marketmakers and placed at 18 1/2 p
premium.
Results largely in line with expectations from hotel group Forte produced a
mixed reaction among analysts - although the more positive view prevailed in
the market pushing the shares up 3 to 242p. There was a strong performance
from London hotels and slightly firmer trading in the provinces. But there
was some disappointment at the size of the write-down in assets, as well as
continued concerns over the group's debts.
BZW moved the stock from a hold to a buy, arguing that concerns such as
those of sale and leasebacks of hotels had now been aired and that the
company's overall strategy was now in place. But Smith New Court remained a
hold, arguing that despite the recovery in London trading, the shares are
fully valued.
Long-term bears NatWest Securities agreed, adding that with no dividend
yield to speak of and little support in the asset backing, the shares are
likely to undergo a continued derating. Profit forecasts for 1995 remained
in the Pounds 125-30m bracket.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives dealers reported a lacklustre trading session as traders watched
developments in the bond markets, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 3,167.
Buying mainly from independent traders saw it move gently ahead to reach the
day's high of 3,178, mid morning.
The retreat in UK gilts brought a turnaround in the fortunes of June and the
contract drifted lower as a nervous period set in as dealers waited for news
on German interest rates. The downing of two US helicopters also unsettled
trading ahead of lunch. The reduction in rates by the Bundesbank reversed
some of the earlier decline before the weakness in bond markets once again
led to renewed selling which saw the contract test the 3,139 support level.
It finished at 3,141, at a premium to cash, with volume improving to 14,698
lots. The mid 250 contract was also busy, trading 425 contracts and closing
at 3,785.
Volume in traded options at 42,055 was just below Wednesday's level. The
FT-SE 100 option traded 16,254 lots and the Euro FT-SE 7,841 contracts.
Glaxo was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,212 lots dealt followed
by Redland at 1,905.

FT  15 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses reduced in erratic
trading session - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The largely unexpected cut in German Discount rate gave little inspiration
yesterday to UK stock markets which were unnerved by weakness in US bonds
and by erratic trading in UK government securities. Shares remained on the
downside throughout the session although the FT-SE Index recovered more than
half of the 32 point fall suffered as traders hurriedly repositioned trading
books following the Bundesbank's move. Trading was also disturbed by reports
that two US helicopters had been downed in the Middle East; fuller details
of the incident did not arrive until late in the session.
Equities opened lower, unsettled by weakness overnight in the New York bond
markets. An attempted rally was helped by a trading programme from a leading
securities house but was then reversed when gilts turned sharply down,
following the US bonds trading in Europe.
The stock market paid little heed to the narrowing in the UK global trade
deficit for January. Share losses were sharply extended, despite the rate
cut from Germany, as equity dealers struggled with the extreme volatility in
the bond markets. Uncertainty over what had happened in Iraq helped depress
the market.
However, once the dust had settled died down, strategists suggested that
little had changed in the market equation. 'The Bundesbank is continuing to
reduce rates in an orderly fashion,' said one specialist. 'But the renewed
worries about US Federal bonds indicates that talk of Europe decoupling from
the US bond market may have been premature.' However, published minutes of
the regular meetings of the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the governor
of the Bank of England served to steady hopes for a cut in UK base rates in
the not too distant future.
The second attempt at recovery was checked at first when Wall Street opened
13 Dow points off but resumed when the New York market moved up to show a 3
point gain on the Dow in London trading hours.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was a net 14.1 down at 3,131.7. Dealers
sounded subdued and warned that volatility in bonds was causing pressures
for many trading houses as well as restraining the equity market.
Stock index futures played an important role in driving the underlying
market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, lacking involvement with the Footsie
future, closed 9.1 off at 3,792.1.
At least one other trading programme was identified in the second half of
the session, and the day's Seaq total of 629.7m shares compared favourably
with Wednesday's 885.7m, which was swollen by substantial deals in several
individual stocks.
Retail, or customer, business in equities was worth Pounds 1.52bn on
Wednesday but this total was inflated by the move through the market of
Transamerica International's 21 per cent stake in Sedgwick, Britain's
largest insurance broker. Although retail business in shares has been good
recently, it has been focused on share deals and placings, and pickings have
been slim for houses not involved.
Futures markets looked optimistic at the close but traders warned that
London would watch the US bond markets carefully overnight and that
attention would be focused on the US economic statistics on industrial
output and capacity utilisation due to be announced today.

FT  15 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow relieved after scare over
Mideast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks were mixed yesterday after recovering from a scare over US-Iraqi
relations and a early round of program selling, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.78 better at 3,663.25, while the more
broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged 0.12 higher to 446.38. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite dipped 0.63 to 437.32, and the
Nasdaq composite 0.07 to 727.31.
Stocks stumbled out of the opening gate, with investors rattled by erroneous
reports of hostile fire downing two US helicopters in northern Iraq. When it
emerged that the aircraft were shot down accidently by US forces, the market
reversed course and pushed into positive territory.
A parallel recovery by the US Treasury market was a help, although bonds
slipped once again. A small gain in weekly claims for state unemployment
benefit was no impediment. Most equity investors, however, were sitting pat
ahead of today's important data on industrial production and capacity
utilisation.
As the afternoon began, the blue chips started to recede from their peak of
12 points up. Positioning ahead today's 'double witching' expiration of
stock options was responsible for some of the volatililty.
Among individual issues, Chevron outperformed the Dow industrials thanks to
an upgrading by Salomon Brothers. The stock climbed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars
88 1/2 .
On the Nasdaq, technology issues stablised after sharp declines in the
previous two sessions. Adobe Systems jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 24 1/4
, and Wellfleet gained Dollars 1 1/2 to 65.
Canada
Toronto closed mixed in moderate trading, as slumping forest-products stocks
offset modest advances in most other sectors.
The TSE 300 composite index rose 6.05 points, or 0.14 per cent, to close at
4,254.85, but declining issues outnumbered advances 428 to 320. Volume was
63.20m compared with Wednesday's 63.73m. Trading value fell to CDollars
791.7m compared with CDollars 820.5m.
Mexico
The bolsa overcame early losses and closed with a slight gain on buying by
local investors.
The key IPC index of 36 leading stocks ended up 6.61 points, or 0.3 per
cent, at 2,206.51 on a volume of 68.5m shares.
Traders said local investors started buying late in the day after the index
fell below 2,200.

FT  15 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases back after
renewed political wrangling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Continued political wrangling over the selection of a new prime minister
left share prices easier on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average fell 73.21 to 19,987.20 after a low of 19,847.97 and
a high of 20,169.13. Shares fell in the morning on arbitrage linked selling,
before rising later on rumours that public funds will be allotted to trust
banks today. Later profit taking eroded most of the gains.
Traders said that investors were still worried by the political situation
which has failed to stabilise. Although the seven coalition parties seemed
to be in accord in backing Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, as the
next prime minister, the New Harbinger Party, on the coalition's left wing,
yesterday refused to enter negotiations.
Analysts said that investors would be reluctant to return to the stock
market while the political situation remained fluid.
Volume totaled 368.5m shares against 339m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 4.59 to 1,623.48, while the
Nikkei 300 ended 1.04 higher at 297.39. Advances led declines by 529 to 457
with 179 issues unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.99 to 1,329.07.
Low priced shipping shares, seen as laggards, improved with Showa Line, the
day's most active issue, rising Y7 to Y273 and Navix Line gaining Y8 to
Y372.
Automobile companies and component manufacturers were higher on expectations
of increased domestic and US car sales. Nissan Motor gained Y14 to Y884 and
Kayaba Industry jumped Y30 to Y570.
Profit-taking depressed some high-technology issues: NEC fell Y20 to Y1,130
and Fujitsu lost Y10 to Y1,030.
Oils rose were higher on hopes of higher earnings due to economic recovery
with Teikoku Oil rising rose Y16 to Y758 and Nippon Oil gained Y2 to Y727.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 102.18 to 22,291.40 in volume of 14.7m
shares. High-technology shares were bought, with Konami, the game maker,
rising Y120 to Y3,600. However, Nintendo lost Y140 to Y6,660 on
profit-taking.
Roundup
Overseas influences affected a number, but not all of the markets in the
region. Bombay, Bangkok and Colombo were closed for holidays.
HONG KONG took profits and the Hang Seng Index lost 153.13, or 1.6 per cent
at 9,600.63, turnover falling from HKDollars 5.56bn to HKDollars 3.22bn.
Property and financial stocks led the way down, with falls of 2.1 per cent
and 1.5 per cent respectively. Among active stocks, HSBC and Hutchison
Whampoa both dropped 50 cents, to HKDollars 92.50 and HKDollars 33.75.
AUSTRALIA followed New York down, but equities were also affected by a
softer Australian bond market as the All Ordinaries index closed 19.8 lower
at 2,095.0.
Turnover fell from ADollars 542m to ADollars 351m. Oil and gas stocks lost
17.6, or 2 per cent to 845.8, Ampolex falling 13 cents to ADollars 4.22 and
Woodside Petroleum 10 cents to ADollars 4.15.
NEW ZEALAND also fell on the Dow, the NZSE-40 index finished 21.94 lower at
2,123.55. KUALA LUMPUR featured a drop in volume from 268m to 111m shares as
the KLSE composite index shed 8.15, or 0.8 per cent to 1,021.30.
SEOUL tried to rise on hopes of a revision of a law allowing listed
companies to buy back their own equity. But it failed to follow through and
the composite index ended just 1.19 higher at 883.52.
JAKARTA managed to retain foreign buying interest and the JKSE index, which
hit a low for the year on Monday, recovered xxxxx to xxxxxxxxxx.
MANILA detached from Wall Street once again as the composite index advanced
63.79, or 2.4 per cent to 2,759.50 following Wednesday's 61-point gain,
turnover climbing from 795m to 1.15bn pesos.
Overnight, PLDT had risen for the second straight day in good volume in New
York, in spite of the fall in the Dow, closing 75 cents higher at Dollars
60.75 following its Dollars 1 gain on Tuesday.

FT  15 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank rate cuts fails to
give bourses a lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpected cut in discount rate from the Bundesbank did battle yesterday
with falling bond prices in Europe and the US, and the bond prices won,
writes Our Markets Staff.
Mr Joe Rooney, European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London, said
that the cuts were too little, and came too late to help bourses which saw
them, responded momentarily and then waited for New York to open.
Sentiment was then shaken by a story that Iraq had shot down two US
helicopters; the later news that they might have been shot down, by mistake,
by US fighters did little to improve matters.
However, said Mr Rooney, Lehman was still happier about bourse prospects
than it was at the turn of the year: 'A number of risks,' he said, 'have
been removed.'
Long bond yields have risen, he said, but faster than the brokers expected;
Lehman now expects them to decouple from their US counterparts, helped by
falling inflation in countries like Germany. Further, cross-border selling
of European equities this year suggests that many of the aggressive
positions taken at the end of last year have been unwound.
FRANKFURT's Dax index, weak ahead of the Buba news, recovered a token 4
points on the interest rate cuts and then lost them again. The lead
indicator closed the session 10.48 down at 2,198.71, and ended the afternoon
a mere fraction lower again, at 2,198.24.
German bunds reported profit-taking after the Buba cuts, and were hit by
falling US treasuries when the Iraq helicopter story appeared. Equities,
said traders, had no option but to follow suit.
Turnover rose from DM8.3bn to DM9.5bn. Banks were preoccupied once again
with the potential collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property empire, and the
repercussions on their loan loss ratios.
Deutsche Bank, said to be the biggest lender to the company, fell another
DM12.70 to DM782.80; yet Commerzbank, thought to have relatively little
exposure, dropped proportionately more, by DM7.50 to DM353. The sector as a
whole was weak, and construction stocks also seemed affected with Bilfinger
&amp; Berger down DM26 at DM859, and Holzmann DM35 lower at DM920.
Elsewhere, interest continued in special situations, with PWA up another DM7
to DM240, Kugelfischer by DM8 more to DM279 and Mannesmann and Thyssen, on
their diversification into the telephone business, by DM8.50 to DM460.50,
and DM4.50 to DM289 respectively.
PARIS slipped back after the German news; the market had already discounted
a cut, and had been hoping for somewhat more than was announced. The CAC-40
index saw a session low of 2,123.70, before closing off 13.31 to 2,139.05.
Taking a broader view Mr Andrew Shepherd-Barron of Kleinwort Benson in
London reiterated that his house had gone underweight in France at the
beginning of the month. One of the pressures on the market, he added was the
recent flow of convertible bonds, rights issues and placings which had been
taking money away from equities.
However, he maintained a positive outlook over the longer term, as corporate
earnings improved in line with the healthier economic picture.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez improved FFr8 to FFr573 after announcing a
satisfactory set of 1993 results, and a FFr1 rise in the dividend to FFr11.
AMSTERDAM concentrated on international stocks as the AEX index slipped 0.39
to 423.69, up from a session low of 420.72.
Internatio-Mueller, the transport and trading group, pleased the market with
1993 results and its forecast of a further improvement in the current year
and the shares put on Fl 5.50 to Fl 87.00.
One of the day's biggest rises was seen in Hagemeyer, the international
trading group, whose major shareholder is First Pacific of Hong Kong. The
shares gained Fl 7.20 to Fl 147, but traders said volume was thin.
ZURICH was unimpressed by its own, larger than expected, 50 basis point cut
in the discount rate to 3.50 per cent and the SMI index fell 34.0 to
2,843.7, near its low for the day.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Bank Sal Oppenheim said that the subdued response
to the rate cut was a further indication that Zurich had failed to decouple
from US trends.
At home, said Mr Hasslauer, investors were waiting for next Tuesday's 1993
results from Roche, which has held up better than most during the recent
correction. While few doubted that the figures would be good, there were
worries that investors might decide that the time has arrived to sell into
strength and switch into Germany. Roche certificates fell SFr90 to SFr7,045.
Among cyclicals, Sulzer fell SFr20 to SFr1,045 in spite of the group's
announcement that it expects increased profits in the current year.
MILAN resumed its advance as huge demand from individual domestic investors
swelled turnover to a record L2,206bn, adding to the capacity problems of
the bourse's already pressured electronic trading system. The Comit index
eased 1.64 to 787.12, although the real time Mibtel index registered a gain
over the session of 1.6 per cent.
Fiat propelled the market higher, rising L197 or 3.1 per cent to L6,500 amid
continuing speculation that the group plans a big asset sale or some other
corporate development. A L134 or 5.1 per cent rise to L2,787 by Cir was
attributed to the stock's recent underperformance. Olivetti added L118 or
4.3 per cent to L2,880.
MADRID added non-resident selling and the threat of political scandal to
broader concerns, and the general index fell 3.65 to 321.64. Mr Mariano
Rubio appears before congress today to answer questions concerning his
personal financial dealings while he governed the Bank of Spain.
WARSAW fell 6.7 per cent, but this was better than many analysts had been
expecting after the authorities suspended the 10 per cent price movement
limit on Tuesday for the following three sessions. The WIG index closed at a
provisional 9,980.4, as turnover tripled.
ISTANBUL rallied 6.5 per cent in heavy trade, adding to Wednesday's 2.6 per
cent gain. The composite index put on 1,344.86 to 22,104.32.

FT  15 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: German turnover picks up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Equity trading picked up in Europe during March as most market indices
continued their decline and the FT-A Europe index was marked 4.2 per cent
lower after its 4.4 per cent fall in February.
Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities says this suggests that selling
pressure increased once it became clear that there would be no early let-up
in the fall of US Treasury bond prices, which remains the main bearish
influence.
Mr Cornish notes the clear involvement of international investors,
demonstrated by a 16.2 per cent rise in the volume of European stocks traded
on Seaq International, the London screen based system, as a proportion of
turnover in continental domestic markets. Seaq trading accounted for 16.1
per cent in February and 15.2 per cent in January.
German turnover showed the largest gain in March, rising by a hefty 21.6 per
cent after February's 19.5 per cent decline as the Dax index went against
the general trend and registered a 1.2 per cent advance.
Hoare Govett notes that the major sectoral theme in March was the strength
of the cyclical sectors, particularly chemicals and motor manufacturers, at
the expense of financials. In the case of chemicals, outperformance of
almost 5 per cent had reflected generally encouraging earnings and dividends
statements and better prospects for 1994; for car-makers, investors
continued to anticipate a recovery, although there was little sign of one
yet.
Spain's 6.5 per cent rise in March turnover was in sharp contrast to the
market's worse than average 5.9 per cent fall. A 6.8 per cent rise in
average turnover for the previous three months suggested that selling
pressure was accelerating.
Amsterdam saw domestic turnover rise 3.4 per cent in March, and 7.5 per cent
over the average for the previous three months, as the market index fell 5.5
per cent. However, trading on Seaq International of Dutch shares surged 43
per cent, underlining the particular interest in London in Royal Dutch and
the other large international companies.
Separately, the Amsterdam stock exchange reported that total trading of
equities and bonds reached a new high of Fl 134.5bn in March, taking first
quarter turnover to Fl 356.1bn, up 43 per cent over the same 1993 period.
The exchange notes that the month saw a heavy flow of new share issues,
including those from Pakhoed, Pirelli and KLM, while the market was also
driven by a hefty calender of corporate results.
Milan turnover edged 1.6 per cent higher in March to another record after
the 46.7 per cent surge the previous month, making it the third most heavily
traded European market after Frankfurt and London for the second consecutive
month.
Kleinwort Benson notes that the market was surprisingly firm in the run up
to the elections, apparently acknowledging that a new government would be
forced to continue the economic policies of the previous administration,
whatever its political complexion. The telecom shares were a major driving
force ahead of the announcement of the restructuring plan for the sector and
strong domestic funds flows were also a significant factor.
Zurich and Paris were losers in March, but the sharpest decline was seen in
Brussels where turnover dipped by 12.5 per cent while the market itself
slipped by only 2.7 per cent.

FT  15 APR 94 / Markets Report: Buba cuts, dollar lags
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The surprise 25 basis point cut in official German interest rates yesterday
prompted a flurry of similar moves from other European countries, writes
Philip Gawith.
Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands all eased credit
policy after the Bundesbank council cut both the Lombard and Discount rates
by 25 basis points, to 6.5 per cent and 5 per cent respectively.
Market reaction to the move was unexpected: the dollar weakened, the D-Mark
strengthened, and euromark futures suggested greater pessimism about a fall
in German interest rates than before the rate-cut.
The dollar's weakness was especially surprising given that, earlier in the
day, there had been rumours of the Bundesbank buying dollars to bolster the
US currency against the yen. Two US helicopters being shot down in Iraq
would also normally have lent support to the dollar.
Later rumours that the Bundesbank was selling dollars for D-Mark dampened
any further remnant of positive sentiment towards the US currency.
Dollar/yen provided an early focus of attention with the Bundesbank said to
be buying dollars heavily on behalf of the Bank of Japan (BOJ). The
resignation of prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa has bolstered the yen,
with the market believing that a political hiatus aggravates the US/Japan
trade dispute.
The dollar closed in London at Y104.080 after opening at Y103.15. There were
also rumours of other central banks buying dollars.
Mr David Barrett, proprietary trader at Natwest Markets, said he believed
the BOJ had wanted to teach the market - which had very short dollar, long
yen positions - a lesson. He said Japanese exporters and car manufacturers
had been selling into rallies as they were very worried that the dollar was
not rising.
Analysts were bemused by yesterday's Bundesbank cut. No fresh data
supportive of a cut has appeared since its last meeting. Most observers had
expected a move on official rates at the next meeting.
The bemusement among analysts was matched by the indifferent response of the
market. The dollar closed at DM1.7088, down from DM1.7135. The D-Mark was
stronger across the board in Europe. It closed at FFr3.420 against the
French franc from FFr3.419. The peseta weakened to Pta81.30 from Pta81.01.
In the futures markets, meanwhile, there was a very mixed response to what
should have been seen as good news.
The June euromark contract finished three basis points higher at 94.63, but
the longer contracts lost ground. The June 1995 contract, for example,
finished at 94.91, four basis points lower than its opening.
Two rationalisations were offered for market pessimism. First, the scale of
the cuts - 25 basis points, when 50 is more common - led some to believe
that Germany was at, or near, the bottom of the interest rate cycle. Concern
was also expressed that the Bundesbank continued to cut rates when an
indicator it attaches great importance to - M3 money supply growth - is
growing far beyond its target range.
Few analysts believe German rates have bottomed. Ms Alison Cottrell,
international economist at Midland Global Markets, comments: 'To begin to
call the bottom of the German interest rate cycle already is a sure way to
lose money.' Midland, and others, are looking for the discount rate to fall
to 4 per cent by the end of the year, with a low of about 3.5 per cent some
time later.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe)
commented: 'The Bundesbank is clearly expressing continued concern over the
poor performance of the bond market and that appears to outweigh its genuine
discomfort over M3 growth.'
Analysts believe the decline in official rates will encourage a fall in the
repo rate, used by the Bundesbank to set the level of money market rates.
The repo was cut by 3 basis points to 5.70 per cent on Wednesday. The market
is expecting a repo rate fall of 10-15 basis points next week.
Call money rates fell ahead of the council meeting to 5.60 per cent/5.70 per
cent from 5.65/5.75 per cent.
Sterling was fairly steady yesterday, with events elsewhere drawing
attention away from a good set of trade figures and Wednesday's announcement
of a new openness in the conduct of monetary policy.
The pound closed at DM2.5239 against the D-Mark from DM2.5275. Against the
dollar, it firmed to Dollars 1.4771 from Dollars 1.4751.
The Bank of England is not expected to follow the Bundesbank's lead with
rates. Although analysts anticipate a further cut in UK rates, it is not
expected until there is more supportive data, and evidence of the effect of
higher taxes on the economy.
In the money markets the Bank of England injected Pounds 552m liquidity into
the market against a Pounds 550m shortage.
In the futures market, the June short sterling contract finished three basis
points firmer at 94.64. The longer contracts, however, lost ground.

</HEADLINE>

Current low oil prices should not lead to an energy crisis, despite concerns
that they could discourage oilfield development or create bitter feelings
among producer nations, the chief of the International Energy Agency said
here yesterday, reports Reuter from Kyoto.
Ms Helga Steeg, IEA executive director, in Japan to attend an IEA board
meeting, suggested that serious energy shortages could be averted if
consuming and producing countries created a co-operative environment.
She said the agency had held many talks with producer nations and oil
companies since the Gulf War to discuss the long-term outlook as well as the
investment climate, and: 'Oil companies have said prices are an important
element but not the only element (in deciding development projects)'.
Ms Steeg added that producing countries, most of which were still
economically in the development stage, needed western world funds and
technology and were interested in co-operating with consumer nations.
One IEA idea was to create a two-way investment flow, in which western oil
companies invested in upstream sectors in producing countries and producers
invested in downstream sectors - such as petrol stations - in consumer
nations, she explained.
That would enable the producing countries to 'see with their own eyes and
experience what the problems are.'

FT  15 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver's bull run written off
as hedge funds sell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'audacious' foray into the silver market by the US hedge funds is coming
to an end, according to Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch
financial services group.
The weight of physical selling of silver following its price rise and a fall
in demand in India, the biggest market for the metal, 'suggests that Dollars
6 to Dollars 6.50 (a troy ounce) silver are unattainable levels unless the
funds want to throw huge resources into the market.'
Recent evidence suggests the funds are doing the opposite and starting to
realise their profits, says Mr Arnold in Merrill's Weekly Futures Report.
He suggests the funds' physical silver holdings, built up over the past six
months, are probably in their books at an average of about Dollars 4.80 to
Dollars 4.90 an ounce compared with the average spot price for the period of
Dollars 4.95. Last night silver closed in London up 1 cent at Dollars 5.29
1/2 .
Mr Arnold points out that the average London spot price in 1993 was Dollars
4.29 after Dollars 3.94 in 1992. So many producers, smelters and
stockholders perceive Dollars 5.50 an ounce to be a high price and try to
sell when the price rallies above Dollars 5.50.
'Meanwhile, in Europe physical silver continues to flow into vaults from the
Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East and, to a lesser extent,
from Asia.'
Mr Arnold said last night that 'a large nail in the silver bull's coffin'
was the revelation by Bankers Trust last Friday that it had moved all but 1m
ounces of its silver from New York Commodity Exchange warehouses to vaults
at Chase Manhattan Bank. Four months ago Bankers Trust had more than 25m
ounces of silver in Comex warehouses and since then total Comex stocks have
fallen by about 35m ounces. Some traders cited the fall in Comex stocks as a
factor in silver's rally in recent months to a 4 1/2-year peak.

FT  15 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers silent on rubber pact
stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rubber producers at the United Nations-sponsored negotiations here on a new
international accord were yesterday still refusing to outline their position
publicly, reports Reuter from Geneva. And with just one more day to go to
wrap up the 10-day 28-nation conference, observers were suggesting that
might result in delegates having to return home empty-handed.
'It's difficult to say, we're still in discussion. . . I have no details
yet,' said the rubber exporters' spokesperson Ms Rosediana Suharto, director
of the Indonesian Export Training Centre at the country's Department of
Trade.
But experienced negotiators were not entirely negative.
'Just because the producers are not talking doesn't mean they might not try
to strike a last-minute deal in informal discussions,' an official close to
the conference secretariat said.
'If they appear to be agreeing now, they might give away some bargaining
power later on today.' And an African producer delegate said: 'There are not
many disagreements within the producers' group, it's going better than the
cocoa talks'.
But a producer delegate from one of the top three Asian growers was less
hopeful. 'We haven't narrowed it down enough,' he said.
'If we don't get something to deal on by tonight, the talks will have
failed,' European Union representative Mr Derek Taylor said. But he knew of
a number of private consultations later on.
Success or failure depended on just a few articles within the envisaged
treaty, officials said. The two sides still differed on the reference price,
the price range to be defended by buffer stock operations and how to review
and revise the price.

Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London OIL futures yesterday hit 1994 peaks in a rally sparked mostly by
tighter North Sea supplies and brisk demand. At the International Petroleum
Exchange May delivery Brent Blend traded up to Dollars 15.15 a barrel, the
highest for a prompt contract since November 24 and the first time it had
topped Dollars 15 since February 3.
COFFEE prices remained weak throughout the day at the London Commodity
Exchange, the second month ending at the day's lows in an expected
correction following recent strong gains.
London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices broke lower but just about managed to
hold above a Dollars 1,305 a tonne for three months delivery as Chinese
interest continued to appear on price dips. The price closed at Dollars
1,308 a tonne, down Dollars 8 on the day.
NICKEL prices bounced smartly in the afternoon, with the market capitalising
on good downside support below Dollars 5,600 a tonne, virtually to erase
early losses.
LEAD prices collapsed during the after hours 'kerb' session, with stop-loss
selling orders triggered below Dollars 460 a tonne, following Wednesday's
failure above Dollars 470.

Prices in Australia moved strongly ahead at the first sale to be held since
the Easter recess, at Sydney on April 12, but since then the market has been
steady and firm but not significantly dearer. The market indicator closed at
567 cents, 9 cents higher than at the closing sale before Easter. Prices
paid for other wool in New Zealand moved from firm to slightly dearer at
post-Easter sales, and South Africa this week was appreciably dearer in rand
terms, though a good deal less so if softness in the rand is taken into
account. Business in the wool-using industry is almost invariably said to be
quiet, with few new orders placed and considerable price resistance. Wool's
dearer trend this year is nevertheless not in doubt, even if progress is
slow

FT  15 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank move sparks bout of volatile
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank cut its key interest rates by 25 basis points yesterday,
taking the European government bond markets completely by surprise and
sparking a bout of volatile trading in the bund market.
Despite the unexpected good news, some of the European bond markets ended
lower as other factors, such as worries about US inflation and the shooting
down of two US helicopter over Iraq, gave the markets an excuse to trade
lower.
The Bundesbank cut the discount rate to 5.00 per cent and the Lombard rate
to 6.50 per cent. The moves triggered cuts by other European central banks -
in Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium - and led to
expectations of easings in Italy and France.
At a press conference yesterday, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's
president, stressed that money supply M3 remained the main target for the
German central bank. He said he expected west German inflation to fall below
3 per cent in the second half of 1994, adding that the Bundesbank could not
risk triggering inflationary expectations by cutting interest rates too
quickly.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said the interest rate cuts
from the Bundesbank would support government efforts to spur economic
growth.
The bund market had a choppy day despite the good news. The bund contract
opened at 96.80 and traded up to 96.97 ahead of the rate cuts. Having
drifted down, the futures contract bounced on the rate news and then fell
again, touching a low of 96.45. The contract picked up later in the day to
close little changed at 96.83.
Analysts expressed surprise at the bund market's rocky reaction to the good
news. 'The fact the markets fell after the news shows we are still in a bear
market, when 25 basis points off both rates is still not enough to get a
rally,' said Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international strategist at Midland
Global Markets.
UK gilts drifted lower in the morning, then picked up and closed slightly
higher on the day, taking their cue from the Bundesbank.
The market will be focusing on today's inflation data for March, as well as
on the possibility of a gilt auction announcement.
Disappointing inflation figures triggered a fall in Spanish government bond
prices yesterday morning, but the market later recovered and closed up on
the day helped by the Bundesbank's rate cuts. The Consumer Price Index was
up 0.3 per cent in March from February, leaving the year-to-year rate
unchanged at 5.0 per cent.
US Treasury bond prices receded in thin trading yesterday as the market
cautiously awaited today's release of two important economic reports.
Late in the day, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 lower at 87
7/16 , with the yield rising to 7.29 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was off  1/16 at 99 13/32 , to yield 5.44 per cent.
Early in the session, bonds across the maturity range dropped sharply on
reports of the shooting down of two US helicopters in Iraq by hostile fire
but recovered on news that they had been downed accidentally by US forces.
The day's only economic news - a weekly gain of 12,000 in claims for
unemployment benefit - was shrugged off, even though analysts were expecting
a slight decline. Attention instead was focused on today's data on
industrial production and capacity utilisation, which economists view as
leading indicators of inflation, the bane of fixed-rate investments.
Anticipation of the figures kept many investors on the sidelines. Traders
said some of the early activity had been triggered by trading in the
mortgage-backed securities market, where a big sale forced the liquidation
of five and 10-year government notes.
Japanese government bond futures rallied in the London trading session as
the yen strengthened against the US dollar. The move prompted the Bundesbank
to intervene, selling yen and buying dollars.
In Tokyo trading, the market had a relatively uneventful day, opening on a
strong note with the June futures contract at 111.79, and drifting lower to
111.44 in the course of the day.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Liffe narrows gap with CME in
futures rankings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Adjusted volume figures released by the Futures Industry Association, the US
industry group, show London's Liffe is in a tight race for second place in
the rankings of the world's futures exchanges.
Liffe has run a healthy third in recent years behind the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, and its rate of growth consistently
exceeds that of the two Chicago bodies.
However, second-placed CME muddied the volume rankings this year by revising
its counting method, adding options exercises and expirations, mutual offset
trades and other off-floor activities that its competitors say inflate
volume.
In response to an industry outcry, the FIA has begun releasing adjusted data
for the CME, using the exchange's old method of counting turnover.
The FIA reports CME first-quarter volume at 50.2m contracts, as opposed to
the CME's own counting of 54.7m. For March, the FIA data puts the CME at
19.5m contracts, compared with the exchange's report of 22.1m.
By comparison, Liffe's first-quarter turnover was 47.5m contracts, and for
March it was 17.0m. Liffe's volume was up 115 per cent from the first
quarter of 1993, while the CME's gained about 35 per cent.
The CBoT remains firmly in first place with first-quarter volume of 58m
contracts.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Non-recourse loan facility
for BSkyB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a move which reflects its stronger financial position, British Sky
Broadcasting (BSkyB), the UK-based satellite television venture, said
yesterday that it is raising Pounds 500m of non-recourse bank finance which
will enable it to repay loans from its shareholders.
The main shareholders of BSkyB, which has now moved into operating profit
but is still incurring large pre-tax losses, are News Corporation with 50
per cent, Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times, with 17.5 per cent, and
Granada with 13.5 per cent.
Part of the proceeds of the five-year revolving credit facility, which is
being arranged by Toronto-Dominion Bank and Citibank, will be used to repay
a Pounds 100m bank loan which was guaranteed equally by Pearson, Granada and
Chargeurs, the French transport and communication group which has also put
money into the venture.
The money will also be used to repay securities held directly by Pearson and
Granada and to release certain contingent liabilities.
The payments to shareholders will be in addition to the Pounds 100m they
have received since December from cash generated by BSkyB's operations.
Terms of the facility were not disclosed but bankers involved in the deal
said that such a transaction reflected BSkyB's healthier finances.
'Just one year ago, banks would not have considered taking part in such a
facility,' said one banker.
The two arranging banks are underwriting Pounds 250m of the amount and the
remainder will be syndicated among other banks.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Bonds: Marked pick-up in issuance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond market saw a marked pick-up in issuance in a range of
currencies as sentiment was lifted by the Bundesbank's latest monetary
easing.
The Council of Europe launched its long-awaited Ecu300m of 10-year bonds,
which are due to be priced today to yield between three and five basis
points over the 6 per cent 10-year Ecu OAT.
According to the lead manager, Swiss Bank Corporation, the deal is targeted
mainly at institutional investors, which have shown good demand for 10-year
Ecu paper.
In the dollar sector, the City of Prague launched its long-planned Dollars
250m of 7 3/4 per cent five-year bonds at a 120 basis point spread over
Treasuries. According to an official at lead manager Nomura International,
the bonds closed at 99.55 bid, below their 99.63 re-offer price, but the
spread remained steady at 120 basis points.
While some traders said they saw little demand for the triple-B-minus rated
bonds and felt they were tightly priced, others reported interest from
institutional investors seeking high-yielding paper with potential for
credit improvement.
Two dollar floaters also emerged: Dollars 500m of five-year notes for the
Province of Nova Scotia, paying a coupon of 0.1875 points above three-month
Libor, and Dollars 250m of three-year notes for Mexico's Banco Nacional de
Comercio Exterior (Bancomext), paying three-month Libor plus 0.75 points.
The latter met strong demand from selected east Asian accounts, according to
lead manager JP Morgan.
While Nova Scotia's bonds were deemed appropriately priced, traders felt
they would be slow to place due to the large size of the issue.
However, lead manager UBS, which took Dollars 380m of the deal itself, said
it felt a smaller issue might have put the deal's liquidity into question.
The budding Greek drachma sector saw another two new deals: Dr10bn of 15 1/4
per cent Marathon bonds for the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, and Dr10bn of 15 3/4 per cent Eurobonds for Abbey National
Treasury Services. Heavy recent supply has some traders grumbling that the
sector is fast becoming saturated.
Supranational Marathon bonds are exempt from Greek withholding tax to
resident and non-resident investors while Eurodrachma non-supranational
bonds are tax-free only for foreigners. Because of this, as well as credit
considerations, they pay a significant yield premium over their
supranational counterparts.
'European investors feel safer with Marathon bonds,' said one trader. 'If
the Greek market sours, there will be a backstop bid for these bonds from
Greek investors because they're tax-free,' he said. The EBRD bonds ended
around 100 bid, inside fees, while the Abbey National bonds ended at 99 1/4
bid, at full fees.
Following the Bundesbank's rate cuts, traders in the D-Mark sector are
confident that some of the rumoured deals for L-Bank, KfW, Belgium, the
World Bank, Karstadt and several Japanese borrowers will start emerging
soon. Syndicate sources expect L-Bank to issue DM3bn of five-year global
bonds early next week.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Cragnotti to take control of IRI
unit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital Investment, the fast-growing Italian financial
and industrial group, yesterday took control of Cirio Bertolli De Rica
(CBD), the Italian foods company, and prepared to bid for the rest of the
group.
The complex deal, if approved by IRI, the state holding company which owned
CBD, values the canned vegetable, edible oils and milk company at about
L500bn (Dollars 306m). However, Mr Cragnotti has pledged to retain CBD's
listing on the Milan stock exchange.
Yesterday's announcement should end a long period of speculation about CBD's
future, beginning last year when IRI first tried and failed to find a buyer
for the company, part of its large SME subsidiary, which is being
privatised.
IRI eventually sold control of CBD to Fisvi, a farm co-operative from
Apulia, which had to ask Cragnotti to help it with the acquisition through a
jointly-owned company.
Cragnotti yesterday bought out Fisvi's half of the joint venture, thus
raising its direct stake in CBD to 62 per cent.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: AEG plans further reshape as
deficit reaches DM1.2bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AEG, the electrical engineering division of Daimler-Benz, reported 1993 net
losses of DM1.2bn (Dollars 700m), against a profit of DM10m in 1992, and Mr
Georg Stockl, the chief executive, predicted that the company would not
break even until 1995.
Turnover fell by 3 per cent to DM11bn and operating losses totalled DM500m,
compared with DM200m last time.
The company said it had set aside a further DM600m for more restructuring
and is to spend about DM150m on an additional 7,000 redundancies. The
workforce fell by 3 per cent to 58,921 last year.
Mr Stockl said demand in Germany, the company's most important market, had
continued to fall but orders in the first two months of 1993 were 68 per
cent higher than the year before, due largely to an order from the German
Railways for the updated high-speed InterCityExpress II.
None of the company's five divisions made a profit last year. The
microelectronics, railway technology and automation divisions suffered the
heaviest losses. The company said it hoped to merge its auto electronics
unit with another manufacturer.
AEG said it was about to complete the sale of its household appliance
division, which employs 9,000 people, to Electrolux, the Swedish group. The
European Union is expected to rule this year on whether the sale meets
competition requirements, the company said.
The Frankfurt-based company is to be further integrated into Daimler-Benz,
Germany's largest industrial concern. It will take over the diesel engine
operations of the Motoren-und Turbinen-Union, another Daimler subsidiary,
and will be known as AEG Daimler Benz Industrie.
There will be further restructuring until the company is left with 50,000
employees. Most of the redundancies will be in the railway technology
division, the company said.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Frank Biondi, chief executive of Viacom, the US cable television group,
said the company's planned merger with Blockbuster Entertainment would be
difficult to close due to current stock market prices, Reuter reports.
Despite the uncertainty of the ability to complete the proposed merger, Mr
Biondi said Viacom remained happy with its acquisition of Paramount
Communications.
Although the merger with Blockbuster would provide additional financing for
the deal, Mr Biondi said Viacom was capable of handling the Paramount
acquisition on its own.
Viacom could raise additional funding through the sale of assets if the
Blockbuster merger were not completed, Mr Biondi said.
'If in fact Blockbuster is not going to happen, we've had the luxury of
having a lot of inquiries about a lot of assets,' Mr Biondi said.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: US insurer to sell two
businesses in shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Corporation, the 12th largest property/casualty insurer in the
US, yesterday announced a restructuring of several business units, involving
a Dollars 45m pre-tax charge, and said it planned to sell two businesses:
Continental Canada and Casualty Insurance.
It expects to record a gain on the disposals. Mr John Mascotte, chairman,
said it was an opportune time to sell these 'highly-marketable, successful
and autonomous operations'.
The sales and restructuring would improve customer service and give
additional capital for growth in strategic businesses.
Continental Canada is the third largest writer of business insurance in
Canada and concentrates mostly on mid-sized companies. It wrote Dollars 333m
in premium last year and employed 740.
Casualty Insurance is the leading workers' compensation insurer in Illinois.
It wrote Dollars 362m in premium last year and employed 320.
Continental's reorganisation centres on the field claims operation of its
agency and brokerage division, which represents two thirds of its insurance
writings. The aim is to put more claims adjusters on the road and
consolidate back-office functions.
This, together with other restructuring moves, will cut 680 jobs from the
group's 12,255 workforce.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: IBM to produce Intel chip clones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines has agreed to manufacture clones of Intel's
microprocessor chips designed by Cyrix, a Texas semiconductor company. The
agreement poses a significant challenge to Intel, the dominant supplier of
microprocessors to the personal computer industry.
IBM will manufacture Cyrix's equivalent of Intel's 486 and Pentium
microprocessors in 'non-trivial quantities', the companies said. As well as
supplying these chips to Cyrix, under the five-year deal IBM will also sell
about half of the chips, either to its own personal computer operations or
to outside customers.
'IBM is committed to becoming a major supplier of semiconductor products,'
said Mr Michael Attardo, IBM senior vice-president and general manager of
IBM's micro-electronics division. IBM's semiconductor sales were about
Dollars 700m last year, up from just Dollars 5m a few years ago.
However, Intel, which has vigorously defended its intellectual property
rights in the courts, said its legal department was examining the IBM-Cyrix
announcement.
IBM and Intel have been technology partners since the introduction 13 years
ago of IBM's first PC. This relationship, the foundation of Intel's growth
into the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, is expected to be
strained by the Cyrix accord.
Intel seems, however, to be reluctant to engage in a legal battle with IBM,
its largest customer. All IBM PCs contain microprocessors designed by Intel,
and either purchased from Intel or manufactured by IBM under a long-standing
arrangement.
Intel holds at least an 80 per cent share of the market for PC
microprocessors, according to market analysts, while Cyrix has a share of
less than 3 per cent. The agreement with IBM will significantly expand
Cyrix's opportunity to participate in the market, said Mr Jerry Rogers,
president and chief executive of Cyrix.
IBM and Cyrix declined to comment on the possibility of legal disputes with
Intel. However, Intel and Cyrix are already involved in litigation over
patent rights. A decision in that case, which could affect Cyrix's and IBM's
plans, is expected in a few months.
Intel yesterday disputed whether the patent licences it had granted to IBM
could be applied to the Cyrix-designed chips. 'We do not believe that IBM
can provide patent protection to Cyrix, and we are still examining the
question of whether IBM has rights to market the chips,' Intel said.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Aga to spin off Frigoscandia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group, yesterday announced plans to spin off
Frigoscandia, the world's leading cold storage chain, and obtain a separate
listing for the company.
The move is in line with Aga's long-term strategy of concentrating on
industrial and medical gases.
Shares in Frigoscandia will be distributed to Aga shareholders in line with
their existing holdings. Each Aga A and B share qualifies for a similar
share in Frigoscandia, which will be listed on the Stockholm stock exchange
in June.
Frigoscandia had an operating income of SKr275m (Dollars 34.7m) on sales of
SKr4.7bn last year. The main part of its business is cold storage, transport
and food processing, but 25 per cent of turnover derives from sales of large
industrial freezers, where it has a 50 per cent world market share.
Frigoscandia's income after financial items this year is expected to equal
last year's pro-forma earnings of SKr204m. The freezer manufacturing
operation will benefit from the lower value of the krona, but the benefit
will be offset by EU plans to reduce meat and butter mountains, which will
lower the demand for storage.
Aga bought Frigoscandia in 1978. It said Frigoscandia had enjoyed
considerable autonomy since that time, but added that a listing would
increase the unit's financial freedom of action.
Aga is one of the world's leading industrial gas companies, with 1993 gas
sales of SKr11.4bn. After the demerger, the group's only big involvement
apart from gas will be a 34 per cent stake in the power company, Gullspangs
Kraft, which it does not plan to sell.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Restated results show losses at
Woolworth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Woolworth, the US-based retailer, has restated its financial results for all
four quarters of the year ending January 29 1994, and confirmed that profits
reported for the first two quarters had been illusory.
Last year, Woolworth reported it had scraped into profits of Dollars 1m for
the first quarter and Dollars 2m for the second.
This week's restated figures show, however, that the company actually made
losses of Dollars 24m and Dollars 10m in the first and second quarters
respectively.
Woolworth said it was not yet ready to explain the errors.
A special committee of the board of directors was investigating the events
that had made the restatement necessary, it said.
However, the fact that the first two quarters' profits have turned into
losses is likely to reconfirm suspicions that costs which should properly
have been taken in the first two quarters were deferred until later in the
year, in a misguided attempt to keep the company out of the red.
Woolworth had warned at the end of last month that its quarterly figures
would have to be restated. A few days later, it announced that Mr William
Lavin, chairman and chief executive, and Mr Charles Young, chief financial
officer, were temporarily stepping aside while an investigation was carried
out.
On Tuesday the company announced that its full-year figures for last year
would stay the same, but that the quarterly breakdown had been changed 'to
reflect a correction of gross margins and certain selling, general and
administrative expenses'.
It also brought forward to the third quarter the reversal of a Dollars 145m
repositioning reserve that had been taken in the fourth quarter.
Significantly, the board also reconfirmed the fourth-quarter dividend of 29
cents per share on the common stock, bringing comfort to the company's
institutional shareholders, who hold the shares mainly as a yield stock.
Mr John Adams, interim chairman and chief executive, said that the
announcement concluded the part of the inquiry relating to the financial
results, and should put to rest any concerns about the company's financial
position.

HJ Heinz, the US grocery products group, revealed it was in talks with
Borden, the US food and wallpaper group. However, Heinz refused to confirm
reports it was buying the bulk of its food-services division.
Borden also declined to comment. The sale of its food business, which
generated Dollars 270m in revenues last year, would represent the first
divestment since the troubled group announced a far-reaching restructuring
earlier this year.
The company is seeking to concentrate on its most profitable lines,
including pasta sauces and several niche grocery products. After posting a
net loss of Dollars 593.6m last year, it said it would sell more than
Dollars 1.25bn in assets, including its salty snacks and seafood businesses,
which generated nearly 20 per cent of its 1993 revenues.
For Heinz, the Borden food services division would make a logical fit with
its own core business, which supplies individual plastic pouches of
mayonnaise, ketchup and other condiments to restaurants, schools and
hospitals.

the most widely-used system for accessing information about Hong Kong
companies. This paper-based product is updated regularly.
The new product, Wardley Extel Workstation, will provide information on all
listed companies in Hong Kong, as well as in Singapore, Malaysia and
Thailand. Indonesia would soon be added. All data is updated weekly on a
fresh disc.
The workstation runs on any IBM-compatible personal computer. Extel and
Wardley said it provided a powerful data search and retrieval capability.
They said the service, offering information about more than 10,000 listed
companies, would be the most extensive corporate data package in Hong Kong.
Extel will gain access to Wardley's customer base of between 300 and 400
users. It expects the hard-copy service will be phased out within three or
four years.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais confident on
capital adequacy ratio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ALICE RAWSTHORN

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state-owned French bank, should achieve a
capital adequacy ratio comfortably in excess of the minimum international
standards before it is privatised, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, president, said
yesterday.
Mr Peyrelevade, speaking to analysts in London, said he believed Credit
Lyonnais would raise its current tier 1 ratio of core capital to
risk-weighted assets to about 6 per cent, compared with the current figure
of 4.4 per cent.
He said he hoped the bank would be able to negotiate share swaps with the
government to reduce equity holdings, such as its 20 per cent stake in
Usinor-Sacilor, the steel maker.
Mr Peyrelevade said he believed the bank should have stakes of no more than
between 5 and 10 per cent in companies to improve the spread of its
portfolio, and to give it greater liquidity and flexibility in selling
equity.
He said he would accept a price of Dollars 2.5bn for MGM, the Hollywood
studio owned by the bank, if such an offer was made 'today'. However, the
price could rise by spring 1996, which was when he expected to be selling
MGM.
Mr Peyrelevade said the bank should achieve a 6 per cent tier 1 ratio -
above the 4 per cent minimum in the Basle accord, but increasingly viewed as
a comfort level by ratings agencies - by raising fresh capital and
constraining asset growth.
The government is participating in a FFr44.9bn (Dollars 7.6bn) rescue of
Credit Lyonnais, after the bank reported a FFr6.9bn net loss for 1993. Mr
Peyrelevade was appointed five months ago to succeed Mr Jean-Yves Haberer at
the head of the bank.
As part of the rescue, the government and other public sector shareholders
will subscribe to the rights issue next month.
The bank hopes to follow this with a rights issue of matching size for other
shareholders later this year.
Mr Peyrelevade said he hoped to raise the tier 1 ratio by 0.5 percentage
points a year until the target was reached. He was still working on plans to
increase banking income while holding assets steady.
Mr Dominique Bazy, who is heading the sale of industrial assets, said FFr3bn
in disposals had been agreed, and he was confident that FFr10bn would be
sold this year. The bank has set a target of selling FFr20bn of its FFr55bn
portfolio.
The bank's unions plan to stage a day of action today against Mr
Peyrelevade's plans to accelerate the group's return to profit through
cost-cutting. The chairman last month unveiled proposals to shed 3,800 jobs
over three years.
Mr Peyrelevade said yesterday he expected Credit Lyonnais' staff to accept
the proposed cuts. The bank's four unions plan to mount a demonstration
against the plan today.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Rubbermaid growth evaporates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rubbermaid, the US household goods group named 'America's most admired
company' by Forbes magazine at the beginning of the year, yesterday reported
a sharp downturn in first-quarter profits growth.
Net income rose by barely 2 per cent from Dollars 49.6m in the comparable
period to Dollars 50.6m. Turnover was up by 2 per cent to Dollars 491.6m and
earnings per share rose from 31 cents to 32 cents.
The company had earlier established a reputation for turning in big
increases in earnings from year to year. In the 10 years to 1992, earnings
growth averaged 18 per cent a year.
Mr Wolfgang Schmitt, chairman and chief executive, said the first quarter's
figures reflected particularly soft sales in January and February because of
unusually harsh weather conditions across the US. Bad weather also caused
temporary plant closures, so reducing plant efficiency.
In addition, Mr Schmitt said retailers' efforts to cut stocks in the quarter
held back the company's turnover growth even though store sales of
Rubbermaid's products were up.
'March orders, however, have shown substantial improvement, and that
improvement is continuing into April,' Mr Schmitt said. 'As a result, we
look for more favourable second-quarter sales and earnings comparisons.'

The company - 23 per cent has been sold on the Tel Aviv stock exchange and a

writes Jose Galang in Manila.
The company said sales improved by 11 per cent, but gave no figures.
The beer and food group attributed the improved financial performance to the
economic recovery in the Philippines which, it said, was 'well under way'.
It said it was allocating a capital budget of 12bn pesos for domestic and
overseas projects during the year. It is pursuing beer brewery projects in

BCE, the Canadian-based international telecommunications group, will report
a good first quarter during its annual meeting on April 27, said Mr Lynton
Wilson, chairman.
BCE, which recently completed the sale of Montreal Trust to the Bank of
Novia Scotia, will be profitable for all 1994, he added.
It will maintain the common share dividend at the current level.
The group plans to hold the 10m Bank of Novia Scotia shares it received for
Montreal Trust indefinitely, Mr Wilson added. They are now worth CDollars
275m (USDollars 199.2m).
BCE, which takes in the Bell Canada telephone utility and controls Northern
Telecom and other companies, has completed the disposal of virtually all its
non-core assets, including real estate.
It earned CDollars 1.3bn in 1992, but posted a final 1993 loss of CDollars
750m after special charges of CDollars 800m. Heavier long-distance
competition squeezed Bell Canada's profit.
Pennzoil of the US has counterbid CDollars 205m cash for all the shares of
Co-enerco, a restructured western Canada gas and oil company, sought earlier
by Numac Energy, of Calgary. The bid is higher than Numac's, and Pennzoil
would assume CDollars 104m in Co-enerco debt. Co-enerco has large
undeveloped natural gas reserves.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australian Mututal Provident Society, the large life insurance group and one
of the country's biggest institutional investors, said yesterday it had
after-tax operating earnings of ADollars 2.11bn (USDollars 1.5bn) in 1993.
This figure, however, included investment income of ADollars 7.35bn, of
which ADollars 5.12bn was derived from the net appreciation of investment
assets. The insurer attributed the rise largely to the strong performance of
the Australian stock market last year.
The figure only reflected AMP's Australian and New Zealand operations, and
excluded its sizeable interests in the UK, which include the Pearl and
London Life. The mutual insurer did not provide an earnings figure for the
group overall, but did say total premium income for the consolidated
business stood at ADollars 7.28bn last year, slightly below the 1992 figure
of ADollars 7.9bn. Total investment income surged to ADollars 13.7bn from
ADollars 4.33bn, again largely due to investment portfolio gains.
There was also a sharp rise in surrenders, policies which are prematurely
cashed in by policy-holders. These cost AMP ADollars 3.8bn overall last
year, up from ADollars 2.73bn in the previous 12 months.
There is much discussion over how life companies' profits should be reported
in Australia, and AMP acknowledged that its 1993 earnings figure would have
been significantly higher if it had adopted the basis used by some other
large Australian insurers.
AMP also made clear yesterday it had no intention of 'demutualising' - that
is, turning itself into a share-holder-owned company - despite the fact that
this has become an increasingly popular option for mutuals.

Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the French utilities, construction and

to FFr804m (Dollars 137.4m), in 1993 and expressed optimism about prospects
for the current year.
Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, said the worst of the economic recession was
over, and outlined 'considerable opportunities' in the public works and
utilities markets.
'In France, and in the European Union, infrastructure programmes, including
motorways, high speed trains and airports, will soon be launched', he said.
Mr Monod said the group's construction activities would be reinforced
through the merger between its Dumez and GTM-Entrepose subsidiaries.
The group is proposing a dividend of FFr16.50 for last year, compared with
FFr15 in 1992.

fall in income

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP Morgan, the New York banking group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent fall
in first-quarter net income, due mainly to a sharp drop in revenues from
trading in global financial markets, which turned sour two months ago.
The bank reported net income of Dollars 345m, or Dollars 1.69 a share,
compared with Dollars 432m, or Dollars 2.16, in the same period of last
year, excluding the effect of an accounting change.
The figures were broadly in line with Wall Street expectations of earnings
of Dollars 1.70 a share.
Revenues totalled Dollars 1.39bn, compared with Dollars 1.48bn, with net
interest revenue dipping to Dollars 397m from Dollars 432m. Excluding
receipts from Latin American companies restructuring their debt, net
interest revenue was up 5 per cent, which the bank said reflected improved
results from its European and Asian asset and liability management
activities.
Non-interest revenue dipped to Dollars 994m from Dollars 1.051bn. Trading
revenues were Dollars 356m - down 24 per cent on the Dollars 469m reported
in the first quarter of last year and 41 per cent lower than the record
Dollars 606m of 1993's final quarter - as the bank's positioning activities
were affected by difficult market conditions.
However, Morgan said that client-related trading activities had benefited
from strong demand for risk management products, particularly swaps and
other interest rate contracts, and for US fixed-income securities.
Corporate finance revenues totalled Dollars 117m, compared with Dollars
119m. Lower underwriting revenue of Dollars 45m was largely offset by
increased advisory fees.
Credit-related fees were up 4 per cent at Dollars 56m, investment management
fees rose 12 per cent to Dollars 127m, and operational services saw a 24 per
cent increase in revenues, to Dollars 144m, due to increased custody,
clearance and brokerage fees. Net investment securities gains totalled
Dollars 91m, down from Dollars 95m.
Other revenues totalled Dollars 103m, up from Dollars 85m, and included net
gains of Dollars 97m on sales from the bank's equity portfolio and Dollars
41m of hedging losses from the management of non-trading foreign currency
exposures.
Group operating expenses rose 5 per cent to Dollars 852m.

<TEXT>
Boise Cascade, the Idaho-based paper manufacturer and forest products
processor, blamed severe winter weather and higher costs incurred through
operating difficulties at some plants for deeper losses in the first
quarter. An expected rise in paper prices failed to materialise.
The net loss for the quarter of Dollars 37.6m, or Dollars 1.35 a share,
compared with a deficit of Dollars 12.1m, or 56 cents, a year earlier. The
first-quarter loss was also larger than the Dollars 23.7m, or 98 cents,
deficit Boise reported in the fourth quarter of last year.
First-quarter sales rose to Dollars 1bn from Dollars 984m a year ago.
Losses in the company's largest business segment, paper and paper products,
were Dollars 69.7m in the quarter, up from Dollars 43.5m in the first
quarter of 1993, due to higher operating costs and declining prices for
Boise's most important paper grades.
About 54 per cent of the company's paper sales last year comprised coated
and uncoated white papers. In the first quarter, the average price for these
grades fell more than 5 per cent from the fourth quarter of 1993, the
company said.
Average prices for newsprint and uncoated groundwood papers also declined,
while containerboard and market pulp prices rose in the quarter.
Mr Vincent Hannity, Boise Cascade spokesman, said the company's paper
segment results would not recover significantly until worldwide paper
consumption grew.
'With overseas economies weak, their paper consumption is less. This has
caused a sharp increase in white paper exports to the US at reduced prices,'
he said.
Income from the company's office products segment improved slightly in the
quarter, but income from its building products division declined sharply to
Dollars 35.0m, from Dollars 62.4m a year ago.
Constricted logging in the US north-west raised materials costs, while
winter storms muted construction across much of the US.

for year

<TEXT>
Axa, the second largest French insurer, yesterday announced a return to
profits growth last year with a 31.8 per cent increase in net profits to
FFr2.04bn (Dollars 340m) in 1993 from FFr1.55bn in 1992.
Mr Claude Bebear, chairman, said that the group was on course for further
growth this year.
In the early 1990s Axa was destabilised by the intensely competitive
condition of the French insurance industry and by the problems of The
Equitable, its US associate into which it injected Dollars 400m of new
capital last year.
Mr Bebear said the group benefited from an improvement in its core French
insurance business. Axa, like France's other large insurers, was able to
alleviate the pressure on profitability by raising tariffs.
The group was also buoyed by a recovery at The Equitable, a strong
performance from its reinsurance interests and by a reduction in the losses
of Axa Marine Aviation Transports, its transport subsidiary.
The board proposed raising the dividend to FFr25 in 1993 from FFr23 in 1992.
Axa's group turnover rose by 48.8 per cent to FFr126.28bn in 1993 from
FFr84.87bn in 1992.
Attributable profits from insurance also increased by 48 per cent to
FFr1.54bn from FFr1.04bn over the same period.
Reinsurance profits more than doubled to FFr172m from FFr69m. The
contribution from financial services and property fell to FFr717m from
FFr785m, in spite of the return to the black of Meeschaert Rousselle, the
group's stockbroking unit, which made a net profit of FFr33m against a
FFr20m loss in 1992.
Mr Bebear anticipated 'continued growth in Axa's profits for 1994 unless
there is an exceptional event'. He described the first quarter of the year
as 'very satisfying' for Axa in France.

<TEXT>
Air France, the state-owned airline, is expected to announce a loss of
between FFr8bn (Dollars 1.37bn) and FFr9bn for 1993, substantially higher
than previous estimates of a FFr7.5bn deficit, Mr Bernard Bosson, transport
minister, said yesterday.
Mr Bosson's estimate, made during a statement to the Senate, the upper house
of the French parliament, is the latest increase in losses forecast for the
airline.
Last September, Mr Bosson said the loss for 1993 would probably be about
FFr5.5bn. In 1992, Air France reported losses of FFr3.2bn.
The sharp increase in losses reflects the downturn in the international
airline industry. It also reflects the impact of industrial action last
October when the airline was brought to a standstill by a wave of strikes in
protest against a rescue plan. The strikes forced the withdrawal of the plan
and the resignation of Mr Bernard Attali, then chairman.
Air France declined to comment on last year's results ahead of an official
announcement which is expected later this month or at the beginning of May.
The airline has said that last October's strike cost FFr1.2bn in lost
receipts, but estimates of the overall impact of the dispute are complicated
by savings, such as fuel supplies, and additional costs relating to the
disruption of services.
The scale of the losses adds to the urgency of a restructuring package being
drawn up by Mr Christian Blanc, who replaced Mr Attali as chairman. On
Monday, Mr Blanc received strong support from the company's 40,000 staff for
a framework plan aimed at raising productivity by 30 per cent over the next
three years.
The French government has pledged a capital injection of FFr20bn over the
next three years to ease the burden of losses and total debts of about
FFr38bn.
However, the capital increase requires approval from the European Union.
Earlier this week, Mr Abel Matutes, the European transport commissioner,
indicated that approval for the financing could be linked to the sensitive
issue of deregulating the French airline market.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: L'Oreal bolsters position with
12.5% profits rise
</HEADLINE>

L'Oreal last year reinforced its position as the world's largest cosmetics
company with a 12.5 per cent increase in net profits to FFr2.59bn (Dollars
440m) from FFr2.3bn in 1992.
The group, which owns a range of beauty brands including Lancome cosmetics,
Giorgio Armani fragrances and Ambre Solaire sun products, succeeded in
maintaining profits growth despite the sluggish state of the international
cosmetics market.
The company described conditions last year as 'difficult' and said the
market was 'still depressed' this year. However, he added that L'Oreal had
increased its first-quarter sales by between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.
Consolidated sales rose by 6.9 per cent to FFr40.16bn in 1993 from
FFr37.57bn in 1992. Managed sales, including the contribution from Cosmair,
the North American marketing arm which is to be consolidated into L'Oreal's
accounts, rose by 9.2 per cent to FFr50.9bn from FFr46.6bn.
Operating profits increased by 12.9 per cent to FFr4.66bn from FFr4.13bn.
Earnings per share rose by 12.5 per cent to FFr44.42 from FFr39.50. The
board proposed an increase in the net dividend to FFr10.80 for 1993 from
FFr9.60 in 1992.

Sambre

The crisis in the European steel industry was highlighted again yesterday
when Cockerill Sambre, Belgium's largest steel maker, announced a loss of
BFr6.5bn (Dollars 184m) for 1993. This compares with a loss of BFr1.4bn the
previous year and a profit of BFr3.6bn in 1991.
The company, which had previously predicted a loss of between BFr4-BFr6bn,
blamed falling prices and sales for its poor results.
Sales in the group, whose core activity is the production of flat rolled
products normally used in the motor and construction industry, fell to
BFr147.4bn, down from BFr164.7bn the previous year. Meanwhile, financial
debt rose to BFr8bn, up from BFr4.6bn in 1992.
Cockerill Sambre insisted that conditions should improve next year - a hope
being echoed by most European steel makers who argue that the improvement in
the car manufacturing industry could start to boost steel prices as early as
the summer.
'The first half of 1994 saw a pick-up in steel industry activity and an
improvement in prices. This ought to lead to a notable recovery of earnings
by June,' the company said.
However, Mr Jean Gandois, chairman, warned that there would be no dividend
for 1993, insisting that he wanted to 'reserve all possibilities to
distribute a dividend on 1994 earnings'.
Coming hard on the heels of the steel industry's dispute with the European
Commission over its demands for further capacity cuts, the result seems to
raise more questions about government policy towards steel plants like
Cockerill Sambre, which is partly owned by the Belgian Walloon government.
Earlier this week the commission formally agreed to recommend that it would
delay its threat to withdraw aid until November to allow the industry more
time to develop restructuring plans.
But the delay is contingent on the European steel companies adhering to a
pledge that they will not ask for more aid. Commission officials privately
admit that the temporary agreement has done little to address the broader
problems of the steel sector.

Audi, the quality car division of Volkswagen, yesterday reported a 1993 loss
of DM89m (Dollars 52m) against a DM172m profit the previous year.
However, orders in the first quarter were up 23 per cent on the year before,
bolstering hopes that the company would break even again this year.
Mr Herbert Demel, who was appointed chief executive in February, said the
company hoped to raise its position in the market with a range of new
models, including the A6, the A8 and the RS2, which will be co-produced with
the sports car maker Porsche.
'We have very nearly overcome the trough of the current recession,' Mr Demel
said.
The Audi workforce agreed in March to work 10 per cent fewer hours, saving a
further 3,000 jobs which were due to go, the company said.
In the year ending March 31 the workforce at the company's two plants in
southern Germany had fallen 10.5 per cent to 32,353.
Audi said part of its losses was caused by 'our commitment to shedding jobs
in a socially acceptable manner'.
Production in 1993 fell 30.7 per cent to 340,956 cars while deliveries to
customers worldwide dropped 25.1 per cent to 354,158 units. The UK was the
only exception in a still depressed car market, the company said.
Production in the first quarter of 1994 rose 6 per cent to 80,473 units but
orders for the German market, where Audi's share dropped from 5.7 to 5.3 per
cent last year, were still down on last year, the company said.

debts

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kemira, the Finnish chemicals group, yesterday disclosed plans to raise up
to FM2bn (Dollars 362m) through an initial public offering, further
quickening the pace of the government's privatisation programme.
Shares in the fully state-owned group will be offered to international and
domestic institutions and the Finnish public, leaving as much as one-third
of the company in private hands.
Proceeds will be used to reduce the group's FM8bn debt. The company will
also gain a stock market listing.
The offering would be the biggest yet in the government's programme to widen
ownership of state companies. Two other big Finnish industrial groups,
Rautaruukki and Valmet, are also planning large international share issues
as part of the same process.
Kemira aims to launch its offer in the autumn, subject to financial
performance and market conditions. It has been encouraged to make the move
after returning to the black with a FM30m pre-tax profit last year, compared
with a 1992 deficit of FM338m.
Mr Heimo Karinen, chief executive, said: 'Competitiveness is now good within
the entire group. I am confident that Kemira has sustainable competitive
advantages in its chosen markets.'
The company achieved 1993 net sales of FM11.2bn, up 6 per cent on 1992
despite generally difficult trading conditions.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: RJR Nabisco forced to alter
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The barrage of criticism afflicting the US cigarette industry yesterday
forced RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco group that makes Camel and Winston
cigarettes, into an embarrassing turnabout over its Dollars 2bn stock
offering.
It said that it was changing the terms of the offer so that the stock would
be convertible into shares in both the food and tobacco parts of the
business if the two were split - not just the tobacco business, as
previously planned.
In February RJR Nabisco announced that it was launching an offer of Dollars
2bn worth of preferred equity redemption cumulative shares, or 'percs'.
These would help pay off some of its debt and to raise funds for
acquisitions or other transactions.
RJR Nabisco said that the percs would be convertible into ordinary shares in
the company on a one-for-one basis at the end of three years. But analysts
studying the fine print of the offer quickly learned that if the food and
tobacco businesses were split, the percs would convert into tobacco stock.
The day after the offering was announced, the US Food and Drug
Administration released a letter saying that it was considering evidence
that might result in a decision to start regulating cigarettes as a drug.
This came amid an unprecedented wave of attacks on the industry from
politicians, legislators and anti-smoking groups. Yesterday leading figures
from the industry were called before a congressional hearing to answer
allegations that they were manipulating the amount of nicotine in cigarettes
to make them more addictive.
Many potential investors had made it clear to RJR Nabisco that they would
not be interested in subscribing to a Dollars 2bn share offering linked so
closely to the tobacco side of the business, especially when a split of the
food and tobacco operations was widely regarded as imminent.
RJR Nabisco said yesterday: 'Our decision was in response to a desire from
investors to participate in both parts of the business. We would not have
made this decision unless we felt it was the right thing to do in terms of
having a successful offering.'
Each perc will now be convertible into one share in the food business and
one share in the tobacco business in the event that the two are split.

FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Fortis advances 14% with help of
banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch financial services group, yesterday announced a 14
per cent rise in profits last year, with total consolidated profits for 1993
of Ecu476.2m (Dollars 538.10m) compared with Ecu419.4m in the previous 12
months.
The results come after an eventful year for the group, which has seen it
sell a large stake in Generale de Banque, the Belgian bank, and acquire a
controlling interest in the Belgian ASLK-CGER banking and insurance group.
Fortis said the sale of its Generale de Banque shares had returned a large
capital gain.
However, it stressed that both its life insurance and banking sectors had
continued to expand in Belgium, the UK, the Netherlands and the US.
The biggest growth, the company said, was in the banking sector, where
pre-tax results had risen by 30 per cent.
However, the insurance sector of the group had also expanded, with pre-tax
results rising by 11 per cent.
The non-life sector recorded a Ecu7.9m loss in 1993, compared with a
Ecu15.8m loss the previous year.
The board has proposed a dividend of Fl 3.40 per ordinary share, up from Fl
3.20 the previous year.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Export growth behind 80% rise at Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lamont Holdings, the Northern Ireland-based textiles group, reported a surge
in 1993 profits, reflecting strong export growth and a substantial
contribution from Alexander Drew, its fabric printing subsidiary.
After two years of decline, pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 11.4m, up 80
per cent on the previous Pounds 6.31m. The shares firmed 9p to 433p.
Turnover increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 136.1m, with export sales to the
Americas and east Asia almost doubled to Pounds 17m following the setting up
of sales offices in New York and Hong Kong.
Lamont's performance continued to be hampered by losses from its core Shaw
carpets business. However, all other group operations experienced growth,
and overall, the carpet divisions contributed operating profit of Pounds
1.3m, against a small loss in 1992.
Sir Desmond Lorimer, chairman, said profit margins in the carpet division
remained weak because of 'over-capacity in the industry'. This was more than
compensated for by the fabrics division, and operating profit margins
(excluding discontinued businesses) rose from 6.7 per cent to 9.3 per cent.
Shaw was also affected by a recent capital expenditure programme and an
unsuccessful push upmarket. Sir Desmond said in spite of difficult trading
conditions it was expected to return to profitability in 1994.
The fabric manufacturing and printing business remained the main
contributor, with operating profits of Pounds 10.6m. Alexander Drew, which
was acquired in April 1992, will be strengthened by the merger with
Cunningham Johnson, the recently acquired fabric printer which is on a
nearby site.
The results were hit by the elimination of Pounds 617,000 of goodwill on the
sale of the computer division, partly offset by a Pounds 394,000 profit from
a property disposal.
At the year end, net borrowings stood at Pounds 10m, marginally down from
1992, and gearing fell to 23 per cent.
A final dividend of 9p makes a total of 12.5p (12p), payable from earnings
ahead by 59 per cent to 25.57p (16.09p) per share.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Recovery seen as Beauford cuts loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Losses at Beauford, the engineering and ceramics group which completed a
refinancing package earlier this year, were cut from Pounds 26.4m to Pounds
7.43m pre-tax for 1993.
Turnover of continuing operations slipped from Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 27.5m
and losses per share worked through at 9p (32p).
The 1992 deficit included a Pounds 19.5m provision for goodwill in
continuing operations.
Sir Trevor Holdsworth, chairman, said trading conditions remained difficult
in the second half, but added that there was evidence of a recovery in the
last two months which led to a 'significant' increase in order intake.
Although that was too late to affect the 1993 results, the trading
improvement had spilled over into the current year. Most parts of the group
were now operating profitably and further improvement was looked for during
the year.
Refinancing included a restructuring of bank debt and the raising of new
money via a placing and rights issue. The directors believed the group would
have ceased trading without the package.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Passions run high over sugar cane bid -
Nikki Tait on Tate &amp; Lyle's attempt to buy two Australian mills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An outward air of normality surrounds the Tully and South Johnstone sugar
mills, set in neighbouring villages on northern Queensland's lush, coastal
plain.
Their vast crushing plants are undergoing the seasonal overhaul. In
surrounding fields, a healthy cane crop promises bumper business when
harvesting begins on June 14.
However, stickers plastered across the mill buildings tell a different
story. 'Crush the Tate &amp; Lyle bid', they demand.
Inside, managers are lobbying local shareholders who hold the key to the
British sweetener group's offers, worth ADollars 121m (Pounds 58m) in total,
by phone.
One local resident, Ms Jessica Hitching, has even mobilised a 'women's
defence committee'. 'We're told to buy Australian,' she complains, 'but the
mills won't be Australian anymore . . . they'll be English'.
The bid battle for the Queensland mills is the most public move Tate has
made since acquiring its Australian subsidiary, Bundaberg Sugar, in 1991 -
and it is proving neither easy nor speedy to complete.
Only today, six months after the opening salvos were fired, will the tussle
reach a crucial stage. Shareholders in the South Johnstone mill are due to
vote on a proposal to lift a restriction which bars anyone from holding more
than 3.2 per cent of the mill's shares. Only if they agree, and by a 75 per
cent majority, can the Tate offer proceed.
In this tightly-knit community, where many of the shareholders are direct
descendants of the Italian and Maltese immigrants who established the first
farms, passions run high and no one will admit defeat. 'I'm smiling,' says
Mr Fred Lizzio, chairman of the South Johnstone mill. 'We're confident',
retorts Mr Rod Young, Bundaberg's company secretary.
The one point on which both sides agree is that the deal would make sense
for Tate. Via Bundaberg, it already owns mills at Babinda and Mourilyan,
directly to the north, and synergies could flow.
Sugar prices have also improved, and both Tully and South Johnstone have
been investing in their plants. Profits from both mills rose strongly last
year and are forecast to do better still. Moreover, Tully and South
Johnstone have better potential for expanding their catchment areas, and
increasing throughput, than Bundaberg's existing mills. In Queensland, cane
can only be grown on acreage assigned for this purpose, but Tully, in
particular, has earmarked various tranches of nearby land from which it
thinks additional tonnage could be sourced in the future.
The problem for Tate is that the mills' shares are owned largely by local
cane growers, whose livelihoods are directly affected by the way in which
the mills are run. While the bidder claims that its cash offer represents a
'unique' opportunity to realise a good price for the mills' unlisted stock,
at least some of the growers have broader concerns.
'What the mill does affects my business - and at present, it's run as a
farmers' mill,' says one South Johnstone shareholder.
Asked to elaborate, growers who oppose the bids present a list of worries.
The first is maintenance. Growers cut and deliver cane to their respective
mills under a highly-organised system, which aims to ensure that everyone
gets fair treatment. But if mechanical failures interrupt the crushing
process, cane which has been burnt quickly becomes perishable.
Some farmers point to last year's breakdowns at the Babinda mill, and worry
that Tate - with more interest in mill profits than cane growers' income -
might prune maintenance expenditure.
Tate, not surprisingly, denies this. 'Babinda was an old mill when we bought
it,' says Mr Young, adding that money has been spent on it subsequently, and
denying any maintenance cuts.
Next, there is the question of maintaining the cane railway - a network of
tracks which allow farmers to bring the crop to the mill. Might Tate be less
inclined to replace track to outlying areas? Then there is the question of
what price the 'cane-dirt' - extracted in the crushing process and returned
to farmers for use as fertiliser - might be sold by Tate. And so on.
Such uncertainties, moreover, come at a delicate time for Australia's sugar
industry. Historically, this has been heavily regulated, with the state
government buying up Queensland farmers' production at an 'award' price, and
limiting the land on which cane can be grown. Now, in the current 'free
trade' atmosphere, and with Australia committed to deregulation throughout
the economy, this structure is likely to change  - although no one is sure
exactly how.
As Mr Lizzio puts it: 'Deregulation is rather frightening if you've only got
one buyer'.
But the mill boards have a problem, too. Not all shareholders are either
growers, or growers who expect to be in the business for the long-haul.
While the mills claim that the bid prices are inadequate, these do represent
a substantial advance on the levels at which shares had been changing hands
prior to Tate's arrival. South Johnstone, for example, traded at about
ADollars 3-ADollars 4, while Tate's final offer has been pitched at ADollars
14.
The mills' answer is to merge and then list on the stock exchange - thereby
accommodating those shareholders who would like to cash in all or part of
their holdings. At present, however, no firm plan is on the table, although
Mr Rino Cargnello, who chairs the Tully board, says proposals should be
presented 'within the next month or two'.
The drawback is that this scheme, too, would require a 75 per cent majority
of both mills' shareholders. Both boards, meanwhile, say that they would
look for some sort of anti-takeover protection for the merged group,
probably by way of state government legislation.
In short, the potential obstacles which surround the flotation idea are
considerable and it is by no means guaranteed that shareholders would have a
ready market for their shares in the near future.
Perhaps the most indisputable point made by the mills is that a six-month
war of attrition is long enough.
Already, the battle has led to court actions, and the bid costs are
approaching ADollars 250,000 for each mill - money which the growers see
vanishing before their eyes.
Tate, however, says it will wait until today's vote before deciding what to
do next. 'Our assessment will be governed by today's result,' says Mr Young.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Scudder enters UK with Pounds 50m trust
launch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Scudder Stevens Clark, the US fund management group, is raising its profile
in the UK by aiming to raise about Pounds 50m by the end of the month
through a new Latin American investment trust.
Scudder Latin America Investment Trust will be the group's first venture
into the UK investment trust sector, but Latin America is more familiar
territory: Dollars 2.5bn of the group's Dollars 90bn (Pounds 62bn) funds
under management is in Latin American debt and equities. It has been
investing in Mexico since 1979, and has eight specialist Latin American
funds, run by a team of 12 based in Boston.
Scudder's activities in London have up to now been limited to a small number
of insurance funds. As the name is not yet widely known to the British
public, the trust is being launched by means of an institutional placing,
and possibly small intermediaries offer, rather than a full public offer.
Scudder said it was confident of attracting sufficient interest in the fund,
although it will be the fourth investment trust focusing on Latin America to
be launched in the UK this year. The first two, from Morgan Grenfell and
Edinburgh Fund Managers, raised less than their initial targets, at Pounds
64m and Pounds 39m respectively. The offer for Templeton's version has not
yet closed, but it raised Pounds 37.5m from a placing.
Beta Global, the emerging markets investment trust, is seeking up to Pounds
28.6m of net new equity, through a placing and open offer of up to 30m
conversion shares at 100p.
Institutions have already indicated interest in 24.5m C-shares; a minimum of
3m C-shares have been reserved for the open offer, which is restricted to
existing share and warrant holders, and closes on May 6. Warrants will be
issued on a 1-for-5.13 basis after conversion of the C-shares into ordinary
shares. This should be effected by October 31 at the latest.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Going for gold as rivals drop out - Kenneth
Gooding on the fortunes of Cookson as it focuses on precious metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is the hope of every company in an overcrowded and competitive market
that some of its rivals will pack up and leave. It is rarely fulfilled.
Yet that is what has enabled Cookson to emerge as one of the world's five
biggest suppliers of semi-fabricated precious metals to the gold jewellery
and silversmith industries.
In the past four years the specialist industrial materials group has been
hauled back from financial disaster by a new management team led by Mr
Richard Oster, chief executive.
He is now busy refocusing the group. It is withdrawing from non-core
businesses such as the engineering operations, sold recently, while precious
metals fabricating has been carefully reconstructed to become one of the
biggest core divisions.
In North America Cookson was already the largest fabricator of gold for the
jewellery industry, processing more than 1.5m troy ounces of gold and
several million ounces of silver. This followed the merger five years ago of
the two biggest US companies, Stern and Leach. Cookson took full control in
1992.
Its biggest rival in the US quit in 1991. Engelhard, the precious metals
group ultimately controlled by the Anglo American Corporation of South
Africa, first attempted a sale to Degussa of Germany but the deal fell
through and companies were either sold individually or closed.
This left Cookson's Stern Metals business, based in Attleboro,
Massachusetts, with 70 to 80 per cent of the US market for supplying gold to
the jewellery industry and 50 per cent of the silver market.
The next step was obvious: tackle Europe.
In February last year Cookson made a start by buying some of the assets of
Knight &amp; Day in the UK from the receiver for a knock-down Pounds 350,000. It
took on the staff of 105 but the number is now down to 62.
Then in December it paid Pounds 37m, including Pounds 20m for precious
metals stocks, for the jewellery materials operations of Johnson Matthey,
another company ultimately controlled by Anglo American.
With annual sales of Pounds 44m, JM was the UK market leader. Its operations
in Dublin and Birmingham have been merged with those of Knight &amp; Day (also
in Birmingham) and the combination renamed Cookson Precious Metals.
Some analysts suggest that Cookson's move into the UK market and its obvious
intentions of becoming a serious force in continental Europe triggered JM's
decision to move out. JM said the business did not fit its strategy and that
it was achieving only a 2 per cent return on net assets against a required
level of 20 per cent. Stern is sure CPM can reach the 20 per cent target,
mainly because of book-keeping differences, JM bought all its precious
metal, but Stern's policy is to lease metal.
Mr Jake Conley, president of Stern, said the JM acquisition gave Cookson the
critical mass to compete in western Europe with the likes of Degussa as well
as Hereaus of Germany and CLA (Chaudronnerie Legere d'Argenteuil) of France.
He said: 'This is a mature business with little growth. But the last
survivor is going to do well and we (Cookson) are heading in that
direction.'
He would not be surprised to see Handy &amp; Harman, the remaining big
competitor in the US, quit, or to see CLA give up in Europe. He also
suggested it was likely that Engelhard would ease out of the remnants of its
jewellery materials business in the UK.
Stern Metals had sales of Dollars 230m (Pounds 158m) and an operating profit
of Dollars 26.1m last year for an 11.4 per cent return on sales, up from
Dollars 204m, Dollars 22.6m and an 11 per cent return in 1992.
The group employs 527 people and specialises in turning alloys containing
pure gold and silver into more than 2,000 different items such as metal
wire, sheet, tubing and casting grains. Its customers make these into
anything from cheap, 14-carat gold chains to some of the most expensive
jewellery in the world.
The activities also include APM-Sterngold, the oldest dental attachments
company in the US, which processes more than 50,000 ounces of precious
metals annually and last year reported a remarkable 73 per cent return on
net assets.
Mr Fred Hammerle, Stern's chief operating officer, suggested the success
sprang partly from its 'incentive-driven' workforce. For example, the
Stern-Leach mill products operations have an incentive scheme called TCP -
Teamwork + Cost Control = Profit - which last year paid a total of Dollars
1.8m, equivalent to nine weeks pay, for each of the 452 people included. The
minimum payment was Dollars 2,761 and the maximum more than Dollars 25,000.
Mr Dick Smith, president of Stern-Leach, explained: 'The scheme encourages
people to work smarter, do their own quality control. They don't make scrap.
There is more awareness of how the job should be done. They don't want us to
hire more people. They don't like people goofing off.'
With more than 1,600 customers, many of them small businesses, credit
control is also an important element in Stern's success. Any debt above
Dollars 200,000 must go to the credit committee. Customers get 30 days to
pay and then are charged at an annual rate of 15 per cent up to 60 days.
Some of this expertise can be passed on to the newly-acquired UK companies,
as can many of Stern's production techniques - although Stern also expects
to learn from the former JM people. Transatlantic exchanges of key
production people already are being made.
Mr Conley says that tube, sheet and wire will be exported from the US, where
there is very little incremental cost when output is increased, to the UK
for reworking. This should shorten UK delivery times.
'Our main priority will be to rationalise the mill and dental operations.
That should take nine months.'
Then CPM would start looking seriously at exporting to Spain, Greece, east
Asia and Australia. JM's export experience would be of great value. Also,
JM's contacts with Britain's National Health Service should help the US
dental business.
'But first we have to digest what we have so far. We want to make sure
Cookson gets the return we promised.'
Mr Geoff Allum, analyst at NatWest Securities, saw no reason why targets
would be missed.
'With a good management team and a high market share you can rake it in. I
can't see what's to stop them taking Europe by storm.'

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Holiday Inn's budget hotel chain heads for
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Holiday Inn, the hotel chain owned by Bass, the brewery and leisure group,
plans to extend its budget hotel chain, Holiday Inn Express, to Europe.
The company said it hoped to open more than 100 Holiday Inn Express hotels
over the next five years, mainly in Germany, central Europe, the UK, Spain
and France. The target customer is the 'budget-conscious' business and
leisure traveller.
In the UK, the hotels will compete with chains like Travelodge, which is
owned by Forte. In France and Germany they will be pitted against the Ibis
Hotel chain owned by the Accor group of France.
Most of the hotels will be located along motorways and on secondary sites
near main cities, rather than in city centres. Rooms will cost an average
Dollars 55 (Pounds 38) a night, including breakfast - considerably less than
the prices charged at standard Holiday Inns or at the more expensive Holiday
Inn Crown Plaza hotels.
Holiday Inn Express hotels were launched in the US in 1990, and plans to
extend them to Asia were announced in late 1993.
Mr Bryant Langton, Holiday Inn chairman, said: 'Given the success of this
product around the world, I see no reason why we here in Europe could not
have more than 100 Holiday Inn Express hotels in the next five years.'
As with other Holiday Inn hotels, the emphasis will be on franchising rather
than outright ownership by Holiday Inn. Some will be purpose-built as
Holiday Inn Express hotels, while others will be existing hotels that join
the Holiday Inn organisation.
The investment cost to the developer is expected to range between Dollars
45,000 and Dollars 50,000 per room, about half the outlay for the upmarket
Holiday Inn Crown Plaza hotels, whose prime city-centre locations mean
higher land prices.
The company has already signed agreements covering the opening of 20 hotels
in Poland and one in Germany, with talks on four other German sites
currently underway.
The first German hotel will open in Cottbus, a city located between Berlin
and Dresden, in the spring of 1995.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: One-off items hit Estates &amp; Agency
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A number of one-off items left pre-tax profits at Estates &amp; Agency Holdings,
the property investment company, lower at Pounds 283,000 for the six months
to December 31, against Pounds 416,000.
The company said that costs relating to the sale of a site in Plymouth,
offset by non-recurring income, cut operating profits by Pounds 340,000 to
Pounds 249,000 (Pounds 416,000).
The sale resulted in an exceptional credit of Pounds 34,000 being the net
surplus over the latest valuation.
Gross income was Pounds 2.65m (Pounds 2.48m). Earnings per share came out at
3.94p (6.89p). The interim dividend is raised to 3.5p (0.5p).

Swallowfield, the aerosol and cosmetics manufacturer, announced 28 per cent

The advance was achieved on turnover ahead 23 per cent to Pounds 28.6m

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Ipeco declines 29% to Pounds 2.35m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ipeco Holdings suffered a 29 per cent fall in 1993 pre-tax profits. The
aviation and defence industry supplier blamed the decline on poor conditions
in the civil aerospace sector.
After restructuring costs of Pounds 200,000 the pre-tax figure was Pounds
2.35m (Pounds 3.3m).
Turnover was slightly higher at Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 19.9m).
The company said despite cost reductions, order rescheduling left the core
flight deck equipment business lower. Trading in the other subsidiaries was
mixed with good results from the smaller aerospace operations and steady
progress in the second half in some defence-related areas.
Earnings per share were 5.45p (7.72p) but the board is recommending an
unchanged final dividend of 2.3p, maintaining the total for the year at
3.6p.

In spite of fierce competition that led to price reductions in many areas,
Brooks Service Group, the textile rental and retail services company, swung
from losses of Pounds 392,000 to profits of Pounds 323,000 pre-tax for the

Turnover was marginally lower at Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 24.2m) but interest
charges were cut to Pounds 348,000 (Pounds 532,000).
Earnings per share emerged at 3.13p (losses 1.76p) and a proposed final
dividend of 1p makes a total of 1.5p (nil).
Although trading conditions continued to be difficult the directors said
there were 'encouraging' signs in some areas. Actions taken had 'laid a good
foundation' for improved profitability.
Year-end gearing was reduced to 46 per cent (58 per cent).
The shares closed 1p higher at 70p, after 74p.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Storm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Storm Group, the USM-traded multi-media concern, continued its recovery
during the second half of 1993 and ended the 12 months with pre-tax profits
amounting to Pounds 122,000, compared with losses of Pounds 2.1m restated in
accordance with FRS 3.
The directors said they intended to undertake a capital reorganisation which
would enable the group 'to commence paying dividends as soon as possible'.
Turnover fell from Pounds 6.04m to Pounds 5.23m but there were operating
profits of Pounds 311,000 (Pounds 2.03m losses), after much lower
exceptional debits of Pounds 107,000, against Pounds 2.05m.
The pre-tax figure was after higher interest of Pounds 189,000 (Pounds
52,000).
Earnings per share were 0.2p against losses last time of 2.8p.
Directors stated that during 1993 there was an encouraging increase in sales
of the group's television portfolio and strong interest in a number of its
character properties.
The production facilities studio also contributed to profits, they added,
with two series completed during the year.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hunting at Pounds 32m with help of
exceptionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Property disposals and the sale of subsidiaries last year helped Hunting
defy the recession in its aviation, defence and oil businesses.
Exceptional items totalling Pounds 8.1m underpinned a slight increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 31.7m in the 12 months to December 31, against
Pounds 29.2m last time.
The shares, however, fell 14p to 215p after the group showed a 16 per cent
decline in operating profits to Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 34.6m).
Mr Kenneth Miller, chief executive, blamed the operating downturn on hefty
restructuring costs of Pounds 5.8m and trading losses at subsidiaries which
have since been sold.
The reorganisation centred on the aviation business, where the group made
Pounds 2.9m of provisions to cover redundancies, the cost of selling Hunting
Aircraft - its lossmaking US subsidiary - and the amalgamation of more than
30 companies into five sub-divisions.
Operating profits in the aviation division, which suffered from deferred
orders and production cuts, fell from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 5m and the
workforce was reduced by 150 to less than 2,000.
Mr Miller, who warned a further 150 jobs would go this year, said: 'It was a
skinny performance and the business is not generating an adequate return on
investment. The restructuring will change that but it's not going to recover
in a hurry.'
The problems were partially offset by improved results in the defence and
oil divis-ions.
A nine-month contribution from the management contract for the Atomic
Weapons Establishment boosted defence profits to Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 9.3m).
The group made a Pounds 2.3m provision for relocating its communication
technology business.
The oil division saw profits increase by Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 17.8m despite
the falling price of crude, which it markets and supplies in North America.
Group turnover improved from Pounds 809.8m to Pounds 1.06bn, including
Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 30.1m) from discontinued activities. Earnings per share
fell from 15.7p to 13.6p, and a final dividend of 6p is proposed for an
unchanged 10p total.
COMMENT
With Pounds 15m of surplus property still on its books, there is nothing to
stop Hunting selling further assets to buoy this year's figures. It is an
attractive option given the fragility of the aviation and defence markets
and the recent slide in the oil price. But the balance sheet has been
strengthened by last year's Pounds 37m rights issue, cutting gearing from 78
per cent to 35 per cent, and that will allow the group to develop its
underlying businesses. It may take some time, however, for the benefits of
new orders to feed through. So although profits this year could reach Pounds
33m on a forward multiple of 15.5, the shares could prove a costly
short-term option.

Leeds Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth largest, is close to
becoming the first society to fund its mortgage lending business through
securitisation, a financing technique in use in the US for more than a
decade.
Securitisation allows banks to take loans off their balance sheet, thereby
removing the risk of default and freeing up capital. Banks place the assets
in aspecial-purpose vehicle which then raises money by selling the debt
securities to investors. Interest on the so-called 'mortgage-backed'
securities are funded by the loan repayments.
It is now a trillion-dollar market in the US but its development in the UK
is at an early stage. In the past year, Barclays Bank and National
Westminster Bank have securitised mortgages and loans.
Regulatory constraints have hampered the use of securitisation by building
societies which last year had just under 60 per cent of the UK mortgage
market. However, the Building Society Commission, the sector's statutory
regulator, is due to publish guidelines within three months on how building
societies can securitise their assets.
Two other societies apart from Leeds - Nationwide and most notably Skipton -
have also carried out work on securitisation.
Leeds has spent the past two years setting up a system to securitise its
mortgages. 'We see securitisation as an important source of funding in order
to cope with higher mortgage volumes,' said Mr Ian Stewart, general manager,
treasury, at the Leeds Permanent.
Leeds plans to test the system by using a pool of its mortgages as
collateral to raise up to Pounds 100m from a small group of banks rather
through selling securities in the public market.
'The analysis will be exactly the same as a fully blown securitisation,'
said Mr Stewart.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Prestwick falls Pounds 1.15m into red but
sees improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prestwick Holdings, the Scot-tish printed circuit board maker which in
January called in Postern, the corporate recovery specialist, suffered
losses of Pounds 1.95m before tax in the half year to January 31, compared
with profits of Pounds 106,000.
Mr Archie Coulson, an executive director of Postern who became Prestwick's
executive chairman, said, however, that the company's core businesses had
achieved improved profits since January, reaching record levels in March.
The directors expect the second half to show a 'significant turnround'.
Prestwick incurred losses of Pounds 3.9m in the year ended July 31 because
of the failure of the acquisitions strategy of Mr Wayne Osman, the chief
executive who resigned last June.
Directors blamed the interim losses on the decision to abort an acquisition
supported by Mr Osman and to the cost of Postern's services. In addition,
Pounds 652,000 has been included as an exceptional item following the
decision to close Northumbria Circuits, a purchase made under Mr Osman.
Turnover from continuing operations was unchanged at Pounds 17m in the half
year. Directors stated that customers had an 'impressive share' of the
mobile telephone market, and that the company supplied the European car
market through Ford and Siemens.
In the absence of distributable reserves no preference or ordinary dividends
can be paid. In 1992 there were preference payments of 3.6p per share and an
ordinary dividend of 0.5p. Losses per share were 9.44p (0.02p). The board
intends to restructure reserves later this year.
Mr Bill Young has left the board and is replaced as finance director by Mr
Paul Woodley of Postern. Mr Hugh Laughland, previously chairman, has also
left. Mr Kenneth Thompson, former group finance director of Royal Bank of
Scotland, and Mr Bill Junor, a company non-executive director with industry
experience, become non-executive directors.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Further US blow for GrandMet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan is to lose US distribution rights to Grand Marnier, the
orange-flavoured liqueur owned by Marnier Lapostolle, the French
family-controlled company.
The rights have been transferred to Schieffelin &amp; Somerset, the US joint
venture between Guinness's United Distillers and Moet Hennessy whose parent,
LVMH, has an 8 per cent stake in Marnier Lapostolle. The joint venture
already distributes Grand Marnier in Japan.
It is another blow to Grand Metropolitan's IDV drinks arm which has just
lost the US distribution rights to Absolut vodka.
Grand Marnier sells about 400,000 cases a year in the US and analysts
estimate it generates profits of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m for
GrandMet compared with Pounds 25m from Absolut.
IDV said the two sides had failed to reach agreement on a new distribution
arrangement after the current contract expires at the end of this year.
IDV's separate distribution agreements for Grand Marnier in Australia,
Portugal, Greece, Spain and Italy will all continue after January 1 1995.
UK distribution of Grand Marnier was recently switched from Matthew Clark to
Moet Hennessy.
GrandMet's shares fell 8p to 457p.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Minimum reasons maximise puzzle - Peggy
Hollinger considers the surprising departure of Jim Maxmin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The puzzle about the departure of Mr Jim Maxmin from his post as chief
executive of Laura Ashley was summed up by one bewildered analyst: 'It is
bizarre that he has chosen investment as the issue on which to go when
capital expenditure in general was above expectations. If you believe the
story, then that would imply there was a quantum leap planned for next
year.'
Such questions dogged the announcement of Laura Ashley's results. Just what
had Mr Maxmin been planning and what exactly was the board intending for the
future?
The issue was further clouded by the decision to not to give the traditional
break down of profits at this stage. The company claimed it was offering
enhanced disclosure and, indeed, it did in some respects such as on turnover
and operating expenses.
Yet many analysts trying to devise forecasts were left without
straightforward facts over such issues as the US losses. It is estimated
that the US business, hit by heavy overstocking in 1992, had incurred losses
of between Pounds 9m and Pounds 10m.
Nevertheless, the business appears to be making substantial inroads in
recovering those losses. Almost all of the old stock has been sold, leaving
prospects for margins looking better than for some time.
Mr Maxmin has been criticised for being late to realise the extent of the
difficulties in the US. Yet many of his achievements are praised even by
those who find his effusive style difficult to accept.
When he arrived in July 1991, the heavily indebted Laura Ashley had been
without a chief executive for 13 months. The programme to tackle the Pounds
100m debt, involving disposals and factory closures, had begun, but survival
left little time for strategic planning.
Mr Maxmin, straight from Thorn EMI, began to preach the 'lifestyle brand'
gospel, replanting Laura Ashley's image firmly in the English countryside.
The chic niche would protect all-important margins which had melted in the
volume-driven 1980s.
The chief executive also sought to empower staff with a series of
catchily-titled campaigns, such as 'Love the Customer', aimed at improving
productivity and profitability.
In addition he spent Pounds 11m on state of the art computerised point of
sales equipment and concluded an innovative distribution deal with National
Express which cut down on stock and improved the company's response to
demand.
So it is surprising that just as the company begins to reap the benefits of
his efforts, Mr Maxmin is leaving. 'He has pointed things in the right
direction, yet the achievement has yet to be triumphantly realised,' said Mr
Robert Snaith, analyst with Strauss Turnbull.
Even Laura Ashley executives admit there is much work left to do,
particularly given the continuing losses in the US and the maturity of the
UK business. Yet there is little option other than to follow the tracks Mr
Maxmin has laid.
The main difference, according to analysts, is likely to be a greater
emphasis on the operational controls which were certainly lacking in the US.
While the company does not intend to replace Mr Maxmin immediately, the
board has been substantially strengthened by the addition of Mr Steven
Cotter, the retail executive who is known by some in the City of London as
'Mr Detail'.
The City is also relieved that there were no nasties in the results
following Mr Maxmin's departure, implying steady progress this year towards
pre-tax forecasts of Pounds 10m.
Nevertheless, there is a degree of uneasiness over the party line that the
split was 'a mature separation over a disagreement on investment levels' -
whatever that means.
'When someone says there was a mature disagreement you know there has been
blood on the floor,' said one analyst.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley up 67% to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laura Ashley yesterday remained tight-lipped about the sudden departure of
its American-born chief executive as it announced a 67 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 3m, writes Peggy Hollinger.
However, it became increasingly clear that the boardroom split, which
resulted in the announcement this week of Mr Jim Maxmin's departure, had
been less than amicable.
Mr Maxmin was present yesterday to announce the results of the company which
he led back to profit during his three-year stint. He was relaxed and
confident - as long as questions were focused on the business.
Sales were ahead 13 per cent, after accounting for currency effects, at
Pounds 300.4m, with gross profit 8 per cent higher at Pounds 158.4m on the
same basis. Earnings rose from 0.35p to 0.45p.
The group also reported substantial progress in rectifying problems which
resulted in heavy losses in the US last year. This gave many analysts
encouragement to speculate that a dividend more meaningful than 1993-94's
maintained 0.1p might be paid this year. 'If things are looking fair, a
dividend of about 1p would not be unreasonable,' said one analyst.
When asked about the reasons for his departure, Mr Maxmin's replies were
more abrupt and the questions were often fielded by Mr Andrew Higginson,
finance director. 'Jim left us with a superb strategy and a business in good
shape to take advantage of future opportunities,' he said. 'There has
clearly been a disagreement at board level and that is all we can say.'
Mr Hugh Blakeway Webb, who will become executive chairman in May, did not
attend the meeting. Mr Maxmin said he was in negotiations over compensation
which is expected to total more than Pounds 600,000 after accounting for
share options and performance-related bonuses.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tudor, the USM-traded floor and wall tile distributor, incurred losses of
Pounds 865,000 pre-tax for 1993 reflecting full provision for the closure of
its crystal operation and costs of reorganising the tile business.
Turnover rose Pounds 1m to Pounds 17.7m. The deficit was up from Pounds
104,000 last time and came after closure costs of Pounds 150,000 and
exceptional charges of Pounds 243,000 (Pounds 74,000). The dividend is again
0.25p.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rising provisions leave Aegis Pounds 18m in
the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aegis, the London-based holding company of Europe's largest media-buying and
planning group, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 18m for the year to
December 31, compared with restated deficit of Pounds 11m.
Exceptional items of Pounds 40m were Pounds 25.9m higher than the Pounds
14.1m the group had been expecting at the time of its refinancing in October
last year.
Some Pounds 9.5m of the exceptionals were for FRS 4 requirements, which
alter the treatment of refinancing costs and preference dividends. The
remainder was made up largely of additional restructuring and a reserve to
cover a fine under French competition law, against which the group is
appealing.
Mr Frank Law, chairman, said the underlying pre-tax profit of Pounds 22m was
at the anticipated level.
The group also confirmed that Mr Michel Lefebvre, chief financial officer,
would be leaving 'in due course' and that Mr Thierry Vial Collet, chief
operating officer, would also be leaving. Mr Charles Hochman, chief
executive, may retire by the end of next year.
Consultants are reviewing the group's central management structure to bring
it into line with the 'enlargement and geographic spread of the shareholders
following the refinancing'.
The current management is strongly French but, following the refinancing,
Omnicom, the US advertising group, has acquired a 9 per cent stake, and
Warburg Pincus, the US investment firm, a 33 per cent holding.
Turnover was down 3 per cent at Pounds 2.75bn, while gross income dropped 19
per cent to Pounds 153m.
Operating expenses were down 14 per cent at Pounds 120m and underlying
operating profit was reduced by 37 per cent to Pounds 33m. Gross margins
dropped from 6.7 per cent to 5.6 per cent.
Losses per share fell from a restated 20.8p to 12.1p. The dividend for the
year is omitted and the board said it did not expect a payment in 1994. An
interim only of 1.375p was paid for 1992.
COMMENT
Aegis is heavily dependent on operations in France where the
recently-introduced 'Loi Sapin' has slashed media-buying revenues. Until
April 1993 media buyers could take a cut from substantial volume-related
discounts from media owners; now all discounts have to be passed on directly
to advertisers. In spite of this, the group has maintained a gross margin of
5.6 per cent, compared with the pre-Loi Sapin level of 6.7 per cent. Growth
in turnover is anticipated by the company, with over a dozen new clients
coming on stream during 1994. Forecast profits of Pounds 30m put the shares
on a prospective multiple of 11.8. That sizeable discount to the market is
understandable, given recent traumas, but does not yet reflect the recovery
potential.

Zeneca, the bioscience group demerged last year from Imperial Chemical
Industries, has taken Pounds 5m of shares in International Biotechnology
Trust which is being launched by Rothschild Asset Management.
Rothschild announced yesterday that a placing of shares with warrants, with
institutions and other investors, including Zeneca, had raised Pounds 35.1m
 -less than half the figure originally hoped for.
Rothschild's target was Pounds 100m, including proceeds from a public offer
for subscription which opened yesterday.
Mr Jeremy Curnock Cook, a director of Rothschild Asset Management and leader
of the investment advisory team, said 'in the light of current market
conditions I am pleased with the support for the placing'.

FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: NatWest Bancorp advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pressures on banks from falls in bond and equity prices emerged
yesterday when NatWest Bancorp, National Westminster Bank's US retail bank,
reported an Dollars 8.2m fall in income from its securities portfolio in the
first quarter.
The pre-tax result jumped to Dollars 69.8m (Pounds 47.8m), against Dollars
56.7m, while post-tax profits amounted to Dollars 62.6m (Dollars 60.7m).
Non-interest income fell to Dollars 79.7m (Dollars 96.5m) because of a fall
in securities gains to Dollars 2.6m (Dollars 10.8m) and a non-recurring
Dollars 8.7m sale of stock in the first quarter of 1993.
The bank said that its core performance, excluding non-recurring items, had
increased by 40 per cent. Net interest income rose to Dollars 221.3m
(Dollars 192.3m). However, the return on average equity fell to 11.61 per
cent (13.03 per cent).

FT  15 APR 94 / Blue Circle up 76% and reopens UK kiln
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blue Circle Industries, the UK's biggest cement company, which yesterday
announced a 76 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, has resumed exports to the
US and reopened a kiln in south-east England.
The measures emphasise the improvement in construction demand on both sides
of the Atlantic, although recovery is more advanced in the US.
Pre-tax profits last year rose from Pounds 93.8m to Pounds 165.6m. If
exceptional items, which depressed the 1992 figure, are excluded, operating
profits rose 57 per cent to Pounds 165.6m.
A reduced tax charge of 31.4 per cent, against 56 per cent after large ACT
write-offs, left earnings per share more than three times higher at 14.5p
(4p).
Blue Circle is paying an unchanged final dividend of 7.5p making a
same-again total of 11.25p. The market was encouraged by the figures and the
shares rose from 327p to 334p.
Blue Circle stopped shipping to the US several years ago. Its kiln at
Northfleet in Kent was mothballed last year when UK construction was still
falling sharply.
Since then the company has won several large orders in south-east England,
including the extension of London's Jubilee underground line, requiring the
kiln to be reopened. A decision on whether to keep it permanently open will
be taken this summer.
The company said first-quarter UK cement sales rose 5 per cent. Sales were
likely to rise by 3 or 4 per cent this year, while cement price increases of
4 per cent introduced in March were expected to hold.
UK profits, including the group's heating, bathroom and kitchen products
operations, rose from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 59.1m helped by cost savings.
In the US, profits more than doubled from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 32.6m with
volume sales of cement, readymix concrete and aggregates rising by 7-15 per
cent. The group in February resumed cement imports from Greece into its
deepwater terminal at Norfolk Virginia. Mr Keith Orrell-Jones, managing
director, expected the company to make further progress in the US this year.
Continental European profits rose from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 33.5m; Asian
profits increased from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 20.8m; Africa from Pounds
14.6m to Pounds 17.9m; and Chile from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 34.5m. Overall
building material profits rose from Pounds 96.8m to Pounds 137.7m; home
products contributed Pounds 64.4m (Pounds 60.2m).

FT  15 APR 94 / Schneider faced with allegations of fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank and the Frankfurt prosecutor's office yesterday launched
separate legal actions against Mr Jurgen Schneider, the missing businessman
at the centre of the crisis surrounding the large German property group
which bears his name.
Their allegations of fraud added to speculation about the reasons for the
disappearance on Friday of 59-year-old Mr Schneider.
Deutsche Bank, the biggest creditor to the property group, alleges Mr
Schneider deliberately falsified financial information when seeking a loan
for a property development in the Frankfurt city centre. The bank, which has
financed eight of Mr Schneider's developments, also alleges Mr Schneider
doctored documents when applying to finance the Zeil-Galerie shopping arcade
in the city centre.
The Frankfurt prosecutor's office said Mr Schneider had 'obviously fled
abroad'. Sources suggested he told colleagues working at the castle
headquarters of the group in Konigstein, in the Taunus hills near Frankfurt,
that he was going to Tuscany for Easter.
Creditor banks, owed an estimated DM5bn (Pounds 2bn), said last night after
a four-hour meeting in Frankfurt that there was no future for the Schneider
group. However, they committed themselves to an orderly solution, short of
insolvency.
This would mean the step-by-step sale of some of the group's properties, the
banks said, together with job cuts. Creditor banks would oversee the task.
The bankers said the group's difficulties were not representative of the
situation in the German property market as a whole. They had been caused by
'mistakes and deficits particular to this one company'.
The bankers met following a warning on Wednesday from Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, not to push the group into bankruptcy which could affect jobs
throughout Germany's major cities.
The group's total liabilities are believed to be in the region of DM9bn, of
which DM4bn is owed to trade creditors, mainly small businesses. Reflecting
the government's concern about the crisis, a taskforce headed by Mr Gunther
Rexrodt, economics minister, started to assemble data on the impact of
Schneider's problems on small businesses.

FT  15 APR 94 / Finger points at banks after Procter's gamble: Tracy
Corrigan looks at the impact of a threat to sue over swap losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new dimension has been added to the range of risks associated with trading
derivative instruments, already the source of sleepless nights for
regulators, intermediaries and their clients.
Earlier this week, Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group,
threatened to take legal action against Bankers Trust over losses it
incurred on interest rate swaps marketed by the bank. In the wake of a
Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m) after-tax charge in the company's first-quarter
results, this has prompted concern among banks that they could be vulnerable
to a new type of legal risk: litigation by companies which have lost money
on complex derivative instruments such as swaps and options.
The grounds for such an action are unclear, however, and Procter &amp; Gamble
has declined to expand on its chairman's statement that: 'We are seriously
considering our legal options relative to Bankers Trust.'
One American lawyer said: 'The obvious difficulty for P&amp;G is that in theory
they are a sophisticated user, not a widow or orphan. But it may be that
certain representations were made by Bankers Trust, perhaps some kind of
undertaking to help manage the risk.'
Bankers Trust, however, claims it 'formally recommended that Procter &amp;
Gamble limit its risk by unwinding all or part of the transactions. Senior
officials rejected these recommendations.'
But one corporate treasurer said he was puzzled by P&amp;G's use of 'geared'
swaps, which are more risky than normal swaps. 'Why did Bankers Trust sell
them this sort of product?' he wondered, noting that it was an unusual type
of instrument for a company to use.
Whether or not any action goes ahead, the incident has raised the issue of
how much hand-holding a bank should do.
'They are obliged to inform companies of the effect of changing market
conditions, but not obliged to reveal complex formulae, because that is
proprietary information,' according to Ms Maureen Erasmus, a partner of
Cooper &amp; Lybrand's global risk management practice.
She points out that many companies have lost money on derivatives because
they have failed to take account of the tax implications. While this may not
seem to be a bank's responsibility, some derivatives are specifically
marketed for tax purposes.
The fact is that law on derivatives is a rather grey area, precisely because
the rapid growth of the market has outstripped the development of a legal
framework.
'I would have not have thought there was any basis to sue where
sophisticated grown- up companies are involved,' said Mr Alan Newton,
partner and head of derivatives at Freshfields, a London law firm. 'I think
it would be a very difficult argument to get off the ground, unless the
financial institution had some sort of advisory role. It wouldn't normally
be the case that the intermediary has any obligation to explain risk.'
However, in the US, where companies tend to be more litigious a number of
cases have been brought. City Colleges of Chicago has filed a suit against
National Western Life Insurance's broker-dealer unit, alleging it wrongfully
sold the college system Dollars 100m of collateralised mortgage obligations
(CMOS), risky securities which it alleges were unsuitable for its investment
portfolio. And Marion Merrell Dow, this week filed a lawsuit against fund
manager David Askin, alleging improper handling of its investments.
However, in these cases the claimants can invoke federal securities law,
which does not cover swaps because they are privately negotiated contracts.
The Procter &amp; Gamble move has awakened painful memories for London bankers
of the UK local authorities swaps debacle in the 1980s, which left banks
facing losses of Pounds 600m when councils were found to have acted outside
their powers in using these instruments. Some banks were also criticised for
encouraging councils to take highly speculative positions.
Mr Geoffrey Isaac, chairman of MTM Partnership, which advises international
companies on treasury management, says as a result, 'there has been a lot of
tightening in the way these things are marketed'.
Whether or not Bankers Trust is sued, the crux of the matter - as in
virtually every case of large corporate losses, from Allied Lyons' Pounds
150m to Metallgesellschaft's roughly Dollars 1bn - is that internal controls
were broken. Procter &amp; Gamble has already admitted that the policies and
procedures governing the control of swaps 'simply weren't followed in these
two isolated swaps'.
While this admission may be enough to scupper any potential action, it could
still spark further attempts to gain redress for what can be painful losses.
'It certainly has the potential to become a growing area of litigation
because of the size of the losses and the reliance that clients may be
putting on the expertise of financial intermediaries,' said Mr Thomas
Siebens, a partner at Milbank Tweed Hadley and McCloy, the US law firm.

FT  15 APR 94 / Forte sees rise in corporate custom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte, the hotel and restaurant group, yesterday announced full- year
pre-tax profits of Pounds 121m, down from Pounds 164m, and said it had seen
little improvement in the economies in which it operated.
Mr Rocco Forte, chairman, said UK consumer spending was still fragile, but
the group was now seeing an increase in business from corporate customers.
Sales for the year to January 31 were Pounds 2.1bn, against Pounds 2.7bn.
Continuing operations improved 11 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn.
The final dividend of 4.75p gives a total of 7.5p, unchanged from last year
when the payout was cut for the first time in two decades. The dividend was
uncovered by earnings per share of 6.8p before exceptional items, or 10.2p
afterwards.
The net exceptional gain of Pounds 34m followed a profit of Pounds 122m from
the flotation last January of 75 per cent of Alpha Airports Group and the
sale of its 50 per cent stake in Kentucky Fried Chicken. However, there was
a charge of Pounds 88m related to the downward valuation of properties and
fixed assets. A further Pounds 324m was offset against the revaluation
reserve, bringing the total write-down to Pounds 412m.
Forte said it normally revalued its properties by rotation every three
years. Under procedures introduced last year, it supplemented this with a
further review of all its property values. As a result of this year's
exercise, its property and fixed assets were now valued at Pounds 3.4bn,
representing sums at which it was likely assets could be sold within a
reasonable period.
Pre-tax profits before exceptionals were up 23 per cent at Pounds 87m.
The proceeds of the Alpha sale had reduced net borrowings to Pounds 1.05bn.
Gearing was 43 per cent.
While occupancies rose at Forte's UK hotels, rates were hit by strong
competition. Room rates in London fell 6 per cent, but a 9 percentage point
increase in occupancy proraised profits 30 per cent. Mr Forte said London
room rates had improved in the first few months of this year.
In provincial UK hotels, room rates fell 2 per cent last year, but a 3 point
rise in occupancy produced a 12 per cent advance in profits.
Elsewhere in Europe, a decline in Italy was partly offset by new hotel
openings in Malta and Warsaw.
The UK motorway service restaurants saw lower volumes, but enjoyed an
increase in spending per head. The Relais motorway business in France
suffered from the downturn in the French economy. However, the acquisition
of the business in 1992 had been earnings enhancing.

FT  15 APR 94 / VCR deal averts clash on standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A costly battle over the design of the next generation of video cassette
recorders has been averted by an agreement on technical standards between
the world's leading consumer electronics companies.
The accord, reached in Tokyo yesterday by the 50 members of the HD Digital
VCR Conference, is expected to head off a standards war of the kind that
marred the introduction of analogue video recorders.
Sony had led the way with its Betamax format, but eventually had to concede
defeat to JVC, which was more successful in persuading video film suppliers
to use its VHS standard.
Mr Andrew House of Sony, acting as spokesman for the conference, said in
Tokyo that digital technology would change the VCR industry 'in the same way
that digital has changed the music business by replacing vinyl records with
compact discs'.
Other members of the HD Digital VCR Conference include Matsushita and
Toshiba of Japan, Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France. The
computer companies IBM and Apple of the US are members because digital VCRs
can be used to store computer data.
The standards are for high-definition digital VCRs, which use the binary
digits ('bits') of computer language rather than analogue signals to record
images and sounds. Digital VCRs will give greatly improved picture quality
and make for cleaner tape copies.
Industry executives believe digital VCRs could be in the shops as early as
next year. They are expected, however, to be expensive, with some estimates
putting the cost of a machine at up to Dollars 3,000 (Pounds 2,055).
The new machines will use tapes about two-thirds the size of a conventional
VHS cassette with 4 1/2 hours recording time.

FT  15 APR 94 / Whitehall roles under scrutiny: Pressure grows to move
insurance regulation from DTI to Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury is actively looking at taking over responsibilities from other
Whitehall departments in order to create a single administrative structure
covering investment and financial regulation.
It would involve taking on the Department of Trade and Industry's role in
prudential supervision of the insurance industry.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is also eyeing the Department of Social
Security's responsibility for personal and occupational pensions policy.
'The issue is on the agenda,' one official admitted. The last shift of
responsibilities in this area came in the summer of 1992, when the Treasury
took on the oversight of financial services.
The argument behind the move then was that it made sense for the regulation
to come within a single department.
But there was some criticism at the time that it still left companies
dealing with more than one ministry.
Recent lobbying about the future form of regulation in retail financial
services, for example, gave life companies an opportunity to try to play off
the DTI against the Treasury - which is strongly committed to the new
Personal Investment Authority.
One of the factors in the revival of the issue is the current inquiry by the
cross-party treasury and civil service committee of MPs into financial
regulation.
The committee raised the continuing division of responsibilities when it
took evidence from Mr Anthony Nelson, the junior Treasury minister, last
year.
Officials believe it is likely to recommend the change when it makes its
report. Though work is in hand on the implications of possible changes, no
transfer would take place without the consent of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary.
The timing of any move in relation to the DSS would also be complicated
because of the changes as a result of the report of the Goode committee on
occupational pension law reform.
Legislation on this is expected to be brought forward in the parliamentary
session that begins in the autumn.

FT  15 APR 94 / Delta-Virgin pact may help UK revive 'open skies' talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government is expected to use Virgin Atlantic's deal with Delta Air
Lines as a lever to revive 'open skies' negotiations with the US.
The US walked away from the talks in January after rejecting UK proposals
for a gradual three-stage liberalisation of air services between the two
countries. Washington insisted on immediate access for all US carriers into
London's Heathrow air-port.
But the partnership announced this week by Virgin and Delta, the third
biggest US carrier which has been vigorously campaigning for access into
Heathrow, appears to have strengthened Britain's hand in bringing the US
back to the negotiating table.
Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, is expected to hold preliminary
talks with Mr Federico Pena, his US counterpart, during the next 10 days to
discuss the Virgin-Delta deal. Both governments must approve the partnership
which would give the US carrier access to Heathrow through ticket
code-sharing and seats-sale agreements with Virgin.
The UK is likely to insist that its approval for the code-sharing will hinge
on resolving the broader issues in the stalled 'open skies' negotiations. Mr
MacGregor is also expected to make new proposals to the US in an effort to
resolve the deadlock.
The UK is seeking the relaxation of current US restrictions on foreign
ownership of US airlines as well as wider access into the US domestic
market. But it has so far not been prepared to open up immediately access to
all US carriers into Heathrow, which under the existing regime can only be
served by United Airlines and American Airlines.
Virgin said last night it had had contacts with the UK government before
announcing its deal with Delta, which in turn had discussions with Mr Pena.
'We feel very confident that the deal will be approved because it is in the
interest of consumers as well as for both the US and UK airline industries,'
Mr Richard Branson, Virgin chairman, said last night.

FT  15 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Axa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After yesterday's solid full-year figures, it might seem strange that Axa
has underperformed the French equity market by 20 per cent in the last six
months. The profits recovery at the Equitable of the US is stronger than
expected when Axa bought its 49 per cent stake in 1991. In Europe, the
cyclical upswing in insurance markets is starting to help. Since insurance
premiums are still rising in France, and Axa's London market operation is
only just climbing back into profit, the recovery has some way to run.
Yet by buying into the Equitable, Axa now generates 40 per cent of its
premium income in the US. The impact of rising interest rates on the
Equitable's life insurance business - and Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the
investment bank which contributed most of last year's US profits - is a
reason for caution. The optimistic forecasts which pushed Axa's shares ahead
last year have now been scaled back.
Besides, while stock and bond markets are falling, investors are probably
more concerned with asset values than earnings. Last year's bull market in
bonds more than offset a FFr4bn write-down in the value of Axa's property
portfolio. But while the pain in property has now been taken, falling
securities markets are still a threat. Until the shadow of a global bear
market has been lifted, Axa will probably continue to trade at a substantial
discount to net assets.

FT  15 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Blue Circle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Blue Circle's results add further ballast to the argument that the company
took the wrong route in the late 1980s by diversifying into home products.
The vibrant profits growth in heavy building materials provides a marked
contrast to the lacklustre progress made in home products, where operating
margins are only half those attained elsewhere. The Pounds 11m burn mark
resulting from Blue Circle's failed diversification into incineration
equipment throws up a fresh embarrassment.
Not only has diversification dulled the group's recovery, it has also meant
the company has missed opportunities to expand its international cement
interests, slipping steadily down the global rankings over the past decade.
Global scale is certainly not an absolute prerequisite for success. Local
market dominance is perhaps a more critical determinant of profitability.
But the strong performance of Blue Circle's cement businesses in Chile and
Malaysia shows how it is actually rather good at finding fruitful expansion
avenues overseas.
The relatively new management can hardly be blamed for past mistakes.
Indeed, it now exhibits a commendable determination to make existing assets
work harder. Volume and price rises for cement in the US and the UK should
push profits strongly this year. The hope is that the cost-cutting efforts
in home products should bear fruit thereafter. Perhaps that would be the
moment to demerge the division altogether and refocus all efforts on doing
what Blue Circle does best.

FT  15 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The good news from Forte is that trading has finally started to improve, at
least in its London hotels where occupancy rates have risen and the bargain
hunters are being squeezed out. The bad news is that there is a long way
still to go before the company is lifted off interest cover of just 1.8
times. Even after last year's reduction, the dividend is still not covered
by earnings before exceptional items. The annual results show the cash
position remains tight. Indeed there would have been a substantial outflow
in 1993-94 without the impact of disposals, lower capital spending and last
year's enhanced scrip dividend.
Forte argues, probably rightly, that it can live with this situation a while
longer. There is more recovery to come and the company has yet to reap the
full benefits of its new management structure. Capital spending will have to
rise this year, though, and that in turn will have to be financed by
disposals. At least the write-down of its hotel portfolio, which is in
striking contrast with Queens Moat's upwards revaluation, will add to its
flexibility in selling surplus hotels. Forte could even afford to finance
any Meridien deal with debt by ear-marking the proceeds from an eventual
sale of its remaining minority stakes in Alpha Airports Group and Gardner
Merchant.
But this still leaves the impression of living from hand to mouth. It
requires an act of faith to believe that Forte will achieve a worthwhile
return on assets or that it will trade its way out of debt. Having sold its
cash-generative catering businesses, the group is more vulnerable. A
historic multiple of more than 35 before exceptionals leaves no room for
error.

FT  15 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Hostage to fortune
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even allowing for the Bundesbank's fondness of wrong-footing financial
markets, the timing of yesterday's discount rate cut is difficult to fathom.
With money supply and inflation figures due next week, the central bank
appears to have made itself a hostage to fortune. Perhaps the authorities
already have an inkling of the likely data. Either way, the collapse of the
Schneider property empire is a reminder of the pain still being suffered by
German companies and banks. While there does not appear to be any systemic
danger arising from the collapse, that may have been enough to swing the
council behind a quarter-point cut.
The worry for financial markets accustomed to half-point cuts is that a
smaller reduction might signal the beginning of the end. By setting a
variable rate repurchase tender next week, the Bundesbank appears to be
signalling that money market rates will drift lower for the time being. The
70 basis point gap between the money market repurchase and discount rates
leaves plenty of room for that. If the central bank expects inflation to
fall below 3 per cent in the second half of this year, real interest rates
will rise without further action. Lower short rates will also be required to
shepherd investors out along the yield curve, as the Bundesbank remains keen
to do.
Such arguments point to a gently falling repurchase rate for some time yet.
The reaction of the foreign exchange markets yesterday - the D-Mark actually
strengthened against the dollar - suggests that the currency presents no
obstacle.

FT  15 APR 94 / A fortress would be no defence: Europe must choose
decentralisation and liberal trade, not harmonisation and protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Can we (west Europeans) take it for granted that we will remain sufficient
leaders in a sufficient number of sectors to survive - in the face of
countries with populations infinitely larger than ours and with levels of
social protection infinitely smaller? I say we should leave this to the
market, but only up to a certain point. What is the market? It is the law of
the jungle, the law of nature. And what is civilisation? It is the struggle
against nature' - Edouard Balladur, prime minister of France, Financial
Times, December 31 1993
Mr Balladur's very French perspective on the relation between market and
state is wrong. It is wrong, partly because the market is a sophisticated
mechanism, whose functioning depends on civilised social restraints. If
anything, it is the state that needs to be civilised. In the European Union,
treaty articles enshrining principles of competition were the chosen way to
contain the destructive proclivities of European nation states. To see what
happens when states try to 'civilise' the market, look at the common
agricultural policy, which has created a trading jungle.
Mr Balladur's view is more than wrong. It is also dangerous. The collapse of
communism offers a unique opportunity to develop a prosperous and liberal
global economy. As the world's largest single trading entity, the EU must
play a central role in securing this opportunity. The question is whether it
will. If it pays too much attention to the fears voiced by Mr Balladur, it
will not.
Historically, the EU's approach to international trade has been a compromise
which can best be labelled 'managed liberalism'. In this, the Union has
largely followed the US, combining large reductions in average tariffs with
the introduction of non-tariff barriers and reliance on measures of
contingent protection, such as anti-dumping.
The special feature of US trade policy is self-righteous pursuit of
'fairness'; in EU policy, it has been an addiction to discrimination. To
trade with the EU on a most-favoured basis is, in fact, to be among its
least favoured partners. Fortunately, the damage of discrimination has been
limited by EU participation in major international trade negotiations, the
most recent being the Uruguay Round, finalised in Marrakesh today. The
agreement with the US to liberalise public procurement announced this week
is another example.
That is the past. What of the future? Unhappily, powerful forces may push
the post-Maastricht-treaty EU in a more protectionist direction. There are
three closely related pressures: a desire to contain the forces of policy
competition among states; growing pressure from a dynamic world economy on
the faltering European one; and the aim of cementing a nascent European
political identity.
European states impose relatively high taxes and tight regulations on their
economies. The share of public spending in gross domestic product in France
or Germany is some 20 percentage points higher than in Japan, for example.
Similarly, direct taxation of labour in these two states is some 25 per cent
of GDP, against 15 per cent in Japan. High taxes and stiff regulations are
threatened by free movement of goods, services and factors of production.
This is why regulatory harmonisation was a theme of the Maastricht treaty.
Countries with high taxes and regulatory standards insist they be adopted by
poor countries with which they trade freely. The latter then demand
transfers to compensate them for the costs they are required to bear. But
the logic demanding internal harmonisation entails either the extension of
that principle worldwide or, failing that, plain protection.
Liberal trade also multiplies the costs and visibility of policy-induced
distortions. In the EU, the most important such distortions lie in the
labour market. Unemployment has been rising cycle-by-cycle over two decades.
Worse, between 1960 and 1993, employment grew by almost 90 per cent in North
America, by well over 40 per cent in Japan and by a mere 10 per cent in the
EU. Worse still, while 80 per cent of employment growth in North America
over the past two decades has been in the private sector, two-thirds of what
little growth there has been in the EU has been in the public sector. Many
of these are not jobs. They are transfers. Growing supplies of
labour-intensive manufactures threaten to worsen the EU's employment
problem.
Finally, there is the aim of political integration. The European states are
divided by language, culture and historical sympathies. How are they to be
united? Historically, mercantilism - the combination of internal free trade
with protection at the borders - helped overcome similar barriers in the
emerging European nation states. Nothing would be more natural than for a
nascent European super-state to enhance integration by underplaying internal
differences and emphasising external ones. This approach could be justified
by the need to regain the economic sovereignty allegedly lost by individual
member states.
How are such pressures to be resisted? Partly by argument. The starting
point must be the costs of protection. Perhaps the most significant is the
damage to export performance done by inward-looking liberalisation. Between
1980 and 1991 the value of the EU's internal trade in manufactures rose 167
per cent, but its external exports increased only by 79 per cent, far behind
the increases of 129 per cent achieved by the US and 146 per cent by Japan.
It is no less important to understand that harmonisation is not a
precondition for liberal trade. Rather, diversity should be welcomed as a
potential source of gains. This is partly because competition among
different regulatory regimes constrains the state by making the effects of
its interventions more transparent. But it is also because such diversity is
a natural reflection of differences among countries in their wealth,
resources and values.
Even the concern about low-wage labour must be kept in perspective. Trade
has had less effect on the earnings of the unskilled than technology. More
important, protection is an ultimately self-defeating way of preserving
unskilled labour's earnings. Far better would be a mixture of more
investment in education with subsidies to - or less taxation of - unskilled
labour.
A Europe of harmonisation, of regulation, of centralised political
decision-making is likely to become a protectionist Europe. The logic urging
harmonisation of labour standards demands their worldwide extension.
Policies leading to poor economic performance prompt a demand for protection
at the border. Finally, political integration may demand reinforcement of a
sense that Europeans are the embattled minority described by Mr Balladur.
The EU is economically valuable because it has forced member states to
follow more liberal economic policies. Its large economic size is not itself
an important source of gain, as the contrast between the high incomes per
head of tiny Singapore or Taiwan with the poverty of China suggests. Size
does not justify self-sufficiency. Europe's choices must be decentralisation
and liberal trade, not harmonisation and protectionism. On that depends the
future of its struggling economy. On that, too, depend the prospects for
harmonious economic development worldwide.

FT  15 APR 94 / Personal View: Breaking the spiral of corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURENCE COCKCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transnational bribery in pursuit of arms deals, large construction projects
and even consultancy contracts is a growing phenomenon in the global
economy. In the UK there has been the furore triggered by allegations about
the Pergau Dam affair. Rather less attention, though, was paid in 1993 to
the 'Foxley' case, in which an official in the Ministry of Defence was found
guilty of having accepted Pounds 1.5m in bribes (in 1984) from armaments
companies in Italy, Germany and Norway.
In Europe until the 1990s indirect or direct corruption of officials and
politicians in the south by companies in the north was considered a part of
the 'cultural norm' of the south.
Some companies avoided the phenomenon by insisting on a 'no bribes' internal
code of conduct; multilateral development institutions chose to believe that
the bidding procedures they required client countries in the south to use
were foolproof.
Such attitudes are bolstered throughout the European Union by provision for
all transnational bribes to be tax deductible when shown as necessary
expenditure for the generation of business, and by the legal doctrine of
'extra territoriality', by which national citizens cannot be pursued for
paying bribes in other countries. Yet, nationally, nearly all EU member
states have made bribery (both of public officials and between companies) a
criminal activity for most of this century. In contrast, the US passed tough
legislation placing transnational bribery on the same criminal footing as
domestic bribery in 1977.
This double-think in the EU (and Japan) is no longer tenable. First, the
global market regulated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
requires a convergence of ethical and business standards if its 'fair trade'
assumptions are to be sustained.
Second, the 1993 impeachments of the presidents of Venezuela and Brazil and
the political crises of Japan and Italy have shown the potentially
disastrous effect of widespread corruption on political and economic
stability.
Third, the growth of multi-party democracies in former one-party states has
placed the issue high on the political agenda in many countries of the south
and the 'east'. Finally, the link between corruption and non-development,
particularly in Africa, is no longer contes-table.
What can be done? The key, as with drugs trafficking, is to recognise
business bribery as an international crime. Transnational bribers could then
be pursued either in the courts of their home country, or in the courts of
the country where the briber sought to influence decision making, or in a
third country where the bribe may have been paid. International conventions
 -as with the 1993 Council of Europe convention on money laundering - are
designed to ensure the possibility of global action and such a convention
was prepared by a sub-committee of the Economic and Social Council of the UN
in 1979, but never submitted to the General Assembly. It should be revived.
More immediately, OECD governments should support tough measures in the
current OECD working party on illicit practices which will meet later this
month to make a series of recommendations to ministers of finance. The EU
members of the OECD, strengthened by the judicial provisions of the
Maastricht treaty, could move rapidly to legislate against transnational
bribery within the EU and negotiate mutual agreements with other countries.
The leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, meeting
in June, could pledge their commitment to a UN and/or Gatt convention.
Multilateral and bilateral aid officials could standardise a global code of
conduct for aid contractors.
All of these measures, or a combination of some of them, would make it
easier for reform-minded political leaders to take an effective stand. There
is currently an assumption that no large deal can be completed in many
countries of the south without a bribe being paid. This assumption can only
be broken with the co-operation of the north, which reform-minded leaders in
the south are actively seeking.
Such co-operation is achievable, and at no cost in aid terms. In the medium
term it would increase world gross domestic product by reducing the cost of
many large investment projects by up to 25 per cent, without reducing the
net return to international contractors. It would also be a significant step
in the development of a global business ethic, a vital concomitant to a
positive global business environment.

Should HSBC shareholders be concerned about this week's defections from
Midland Global Markets? Vib Baxi, who had made a lot of money for the bank's
own account in last year's obligingly bullish fixed income markets, and
Gerry Reynolds, who was mysteriously put in his place as head of proprietary
trading last December, have both packed their bags, destination unknown.
There's been a wrangle about bonuses, but some in the City are convinced
that there are some possible hefty losses too. MGM would hardly be alone if
it had dropped a cent or two in the first quarter of this year, a time of
extraordinary volatility since the Federal Reserve raised its rates. But
clearing banks are not supposed to behave in quite the rash way hedge funds
do.
Whether or not Baxi and colleagues have suffered what the rumour mongers
suggest, people who earn bonuses on positions that subsequently turn sour
can expect unsympathetic glances from their pals.
The HSBC balance sheet has easily accommodated some spectacular losses in
the past. But it might be worth shareholders raising the odd question at the
annual meeting on May 27.

Even Singapore's highly disciplined workers are not immune to taking the
occasional unauthorised day off. Singapore International Airlines has become
so concerned about absenteeism that it's introduced a demerit system for
offenders. SIA says numbers reporting sick on the eve of public holidays and
holidays had risen to 'unrealistic levels'.
Thus, in an airline version of the soccer card system, errant staff will be
penalised two points for a second such offence and four points for third or
fourth offences. Demerit points are also given for other disciplinary
lapses, like arriving late for a flight or being without a valid passport.
If staff accumulate eight or more points in a two-year period, they will be
hauled up before an official inquiry. The only surprise is that SIA hasn't
introduced the system for naughty passengers too.

The man from Ivantheterribleograd - Vladimir Zhirinovsky - is under fire
from Boris Fyodorov, Russia's pugnacious former finance minister. Fyodorov
is renaming his 26-member 'December 12' parliamentary faction the 'Liberal
Democratic Union' - not a million miles away from Vlad the impaler's
'Liberal Democratic party'.
'Somebody has to challenge him,' says Fyodorov, narked that Zhirinovsky's
party name connotes values somewhat removed from its neo-fascist ideology.
Boris hopes that by the 1996 elections, voters may choose the Liberal
Democratic Union - from confusion if not conviction.
Boris adds: 'I'd love Zhirinovsky to try to hit me,' recalling Vlad's
previous punch-ups, including one over his alleged queue-jumping in the
parliament's restaurant.
Zhirinovsky clearly espouses free market attitudes nowadays. In France
yesterday, having lost his cap at a meeting of the Council of Europe, he
advised the thief 'not to sell it straightaway, because the price of my hats
will increase enormously in the near future'.

Of course, Bill Clinton would never say a bad word in public about Bob

Bentsen's seat, often voted against his president, though both are
Democrats. True, Krueger got thrashed by Kay Bailey Hutchison last year,
giving the Lone Star state far too Republican a look and the Senate a
smaller Democratic majority.
Such political adroitness is deserving of its own special rewards: thus Bob
Krueger has just been nominated as the next US ambassador to Burundi.

Bewilderment in the wake of Lancer Boss's decline into receivership is
nowhere greater than at the company's Spanish subsidiary, Boss Espana.
Employees at the factory in Barcelona complain they have been left not only
in the dark but also without a boss. Their two senior managers, both
British, have not been seen since the receivership decision on Friday.
For want of any further instructions, the company's 180-strong workforce is
dutifully carrying on producing trucks - while trying to talk to Grant
Thornton. The receivers however maintain that the Spanish operation is not
itself in administration, and that the UK company would like to establish a
commercial relationship with Boss Espana as a separate entity. Only problem
is, with Barcelona Boss remaining bossless, who does Leighton Buzzard Boss
deal with? Even the receiver had to admit that it was a 'complex' situation.

FT  15 APR 94 / Leading Article: Ukraine adrift after elections
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The results of the Ukrainian elections could be worse, but not much. There
has appeared no Ukrainian Zhirinovsky who would lead the country in a quest
for national purity and inevitable war with Russia. The communists and their
allies are not likely to be a majority in the parliament after a third round
of voting. Conflicts over the Black Sea Fleet and the Crimean peninsula are
so far localised and are being managed, albeit with many alarms.
But the results have shown a country divided and confused over several
central issues. Where the previous parliament and presidency were unable to
agree on anything and reluctant to confront each other, the new assembly
threatens to make matters significantly worse. The country lacks a modern
constitution, relying on a patched-up Soviet document which leaves moot the
vital matter of division of powers. President Leonid Kravchuk, who over the
past three years has at least provided some stability and continuity - at
the cost of an insupportable inertia on economic or any other reform - has
dithered fatally over his future intentions. He is now demanding a strong
presidency as his condition for standing for re-election, a condition
unlikely to be granted him by the new Rada.
Complete collapse
Ukraine's disputes with Russia - over the Black Sea Fleet, the status of
Crimea, the supply of Russian gas and the payment of Ukraine's vast debt to
Russia - are coming to a head at the same time as the parliamentary results
are coming in. All demand very tough decisions from a power structure now
even less capable of making them. The dominant view in the parliament
probably favours closer ties with Russia and an attempt to revive the old
command economy. But the west of the country has returned a number of
deputies who are intransigently hostile to such a strategy and who could
become not just a fierce opposition but a prey to extreme, even violent
strategies.
Economics overshadows everything. In Ukraine the official figures show
complete collapse. Even correcting these with the unreported and apparently
quite large 'black' sector, the economy is in a crisis so deep that any
effort to reform it will not produce a significant improvement in miserable
general living standards for some years to come - an approach which has no
political champion.
Greater priority
Is there anything the west can do about all this? Only at the edges. The
trilateral agreement between Russia, Ukraine and the US on the dispatch to
Russia of nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine in return for enriched
Russian uranium has so far worked well, and might provide a model for the
solution of other conflicts. The newly evident concern by western countries,
particularly the US, to give Ukraine greater priority in assistance,
diluting the former policy of 'Russia first', should be continued. The
international financial institutions, which have been engaged in largely
fruitless dialogues with the Ukrainian authorities for more than two years,
are clearly anxious to lend if they can find a glimmer of hope for continued
reforms like that which the International Monetary Fund found in Russia. But
with these important if limited exceptions, foreigners can only sit and
watch.
The most important outside determinant of Ukraine's future will be Russia.
So far, it has been relatively restrained - always willing to strike an
agreement and avert a showdown. Even this week, with tensions running high
over the Black Sea fleet, the response has been to send a senior delegation
for talks in Kiev.
Russia would be wise to continue to show restraint. However inflamed local
tensions become, Moscow has a strong interest in preventing them from
spreading and in making an accommodation with its much weaker neighbour.
This means finding mechanisms to deal with the debt and a workable
compromise on the Black Sea fleet. Above all, it means not giving
encouragement to those on the Crimean peninsula who agitate for union with
Russia. It may be a tall order for a harassed nation, but unless it is
filled, the danger of outright conflict, with incalculable consequences for
Europe, can only grow.

The inherent conflict between the interests of shareholders and consumers in
privatised utilities makes it inevitable that there will be a continual
debate about regulation. It is, at present in Britain, a rather noisier
debate than usual. Not only have some utilities been calling for a radical
overhaul of the regulatory regime; two leading institutional investors,
Prudential and Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, are pressing
water companies to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if their
regulator's new price limits turn out to be tough. Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director-general of fair trading, has now stepped in with a warning against
over-ambitious reform of the system. On the whole, Sir Bryan has the better
arguments.
While shareholders and consumers have both done well out of the utilities
since privatisation, it is the shareholders who have had the better deal.
The government was insufficiently ambitious, early on, in introducing
competition into hitherto monopolistic industries; pricing formulas did not
take into account the full scope for efficiency gains. Now that the pricing
arrangements have been tightened and increased competition brought to bear,
both management and investors feel uncomfortable. That is precisely what
ought to be happening. There is no reason why customers should, in the words
of Mr Ian Byatt of Ofwat, find themselves on 'an endless price escalator'.
Nor should the utilities be an engine of inflation in the wider economy.
Regulatory improvement
That is not to say that there is no room for regulatory improvement. The
regulators have frequently been accused of a lack of openness in their
deliberations over the industries' affairs. That, admittedly, could not be
said of Mr Byatt in his protracted and well publicised review of prices.
Indeed institutional investors would not be in a position to question his
methodology if it had been otherwise. But there remains a wider question
about formalising procedures for disclosure and scrutiny of the regulatory
process.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, has argued in the
Financial Times for a clearer definition of the role and objectives of
regulation, together with a quick appeals procedure to an ad hoc panel of
the MMC. He and others have called for the replacement of a single regulator
with a tribunal of between three and five members, along with the creation
of a single joint utilities regulator and a monitoring process to measure
regulatory performance against goals.
Greater transparency
It is hard to disagree with those proposals that call for transparency. In
capital-intensive industries with long investment pay-back periods there is
a premium on predictability and the reduction of regulatory risk. Whether
wider upheavals are called for is the more contentious issue.
In practice the supposed 'cult of personality' among the watchdogs, which
was probably necessary in the early days of privatisation when powerful
industrial barons were reluctant to submit to a new regulatory regime, is on
the wane. It is not obvious that there would be great synergy in combining
the regulation of industries as different as telecommunications and water. A
fruitful dialogue between the regulators already exists; and there is a risk
that an element of competition between different watchdogs, a benefit of
present diversity, would be lost.
Moreover, an all-powerful, high-profile regulatory giant might be more
susceptible to political pressure than the present plurality of watchdogs.
The same worry would arise with tribunals if their membership was open to
the representatives of specific interests. A fast-track appeals procedure to
the MMC has more appeal. But the danger here might be that the present
trench warfare between conflicting interests would become institutionalised
in a destructive fashion.
On balance the present system has worked surprisingly well, avoiding the
standard pitfalls of regulatory capture and excessive legalism of the kind
that dogs US utilities regulation. A steady evolution thus looks more
desirable at this stage than a radical overhaul. But the legitimacy of the
evolutionary approach would be enhanced by a regular review of the
regulatory process. The Office of Fair Trading is the appropriate body for
this task.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a quality management consultant dealing with a large number of small
professional practices, I agree with many of the concerns expressed in your
article, 'Seeking credibility for quality standards' (April 12). It is a
fact that many small firms are being forced by their clients to comply with
BS 5750, and of course they will be looking to achieve certification as
simply and quickly as they can.
However, almost without exception, our clients have found that the
discipline imposed by formalising procedures and the feed-back and review
stipulated by the standard have led to improvements to internal management
efficiency and to the quality of service being provided.

FT  15 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Gummer policies will not improve
urban life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL ORCHARD-LISLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Gummer, the secretary of state for the environment, has made much
of his intention to promote the town centre as the right place for new
shopping developments. As a concept his thinking deserves support, but
delivery is a separate matter.
He would have little to complain about if his ideas were to be defeated by
the shopping public or by retailers. But it is his own department and his
neighbours at the Department of Transport whose policies are the most likely
to destroy his vision.
Mr Gummer's difficulties lie in access to markets. High-street retailers and
shopping centres must compete for consumers' spending power - the most
accessible and pleasant will be the winner.
That is the crux of the problem. The Department of Transport has no money
for big road initiatives in town centres, and the Department of the
Environment says that money collected for the uniform business rate will not
be returned to the local authorities to enable them to improve shopping
environments, facilities such as car parking, or public transport networks.
On this basis Mr Gummer's policies should be seen for what they are -
protection of the countryside and not the advancement of urban life.

FT  15 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tecs - not so easy, not so bad (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report laments the departure of so many chief executives of the
new Tecs. More than a third are said to have resigned or been sacked since
Tecs were established four years ago. The high turnover is ascribed to
failures in the recruitment policy of Tec boards.
Surely it is more worthy of comment that two-thirds of incumbents are still
in their posts four years later? This degree of stability is rare within the
private sector: the same edition of the paper notes the departure of two
American retailers from the top of UK companies within eight and a half
months and two and a half years. Our research, tracking the career moves of
more than 1,000 managers over 10 years, has shown that the average span of a
management job is close to three years: four years is a long time in
management.

FT  15 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tecs - not so easy, not so bad (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GREGORY HYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lisa Wood has highlighted several key issues in her article on Training
and Enterprise Councils ('Carnage of chiefs in Tecs battle', April 13 UK
edition, April 15 international). I see none of the existing Tec chief
executives was asked to comment, and neither were the 35 who have left. Not
really surprising, since there is no shortage of people who feel free to
point out how Tecs could be run better, without at the same time having the
troublesome need to try it out for themselves.
The issues are far more complex than your article suggests, and the problems
of Oldham Tec cannot be generalised across the Tec system. Not all those who
have departed were pushed out. In my own case I resigned because I felt too
much time was spent on negotiating arcane details with civil servants, and
not enough on getting the job done. In case that sounds too noble, I also
earn significantly more in my new role. Others left for different reasons.
Does the head-count include those chief executives who died in post, or
those who had to bow out with nervous frustration?
Make no mistake, the job to be done by Tecs is formidable. They are
attempting to reverse more than a century of national economic decline, and
to combat deeply entrenched positions. The weight of fire implicit in this
task falls on the shoulders of the Tec chief executive, and it is one of the
most demanding jobs around. But it is wrong to suggest that success or
failure rests on the chief executive alone. Tecs need to move into a more
sophisticated and effective mode, and the best Tec boards are starting with
their own development.
Those who are doing the job of Tec chief executive now are to be greatly
admired and deserve the strongest public support, but much more than an
individual will be needed for success.

FT  15 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nigeria firm in resolve against drug
trafficking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ALHAJI ABUBAKAR ALHAJI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, My attention has been drawn to your report, 'Nigeria accused over
drugs' (April 5), alleging official collusion in drug trafficking by some
Nigerians.
The Nigeria High Commission wishes to state emphatically that, contrary to
the erroneous impression contained in the report credited to Mr Robert
Gelbard, the US assistant secretary of state for international narcotics
affairs, the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has been
steadfast in its determined effort to combat drug trafficking and has put in
place adequate legal mechanisms stipulating stiff penalties with a view to
deterring usage and trafficking of drugs. Indeed, in a summary of a report
No 432 submitted to the US Congress, Nigeria was acknowledged and I quote:
'The government (Nigeria) does not as a matter of policy facilitate the
production or distribution of drugs or encourage money laundering.'
Therefore, the statement by the said US official is, to say the least, most
unfortunate since the government of Nigeria has readily co-operated with
foreign governments and, in fact, extended assistance that has led to the
apprehension and prosecution of many drug traffickers. It is, therefore,
surprising that the same US department that commended Nigeria for arresting
and turning over to American law enforcement authorities some suspected drug
traffickers wanted in the US should now, for political reasons, turn around
to make unsubstantiated allegations against the government.
It should be recalled that, when the government of Nigeria demonstrated its
abhorrence for drug trafficking by imposing capital punishment as a sanction
for such offences, it had to rescind that decision following an
international outcry.
Nevertheless, I would like to state for the benefit of any doubting Thomases
that the government of Nigeria remains open to suggestions from friendly
governments and stands ready to co-operate with all and sundry on ways and
means to combat the global drug menace.

FT  15 APR 94 / The axemen slumber: UK public spending is being curbed. Or
is it, asks James Blitz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, UK government ministers were promising a furious fight to cut
public expenditure any way they could. What happened to this much-heralded
review of the welfare state?
Last April, as official forecasts projected a public sector borrowing
requirement of Pounds 50bn for 1993-94, the Treasury announced one set of
Budget tax rises and prepared to unveil another in November. Departments
were told to curb running costs and pay levels, and in November's Budget,
which combined tax and spending decisions for the first time, a total of
about Pounds 15bn was lopped off the spending commitments of Whitehall
departments for the three financial years starting 1994-95.
But the ambitions of Mr John Major's government did not stop at a one-off
balancing of the books. It launched a campaign to reverse the growth in
public spending over the longer term, with 'fundamental expenditure reviews'
of departmental spending that would go well beyond traditional attempts to
match revenue and expenditure.
The reviews, announced with panache by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary
to the Treasury, would think the unthinkable about departmental policies,
starting with the departments of social security, education and health, and
the Home Office.
Their task was to test whether a particular programme should remain the
state's responsibility and whether waste could be squeezed. The goal, as Mr
Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, put it, was to ensure that the
growth in the welfare state did not outpace the nation's ability to pay for
it.
One year on, the review system is waning. No conclusions have been published
and few ministers talk about the process. There is a rolling programme of
departments under scrutiny - employment, transport, and trade and industry
were among those ministries added this year.
But this week, as cabinet ministers held their first meeting of the current
spending round, Treasury officials warned that public spending would still
easily overshoot projections made for the current financial year. Mr Norman
Lamont, the former chancellor who helped set up the reviews, speaks as if
they have already been buried, saying 'they should not be forgotten'. And
rightwing Tory backbenchers believe the government has lost its willingness
to use the reviews to cut deep into public spending.
'There is a feeling among colleagues that the reviews have run out of
steam,' says one Tory backbencher. 'If you look for where the cuts in
spending came in the last Budget, they were in holding down running costs
and public sector pay. There weren't enough signs that the need for services
was being questioned.'
Ministers take pride in some aspects of the review process. They claim that
the review of the social security department is playing a significant role
in containing the long-term growth of an Pounds 80bn annual budget.
Legislation next year to replace unemployment benefit with a 'jobseekers
allowance' will help social security officials target benefits more
precisely. So too will the replacement of invalidity benefit with incapacity
benefit (bringing a more objective test of applicants' fitness) and the
abolition of the subsidy paid to large companies to cover the cost of
statutory sick pay.
'These reforms were already in our sights,' says a Treasury official. 'But
we had not got them worked out properly, certainly not to the extent that
they would yield so much to the Exchequer. The review took these ideas and
worked them through in full.'
But it is far less clear what has been achieved elsewhere. The education
review has encouraged a shift from student grants to loans; the Home Office
review has studied whether private finance could be used to help build
prisons - a move that found its way into recent proposals by Mr Michael
Howard, the home secretary. But both these examples represent an extension
of existing policies, not radical departures. And many areas of heavy
spending appear untouched - for instance, the National Health Service drugs
budget.
As the Treasury official explains, many of the ideas in the reviews 'have
helped us to be more demanding over running costs rather than producing
identifiable policy changes'.
Why has the impact been so variable? Partly it is because the reviews are
led by the department concerned. Treasury officials on review steering
groups can insist that radical, cost-saving options are studied. But
departments are not forced to meet pre-set targets and can approach the
reviews in their own way.
Results, therefore, depend on the political outlook and skills of the
cabinet minister heading each department. As a Thatcherite minister with a
clear cost-cutting agenda, Mr Lilley has been keener on securing results.
But elsewhere the Treasury has met obstacles from departments reluctant to
force difficult measures through a House of Commons where the government has
a slim majority. Mr Lilley himself has encountered problems, for instance,
over the operation of the Child Support Agency, which is intended to cut the
cost of state support for single parents.
What can realistically be expected from the reviews over the coming year?
There are some obvious targets: the Treasury is scrutinising the cost of
running Britain's courts, looking for ways to reduce the time spent in
handling divorce petitions, civil liability cases and insurance claims. A
job-saving merger of Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise operations is
being considered. But these budgets make up a small part of the overall
spending cake.
Whether more sweeping cuts can be achieved in this November's Budget, or
over coming years, will depend on the determination of Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, to push his cabinet colleagues into renewing their
commitment to reduce public spending.
In a recent speech, Mr Clarke said he was seeking a tough spending round
this year, and threw his weight behind the reviews.
With speculation about a leadership contest in the autumn, the centre-left
Mr Clarke may be appealing for support from rightwing Tory backbenchers. But
the chancellor also knows that the fragility of the economic recovery means
he cannot loosen his grip on public spending - particularly if he is looking
for tax cuts before the next general election.
Those who believe the UK's public spending has spun out of control must hope
that the prize of tax reductions will concentrate the minds of ministers and
officials, as they scrutinise the minutiae of departmental programmes.

FT  15 APR 94 / Lead not into temptation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that spring has come I remain undisturbed by news that some chief
executive or other is taking home sterling or dollars in sacksful. Most
people do not receive seven- or even six-figure salaries, but that is no
reason to envy those who do. Some of them deserve it. Good luck to them. Yet
high pay is becoming a political issue. Last week The Sun ran a spread on
the '10 greediest bosses', with pictures. The captions contained the
tabloid's calculations of the villains' compensation packages, broken down
into comprehensible weekly amounts. The usual suspects were there - Mr Derek
Hunt, chairman of MFI (Pounds 31,423 a week); Sir Paul Girolami of Glaxo
(Pounds 27,744); Mr Mick Newmarch of the Prudential (Pounds 13,865) and so
on. Mr Rupert Murdoch, proprietor, was absent from this little gallery.
The chancellor of the exchequer, who earns about a tenth of a Newmarch,
disapproves of some of the large executive salaries paid by British
companies. He has expressed the wish that more business leaders would show
'a decent level of restraint'. The prime minister, questioned in the
Commons, concurred, but added that the subject is not a matter for the
government. This is 'a free capitalist country in which companies determine
their wages', he said. When Lady Thatcher had his job, she also supported
voluntary limits. That is clearly as far as the present Conservative
government will go.
It may not be far enough. Average incomes are increasing slowly, if at all.
Most employees worry about losing their jobs. This early post-recessionary
atmosphere is not one in which it is comfortable for highly rewarded CEOs to
take the salary and the bonus, cash in the options, and run. US President
Bill Clinton demonstrated during his 1991 campaign that politicians can win
votes by attacking what seem to be over-generous executive salaries. There
may even be an advantage in promising tax increases at the very top. The
difficulty comes when the election is over. Congress has voted to put a
Dollars 1m a year ceiling on corporate tax deductions for executive
remuneration. The reaction from the tax-avoidance industry has been
disappointment that the provision is so easy to circumvent. It spoils the
fun. You do not need to use stock options to get around the Dollars 1m cap.
Playing with definitions of an incentive bonus scheme will suffice.
It would be foolish to attempt a similar restriction in Britain. Some
employees are almost literally worth their weight in gold. Mr Peter Wood
(Pounds 355,253 a week in Sun money) created Direct Line, now the insurance
division of the Royal Bank of Scotland. No Peter Wood, no Direct Line.
Everyone in financial services knows of this or that dealer whose
contribution is as unique as that of a named pop star to the entertainment
business. Specialists, or those of exceptional ability who work
exceptionally hard, de-serve commensurate rewards. The undeserving cases
are, however, both obvious and sad. We can all think of certain well-known
former nationalised industry flacks who privatised their salaries when their
enterprises were sold off and they became chauffeur-driven executives. Have
they no sense of decorum?
There is a theoretical curb on such behaviour in quoted companies. The
Cadbury code on corporate governance provides for remuneration committees of
non-executive directors. These are supposed to keep the managers honest. In
fact they are probably doing more harm than good, according to Mr Stanley
Wright, a former civil servant who has spent much of his career in the City.
His case is made in a pamphlet published by the Social Market Foundation*
yesterday. Remuneration committees, he says, 'are confronted with confusing
surveys, largely prepared by 'human resources' or 'management selection'
firms, whose only emphatic messages are that the trend is strongly upwards
and that every class of benefit is becoming 'normal'.'
Mr Wright approaches management theory in much the same way as public choice
theorists analyse the behaviour of officials. Executives, hirelings of the
shareholders, think they own the companies they are paid to manage.
Self-interest motivates everyone. Headhunters prosper when they persuade
boards that there is an international market for overpaid generalists;
flattered managers do not take many lunches to be convinced. As Adam Smith,
quoted by Mr Wright, said: 'The directors of joint stock companies being the
managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be
expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with
which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own.'
So what else is new?
Quite a lot, if Mr Wright has his way. He would have each director's
remuneration and benefits published in greater detail than Cadbury suggests.
This would be enforced by law, not a voluntary code. Directors should be
re-elected by the shareholders every two years. The maximum legal
compensation for unexpired contracts should be cut from five years to two,
rather than the three in the Cadbury code. That would limit failed CEOs'
termination pay-offs. Non-executives should be able to report directly to
the shareholders, and to comment on directors' remuneration for the current
year. To encourage shareholders to use this additional power, dividends
should not be paid unless votes representing at least 75 per cent of the
shares have been cast on all resolutions at an annual general meeting.
There are many such recommendations. They all shift the balance of power
towards institutions as responsible shareholders. Mr Wright rejects both the
German bank/stakeholder system, and the Japanese consensual model as either
out-of-date or alien to the Anglo-Saxon culture. He regards the notion of
empowering more individual shareholders as a 'romantic muddle'. He would
tighten takeover rules. That would curb the temptation to grow by
acquisition, which, he argues, rarely benefits the buying companies'
shareholders. In sum, his proposition is that 'a powerful body of
institutional shareholders has become an essential for shareholder
sovereignty'. He may be on to something. If the government does not perceive
the need for thinking about his argument, the opposition might. One day,
perhaps, Labour will awaken from its long sleep.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Some of us - but not, it would seem, your leader writer ('Follow the
Fed', April 14) - think a monument should be erected to the unknown
journalist who recently gave us the phrase 'inflation nutter' to describe
the obsessive tendencies of people such as the governor of the Bank of
England.
The phrase also applies to the former unlamented chancellor of the exchequer
who opined that unemployment, bankruptcy and repossession of homes was 'a
price well worth paying' for reduced inflation. Perhaps it even applies to
the prime minister, who may soon be discovering what the British electorate
thinks of his view that 'if it isn't hurting, it isn't working'.
So you should not be surprised to find that your statement that 'the latest
step towards greater central bank autonomy is welcome' is not universally
shared, even among people who have managed to hang on to house, home and
job. Instead, how about compulsory resignation for unelected governors, to
be enforced the moment interest rates are increased by a total of one
percentage point during their term of office?

series on Tuesday night. Complete cycles of the composer's 32 piano sonatas
ought always to be enlightening events - for the Brendel fans who packed the
Royal Festival Hall, this recital plainly was - but it seems that this
legendary pianist has lost the instinctive, inspiring powers of his earlier
self.
Brendel has, of course, performed complete Beethoven cycles umpteen times.
This widely-spaced series is different: seven programmes spread over
three-and-a-half years (it is not due to finish until summer 1995), each
repeated in various European and North American cities. Brendel is more than
halfway through, but since his approach is not chronological, we heard four
early sonatas (numbers 8-11) and the later Lebewohl op. 81a.
Though Brendel brought no special insights on Tuesday, there were good
things, mostly in the second half. The soaring, turbulent op. 22 was tightly
argued; its Allegretto finale had clarity and elegance. Brendel's Lebewohl
had a radiant conclusion, reminding one - for the only time during the
evening - of Beethoven's life-afirming qualities.
The 'simpler', more direct works were less successful. At best they were
unremarkable, but often the music sounded mannered and inflated. In op. 14
no. 1 Brendel pulled the almost-Mozartian scales and arpeggios around, and
no. 2 in the set was even more heavy-handed - his antics distorted
grotesquely the miniature variations that make up its middle movement (they
drew spontaneous applause). The Sonata Pathetique lacked dramatic breadth,
and detail was smothered in the breathless outer movements.
Much of Brendel's playing now sounds cantankerous. His intellectualism
stifles the music. One of the visionary musicians of our time is in danger
of becoming a monument to himself.
The programme is repeated in San Francisco (April 22), Los Angeles (April
26), Toronto (May 7), Princeton (May 9), and New York (May 12).

Can Dylan Winter, co-star with Molly the packhorse in the Radio 4 series 'A
Hack In The Borders', follow the path trodden by such erstwhile radio
personalities as Christopher Morrison and Anne Robinson and become a
television star? We shall see, when he presents the first in the series
Secret Service. Winter goes undercover to test the customer friendliness of
five organisations, beginning with Burger King and Ansells pubs (7.00 BBC1).
Like public schools, 'the public interest' usually means the opposite of
what it says. When bureaucrats refuse to tell you what you want to know,
citing 'the public interest', it is almost invariably private interests
which are under threat. Public Eye reports on Jean Bennett's attempts to
find out why the police killed her son (8.00 BBC2).
You knew stand-up comedian Jo Brand was sensitive about being very fat. You
knew that as a woman she is licensed to make sexist jokes. But had you ever
been told she used to work in a mental hospital? Jo Brand Through The Cake

FT  15 APR 94 / Arts: A theatre in free flight - Alastair Macaulay talks to
Lev Dodin, the artistic director of the Maly Theatre of St Petersburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For decades, the west knew next to nothing about the performing arts troupes
of Russia. Even the big Kirov and Bolshoi ballet companies toured far less
than their western admirers would have liked. Now the situation is reversed.
It is the west that sees the Russian companies most.
Ballet and opera, though more expensive, are more obviously international
arts. But the spoken theatre? One company in particular has pandered to the
growing western appetite for Russian theatre. The Maly Theatre of St
Petersburg, which has made several visits to the west in recent years, has
now begun to spend most of its time outside Russia. Last weekend it finished
a season at the Odeon, Paris; this week it begins a tour of Britain. The
scale of the endeavour is probably without precedent in the history of the
spoken theatre. The Maly company has 85 members; it brings five different
productions to Britain (including the two-part Brothers and Sisters and
three-part The Devils); it will visit London, Manchester, Glasgow,
Newcastle, and Nottingham.
The company's artistic director is Lev Dodin. In interview, he at first
delivers a certain amount of Eurospeak. 'These new contacts are very
important for us . . . We gain a new quality of communication in the west.
Performing here has become natural; it makes us aware we are all part of one
community.' He drops the 'one community' line, however, when I make the
error of referring to St Petersburg as a more conservative city than Moscow.
'St Petersburg had always the more profound culture. Things were hatched
there before appearing on the surface. The surface is where Moscow picked
things up.'
This is true Petersburg-speak, and wonderful. 'St Petersburg is built
according to laws of beauty, and these laws shape our thought. The Soviet
regime stifled ideas, and more so in St Petersburg. It was easier to keep
down inventive thought there, whereas the bureaucracy in Moscow allowed
various different channels there. But St Petersburg was always alive to the
work of Meyerhold, Akhmatova, Brodsky, Shostakovich.'
Today, he says, there are as many experiments in St Petersburg as in Moscow.
'You can do what you like now - if you have money. But it's hard, as yet, to
judge the results.' I ask if there had been an extra stimulation in trying
to create new work under the Soviet regime. 'Well, it gave certain spurs,
certain energy, yes. But it was the energy of craziness. It's very hard to
create in a situation where any minute your mouth can be stopped. The
absence of freedom has taken away a lot of force from Russian theatre. Now
it is a new world - one of financial values.'
Will theatre be able to preserve its role? 'This is a very serious question
for us. You know from your own country that theatre easily becomes an
entertainment industry. That is not real art.' I think of Solzhenitsyn and
his discomfort in the west. What is it like being a company in exile, I ask?
'No, no, not exile, but free flight] We have been abroad since January, and
we return in June. We will work there, and perform in September. We perform
in the west so much because this is the best way we can support the staff in
our theatre. There are people at the Maly now whom we can only support by
working here. We have to send a lot of money home; and this is getting
harder.'
The company has made its western reputation with theatrical adaptations
rather than by performing plays that were written as plays. The Paris season
ends, however, with Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, with which the British
tour opens. This was my introduction to the company's work, and it is, by
most accounts, by no means the best. The company's admirers love the
theatrical energy and intensity of its stagings; but The Cherry Orchard is a
play with a great deal of languor, which Dodin observes. Nonetheless, this
staging is less naturalistic than most British productions.
The play has one single set, which changes in the light. It is, by turns, a
hall of mirrors, a wall of windows opening onto cherry trees, a dark
interior. Splendid; but why so much surrounding darkness in the daytime
scenes? Dodin feels that this is not a naturalistic play; while talking of
the comic element in Chekhov, he says 'It is not a naturalistic drama, not a
sad tragedy. It is a spiritual tragedy which is sometimes very comic. The
comedy is that of human life. A human's life is very short and limited. A
human is unwilling to accept this, which makes his life only faster. This is
close to Shakespeare. The comic aspect is dramatic.'
This staging, daringly, is given without an interval; and the second act is
in Chekhov's original version. I have always loved the asymmetries of
British Chekhov stagings, the ways that two or more activities are
frequently going on at different tempi, and the way that the people in the
stage world never stop to orate to the audience. Dodin, however, frequently
has events happen bang on the centre-line of the stage, underplays any
multiplicity of stage incident, and has certain speeches delivered straight
out to the audience.
But his company is a true ensemble, and they bring to it a Russian ease in
large emotion, easily able to switch between laughter and tears, or indeed
to catch both at the same time. Dodin again: 'A common spirit is very
important in Chekhov. When individual stars appear in Chekhov, they make it
less like Chekhov, more like any other play. You must hear the music of the
Chekhov symphony. Or, rather, the small evening serenade.'
The Maly Theatre tour starts with The Cherry Orchard, until April 17 at the
Lyric, Hammersmith. The Forum Theatre, Manchester, presents Brothers and
Sisters and Stars in the Morning Sky, April 20-24; as does the Nottingham
Playhouse, May 24-28. Glasgow presents all five productions, at the Citizens
and Tramway Theatres, April 29-May 15. The Newcastle Playhouse presents
Brothers and Sisters and The House, May 18-21.

FT  15 APR 94 / Arts: No love in 'The Butterfly Kiss' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No-one likes to break a butterfly upon a wheel, so I shall be gentle with
the new play at the Almeida, save to say that it is one the most unpleasant
pieces I have seen on a London stage. According to a programme note, the
subject of Phyllis Nagy's Butterfly Kiss is matricide, 'dramatically
speaking', the note claims, 'a no-go area'. And it is true that a girl does
kill her mother. But it is not the subject one objects to; it's the play.
A butterfly kiss, the programme also reveals, is American slang for 'a
caress given by winking one eye so that the lashes brush against the face of
the receiver'. Yet unless you count the increasingly frenetic groping of a
couple of lesbians in the background, there is not much caressing in the
piece; nor much winking either.
Instead, there is a lot of brandishing of a vicious-looking kitchen knife
and the suggestion, possibly a joke, that Sloan Ross, the ex-US Marine
turned lepidopterist, may kill butterflies with a Luger, the same gun which
is eventually used by his daughter to kill his wife.
The motivation remains obscure throughout partly because this is one of
those irritating plays that dot backwards and forwards in time. But even if
you try to put the events in chronological order, the motives are still
unclear.
There is an old woman and a daughter, both of whom seem fairly high on the
bottle. The daughter marries the ex-marine, who turns up at the wedding with
another ex-marine as best man and a floozy who (we learn) is already the
mistress of the groom.
Sloan, the groom, tells his wife that he does not want children - yet.
Nevertheless, a daughter called Lily arrives and it is she who may be at the
centre of the piece. By the time she is 14, she has seduced the other
marine. She then kills her mother with the gun handed to her by her father,
possibly at her mother's drunken request: there is some suggestion that it
is manslaughter, not murder. Lily (played by Elizabeth Berridge) is also
seduced by a lesbian named Martha - who at least has the virtue of being the
only remotely attractive character in the piece.
Perhaps there is something to be said for Sloan's amiable ex-marine friend,
Teddy Roosevelt Hayes, but since the part is not filled out it is impossible
to say. There is a striking set, with a case of butterflies in the
background, designed by Mark Thompson. Otherwise one wonders what a director
like Steven Pimlott and a theatre like the Almeida are doing with a piece
like this. Phyllis Nagy, the author, is a New Yorker living in London who is
now the Arts Council writer-in-residence at the Royal Court, so there may be
more to come.
Almeida Theatre until April 30. (071) 359 4404

FT  15 APR 94 / Arts: Dissonance in Prague - Andrew Clark finds Czech
Philharmonic supporters out of tune with its new conductor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is disharmony at the Philharmonic. Not at the London, Berlin or New
York philharmonics, but in Prague, where the Czech Philharmonic and its
audiences are deeply divided about the first foreign music director in the
orchestra's 98-year history.
In most countries, the appointment of a foreign conductor would cause few
problems, and could even add to an orchestra's prestige. Not one of London's
four independent orchestras, for example, has a British music director. But
in the Czech Republic, where national pride is identified with leading
artistic institutions, the arrival of Gerd Albrecht from Germany has aroused
intense passions.
The issue recently took on a political dimension when Albrecht turned down
an invitation for the Czech Philharmonic to play at the Vatican. President
Vaclav Havel openly criticised him for 'damaging the esteem of the Czech
Republic'.
Albrecht's appointment is hardly new. In 1991, the orchestra held its
first-ever vote for the post of chief conductor and by the narrowest of
margins, Albrecht defeated the Czech incumbent, Jiri Belohlavek. But it is
only in this season, since Albrecht took up the appointment and began
conducting regularly in Prague, that the consequences have become clear.
In the post-revolutionary atmosphere of freedom and democracy, the players
saw Albrecht as a passport to fortune. He bore the promise of lucrative
foreign tours and recording contracts, none of which has materialised:
western agents and record companies are only interested if the orchestra
works with Czech conductors. 'The orchestra is losing out,' says Anthony
Howard of IMG Artists, the agency which has organised the orchestra's recent
visits to Britain.
'A lot of concert promoters are interested in the Czech Philharmonic, but
not in Gerd Albrecht. He's not regarded as a top-notch conductor and he's
German. The package doesn't fit. The Czech conductors with whom the
orchestra used to work may not have been household names, but they fitted in
and produced good results. Albrecht's appointment was not a good idea.'
Albrecht nevertheless has many supporters in Prague. While increasing the
profile of Bruckner and other German composers, he has conducted a wide
variety of Czech repertoire, programming rarities by Fibich and Martinu
alongside popular works by Dvorak. 'The Czech Philharmonic has always been
charmed by conductors like Sawallisch and Albrecht,' says one local critic.
'Albrecht has the detached, perfect German baton.'
But these qualities are exactly what opponents cite as alien to the
orchestra's tradition, and many older members of the orchestra and its
audience remember the German wartime occupation. 'He's a good enough
conductor,' says one orchestra veteran, 'but whether he's right for us is
another matter. The Czech Philharmonic became famous by playing under great
Czech conductors like Talich and Ancerl. When Albrecht conducts, everything
is exact and cool. It lacks spontaneity and the Czech spirit.'
If Albrecht had the international reputation of Colin Davis or Kurt Masur,
his opponents would doubtless accept him. But the orchestra cannot afford a
front-rank foreign conductor.
It has given Albrecht a five-year contract with sweeping powers, enabling
him to veto the Vatican concert, which had been offered to another
conductor. 'A strong management would take control of the situation, but
there's no one with the guts or the knowhow to do it,' says one Philharmonic
insider. 'The orchestra is paying for its own arrogance. They'll be crawling
back to Belohlavek in five years.'
Ironically, the two main beneficiaries of the Albrecht controversy have been
Belohlavek and the Prague Symphony Orchestra. Belohlavek, still only 48 but
with a reputation as a strong orchestral trainer, has wasted no time in
developing his freelance international career. The Prague Symphony is
picking up prestigious engagements at home and abroad which would previously
have gone to its older rival. Under its chief conductor, Martin Turnovsky,
it has traded profitably on its Czech character.
'We want to be a Czech cultural institution that is open to the world,' says
Roman Belor, the Prague Symphony's manager. 'At the same time, we feel a
responsibility for the continuity of Czech culture. There's something
special in the atmosphere of Prague and the Bohemian countryside, in the
traditions handed down and the mixture of middle-European influences, which
give a distinctive sound to the music made and played here.
'It doesn't prevent foreigners from giving good performances. But the
advantage of Czech conductors and Czech orchestras playing this music is
that they are Czech - they were born here.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
From secretary to commercial director in nine years is no mean feat; but
then to return voluntarily to being a personal assistant and, once more,
rising to the top ranks of yet another company is a rare achievement.
Jan Reynolds, below, has just been appointed managing director of Octavius
Hunt, part of the Chemring group since 1991.
The UK's last remaining match manufacturer, Octavius Hunt is based in
Bristol, from where it produces a variety of specialist pyrotechnical and
smoke equipment for such diverse entities as the ministry of defence and
banana importers.
Reynolds, 51, spent almost 10 years with Pollastrip, then part of the Tarmac
group, rising from secretarial status in 1980 to be commercial director by
the time she left in 1989.
'Having become disillusioned with being part of a large organisation I
decided to go back to being a personal assistant for a smaller operation,'
she says.
She then joined Octavius Hunt in 1989 as personal assistant to Derek
Luffingham, who then owned the company. Within a year, she was once more a
director; she now replaces Tom Davies - who is taking on a broader role
within the Chemring group - as managing director, running the company.
No disillusionment this time round, either: 'Rather, I feel a bit like the
people in the latest British Gas ads, who say they just love being in
control.'
With the company just recently launching into the retail and display
fireworks' market, Reynolds is likely to find much to spark further
interest.

FT  15 APR 94 / Property: Happy returns - Vanessa Houlder on the reasons
behind the improved investment outlook in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Returns in the UK property investment market posted their fastest recovery
on record last year, according to the annual review of the sector by
Investment Property Databank, a research group. Investment returns reached
18.1 per cent, a 22 percentage point improvement on the previous year.
After sinking so low, it is perhaps unsurprising that the investment market
would rebound vigorously. But the factors driving this strong upturn are
more complicated than first meet the eye.
The IPD report suggests that the recovery took place in spite of, not
because of, the behaviour of two crucial components of the market: tenants
and institutional investors. Although there was some improvement in demand
from tenants, it was insufficient to stop the fall in rents, which dropped
by an average 8 per cent over the year. Meanwhile, net institutional
investment totalled just Pounds 466m last year, the lowest for 13 years.
Instead, the main underlying causes behind the recovery can be traced to the
behaviour of the bond markets: when bond yields fell sharply last year, they
dragged property yields down with them, thereby improving property values.
The reason for the close correlation between bond and property yields last
year was that property started to resemble a fixed-income investment -
valued on the strength of its existing income rather than its potential
income growth.
This was because an increasing number of properties were 'over-rented' - the
term used to describe properties whose tenants are locked into leases that
require them to pay rents at above the market rates. Since the rental income
from these 'over-rented' properties is unlikely to increase for several
years, the value of the properties will depend on the security of the
current stream of income.
The IPD statistics, which are based on property amounting to 75 per cent of
all institutionally-owned buildings (valued at about Pounds 40.4bn),
underlines the extent to which this type of property has become
'over-rented'.
After the sharp fall in rents of the past few years, 44 per cent of all
institutional tenants paid above market rents at the end of 1993, according
to IPD. Even institutional portfolios spread across all sectors and regions
are, typically, 'over-rented'. Among such properties, the gap between rents
paid and the market rate is in excess of 30 per cent.
The consequence of this 'over-renting' was that property assumed some of the
characteristics of bonds. And as bond yields fell, property yields tumbled
in tandem, from 10.7 per cent to 9.2 per cent over the year, according to
IPD.
One outcome of the increasing similarity between property and bonds was that
all the sectors of the market produced similar returns: retail returns were
19.6 per cent, industrials 19.3 per cent and offices 18.3 per cent. Those
properties with the greatest degree of 'over-renting', such as City of
London offices, enjoyed the greatest benefit from the movement in yields.
'Over-renting' had least impact in the retail and industrial sectors. In
these sectors regional variations in performance continued to reflect rental
trends, with the Midlands and the north generally recording smaller falls in
rental values, and thus higher returns, than London and the south.
Retail property posted a 1.7 per cent drop in rents, less than a fifth of
that recorded for either offices or industrial property last year. By
contrast, office rents dropped by a further 13.7 per cent in 1993, taking
the total decline in office rents to 42 per cent since 1989.
As in the retail sector, office rents fell further in the south than in the
north. However, this north-south rental divide was masked by heavy
'over-renting'. Some of the highest office returns were in the most
'over-rented' markets, such as the City which produced a 20.4 per cent
return in 1993.
The dominant role played by bond movements in increasing property values
last year was reinforced, in some sectors, by the pressure of investors'
demand. The best-performing sectors - such as retail and distribution
warehouses which produced returns of 34 per cent and 30 per cent
respectively - owed their strong returns to a particularly sharp fall in
their yields, which stemmed from strong net investment.
However, for most of last year, the net impact of institutional investors on
the market was subdued, according to IPD. Although institutions are
currently among the most enthusiastic purchasers of property, their renewed
presence in the market was not evident until autumn 1993. For the early part
of last year, the most active buyers were foreign investors, private
companies and quoted property companies.
In fact, institutions sold more property than they bought last year: Pounds
2.63bn in purchases against Pounds 2.98bn in sales. Institutions' net
investment climbed on the back of Pounds 473m spent on development and
Pounds 343m on improving buildings.
Retail property was, by far, the most popular sector for investors,
accounting for 86 per cent of the total net investment in 1993; retail
warehouses alone accounted for 59 per cent of the total net investment.
Institutions were net investors in offices in south-east England (excluding
London), but were net sellers of property in the City and West End.
Although institutional demand rose strongly at the end of last year and is
still high, IPD strikes a warning note about the sustainability of a
recovery that depended so heavily on bond movements.
'This upturn is almost exclusively an investment phenomenon, based upon
falling yields,' said Mr Rupert Nabarro, managing director of IPD. 'The
trend in property returns will be vulnerable to shocks in the gilts market.'
The IPD report adds: 'Questions remain as to the strength of the 1993
recovery . . . A sustained recovery will depend in the medium-term upon low
interest rates and continued investor demand.'

David Went, chief executive of National Westminster Bank's Ulster Bank
subsidiary, has been given the job of turning Coutts, the frock-coated
bankers to Britain's royal family, into a 'truly global private bank' which

Went, a 47-year-old Ulsterman who trained with Citibank, has been appointed
to the new post of chief executive of Coutts Group, parent of Coutts &amp; Co in
the UK and Coutts International Private Banking.
Although the 300-year-old Coutts has been a NatWest subsidiary for many
years, it has been allowed to operate independently. Analysts have felt that
NatWest has failed to exploit one of the best known brand names in private
banking.
Just over two years ago NatWest installed one of its own managers, Ian
Farnsworth, as managing director of Coutts &amp; Co. Since then its profits have
recovered strongly and Bernard Horn, NatWest's international chief, says
that Went's appointment is the next stage in the plan to build a 'world
class private banking operation'.
Horn denied yesterday that this would involve taking Coutts down market and
said that the changes had nothing to do with last September's retirement of
Sir David Money-Coutts, who had worked for Coutts for 40 years and been
chairman since 1976. Horn added that what Coutts needed was not more capital
but more customer relationship officers and new products. Went will be based
in London but it remains unclear whether he will sit in Coutts Strand
headquarters.
Apart from NatWest veteran Ian Farnsworth, 56, the other member of the new
management team is Jean-Pierre Cuoni, 56, chief executive of Coutts
International Private Banking. Cuoni, a Swiss citizen, spent 22 years with
Citibank before joining Coutts &amp; Co in Zurich in 1988.
Went, who joined Ulster Bank in 1976, takes over on June 1 and will be
replaced as chief executive of Ulster Bank by Ronnie Kells, 55, who has been
with the bank since 1964.

FT  15 APR 94 / People: Turner to manage UES Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UES Holdings, the Rotherham-based engineering steels and forgings company,
has strengthened its top management by appointing Don Turner to the key post
of managing director of the UES Steels division.
With effect from July 1, Turner replaces David Stone, who will become
managing director of UES Holdings' subsidiaries division, which has
interests in bright bar - a shiny steel used in the automotive and other
industries - stockholding and metal reclamation.
Stone will also directly assist Don Ford, UES Holdings' chairman, on matters
such as relationships in Europe and US trade issues.
Ford said Stone would be retiring in two to three years, but stressed: 'I am
not moving him aside, but planning the succession in a managed way.'
The changes come only seven months after UES restructured the company,
eliminating the post of chief executive and giving greater autonomy to its
three operating divisions. As a consequence, chief executive Graham
Mackenzie left the company.
The shake-up was engineered by UES' two owners, British Steel and GKN, and
Turner's appointment was carried out with the full approval of the two
shareholders. The final selection was left to Ford, however.
Turner, 54, has been managing director of British Steel's tinplate division
since 1992, but will be on familiar ground in Rotherham as he previously ran
British Steel's narrow strip business, based around the Brinsworth strip
mill in the Yorkshire town.
UES Steels has been hit badly by rising scrap prices, reduced selling
prices, and what it sees as unfair subsidies in Europe.
Last year UES Holdings lost a record Pounds 48.1m, but according to Ford
this year's loss will be much lower. GKN has made clear it would sell its
39.1 per cent stake if an opportunity arose.
At British Steel Tinplate, Turner will be replaced by Tony Vickers,
currently technical director at British Steel's strip products business.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A first invitation to join the board of a listed company is an exciting
opportunity for anyone in business. But the post carries additional
responsibilities and increased duties as well as prestige.
That is why the UK's Institute of Directors - increasingly vocal this year
on the subject of raising board standards - is today launching a new two-day
course expressly devised for recently appointed and prospective directors of
publicly quoted UK companies.
There are already numerous general courses on the UK market, including those
run by the IOD, aimed at training company directors. John Harper,
professional development director at the IOD, claims this is the first to
address the special issues faced by listed company boards. He estimates that
there are 15,000 to 20,000 directors of UK publicly quoted companies.
Capital markets and financing options, insider trading rules, shareholder
value and dividend policy, investor relations and opinions, internal audits,
board committees and preparing reports and accounts are just some of the
subjects that will be covered on the course.
Joining The PLC Board has been developed by a team from the IOD, Henley and
Ashridge management colleges, and Manchester Business School, with advice
and input from several FT-SE 100 companies. The two days, running from
Thursday lunchtime to Saturday lunchtime, will be split into nine modules -
each led by an experienced business or City figure and an academic.
The first of the three courses planned for 1994 - price Pounds 2,250 plus
VAT for tuition, accommodation, course material and meals - will be held at
Henley, starting June 16. The others are at Manchester in September and at
Ashridge in November. Details from the Centre for Director Development,
Institute of Directors, 116 Pall Mall, London SW1Y 5ED.

FT  15 APR 94 / Management: Paean of praise in model guise - Christopher
Lorenz reviews a new study of European management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European managers are subtle, socially responsible and humane, believe that
maximum profit is not the primary aim of business, and consider it better to
be shrewd and cunning than simply rational.
They are more adept than their American or Japanese counterparts at handling
'diversity' - they benefit from cultural differences within their
organisations and serve different market preferences around the world.
European chief executives are also more accomplished leaders than their
American and Japanese peers, earning loyalty rather than imposing their
will.
This remarkable paean of praise for Europe's business community comes in a
study published this week on behalf of the European Round Table of
Industrialists, a lobby group of chairmen and chief executives from 40 large
European multinationals including Volvo, Philips, Lafarge Coppee, BSN,
Hoechst, Solvay, Siemens and Unilever.
The study - published as a book* co-authored by an American journalist and
two respected continental European academics - is essentially an opinion
survey of the ERT's members, plus a few Americans and Japanese. But it is
presented as an emerging 'European management model' - something that other
European business people and academics have been trying for years to develop
as an antidote to the dominant US model of ultra-rational, homogenous
management styles and techniques.
As an obvious confidence-rebuilding exercise for demoralised European
managers, the book has an upbeat tone. But its content is by no means
entirely positive and nuggets of realistic criticism shine through:
European companies pay a price for their social attitudes, in terms of lower
flexibility and reduced economic effectiveness;
They suffer from a fear of risk-taking and failure;
European culture does not encourage people to work in teams;
The relative security of semi-regulated markets, plus Europeans' 'fierce
pride in their engineering prowess', has deterred companies from putting
customers first, and from matching Japanese quality levels;
Europeans are 'handicapped by their sophisticated world outlook that sees
every country and culture as different and deserving of tailor-made
treatment'.
European companies must become much more adept at changing, and at living
with uncertainty.
The study is at its most valuable when the academics set the executives'
comments in the context of their own wider research.
For instance, they stress the difference between a monocultural 'global
strategy', as pursued by many US and most Japanese companies, and a 'world
outlook' which sees the globe as composed of interconnected but distinctive
details.
Another prominent theme is the need to reconcile contradictory forces:
global, regional and national strategies; social responsibility and profits;
long-term planning and short-term flexibility; diversity and integration;
leadership and management; individuality and team work; a balanced life and
commitment to the company.
The trouble with that list - which the study claims is the foundation of its
emerging 'European management model' - is that it could have been drawn from
the very source that the ERT so decries: a collection of US business school
professors.
Yet that does not necessarily invalidate the study's conclusion that,
provided they make the effort, Europeans should prove better than Americans
or Japanese at managing these conflicting forces. Whether that will create a
'renaissance of European management', as the ERT hopes, is quite another
matter.

FT  15 APR 94 / Management: Avoid the BP trap - Forthcoming AGMs are heading
for conflict over executive incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week British Petroleum learnt a lesson in how an annual general meeting
can be hijacked over the emotive issue of executive incentives.
Reports of the bad-tempered meeting will have been read with horror by other
publicly-quoted companies which will shortly be asking their shareholders
for permission to renew share option schemes.
On BP's agenda was a resolution extending a scheme for 500-600 managers. A
similar item will be on the agenda of most company AGMs this year, as their
existing 10-year schemes, introduced in 1984 to take advantage of tax
breaks, formally expire. Since share options are the only part of a
remuneration package on which investors have the right to vote, the occasion
is being viewed by shareholders as a golden opportunity to exert an
influence on the fraught question of executive pay.
BP executives say they knew in advance that questions on the issue would be
raised from the floor. But Lord Ashburton, BP chairman, seemed taken aback
by a broadside of complex questions and statements that flowed from a member
of the UK Shareholders Association, which represents smaller investors.
The accusations came fast and furious:
The lack of details on performance criteria meant BP was in violation of the
Cadbury code of corporate governance and guidelines of institutional
shareholders, such as those of the Association of British Insurers and the
National Association of Pension Funds;
The compensation committee of the board of directors was not independent
enough;
References to the scheme in the annual report had been misleading.
Lord Ashburton bravely tried to separate the various strands of questioning,
but the share option scheme became hopelessly entangled with another
incentive plan for BP's top 90 executives that was not on the agenda. His
statement that the ABI had found 'technical shortcomings' in the scheme's
performance criteria signalled the end of the confrontation and a tactical
retreat to the security of an overwhelmingly large block of proxy votes
offered up by institutional shareholders.
As for the small shareholders sitting high above the fray in the lofty
heights of London's Barbican's theatre, they too seemed flummoxed by the
confusion below. But shareholder sentiment, smarting from an extension of
BP's frozen dividend, was not on the side of management.
Many of the allegations may have been misleading, half-truths or downright
wrong, as BP officials later claimed. But they were received with rounds of
applause, and at least a third of those present voted against the resolution
to extend the scheme.
BP's post-mortem of the day no doubt centred on how the executive incentive
issue came to dominate what were otherwise generally positive proceedings on
BP's rehabilitation from the dark days of two years ago, when Robert
Horton's sudden departure from his twin posts of chairman and chief
executive triggered a troubled period for the company.
The BP experience not only indicates that shareholders are baying for blood,
but that there is much confusion on what constitutes an acceptable new
options scheme.
'Companies had better make sure they've got their acts together,' warns Mark
Anderson of New Bridge Street Consultants, specialists on executive pay.
Shareholders have been increasingly vociferous on the issue of options over
the past two years in preparation for the season of mass renewal of the
plans. After considerable disagreement among themselves, the ABI and the
NAPF have decided they will only approve future schemes that contain a
measure of performance.
The joint guidelines the two bodies issued last year stated that companies
and their remuneration committees could choose the performance measure best
suited to them. It was implicit in the recommendation that shareholders, in
order to make an informed vote on the scheme, would need to know precisely
what that measure was.
BP was taken to task last week mainly because it failed to announce what its
criteria are. However, the institutional investors were perfectly happy with
its excuse.
The company argued that it was not yet ready to issue any options under the
new scheme. It pointed out that fluctuations in oil prices and exchange
rates made the two most common performance measures - share price and
earnings - inappropriate. It said it was working on a complex measure of
performance that compared its own return to shareholders against that of the
other oil majors.
BP already uses this measure to reward its most senior people as part of an
annual bonus, but at present the measure is calculated just once a year. If
the measure is to be extended to share options it must be more flexible and
the company is looking at ways of achieving this.
The ABI denies that in approving the options scheme last week, it was
signing a blank cheque. BP has pledged that it will inform shareholders of
the performance measure, which will have been thoroughly analysed by its own
remuneration committee. The ABI reasons that although shareholders will not
get the chance to vote, they could make life very embarrassing for the oil
giant if its performance measure is inadequate.
Other companies, meanwhile, should have learnt the lesson. Most are likely
to announce loud and clear their chosen performance criteria at the outset.
For most the choice of measure will be easier than it was for BP. Few other
companies are in sectors homogenous enough to allow performance to be
compared against their peers, so they are likely to choose more conventional
measures. Moreover, few businesses are so at the mercy of commodity prices.
According to specialist pay consultants who are helping companies to
finalise their new schemes, the most popular measure is likely to be
earnings. Many will plump for a criterion that allows executives to exercise
options if the company's earnings beat inflation by 2 per cent in three
successive years.
Some are still dithering, waiting to see what sort of performance measures
others go for before making a decision.
And a few companies have found the area so perplexing that they have decided
to shelve the whole dreaded question of executive share options until next
year.

Some of the world's rarest books and documents are stored in the Vatican
Library. But every year only about 2,000 scholars are allowed access to the
150,000 manuscripts and 2m books.
To bring the works of art to the attention of a wider audience, the Vatican
Library has teamed up with the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de
Janeiro and computer maker IBM to examine the creation of a database so that
images of the manuscripts can be displayed on PC screens internationally.
The images could be stored on CD-Rom or distributed across networks.
The pilot project will examine the feasibility of creating a high-resolution

Today's portable computers with flat liquid crystal displays need the
screens to be lit from behind in order for text and graphics to be visible.
One of the big drawbacks is that this drains the limited battery power.
Now the Japanese electronics company Sharp has combined several technologies
to produce a prototype thin film transistor screen which does not require a
backlight.
Each of the picture elements, or pixels, which make up the screen is coated
with an organic dielectric film which is highly reflective. Filters in cyan

The systems, developed by Potrafke, of Hattingen, Germany, consist of two
parallel conveyor lanes with a cashier seated in between. The customer
places the goods on the belt and they pass through a perspex covered tunnel
where they are scanned. A carousel, synchronised to the conveyor, then
carries away the goods so that the shopper can pack them while the next
customer is using the conveyor.

FT  15 APR 94 / Technology: Milestone on the road - Fuel cells are set to
become the power source of the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They have been used in space travel and on the moon, in submarines and small
power stations. Invented more than 150 years ago, they have recently been
heralded as an answer to some of the world's most severe environmental
problems and as the power-generating technology of the future.
So why have fuel cells - which produce electricity without serious pollution
of the atmosphere - remained mostly in the laboratory and failed to make any
impact on the commercial market? The answer lies not so much in the
technology itself as in the cost of the process and the cumbersome nature of
the equipment needed.
Yet this week, in its austere white research headquarters near Ulm in south
Germany, Daimler-Benz demonstrated that it was well on the way to solving
these problems. Germany's largest industrial concern showed off a white van
packed full of pipes, valves and cables and with a big yellow cylinder for
the hydrogen used to produce energy by reacting with oxygen from the air.
Daimler-Benz's chairman, Edzard Reuter, keen to show that the industrial
group's expensive diversification into electronics, aerospace and other
non-motor sectors was producing results, spoke enthusiastically of a
'milestone on the road to ecological mobility'. Hartmut Weule, research and
technology director, said: 'We are at the very beginning of a new phase of
technology, comparable with the days when Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz
were constructing their first vehicles powered by internal combustion
engines.'
But Weule was careful not to get carried away by this grand historical
analogy. Much work remained to be done before fuel cell vehicles could be
brought to the series production stage, he said. Daimler was also working to
perfect further the internal combustion and diesel engines on which the
fortunes of its Mercedes-Benz car and truck subsidiary still depend.
Weule left no doubt, however, of Daimler's determination to succeed in the
technology of fuel cells, in which the group says it is ahead of automotive
rivals such as General Motors of the US and Mazda of Japan. 'We do not
intend to wait until our Japanese or American competitors gain the upper
hand in technology,' he said. Already, the group - including AEG
(electronics and energy generation), Dornier (aerospace and materials) and
Deutsche Aerospace - has spent more than DM100m (Pounds 40m) on research
into fuel cell technology.
The electric transporter van, shown off for the first time in Ulm on
Wednesday, certainly does not look revolutionary. Inside, though, it
contains the elements of a technological advance which enables Daimler to
claim that it is the first motor company in Europe, and probably the world,
to develop a fully working vehicle powered by fuel cells. Called Necar (new
electric car), it has a more efficient propulsion system than any other type
used in the industry while producing no harmful exhaust gases and far less
carbon dioxide than emitted by conventional engines.
The energy conversion efficiency achieved by Daimler is up to 30 per cent
compared with up to 20 per cent in internal combustion engines. Fuel cells,
which work at low temperatures and do not rely on the burning of fossil
fuels, produce no oxides of nitrogen or sulphur (the causes of acid rain),
need no batteries which would have to be recharged or recycled and can
obtain hydrogen from such different fuels as natural gas, methanol, biomass
gas, methane and other gases.
With all these advantages, it is not surprising that research into fuel
cells is taken seriously in the US and Japan, both of which have costly
national programmes aimed at making the technology viable for transport and
power generation.
A German project group, including Daimler, Siemens, the electrical and
electronics group, the chemical industry and the federal research ministry,
has just been set up to keep the country in the forefront of fuel cell
developments. Weule would also like to see greater interest at European
Union level - 'they should be more active in Brussels'.
To develop its fuel cell-powered vehicle, Daimler went into partnership with
Ballard Power Systems, a Canadian specialist in this technology. Ballard has
installed fuel cells in a bus in Vancouver and is working to extend its
range and reduce its weight. Firoz Rasul, Ballard's president, is in no
doubt that Daimler has taken fuel cell technology a considerable way towards
commercial viability, despite the remaining problems. 'This demonstration
shows that it's here, it's real and the trick is to get the cost down.'
Cost and weight are the big hurdles still to be overcome. Weule reckons the
present cost of some DM10,000 for each kW of electricity needs to come down
by a factor of at least 50, to around DM200 or less, before fuel cells can
be installed in vehicles for private customers. This could take 10 or 20
years. Rasul, speaking from close knowledge of California's tough new
pollution laws, which stipulate 10 per cent of cars should be zero-emission
producing in 2003, is more optimistic. 'I would say less than 10 years.'
Rasul believes industry and governments are now waking up to fuel cells'
potential. 'The market is pushing it now and there is a new interest from
the auto players.' Ballard's contribution to the Daimler vehicle was the
proton exchange membrane fuel cell, a thin polymer foil coated with a
catalyst material containing platinum; this encourages hydrogen to ionise
and react with oxygen to produce the electricity.
Weule says Daimler's electric vehicle will in future use widely available
methanol to obtain the hydrogen instead of a pressurised gas cylinder. In a
few years' time, Daimler aims to develop a fuel cell drive system far
smaller than that in its Necar. Success would be a further step towards
fulfilling Weule's belief that fuel cells will be 'the propulsion technology
of the next century'.

FT  15 APR 94 / Technology: Getting there by fuel cell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN WISENTHAL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over 10 years ago, Ballard Power Systems took a second look at an all
but abandoned technology. Now the Canadian company which is working with
Daimler-Benz appears on the verge of a breakthrough in the efficient use of
clean, abundant energy from fuel cells. It has attracted attention with the
improvements it has made to a proton exchange membrane fuel cell pioneered
by General Electric of the US.
Paul Howard, Ballard's vice-president, says the GE system (developed for the
space programme) had been seen as too heavy, finicky and expensive. But in
1983, Ballard received a Canadian military contract for the fuel cells which
produce electricity directly from oxygen and hydrogen without combustion.
They work with a polymer membrane as the electrolyte between two thin layers
of platinum catalyst. These are sandwiched between two carbon electrodes.
When hydrogen is piped next to one electrode and oxygen next to the other, a
reaction occurs in the electrolyte, producing the electricity, heat and
water.
Ballard improved the GE technology and by 1987 was ready to produce its
first-generation 5 kW fuel cell, a series of electrodes, catalysts and
plastic membranes bolted together, weighing 50 kg. An array of 24 similar
cells, linked to an electric motor, powers its first test vehicle, a bus.
This first generation of fuel cells has been sold to motor companies,
including Daimler-Benz, for evaluation.
The next cells will generate more than twice as much power. In 1998,
Ballard, working with Johnson Matthey of the UK to reduce the amount of
platinum catalyst, plans to market the third and commercially viable phase.
The 25 kW fuel cells will drive a large bus with a range of 560 km. A fourth
generation 50 kW cell is at least 10 years away.
'We need to get to the power-to-weight ratio of an internal combustion
engine. Today, we're probably about five or 10 times away from that,' says
Howard. 'Automobiles in the future are going to be driven by fuel cells.
Batteries aren't going to get there.'

FT  15 APR 94 / Trade gap closes as exports to EU rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's trade gap narrowed sharply in January, due to a fall in imports
and a surge in exports to the European Union, official figures issued
yesterday show.
The Central Statistical Office said the UK's visible deficit narrowed to a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 916m in January, from Pounds 1.57bn in December.
Commentators were expecting a deficit of Pounds 1.31bn.
Britain had its best trade performance with the EU since August 1993,
reporting a deficit of Pounds 128m compared with Pounds 903m in December.
Exports to the EU rose to Pounds 5.36bn, compared with Pounds 4.89bn in
December. Imports from the EU fell to Pounds 5.49bn in January from Pounds
5.79bn in December.
Total exports increased to Pounds 10.42bn in January, from Pounds 9.96bn in
December. Total imports fell to Pounds 11.33bn in January, compared with
Pounds 11.53bn in December. But in the three months to January, a more
reliable indicator of the underlying trend, total exports fell 3 per cent
compared with the previous three months and the trade balance widened.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, welcomed the figures as 'a very
encouraging start to the year'. He described January's fall in the deficit
with EU countries as 'significant'.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said Britain was 'not
sustaining its competitive position, and we are failing to pay our way in
the world by making and selling our goods'.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'Although
this sharp correction in January provides some good news and considerable
relief after the bad news in previous months, the trend is still worrying.'
The CSO's figures suggest that one reason for the UK's poor long-term export
performance is that manufacturers are continuing to protect their export
margins by raising prices. Export prices increased 3 per cent in the three
months to January, in spite of a 4 per cent fall in volumes in the same
period. Import prices were little changed.
The latest figures again raised doubts about the new system for gathering EU
trade statistics. The CSO is carrying out an inquiry into the system -
Intrastat - after fears that it underestimates imports. Preliminary findings
are expected to be available shortly and will be incorporated into the next
whole-world statistics due on May 12. They could show a substantial change
to the trade figures. Mr John Marsland, UK economist at UBS, said: 'This
month's large increase in exports is rather incredible and we should avoid
getting too optimistic.'
The CSO said its latest estimate of underlying trends in the value of trade
showed little change in either exports or imports, implying a flattening in
the trend of the visible deficit. In volume terms, excluding oil and erratic
items such as ships, aircraft and precious stones, it estimated no change to
the trend in exports but a  1/2 per cent per month increase for imports.
The rise in exports was due largely to increased exports of fuels and
manufactured goods. The deficit of trade in finished manufactures narrowed
to Pounds 598m in January, compared with Pounds 1.08bn in December. The
surplus of trade in oil grew to Pounds 340m in January, up from Pounds 214m
in December.
Surveys of the UK's biggest economic regions published yesterday confirmed
that the recovery is fairly evenly spread across the country, Paul
Cheeseright, Philip Coggan, and Ian Hamilton Fazey write.
In the West Midlands, the regional group of chambers of commerce reported
that companies in the services sector have started to recover more quickly
than those in manufacturing.
The survey, covering 594 companies, showed that 57 per cent of companies in
the service sector had more orders at the end of March than three months
before.
A survey by the chambers of commerce in north-west England showed that
manufacturers are investing more in plant and machinery.
A London Chamber of Commerce and Industry survey showed that employment and
investment intentions are picking up but there has been a slowdown in
domestic business growth.
Two of the biggest chambers of commerce, Westminster and London, yesterday
announced their intention to join forces in a move that will bring together
5,000 London businesses employing around 1m people.

FT  15 APR 94 / Safeguards for birds sought on Cardiff barrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Work on the Cardiff Bay barrage must not start until assurances are given
that more will be done to compensate for the loss of bird habitat, the
European Commission has told the government.
The 1.1km barrage will replace tidal mudflats with a 500-acre freshwater
lake intended to stimulate commercial development around the Welsh capital's
waterfront. The bird species most affected will be dunlin and redshank,
which are declining in Britain.
Site preparation for the barrage has been completed. Five weeks ago Cardiff
Bay Development Corporation recommended that the main Pounds 93m
construction contract should be awarded to a joint venture of Balfour Beatty
and Costain. However, the Welsh Office has yet to give its approval.
Mr Yannis Paleokrassas, environment commissioner, has called for the
assurances in a letter to Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. He says the
barrage may be acceptable for socio-economic reasons under the new habitats
directive which comes into force in June. But the government 'must undertake
to carry out as a matter of priority' additional compensation measures for
the birds, including the classification of the rest of the Severn estuary as
a special protection area.
The letter - written in January and leaked to Friends of the Earth, the
environmental group, which publishes it today - says there should also be a
management plan for the estuary's habitats and a clear 'national
conservation plan' for dunlins and redshanks.
The Department of the Environment said yesterday that the matter was
'ongoing' with the commission and considered 'confidential'. The Welsh
Office said it would not comment on a leaked document, nor on whether the
commission's demands were delaying the approval of the construction
contract. However, it added: 'We are quite confident that we have complied
with Brussels on the directive.'
Cardiff Bay Development Corporation intends to spend Pounds 5.7m creating an
alternative habitat of 740 acres, but most will not be saltwater. It said
the Severn estuary has 39,000 acres of mudflats and believed freshwater
species would come to Cardiff Bay's lake.
Friends of the Earth said the UK had one of the worst records in Europe for
designating special protection areas.

FT  15 APR 94 / Parties struggle to seize the high ground: Arguments over
the council tax miss the point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the local election campaign gathers pace, both Labour and the
Conservatives are claiming that the councils they run are cheaper. The
arguments have revolved around the council tax, but increasing government
controls over local authority spending, which have blurred accountability,
make it hard to sustain either party's arguments.
Claims by Mr David Curry, local government minister, are based on
'band-for-band' comparisons. The council tax is split into eight bands,
according to property value, and for all eight, the average bill is higher
in Labour authorities than Conservative councils - by Pounds 129 for band C,
in which most properties are graded. Nine of the 10 most expensive councils
on this measure are Labour-controlled.
For Labour, Mr Jack Straw argues that the average council tax paid in Labour
authorities is lower because most properties are in lower bands. Therefore
they need to charge more in each band, but the overall amount is less - by
an average of Pounds 40.
Government grants to local authorities are supposed to take differing
property values into account, so that straight band-for-band comparisons are
fair. However, Labour also claims that the final council tax figure is so
dependent on government grants that the comparison is pointless. For
example, according to Mr Straw, only 4 per cent of Westminster City
Council's total budget comes from council-taxpayers' funds.
Conservatives have also attacked Labour councils' spending records, with
figures which show that 18 of the 20 English councils with the highest debt
are Labour-controlled. According to the Conservative league table,
Manchester and Birmingham, with debts of Pounds 1.326bn and Pounds 1.233bn
respectively, both had higher external debts than any of Paraguay, Niger and
Nepal.
But these figures might merely reflect the greater needs of the urban areas
which tend to elect Labour councils.
Mr David Thomas, head of local government for the Chartered Institute of
Public Finance and Accountancy, said that all borrowing was for capital
expenditure and has to be cleared with the government. He added: 'Local
authority debt is really there because that authority has responded to
need.'
The true differences in councils' management culture emerge from figures for
areas where they have more direct control - contracting services, and
education.
Conservative councils are markedly more enthusiastic about competitive
tendering than their Labour counterparts. For example, the Institute of
Public Finance found that only 6 per cent of Labour authorities had let
refuse collection contracts to the private sector. The average for all
councils is 25 per cent, and Tory councils have allowed 41 per cent of
contracts to leave in-house teams.
There are still exceptions to the rule. Contractors claim that both Tory and
Labour councils have manipulated competitive tendering rules to favour
in-house employees.
On one big campaign issue, nursery education, Labour has a strong case that
its authorities deliver results. Provision for three- and four-year-olds is
the responsibility of local education authorities.
Department for Education figures suggest that Labour authorities have a
strong record for providing nursery places. Labour-controlled Newham had the
best record, providing places for 64 per cent of its three- and
four-year-olds. Judged on this statistic, 35 of the top 40 authorities for
nursery education are Labour-controlled, while only two - Hillingdon and
Ealing, which was Labour-controlled until 1990 - were run by the
Conservatives.
Only three of the 40 councils with the lowest provision were
Labour-controlled, while 25 are run by Conservatives.
Philosophical divisions such as this still present voters with real
decisions in local elections.

FT  15 APR 94 / Liberal Democrats forecast 25% increase in seats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats yesterday predicted they could increase their number
of local councillors by a quarter in next month's elections.
Mr Andrew Stunell, political secretary of the Association of Liberal
Democrat Councillors, said the party held about 310 of the seats being
defended in this year's round of elections, and forecast gains of more than
25 per cent.
He told a news conference in London that the party had seen a steady rise in
its town hall power from 864 council seats in 1978 to 4,200.
Although Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the party, has resisted making
forecasts, the Liberal Democrats have now made the most specific predictions
of all the big parties.
The Liberal Democrats are forecasting sweeping gains in councils such as
Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester, Birmingham, and St Helens, and the London
boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth, and are predicting that they will take
overall control of some, such as Colchester in Essex. The party is also
predicting that it will become the main opposition to Labour in the north
and the Tories in the south.
Its manifesto outlines policies to invest in education, make the fight
against crime a main priority, improve public transport and modernise
Britain's political system.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, yesterday accused the
government of a 'desperate and transparent attempt to bribe the electorate
in Westminster and Wandsworth'.
Launching Labour's London campaign, he said central government grants and
other external support accounted for 96 per cent of Westminster City
Council's spending, with the remaining 4 per cent coming from the council
tax.
However, Mr David Curry, local government minister, fiercely denied that
Westminster received money from central government or wrongly benefited from
the grants system.
'There is no way whatsoever in which the government has rigged, distorted,
or disfigured the cash flow so as to direct funds to Wandsworth or
Westminster or any other council,' Mr Curry stressed.
Westminster City Council has been accused by its district auditor of wasting
Pounds 21.25m in manipulating its housing policy to win votes.

FT  15 APR 94 / Rules on sale of discounted airline tickets tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Civil Aviation Authority yesterday announced tougher rules for travel
agents selling discounted scheduled airline tickets and cheap air holidays
to give more protection for consumers should the agent or tour operator
fail.
Under the new guidelines, the CAA will prosecute 'bucket shops' and other
cheap ticket agents and tour operators selling discounted tickets without an
Air Travel Organisers' Licence (ATOL).
The guidelines stress that all ticket sales must be covered by a licence,
unless the airline has authorised its agents to provide a flight or a
guaranteed refund.
Mrs Helen Simpson, CAA head of licensing and finance, said: 'From our
discussions with airlines we believe very few airlines have a comprehensive
agency agreement with their consolidators (agents).
'From now on we will assume that all consolidators must hold an ATOL to
cover their sales to the public unless they can prove otherwise.'
The CAA is also asking airlines to review their ticket distribution
arrangements with consolidators and agents.
The ATOL scheme protects travellers from losing money or being stranded
abroad if their tour operator fails. ATOL operators are examined every year
to ensure they are financially sound.
Before receiving a licence, the tour operator must also lodge a financial
guarantee. The CAA uses this money to refund consumers or pay for people to
continue their holiday and travel home as planned should the operator go

The CAA said that 128,000 consumers received refunds during the year ended
March 1993 and more than 30,000 people were repatriated. The total cost of
refunds and repatriations by the authority was Pounds 18.5m.

FT  15 APR 94 / Utility watchdogs backed: Carsberg warns government against
overhaul of regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, has come out strongly
against overhauling the system of utility regulation, warning of the
'private agendas' of those calling for change.
Speaking at a dinner, Sir Bryan advised the government to be 'cautious'
about change. 'Although not perfect, the achievements of the current system
have been substantial,' he said, and warned of the danger that reform would
politicise the regulatory process.
'The great strength of the present system is the removal of politicians from
the regime, (whose involvement) had pretty disastrous consequences in past,'
he said, referring to the detailed involvement of ministers in the
management of the utilities when they were nationalised industries.
As director-general of Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, from 1984
until 1992, Sir Bryan set parameters for the succession of regulatory
offices since established for the other privatised utilities, each a
statutory body largely independent of Whitehall.
Calls for reform have come most recently from Mr John Baker, chief executive
of National Power, the privatised electricity generator, and from City
institutions concerned at the coming regulatory reviews of the water and
electricity distribution industries.
Earlier this month Mr Baker publicly supported the idea that utility
regulators be brought together in a common organisation.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management and Prudential, the UK's
largest institutional investor, have been urging water companies to appeal
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission rather than accept any tough price
limits set by Ofwat, the water industry regulator.
Although not naming the critics, Sir Bryan dismissed those calling for
looser regulation. He noted that privatisation legislation made no mention
of 'light-rein' regulation, but imposed specific duties on regulators to
ensure fair competition and reasonable terms for consumers.
Sir Bryan also intervened in the dispute between British Telecommunications
and the government over the ban on BT carrying entertainment services. He
supported the ban as essential to promoting local competition in
telecommunications by the cable TV companies, but warned it would have to be
reviewed in due course 'otherwise we shall end up with new local monopolies
 -and we also don't want to lose the power of BT to innovate.'

FT  15 APR 94 / Court clarifies law on job transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contracting-out of services performed by only one employee is covered by
European Union employment protection rules, the European Court of Justice
has ruled.
The Luxembourg Court's ruling yesterday that the European Acquired Rights
Directive can apply to the contracting-out of cleaning services done by one
employee will affect government policy on contracting out public-sector
services.
The directive, which was enshrined in UK law by the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, known as Tupe, protects
employees' jobs and conditions when the business they work for changes
hands.
Confusion over whether such protection applies to contracting out has cast
doubt on the government's compulsory competitive tendering and
market-testing programmes.
Employment lawyers said the court's confirmation that the directive had a
broad application would disappoint contractors and the UK government.
Ms Melanie Tether, a partner of City solicitors Norton Rose, said the court
appeared to have pushed the frontiers of the directive further forward by
ruling that all that was needed for it to apply was for the contractor to be
carrying out the same type of work as performed before the transfer.
It rejected the UK and German governments' argument that for the directive
to apply, there had to be a transfer of assets to the contractor.
European Union social policy should concentrate on disseminating best
practice 'rather than choking off job creation and hindering EU
competitiveness', according to the government's formal response to the
European Commission's green paper on social policy.
It says the green paper should not form the basis of a new round of social
legislation.

FT  15 APR 94 / Black joblessness blamed on race bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discrimination is the main reason why black people in Britain face an
unemployment rate three times as high as that facing whites, according to a
Trade Union Congress report on black workers in the labour market published
today.
'What recovery there has been in the labour market has completely bypassed
the black workforce,' said Mr John Monks, general secretary, yesterday.
'Evidence suggests they are the last to be hired and the first to be fired.'
The study suggests the sort of jobs black workers do does not provide a
explanation for the higher unemployment rate.
It says black workers are mainly under-represented in recession-prone
industries such as construction. The report says: 'The geographical
concentration of ethnic minority workers can only explain some of the
differences. Nor can lack of qualifications be a convincing explanation.'

   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gartmore House, a 23,000 sq ft office block near the Monument, in London, is
being sold for about Pounds 10m, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The deal reflects the strength of demand for good-quality property, which
has pushed City property yields - the ratio of income to capital  - down to
the lowest levels for several years.
Gartmore House, occupied by Gartmore Investment Management and Bass
Holdings, is being sold on a yield of below 6.5 per cent.
Separately, Baltic House, a 53,000 sq ft building in Leadenhall Street, has
been sold to AMP Asset Management for Pounds 20m, on a yield of 6.75 per
cent. The building was sold by a private Dutch company which bought the
building 11 months ago for Pounds 13.8m.
However, the top prices being paid for City buildings are about half those
at the peak of the market in 1989, when deals were struck at prices of
Pounds 1,200 per sq ft.

FT  15 APR 94 / BA intensifies fares war
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways yesterday intensified the air fares war it sparked three
weeks ago by launching a second package of bargain fares covering virtually
its entire UK domestic and European networks.
The fare cuts of up to 50 per cent will involve more than 200 routes and
will be available from today until May 6 for travel up to the end of June.
Fares on BA's domestic trunk routes are being cut by a quarter with return
flights between London and Aberdeen, Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness,
Jersey, Newquay, Newcastle and Plymouth costing Pounds 70. Return fares
between London and Manchester and on a number of internal Scottish routes
have been cut to Pounds 50.
There are also savings of more than Pounds 500 for leisure travellers to
South America, a Pounds 99 saving on the return flight to Boston and a
saving of Pounds 109 on a return ticket to Washington.
Most of the promotional fares need no advance booking. Trips to Europe and
North America must include a Saturday night and those elsewhere must be for
at least a week.
BA said more of the 'World Offer' fares would be introduced when the current
batch of discounts closed.

Pounds 10m, Vanessa Houlder writes.

National Bank of Chicago, was sold by a private Dutch company which bought
the building 11 months ago for Pounds 13.8m.
The deals reflect strong demand for good quality property, which is expected

By contrast, there has been a marked drop in demand for buildings with poor
rental prospects. Agents estimate that more than Pounds 500m of this type of
property is on the market.
However, the top prices being paid for City buildings are about half those

European Union social policy should concentrate on disseminating best
practice 'rather than choking off job creation and hindering EU
competitiveness', according to the government's formal response to the
European Commission's green paper on social policy, David Goodhart writes.
The green paper, published at the end of last year, should not form the
basis of a new round of social leglislation, says the response.
Presenting the document last night, Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary,
said all future action by the community must respect the deep-seated
diversity of national traditions and institutions.
Social policy should focus on:
Support for member states' efforts to improve the functioning of their
labour markets.
Making a reality of existing treaty rights.
Effective implementation and enforcement of existing measures.
Mr Hunt said the EU had a 'vital role' to play in ensuring that 'expertise
gained in the various member states in dealing with problems of employment,
unemployment, employee relations, and equal opportunity is widely
disseminated'.

FT  15 APR 94 / Major in clash on NHS claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday rejected reports that people over the age of 65 were
being denied treatment by the National Health Service.
The prime minister was involved in a heated clash with Mrs Margaret Beckett,
deputy Labour leader, at prime ministers' question time.
Mrs Beckett said the government was responsible for denying treatment on the
grounds of age. Mr Major accused her of 'peddling an untruth' in a
politically motivated scaremongering campaign.
Mr Major rephrased the charge at the direction of Miss Betty Boothroyd, the
speaker - but refused Labour demands that he should withdraw it and
apologise to Mrs Beckett for accusing her of lying.
The prime minister insisted: 'No one is denied proper treatment at any stage
in the National Health Service.'
He rebuked the BBC for being 'wholly irresponsible' in highlighting a claim
by a 73-year-old Brighton man that his treatment for chronic arthritis had
been stopped because of his age. Mr Major said two patients referred to had
simply been offered better options.
Mrs Beckett denied misleading the House. She said one of the patients
referred to had received a letter of apology from the hospital: 'That does
not sound to me like something that did not happen.'
Miss Boothroyd said she regarded what the prime minister had said as
unparliamentary. 'It is for me to decide whether the rephrasing of it was
acceptable. I deemed it was acceptable,' she said.

FT  15 APR 94 / Industry shows caution over private roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday called for the views of the construction industry
on its plans for the private sector to build and operate a new generation of
toll roads.
The Department of Transport announced 21 schemes worth between Pounds 10m
and Pounds 350m which could be included in its 'design, build, finance and
operate' initiative.
They include improvements to the A1(M), a link road joining the M1 with the
A1, several bypasses and widening schemes on the M1, M6 and M25 motorways.
The government is keen to enhance its Pounds 18bn roads programme with
private finance and to involve private companies in building and operating
roads more efficiently.
The programme would involve 'shadow tolling', with the government paying
road operators for the number of vehicles using their roads. It is seen as a
first step towards the introduction in the late 1990s, of a full-scale
system of electronic tolling with direct payments by motorway users.
The initial response from construction companies and roads groups was
cautious.
Trafalgar House, which operates the M25 toll-bridge at Dartford, said it was
interested in the idea but needed to see more details.
Trafalgar House has been involved in preparing the Birmingham northern
relief road for the past three years but has to wait another 18 months while
a public inquiry is held.
The RAC, the motoring organisation, warned that only two of the 21 schemes
proposed had completed all stages of the planning process. 'Until all of the
schemes have been signed and sealed the financiers are unlikely to want to
put up any money,' it said.
The Department of Transport said it wanted contractors to assume a
substantial amount of the risk. There would be incentives and penalties to
encourage companies to reduce the times road were closed for repairs,
provide a high-quality road surface and design safe roads.
The initiative is unlikely to be used to build new motorways but it could
apply to motorway widening, the upgrading of existing trunk roads and
building new by-passes, the government said.

FT  15 APR 94 / German rival could rescue Lancer Boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck producer, last night emerged as
the leading contender to buy the UK operations of its rival Lancer Boss,
after clinching a deal to buy Steinbock Boss, the Bedfordshire company's
German unit.
The purchase, a day earlier than expected, comes less than a week after
Steinbock Boss's German bankers, led by Bayerische Hypo-Bank, withdrew
facilities from the company, prompting directors to call in a receiver. This
forced Lancer Boss to call in administrative receivers to its UK operations.
Last night Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, chairman of Lancer Boss before the
receivership, said Jung-heinrich's purchase of Steinbock Boss put it in
'pole position' to buy Lancer Boss.
He added: 'I am glad that the anxiety has been taken away for the workers at
Steinbock.'
The deal means that a bid from a UK company, conditional on buying both the
UK and German parts of the collapsed group, has lapsed.
Mr Allan Griffiths, partner at Grant Thornton and one of the administrative
receivers for the UK operations, said: 'Given the new situation, and the
close synergy between the different ranges produced by Lancer Boss and
Steinbock Boss, we will be looking forward to discussions with the directors
of Jungheinrich on future co-operation between the two companies.'
Throughout this week Mr Griffiths has been trying to win the co-operation of
the German receiver, Mr Werner Folger, because he believed that the group
was worth more if the UK and German units were sold together. But there has
been some frustration in the UK at the speed of events in Germany. The
German banks have been keen to see Steinbock Boss sold to Jungheinrich as
quickly as possible.
There has been considerable interest in Lancer Boss but very few bids
because would-be buyers have been given so little time. Speaking before the
purchase of Steinbock Boss was known, Mr Griffiths said the case differed
from other UK receiverships where a shortlist could be drawn up of buyers
which would have time for 'due diligence' examinations.
Terms for the purchase of Steinbock Boss were not disclosed but Jungheinrich
said the 'rapid and unbureaucratic' sale of the company was necessary to
overcome uncertainty among dealers and customers before next week's
important Hanover trade fair.
It said a quick deal was possible because the German banking group had made
a 'concrete financial contribution' to secure Steinbock's plant at Moosburg
and the workers' jobs. Mr Klaus Schenk, managing director of
Manchester-based Jungheinrich (GB), said the takeover put Steinbock Boss in
a healthy financial position.

FT  15 APR 94 / Pergau fears of trade minister 'overruled by PM'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister and senior members of the government endorsed an offer of
overseas aid to Malaysia to build the Pergau dam in 1991, in spite of
objections by the trade minister at the time, it was revealed yesterday.
According to evidence given to the Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr
Tim Sainsbury, who was trade minister before the last general election,
called for the offer of Pounds 234m of aid for the dam project to be
scrapped at a ministerial meeting in February of that year.
Mr Richard Needham, the current trade minister, told the committee that Mr
Sainsbury had argued that Britain should not use its aid-and-trade provision
to build a hydro-electric power station in Malaysia, but should use the
funds for alternative gas projects.
Mr Needham did not specify why his predecessor had taken this view.
However, Mr Sainsbury's objections coincided with concerns expressed in
Whitehall that the hydro-electric project would result in Malaysian
consumers paying over Pounds 100m more for electricity during the 35-year
life of the project than if the money was invested elsewhere.
According to Mr Needham, the objections to the Pergau project were overruled
by ministers in other departments. He said Mr Sainsbury's position 'was not
the view of the Foreign Office, certainly not the view of the Malaysian high
commissioner, foreign secretary or the prime minister'.
Instead, Mr Needham argued that it would have been impossible to scrap the
aid offer without damaging the broad canvas of Anglo-Malaysian relations.
'The real question,' he said, 'is whether in February 1991 it was realistic
to go back to the Malaysians and say: 'Sorry, two years after all of this we
now have to tell you we think you don't know what you are talking about . .
. and we will give you a gas-fired power station instead.' The Malaysians
would have said: 'Thank you very much, goodbye', and phoned up the
Japanese.'
Nevertheless, the revelation about Mr Sainsbury's views shows that concern
about the project was not confined to officials at the Overseas Development
Administration.
Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the ODA, raised strong
objections to the project on economic grounds.
In the summer of 1991, he requested Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
to supply him with a 'ministerial direction' to incur expenditure on the
Pergau dam, thereby absolving him of any blame for approving funds.

FT  15 APR 94 / One-man band takes Ulster lead: David Owen reports on the MP
elected as first chairman of the Northern Ireland committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one of the most delicate jobs in British politics and the first man to
hold it is the head of the smallest political party in the Commons.
Sir James Kilfedder, MP for North Down since 1970 and leader of the tiny
Ulster Popular Unionist party, was yesterday elected chairman of the new
Northern Ireland select committee.
Emerging from a Westminster committee room after the first meeting Sir
James, a former speaker of the Ulster Assembly set up while Lord Prior was
Northern Ireland secretary in the early 1980s, said he was 'greatly
honoured'.
He said the committee's establishment would benefit the province both
because it would improve parliamentary scrutiny of Ulster affairs and
because the spectacle of Northern Ireland MPs working together as a team
would set 'an excellent example to other people in the province'.
The committee is expected to make its first visit to the province - a highly
symbolic gesture - within a month.
Yesterday's appointment is understood to have been unanimous and, as his
first remarks suggest, Sir James's priority will be to ensure that the
committee establishes a reputation for handling its agenda sensibly and does
not fall prey to the partisan point-scoring that has tended to blight past
Ulster-related political initiatives.
The inter-party wrangling over the composition, with Labour complaining
bitterly about its quota of two MPs on the 13-member committee, suggests
that this will not be easy.
Sir James will almost certainly seek to improve the committee's prospects of
getting off to a good start by steering clear of subjects impinging too
directly on the UK-Irish peace initiative.
If he has his way then those keen for the committee to sink its teeth
immediately into the Anglo-Irish agreement or the functioning of the
security services will be disappointed. Economics, health and
agriculture-related subjects are much more likely to be on the committee'e
initial agenda.
Sir James is a committed devolutionist and is anxious for the committee to
be seen as a step towards a new Ulster assembly and not an integrationist
symbol.
Perhaps not surprisingly in view of his four years as speaker, he thinks
highly of the Prior assembly's 'rolling devolution' initiative and sees the
assembly's dissolution in 1986 as a wasted opportunity.
In spite of the high esteem in which he holds Lady Thatcher, he ranks the
Tory 'wet' Lord Prior alongside Labour's Mr Roy Mason as the best Northern
Ireland secretaries of recent times.
The fact that the new body will be the only Commons select committee not to
have an inbuilt Tory majority will place an additional responsibility on Sir
James's shoulders. There is a real chance that his casting vote will be
called upon quite frequently to break ties between the six Conservative
committee members and the MPs from the other political parties.
Although he sits on the Tory benches in the House of Commons, Sir James has
a strong independent streak - as indicated by his decision to soldier on as
virtually as a one-man band since resigning from the Ulster Unionist party
15 years ago. It remains to be seen whether he will toe the party line as
assiduously as some of his Conservative friends would like.
In his Georgian drawing-room, with its peerless view over the yachts and
eider ducks in Bangor Harbour, it is easy to see how Sir James's avuncular
charm has made him a popular and respected figure at Westminster.
The extent to which he manages to retain this popularity across the
political spectrum in his new role will be an important gauge of the
committee's effectiveness.

A new ethical framework governing chartered accountants' objectivity and
independence was proposed yesterday by the profession's Joint Ethics
Committee.
The committee is suggesting an 'analytical approach' to replace the
piecemeal standards governing ethical standards.
It wants accountants to consider the expectations of those directly affected
by their work, the public, the environment in which the work is conducted,
the threats to objectivity and the safeguards needed to offset any threats.

Both houses have already decided that small shops should be able to trade
without restriction on Sundays but that shops of more than 280 sq m should

FT  15 APR 94 / Fears on London rail project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed CrossRail project, an underground railway to provide an
east-west link under London, is ahead of its time and could not be justified
until at least 2010, a report released yesterday says, Charles Batchelor
writes.
A review of the Pounds 2bn project by the Bovis construction company and the
Sir Alexander Gibb engineering consultancy for a Commons committee concludes
that CrossRail is 'a visionary project which may be ahead of its time'. It
doubts whether CrossRail will attract sufficient private finance to make it
viable.
CrossRail and the Corporation of London said the report had been prepared in
six weeks and its authors had had to make 'major simplifications (which)
have seriously affected certain results'.
Mr Michael Cassidy, the corporation's policy chairman said: 'Railways have
to be planned to meet demand for decades, not just for the first year of
operation.'

FT  15 APR 94 / Life groups seek tax moves to enhance competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes in taxation on life insurance to enable UK life insurers to compete
more effectively in the rest of Europe are to be urged on the Inland Revenue
by the Association of British Insurers.
However the recommendations are likely to fall far short of the immediate
wholesale shift in life insurance taxation that a significant minority in
the life industry would like to see.
The ABI, the trade association for the insurance industry, held a meeting
yesterday to take views from members before responding to the Revenue. It
must reply by the end of the month but is expected to call for more time to
consider whether widespread changes should be made over the longer term.
One of the main elements in the association's proposal would affect taxation
of services business where the insurer does not have to have an office in
the country in which the policyholder lives. This is not permitted now but
will be after changes in European law on life insurance, due to take effect
at the start of July.
Mr Michael Cole, group taxation manager at Prudential, said that if UK
insurers were to be able to compete effectively in Europe, the tax systems
must be brought more into line.
The UK system taxes income to policyholders as it builds up in the funds.
Most of the rest of Europe taxes income when it is withdrawn from the fund
and reaches the individual.
Mr Cole said: 'If we are to be able to compete we need a system similar to
theirs, and it is possible to achieve that without affecting the whole UK
business. There is already a different regime if you write business abroad.'
The Revenue is expected to put proposals to Treasury ministers next month.
It is also likely to seek to close a loophole in the existing system by
making sure that the investment element of offshore reinsurance does not
slip through the tax net.
Mr Nigel Collard, head of tax at Legal &amp; General, said that many in the
industry believed that it would take time for the pattern of business in the
European single market to emerge.
In the meantime, he said the best course was to keep the present system,
with some adjustments, without rushing for a radical overhaul.

FT  15 APR 94 / Union in contempt over post strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UCW communications union became in contempt of court yesterday after
about 1,000 Liverpool members refused to end an unofficial and illegal
strike over a disputed tea break.
Royal Mail yesterday obtained a High Court injunction demanding a return to
work, but strikers at Liverpool's main Copperas Hill sorting centre stayed
out. Postboxes were sealed as work dried up at 11 delivery centres in
Merseyside and parts of Cheshire.
Liverpool Chamber of Commerce and Industry advised businesses to go to the
Preston postal district for posting mail for delivery outside the area.
The UCW, which has repudiated the strike, said it would probably make a
statement in London today. The union is legally responsible for its members'
actions and could face heavy fines if they continue to defy the court.
The strike began on Wednesday when a worker was suspended for three days -
under what the Royal Mail claims is an agreed disciplinary procedure - after
a heated argument between the worker and his supervisor over an unauthorised
tea-break.
Royal Mail said its operations at Liverpool Airport were not affected.

FT  15 APR 94 / Medway directors to sue in share row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two company directors dismissed by Mr Peter Vincent, the former Medway Ports
chief executive who made Pounds 12m when his company was taken over last
September by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, are to sue accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick.
They are claiming negligence and false valuation arising from the price paid
by Mersey docks for the Medway ports. Some 270 dockers dismissed by the
company in November 1993 are likely to take similar action. The dockers won
an industrial tribunal ruling in March that they had been unfairly
dismissed, and hope action against KPMG will lead to further court moves for
restitution of shareholdings.
Mersey docks bought Medway Ports for Pounds 104m, valuing each share at
Pounds 37.50. Three months earlier KPMG Peat Marwick had valued the shares
at Pounds 2.50. Medway had insisted that the two dismissed directors and 270
dockers - who had been given or bought shares in the company at
privatisation in 1992 - sell their shares back to the company at the KPMG
valuation.
Mr Vincent, who bought shares equivalent to those sold by the two directors
in June 1992 at 250p, resigned from the board of Mersey docks on Wednesday,
citing a desire to pursue other interests.
Mersey docks' annual report, published three weeks ago, makes clear that Mr
Vincent was expected to have a long career with the company.
The Medway acquisition led to his becoming the largest individual
shareholder, and share options offered him an opportunity to secure
substantial gains from 1996.
Mr Vincent acquired 921,486 ordinary shares in Mersey docks - 1.03 per cent
of the total on the market - on becoming a director on October 19. Two days
later he and two other Medway directors were granted 125,000 irrevocable
share options each at a subscription price of 397p, exercisable between
October 1996 and October 2003.

</HEADLINE>

   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK is on course for a low rate of inflation and a 'steadily
strengthening' economic recovery, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, told
the Commons yesterday.
In an upbeat assessment aimed at ending fears about the impact of tax
increases taking effect this month he said Britain was set to have the
fastest growing economy in western Europe this year and next.
Mr Clarke played down his recent differences with Mr Eddie George, governor
of the Bank of England, over interest-rate policy,
These were highlighted by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, following the
publication on Wednesday of the minutes of meetings earlier this year
between Mr Clarke and the governor.
Mr Brown reminded the chancellor that in February he had stated that a
quarter point interest-rate cut was sufficient, while telling Mr George
twice as much was necessary.
Mr Clarke said the 'genuine discussion' ended in agreement and with him
exercising his responsibility as chancellor to decide interest-rate levels.

FT  15 APR 94 / Tories launch Euro campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday put free trade and competitiveness at the centre of
its European election campaign as senior ministers sought to quash
speculation that a poor result could trigger a leadership challenge to Mr
John Major.
Launching the party's election campaign at Conservative Central Office in
London, ministers and officials said the party was united behind a
free-market approach to Europe and opposition to socialist domination of the
European parliament.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary - the two main alternative candidates - ruled out a
leadership challenge and denied that the election amounted to a referendum
on Mr Major.
'We have both said that neither of us would ever stand against John Major.
There is no leadership issue,' Mr Clarke said. Mr Heseltine told
journalists: 'I agree with everything that Ken has said.'
Mr Heseltine said the prime minister would 'put forward the policies of this
government with the united support of this government. What he won't do is
abandon the essential policies which he believes are necessary to enable the
economy to continue to recover.'
But there was continued speculation at Westminster about Mr Major's future
if the Tories poll badly in the European elections on June 9 and the local
elections on May 5.
Launching the European campaign, Mr Heseltine, Mr Clarke and Mr David Hunt,
employment secretary, said there was a clear contrast between Labour's
commitment to regulation and the Conservatives' free-market approach.
'The Conservative contribution to the European debate is based on
competitiveness, free trade, low marginal taxes and supply-side reform
delivered within a sound macroeconomic framework.
'Here in Britain we are delivering the goods and we are showing the way to
our European allies,' Mr Clarke said. 'By contrast, the Labour and Liberal
parties would drive a coach and horses through carefully laid economic
policies.'
Mr Heseltine said there was growing support in the EU for Conservative
policies such as free trade, deregulation and more flexible labour markets.

FT  15 APR 94 / Government sets out terms for ERM truce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday set out the terms for a truce between the
Conservative party's pro-Europeans and Euro-sceptics on Britain's attitude
to the European exchange rate mechanism.
In a series of carefully crafted phrases, the party's economic policy
document for the European elections campaign declares that Britain will not
consider re-entry to the ERM in the foreseeable future. The wording was
approved by Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
But the formulation of the document - A Competitive Britain in a Competitive
Europe - left the door open for a change of heart after the next election.
The document says that Britain's criticism of the ERM had been widely
acknowledged. In those circumstances, it says, 'we will not re-enter such a
mechanism in the foreseeable future, nor could we do so until it is clear
that such faults no longer exist'.
That olive branch to the Euro-sceptics is followed by a reassurance to
pro-Europeans that 'we will not, however, cut ourselves off from future
discussion of how economic policies can best be co-ordinated within the
European Union in order to secure competitiveness, growth and jobs'.
Ministers said the wording would provide the basis of the party's position
to be set out in the full manifesto next month.
Ministers also voiced confidence that the formulation would bridge the sharp
divide on Tory back benches over ERM membership.
On the issue of a single currency, the document repeats the studiously
neutral position implied by Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht treaty.
Parliament would retain the right to take a separate decision - in the light
of Britain's interest and needs - if and when other members of the EU moved
to create a single currency.

FT  15 APR 94 / Pollution liability threatens pits sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At least 200km of rivers in England and Wales are polluted by leaks from
abandoned coal mines, the National Rivers Authority, the water quality
watchdog, said yesterday.
Uncertainty over liability for this pollution needs to be settled before the
privatisation of British Coal takes place, said Lord Crickhowell, the
watchdog's chairman.
British Coal now operates just 17 pits. In the past year it has stopped
mining at more than 30 pits, but is still pumping water at some to prevent
them leaking into rivers and water tables.
The watchdog is concerned that the proposed Coal Authority will not take
responsibility for the pollution. But bidders for the 16 deep mines and 31
opencast mines put up for sale by the government may be concerned that they
may have to pay for pollution control.

FT  15 APR 94 / Sainsbury ready to launch new cola
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sainsbury, the UK's biggest supermarket group, is about to launch a new
own-label cola brand called Classic - but yesterday insisted that it wanted
to avert a costly marketing war with Coca Cola.
Mr Tom Vyner, Sainsbury deputy chairman, said that the new drink - the first
US cola to be packaged under a UK supermarket label - will go on sale as old
stock runs out.
In the US, Coca Cola's regular product is sold as Coca Cola Classic. Ms
Penny Hughes, president of Coca Cola's UK division, has said it will take
legal action if Sainsbury infringes its trademarks. She added: 'Coca Cola
Classic (as a brand name) is owned worldwide.'
Mr Vyner said Sainsbury had registered the trademark Sainsbury's Classic in
1988, but had been waiting until the drink was improved before launching it.
It is being supplied by Cott Corporation, a Canadian company whose
supermarket brands have captured more than 20 per cent of the Canadian
retail market in the past three years.
Mr Vyner said there was no question of Sainsbury adopting the aggressive
advertising techniques of the Canadian supermarkets. Much of this makes
specific negative references to Coca Cola. 'We have a good relationship with
Coca Cola,' Mr Vyner said.
However Coca Cola may launch an advertising campaign this weekend saying
that it is the only 'genuine Coke'.

FT  15 APR 94 / Post Office warns on sell-off delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday rejected Post
Office claims that 30,000 jobs are at risk because of delays in
privatisation.
In the latest shot in a long-running campaign for privatisation, Mr Bill
Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, claimed that a quarter of the UK's
20,000 post offices could close unless the organisation was given commercial
freedom. Mr Cockburn said Post Office business was being eroded by
competitors while the government delayed the conclusions of a 21-month
review of its future. 'We are just weeks away from serious damage,' he said.
Mr Cockburn's comments echoed a warning from the Tory-dominated Commons
trade and industry committee that the Post Office was being damaged by the
government's failure to decide whether to go ahead with privatisation.
However, Mr Heseltine said it would be 'wrong' to conclude the review
prematurely because of pressure from senior Post Office managers.
'Jobs are at risk because new technology might change the demand for labour,
or because there are economies of scale to be achieved. That has nothing to
do with the timing of the review,' he said.
'They are not going to lose 30,000 jobs whether we report on the future of
the Post Office this month or next month.'
Mr Heseltine has made clear that he favours privatisation, but ministers are
aware that legislation would face strong opposition in the Commons. Many
rural Conservative MPs believe that the Post Office would close uneconomic
sub-post offices after privatisation.
Early privatisation is opposed by some members of the cabinet, who fear that
further controversial legislation would worsen divisions in the Conservative
party.
Mr Cockburn said that up to 20 per cent of Post Office business was at risk.
'We must not be seduced into believing that the current status quo is a safe
haven: the Post Office must escape the constraints on its investment imposed
by the public sector borrowing requirement, or face a future of declining
business and rising prices,' he said.
Mr Cockburn said the government should 'take the time it needs to reach the
right decision, but to lose opportunities by default makes no sense'.

FT  15 APR 94 / Call for probe of MP losses at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP for Neath, yesterday called for an inquiry into
allegations that Conservative MPs facing losses at Lloyd's have been
assisted by payments from special funds.
Mr Hain, who has tabled three parliamentary motions on Lloyd's in recent
weeks, told the Commons that 51 Conservative MPs who are Names face
aggregate losses of Pounds 22m.
Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, blocked a further early day motion on the
grounds that the procedure was being wrongly used to 'campaign' against the
MPs involved.
However, Mr Hain told MPs at question time that the prime minister should
set up an inquiry to establish whether Conservative MPs are being protected
by:
'Retrospective stop-loss policies which they have knowingly or unknowingly
been allocated (to) by their agents, and which are not available to other
Lloyd's Names;
'Their losses being financed from Lloyd's central funds whilst they are not
responsible for payment like other Lloyd's Names;
'Their losses being paid by their members' agency . . . especially bearing
in mind that other external Names face destitution whilst Tory MPs with
similar average lines in lossmaking syndicates miraculously have not.'
Mr Hain's campaign has been strongly criticised by some Conservative MPs.

FT  15 APR 94 / Auditors ethical standard proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new ethical framework governing chartered accountants' objectivity and
independence was proposed yesterday by the profession's Joint Ethics
Committee.
The committee is suggesting an 'analytical approach' to replace the
piecemeal standards now dictating ethical standards.
Mr Brian Currie, chairman of the committee, said that maintaining
objectivity was the most important factor rather than 'independence', which
is easily misinterpreted.
His recommendations are that in considering taking on work, accountants
should consider the expectations of those directly affected; the public
interest; the environment in which the work is conducted; the threats of
objectivity; and the safeguards to offset any threats.
It highlights five types of threats to objectivity:
Self-interest: such as from a financial share or interest in the client or a
desire for additional work, or fear of losing a client;
Self-review: such as when examining the auditors' own judgment in previous
years which in hindsight appear incorrect or inappropriate;
Advocacy: in litigation or other adversarial proceedings;
Familiarity or trust: when the auditor may be over -influenced by the
client's personality and qualities and too sympathetic to their interests;
Intimidation: by a dominating personality or other actual or feared
pressures.

FT  15 APR 94 / World Trade News: US-Japan row tests EU patience - Sir Leon
Brittan talks to Guy de Jonquieres in Marrakesh

<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, warned yesterday that he
would not wait much longer for the US to show whether it was ready to pursue
his proposal to involve the EU in its talks with Tokyo on reducing the
Japanese trade surplus.
He said in an interview that he would decide in the next few weeks whether
the trilateral proposal had any future. That would depend partly on whether
the Clinton administration met EU requests to clarify the fundamental
objectives of its trade policy towards Japan.
He also said that Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, had assured him
this week for the first time that Washington accepted that the Uruguay Round
world trade deal would substantially reduce US scope to impose unilateral
sanctions on other countries under its Super-301 trade provisions.
Sir Leon called the assurance 'of very great significance'. However, he said
that US insistence that it could still legally use Super-301 in some
circumstances was 'objectionable and unfortunate'.
He was speaking ahead of a meeting between himself and Mr Tsutomu Hata,
Japan's foreign minister. At that meeting Mr Hata apparently expressed
reservations about the trilateral approach but assured Sir Leon that any
agreement with the US would be extended equally to the EU. Mr Hata was later
due to meet Mr Kantor and US Vice-President Al Gore.
Sir Leon, who first suggested a trilateral initiative to tackle Japan's
trade surplus earlier this year, said he wanted to resolve the matter
quickly because his personal credibility was at stake. 'I do not see that
there is any useful purpose served by keeping it up in the air,' he said.
He expressed impatience at the US failure to explain clearly what it wanted
from Japan. Mr Kantor had promised to give Brussels - but had not delivered
 -US papers prepared for the abortive meeting in February between President
Bill Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, then Japan's prime minister. The EU
planned another effort to discover US intentions soon.
If the trilateral proposal proved unworkable, the EU would feel free to
criticise the US publicly on issues such as attempts to set targets for a
cut in Japan's bilateral surplus in specific sectors. Sir Leon said such
targets were 'very dangerous' and threatened EU interests.
Sir Leon also cast doubt on the prospects for an EU agreeing with the US to
free trade in telecommunications equipment. The two sides plan further talks
after failing to conclude a deal as part of a package of bilateral measures
to liberalise public procurement agreed on Wednesday.
He said he was 'not really focusing' on telecommunications markets, which
were mainly of interest to the US. 'I regarded the whole telecommunications
issue as an obstacle rather than an opportunity (in the public procurement
talks),' he said.
However, he said the procurement deal - which he had not previously thought
possible - showed that the two sides could settle bilateral disputes.

<TEXT>
The Cairns Group of farm product exporters is to stay in being, to continue
the push for agricultural trade reform, Mr Bob McMullan, Australia's trade
minister, announced in Marrakesh yesterday
The 14-strong group, chaired by Australia, was set up, just before the
Uruguay Round talks began, to lobby for reductions in trade-distorting farm
subsidies. Other members are Canada, New Zealand, Brazil, Chile, Argentina,
Thailand, Uruguay, Colombia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Fiji, Hungary and the
Philippines.
The Uruguay Round deal involves cuts of a third in agricultural export
subsidies and a fifth in domestic farm supports, over six years. Further
negotiations are planned before that period is up to reduce subsidies
further.
US and Canadian ministers failed to resolve a dispute over Canadian wheat
exports to the US. Negotiators said the talks would resume at midday today
in an attempt to reach agreement before an April 22 deadline for US
sanctions.

FT  15 APR 94 / World Trade News: Agenda takes shape for new trade
negotiations
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The 120-plus nations at the Gatt ministerial meeting in Marrakesh have begun
to set the agenda for future trade negotiations - even before the formal
signing today of the Uruguay Round world trade accords. Ministers yesterday
adopted a series of decisions relating to the new World Trade Organisation
to be set up next year. In particular they have agreed to establish a
preparatory committee which, among other things, will be charged with
discussing items for the WTO's initial work programme.
They are also establishing a committee with a wide-ranging brief to examine
links between trade and the environment.
This week's meeting presages a delicate task for the preparatory committee
in striking the right balance in the WTO's negotiating agenda between the
interests of rich and poor nations, and in honing the list to manageable
proportions.
Pressure from industrialised countries, led by the US, to make workers'
rights a priority has antagonised developing countries and sparked calls for
negotiations on many issues, from labour mobility to company law.
Arguing that the rich nations already stand to corner the lion's share of
Uruguay Round benefits, developing countries this week have come up with an
alternative agenda.
Their ministers have urged discussion of labour mobility, restrictive
business practices of multinational corporations, commodities trade and
fluctuating exchange rates.
Developing countries also want stronger WTO mechanisms to help them expand
export capacity and to compensate Round losers through aid and debt relief.
Meanwhile, the European Union and others have proposed discussions on
competition policy, Japan wants regional trade blocs and investment rules on
the agenda, and Italy has suggested study of the harmonisation of company
and commercial law.
On trade and the environment, where a work programme has been agreed,
developing countries were eventually won over by assurances in the new
committee's brief that they faced no threat from disguised protectionism
under environmental cover.
Even so, this week's meeting has demonstrated continued suspicion of western
motives, reinforced by the vigorous lobbying of environmental groups which
want trade rules subservient to 'green' objectives.
Even more concern has been voiced by developing countries about putting
workers' rights on the agenda. Though they managed last week to head off a
US bid to have a reference to 'internationally recognised labour standards'
in today's ministerial declaration, the issue is expected to be mentioned,
along with others, in the chairman's concluding statement.
Speaking to the FT yesterday, Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, said
the next stage had to be a 'hearts and minds operation' to calm Third World
suspicions that workers' rights were not simply a code word for raising
trade barriers against low-wage countries.
He emphasised that low wages and inadequate social security systems were not
unfair trading practices but a legitimate source of comparative advantage.
Any agreement would have to be a multilateral one, with no scope for
unilateral application of trade rules.
However, the facade of EU unity on the matter was sharply questioned
yesterday by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister. He said that the
Commission, as well as the 12 member governments, remained divided on the
issue.

FT  15 APR 94 / World Trade News: Bananas jeopardise procurement deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
As more than 120 governments prepared to sign the most important world trade
deal in history, European Union ministers were struggling in Marrakesh to
surmount deep divisions over a bitter dispute about the import of bananas.
Though the row does not directly threaten the planned signature of the
Uruguay Round trade accord today, it could cast a pall over the ceremony and
jeopardise a parallel accord to open to international competition public
procurement contracts worth more than Dollars 300bn a year.
EU ministers were summoned to an emergency meeting last night to try to
resolve the issue. However, the meeting was abandoned after efforts by the
European Commission and the Greek presidency failed to find enough common
ground for agreement.
The ministers plan to meet again today, barely six hours before governments
belonging to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are due to start
signing the Uruguay Round.
The dispute stems from Germany's concern that a court case it has brought
challenging the EU's proposed regime for banana imports could be prejudiced
by obligations imposed by the Uruguay Round. Germany is supported by Belgium
and the Netherlands.
The Commission has offered Germany assurances that its legal rights will be
fully protected. However, France has said that unless Germany withdraws its
court case entirely, it will refuse to sign the new Gatt agreement on
government procurement.
That would prevent the EU subscribing to the agreement and could undermine
an important bilateral deal on procurement it reached with the US on
Wednesday. That in turn could discourage other Gatt members from going ahead
with plans to liberalise their procurement rules.
Last night's meeting was delayed until Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry
minister, arrived from Paris. However, other delegations said he had a
dinner engagement and did not participate in discussions.
Germany wants to be able to import more 'dollar' bananas grown in Latin
American countries. France fears that this could reduce banana imports from
its colonies and territories in the Caribbean. However, its decision to link
the issue to the procurement agreement is surprising because it stands to
gain most from freer competition for public contracts.

FT  15 APR 94 / World Trade News: Rival for Geneva as WTO site - Marrakesh
Diary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the unresolved issues at this week's meeting is the delicate question
of the location of the headquarters of the new World Trade Organisation, the
larger and grander body which will succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade next year.
It had been widely thought until recently that the WTO would be sited in
Geneva, home of the Gatt secretariat.
Indeed, Gatt has already begun preparing for its metamorphosis by opening
negotiations to take over the remainder of its lakeside headquarters
building after it is vacated by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees later
this year.
However, there could yet be a surprise. The question of the site was raised
this week at a meeting of ministers from the 'Quad' powers - the US, the
European Union, Japan and Canada - and rumours are circulating that
Stockholm is ready to offer itself as an alternative candidate.
It all looks like an elaborate game of bluff. Says a senior official who
attended the Quad talks: 'We'd like to go to Geneva, but it's a question of
bargaining the terms with the Swiss. We are trying to tell them that if
they're going to be unreasonable, then we'll go somewhere else.'
Yesterday, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, stirred the pot
further by announcing that, as soon as he got home, he would ask his cabinet
colleagues to propose Bonn as the headquarters.
No doubt Switzerland will get the message. After all, no self-respecting
country would want to be accused of gouging rent out of an organisation, a
third of whose members are classified as the world's poorest countries.
No such sense of frugality prevails in Marrakesh, where representatives of
several developing countries are among the guests at the magnificent Hotel
Mammounia. A favourite holiday haunt of Winston Churchill, who painted in
its gardens, the Mammounia's main rooms are an eye-catching exercise in
1920s Islamic art deco.
The accommodation is no less exotic. Sir Leon Brittan's suite, for instance,
is an Arabian Nights fantasy of mirrors and mosaic. The overall effect is of
an oriental courtesan's boudoir. It is rather spoiled, however, by a chiming
doorbell which would seem more at home in suburban Esher. 'I think it's
ghastly,' said Brittan, grimacing as the chimes announced the arrival of
another delegation at his door.
Speaking of boudoirs, first prize for journalistic enterprise - and the
week's most intriguing story - goes to Reuters. One of its intrepid
correspondents bearded Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, at his
hotel yesterday and reported that he had just breakfasted with his former
masseuse, now employed by Morocco's royal household.
What can this mean? And what will it do for Mr Hata's prospects of becoming
his country's next prime minister when the news gets back to Japan? I think
we should be told. . . .

FT  15 APR 94 / World Trade News: US farm lobby threatens to withdraw its
support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lobbyists for US agriculture interests have warned President Bill Clinton
that the administration must drop proposals to lower farm spending or they
will withdraw their support for congressional passage of the Uruguay Round
implementing legislation.
Twenty-one groups, which expressed their displeasure in a letter to the
president, have been among the strongest supporters of the Round. They
include the American Farm Bureau, the American Meat Institute, the National
Association of Wheat Growers, and the National Pork Producers Council.
Their threatened opposition is the latest in a series of difficulties
confronting the administration in its struggle to have the legislation
approved this year. The biggest obstacle lies in finding an estimated
Dollars 13bn over the next five years to compensate for the loss of tariff
revenue in the US budget.
It is proposals to raise the billions through cuts in agriculture programmes
which have the farm groups up in arms. They had been assured that the final
Gatt deal would not require further reductions beyond those have already
made in domestic income and price-support programmes.
They are urging the president to shift current funding from programmes
either reduced or not allowed by the Gatt to those which are allowed, such
as market promotion, export credit and food aid schemes. 'Unless these
concerns are addressed, it is hard to envision how US agriculture stands to
gain as a result of the new Gatt agreement,' they said.
Large exporters, such as IBM and Caterpillar, are also worried about the
implementing legislation. They say proposals by the labour/industry
coalition Licit will undermine the spirit of the improvements to dumping
laws negotiated in Geneva.
US companies are already being hit with the largest number of dumping cases
worldwide, according to Mr Thomas Gann of Sun Microsystems. He and other
exporters say they do not want the dumping laws eviscerated.
'But what is going to happen if other countries further copy our dumping
rules?' he said. 'This scares computer companies, because we have to go
internationally to compete.'
Licit is just as worried that the pact will dilute US trade laws. 'In
virtually every area, current US law provides domestic industry with greater
remedies against injurious unfair trade than will exist under the new
Uruguay Round regime,' said a recent Licit report.
'Several provisions are likely to reduce anti-dumping duties, but they are
unlikely to deny relief altogether.'
Labour groups see the failure of the Gatt members to agree to a standing
committee on labour rules as confirmation that the global trading
organisation agrees rules purely for the benefit of the giant
multinationals.

FT  15 APR 94 / HK press shocked at Beijing jailing: Simon Holberton on
reaction to a 12-year sentence for printing 'secrets'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Editors and journalists in Hong Kong have always known that the colony's
reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 posed special problems for the
maintenance of a free press.
But the 12-year jail term meted out two weeks ago to Mr Xi Yang, a
mainland-born reporter for Ming Pao Daily News, a leading Hong Kong quality
daily, has cast a long shadow over the media in the colony, shocking even
those who believe the Chinese takeover in 1997 will be relatively benign.
Over the past few years proprietors have faced the implicit threat from
mainland-funded companies that advertising will be withdrawn if their
editors overstep the mark. For their part, journalists are frequently called
into the New China news agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong,
to account for their stories.
Self-censorship is a growing problem, with newspapers finding it easier to
ignore issues - such as the growing role of the People's Liberation Army in
business in Hong Kong, or the business connections of senior Beijing
officials in the colony - than to run the risk of offending Hong Kong's
future ruler.
Now journalists and academic lawyers openly express doubts that the
guarantee of press freedom - promised in the Basic Law, China's
mini-constitution for Hong Kong - will be robust enough to withstand the
Chinese Communist party's distrust of critical media. To some there is an
unreconcilable contradiction at the heart of 'one country, two systems',
China's formula for ruling Hong Kong.
Yesterday Mr Nihal Jayawickrama, of Hong Kong University's law department,
told a media conference in the colony: 'It seems to me that Beijing would
find itself not only in a wholly untenable position, but also pursuing an
unattainable goal if it were to attempt to permit a small number of its
citizens to conspicuously enjoy a high degree of freedom so vehemently
denied to others' in China.
Others are less gloomy, though no less concerned. There is pressure building
on the Hong Kong government from local legislators to enact a freedom of
information law, and to do more to promote human rights in the colony.
Earlier this week a British House of Commons select committee threw its
weight behind the establishment of a human rights commission, underpinned by
an equal opportunities law, recommending that one be set up before British
administration ends.
Mr Xi was arrested in Beijing on September 27 last year for allegedly
stealing state secrets. Under pressure from public opinion in Hong Kong,
Beijing has released some details of the charges against him and the
judgment of Beijing's Intermediate Court.
It appears that Mr Xi was responsible for a Ming Pao report last summer
which said the government planned to sell gold on the international bullion
market to help fund intervention to support the yuan. The report also
speculated about interest rates.
In the six months since his detention the Chinese authorities have allowed
Mr Xi only one visitor - his father, once, for one hour. Beijing has
rebuffed all Ming Pao's attempts to provide him with legal representation or
find out the precise details of his alleged offences.
Ming Pao feels especially affronted by his sentence. Its owners were given
to understand that if the newspaper kept a low profile and offered an
apology for Mr Xi's behaviour, which they did, then the Beijing court would
exercise leniency. 'Six months of self-restraint and he got 12 years,' said
Ms Daisy Li, chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association and a senior
Ming Pao staffer.
Another aspect of Mr Xi's case which has disturbed many is the prison term
given to his apparent informant at the People's Bank, China's central bank.
Tian Ye (whose sex is unknown) was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
The effect of the Xi case is already being felt among Hong Kong's
journalists. It led to the resignation of a number of Chinese journalists
from newspapers in the colony. One, who covered China's austerity programme
last summer, resigned out of fear for his own safety earlier this week.
'His sentencing has had an immediate effect,' says Ms Li. 'Those who cover
China have become more cautious. They are worried for their personal safety
and for the safety of their contacts in China.'
She also noted that China has not observed its own judicial procedures in
the Xi case. Chinese criminal law states that even where a case has been
tried in secret the judge's verdict has to be publicised. In Mr Xi's case
this has not happened, Ms Li said.
Mr Xi has been allowed to appeal against his sentence but Ms Li said she was
pessimistic about his chances of having the verdict overturned.
At yesterday's media conference Mr Tsang Tak-sing, editor of the
Beijing-controlled Ta Kung Pao, lashed out at critics of China's legal
system. Mr Tsang, who is also a delegate to China's National People's
Congress, said Hong Kong standards could not be applied across the border.
After 1997, he said, he was confident the two legal systems could co-exist
as promised in the Basic Law; those who doubted that might as well make
their preparations to leave Hong Kong now.
'The verdict handed down in Beijing will in no way affect things in Hong
Kong,' he said. 'The only impact will be on the coverage of news from the
mainland; we should have been aware from the start that that was another
ballgame.'
If Mr Tsang is right about the constraint on Hong Kong's media to report
about affairs on the mainland then the colony will lose one of its unique
qualities: its position as a window on China.

FT  15 APR 94 / Seoul in US talks on North's N-facilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and South Korea will begin talks tomorrow in Seoul on efforts to
renew negotiations with North Korea, concerning inspections of its nuclear
facilities.
The discussions with South Korea over the weekend will involve Mr William
Perry, US defence secretary, and Mr Robert Gallucci, a senior State
Department official recently appointed to head a US policy group on Korea.
A key issue will be whether to drop a demand that North Korea must exchange
special envoys with South Korea before the US agrees to hold another round
of high-level talks with Pyongyang.
North Korea maintains the dispute can be solved through negotiations with
the US on possible diplomatic recognition, in exchange for opening its
nuclear sites to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
But its refusal to accept a special envoy from the South, who would discuss
inter-Korean nuclear inspections, has blocked talks with the US.
Seoul believes inter-Korean talks must be held in parallel to US-North
Korean negotiations, but there have been recent suggestions in Seoul that
the demand may be abandoned temporarily to improve the chances for a
diplomatic settlement.
The IAEA has warned it may declare North Korea in violation of nuclear
safeguards in early May, if Pyongyang continues to refuse full nuclear
inspections by the UN agency.
The IAEA is expected to seek new talks with North Korea next week on
preparations for inspections, which were halted in mid-March.
The United Nations Security Council recently approved a statement urging
North Korea to resume acceptance of inspections.
A second issue will be the schedule for the staging of the Team Spirit
military exercise by the US in South Korea this year. Both countries regard
Team Spirit as a diplomatic means to press North Korea into allowing
inspections, but early resumption of the exercise might derail chances for
renewed talks with Pyongyang.
North Korea has repeatedly condemned Team Spirit as a rehearsal for an
attack on the country. The exercise is expected for the second half of the
year if no progress is achieved on the nuclear dispute.
Mr Perry will also discuss the strengthening of US forces in South Korea
against a possible surprise invasion by the North. Defence preparations
would include deployment of US Patriot missiles to destroy North Korean Scud
missiles and increased stockpiling of other military equipment.

The National Crime Authority's case against the seven men was essentially
straightforward, lawyers told a Melbourne court yesterday, but would involve
24 volumes of documentary evidence and 90 witnesses. The committal hearing,
they warned, could take three months.

<TEXT>
Two Iraqi diplomats are being held by the Lebanese authorities on suspicion
of assassinating a prominent opponent of President Saddam Hussein in Beirut
on Tuesday. The dissident, Mr Taleb as-Suheil, is said to have played a
prominent role in a planned coup attempt in Baghdad last July.
The diplomats were named as Mr Khaled Khalaf, commercial attache, and Mr
Mohammed Kadhem, cultural attache. Beirut has asked Baghdad to lift their
diplomatic immunity so that they may face trial. A third man, Mr Hadi
Hassan, is believed to have taken refugee inside the Iraqi embassy, which
has been surrounded by police.
The Lebanese government has said that all three are held to be Iraqi
intelligence agents. But Baghdad has denied any involvement and called for
their immediate release.
The killing comes amid growing signs that the security situation in Beirut
is deteriorating. A Jordanian diplomat was gunned down earlier this year and
two Palestinians belonging to Abu Nidal's notorious terrorist organisation
were arrested and charged with the killing. In February a bomb went off in a
church near Beirut, killing 11 worshippers. The Lebanese Forces, a
right-wing Christian group which was formerly allied to Israel during the
country's civil war, was subsequently banned and four of its supporters
charged with the bombing.
The recent spate of killings is likely to mar the government's
reconstruction efforts and hinder plans to raise finance on the Euromarkets.
Security in and around the city has been stepped up and both Lebanese and
Syrian soldiers are again patrolling the streets.
Mr Faris Bouez, Lebanon's foreign minister, said yesterday that it was too
early to say whether Beirut would cut diplomatic ties with Iraq over the
killing but that 'Lebanon cannot be taken advantage of, not under the
diplomatic cover or diplomatic immunity, to settle scores and to practise
crime'.

Gabon is due today to become the sixth member of the African 'franc zone' to
reschedule its debt with sovereign creditors in the Paris Club, since the
zone's 14 members devalued their common currency by 50 per cent against the
French franc in January, David Buchan writes from Paris.
Finance Minister Marcel Doupamby Matoka announced the rescheduling as franc
zone members met French ministers in Paris for a generally upbeat review of
the impact on their long-stalled economies of January's devaluation. Eleven
of the franc zone countries have signed adjustment agreements with the
International Monetary Fund which is lending them FFr3.5bn (Pounds 410m)
this year, in addition to FFr8.8bn aid from the World Bank.

FT  15 APR 94 / South African Elections (April 26-28): South African
mediation effort fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An attempt to resolve South Africa's political crisis through foreign
mediation collapsed yesterday. Mediators packed their bags and left the
country's political parties to their disputes.
'The fact that it has failed fills me with sadness,' Lord Carrington, former
British foreign secretary, told reporters as he, Mr Henry Kissinger, former
US secretary of state, and five fellow mediators cut short their mission
after the parties failed to provide them with agreed terms of reference.
The failure of mediation, less than two weeks before planned all-race
elections on April 26-28, will seriously undermine hopes for a peaceful poll
and for stability of the new government. Constitutional negotiations appear
to have reached a dead end, though African National Congress president
Nelson Mandela said last night he was prepared to continue talking to the
mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party. In reality, negotiations are likely to
resume after the poll. In the meantime, the ANC will continue trying to do a
separate deal with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, to guarantee his
constitutional status and persuade him to endorse the poll.
The ANC will also push for a further security crackdown in KwaZulu/Natal,
power base of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader. Mr Cyril
Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said more troops would be sent to the area
to deal with a predicted surge in violence.
Mr Ramaphosa made an unprecedented visit to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange
to warn brokers of the imminent collapse of mediation. Markets reacted
negatively. The JSE's overall equity index weakened 68 to 4,955 and the
commercial rand, the trading currency, dipped 0.62 cents against the dollar
to close in London at R3.6008 in spite of central bank intervention.
Mr Mandela and President F W de Klerk were last night at pains to stress
their desire for reconciliation when they took part in South Africa's first
ever televised election debate. 'I am proud to hold your hand. Let us work
together to end division and suspicion,' Mr Mandela told local television
viewers and millions more watching the live debate on CNN Worldwide, as he
grasped the hand of Mr de Klerk.

<TEXT>
The United Nations was yesterday searching for ways to salvage its
peacekeeping operation in Rwanda following a decision by Belgium, the former
colonial power, to pull out its 420-man UN contingent from the strife-torn
nation in central Africa.
Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, said in Brussels that the
inadequate protection provided for the UN troops meant that it was now
'senseless' to continue the operations under the existing mandate,
established after a 1993 peace agreement in Arusha.
The UN presence, he said, had been unable to prevent the deaths of tens of
thousands of people in Belgium's former colony. Furthermore, there was such
an anti-Belgian climate in Rwanda that soldiers' lives were in danger.
Mr Claes notified Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, of
Belgium's intention to withdraw at a meeting in Bonn this week.
Yesterday, visibly angry over the events, Mr Claes added that 'the
credibility of the UN is now at stake'.
His comments reflect the disgust felt by Belgian politicians about the poor
protection provided for the UN troops in Rwanda following the massacre of 10
Belgian soldiers last Thursday - deaths that occured in a 'terrible,
terrible' manner, Mr Claes said. The 10 were executed by rampaging Rwandan
soldiers in the violent aftermath of President Juvenal Habyarimana's death
in an air crash nine days ago.
In addition to the Belgian troops serving with the UN force, Belgium has
also had up to 800 paratroopers in the country organising the evacuation of
foreign nationals. These troops left last night ahead of a deadline set for
their withdrawal by the Rwandan government.
Mr Boutros Ghali has ordered Gen Romeo Dellaire, the Canadian commander of
the 2,500-strong UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda (Unamir), to prepare plans
for withdrawal. He has told the Security Council he does not think the
operation is viable without a Belgian presence or replacement troops.
The Security Council was meeting last night to discuss what role, if any,
the UN could now play in Rwanda. The peacekeepers arrived last October, at
the request of Gen Habyarimana's government and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic
Front (RPF), which had signed an accord in August to end three years of
civil war.
But the collapse of the peace agreement, with rebels fighting the Rwandan
army for control of the capital, Kigali, has rendered the UN mission null
and void.
The rebels yesterday denied they had agreed to truce talks as they fought
for a second day for control of the capital.

FT  15 APR 94 / Flag is lowered on 'grand apartheid'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   UMTATA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Major General Bantu Holomisa stood erect, the bugler sounded the Last Post,
and the flag of Transkei was lowered for the last time. Nominally
independent since 1976, self-governing since the mid-1960s, victim of
corrupt leaders as well as apartheid itself, the territory was yesterday
re-incorporated into South Africa.
It was an act which, declared Mr Walter Sisulu, the guest of honour and
veteran African National Congress leader, marked 'the burial of the
apartheid system'.
Not quite: Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi continues to exploit the legacy of
apartheid, fighting for what amounts to an autonomous KwaZulu state in the
new South Africa. But that bitterly disputed issue was not allowed to spoil
yesterday's celebrations.
There were, however, some tense moments. The Escort to the Flag had to use
unconventional methods to discharge his solemn duty and save the day from
embarrassment. A particularly stubborn knot threatened to prolong the
attachment of the Transkei flag to the pole once it had reached the ground.
The white gloves of the officer did not help; strong white teeth did the
trick. A firm grip, a sharp tug, and the crowd cheered as the homeland of
Transkei was symbolically set free, and Bazooka Ben and his Band came on
stage to set feet tapping.
'The occasion symbolises the closing of the last chapter of the apartheid
system. . . It signifies the imminent dawn of a new era of a representative
government accountable to all South Africans,' the general told the crowd in
Umtata's independence stadium.
Comrade Johnson Mlambo, of the radical Pan-Africanist Congress, put past
injustice in the forefront of his concern. The average land holding in the
Transkei was under 2.8ha, while across the 'border' commercial farms spread
out over 1,500ha. The inequity must be addressed, he said.
Popular as a PAC campaign strategy this may be, Gen Holomisa made clear that
Xhosa-speaking Transkei is ANC country. Its favourite sons include Mr Nelson
Mandela, ANC president.
Gen Holomisa is himself well regarded locally. Number 13 on the ANC's list
of candidates for the national assembly to be elected in a fortnight, he is
earmarked either for a senior cabinet post or a top position in the
integrated defence forces.
The general, who took power in a bloodless coup at the end of 1987, has
proved a canny politician. He soon aligned himself with the ANC and the PAC.
Yesterday he was looking for votes. Transkei had suffered because Mr Mandela
and others from the territory had been in the vanguard of the battle against
apartheid, he told the crowd.
This historical grievance had to be redressed by the post-election
government, said the general. 'And it will,' he vowed, 'for I will be part
of the team'.

FT  15 APR 94 / Brighter outlook for third world: World Bank projection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank is projecting a much brighter economic outlook for developing
countries over the next decade, despite prospects of slower growth in the
industrialised nations.
'The international economic environment is likely to be more favourable for
developing countries as a whole during the 1990s than it has been in the
last 20 years,' said Mr Michael Bruno, chief economist at the
Washington-based development institution.
'Developing countries are projected to grow at a rate of 4.8 per cent per
annum during the coming decade, considerably higher than the 3 per cent per
annum recorded during the 1980s,' Mr Bruno said.
Although growth in the industrialised countries has in the past had a large
spillover effect on the rest of the world, the World Bank says in its annual
assessment of global economic prospects, published yesterday, that the
modest growth rates of 2.5 to 3 per cent likely in Europe, North America and
Japan over the next decade need not hold back the developing nations.
Mr Bruno said lower real interest rates, higher flows of private capital
into the developing countries, fast growing world trade and a stabilisation
of real commodity prices should create a more favourable environment for the
developing countries.
He warned, however, that generally strong growth could disguise severe
disparities between regions and countries: while east Asia would probably
continue to fare well, even modest improvements in growth rates were still
likely to leave more people in poverty in sub-Saharan Africa.
East Asia's growth over the next decade is likely to be less spectacular
than in the past, because the region will encounter infrastructural
bottlenecks and environmental constraints. Nevertheless, growth rates in the
region are likely to average more than 7 per cent a year.
South Asia already improved its economic performance in the 1980s, and
steady growth rates of around 5.3 per cent a year are projected for the next
10 years, while growth in Latin America and the Caribbean could accelerate
to 3.4 per cent a year.
Sub-Saharan Africa has an opportunity for modest acceleration of growth
rates to 3.9 per cent a year, especially if the continent's civil wars
abate. Nevertheless, the World Bank concludes, 'limited stock of capital
equipment, infrastructure and human capital preclude any sharp improvement
in living standards'.
Mr Bruno said that much of the downside risk for the developing countries
came from the possibility that the industrialised countries would falter in
their efforts to tackle their budget deficits and to undertake supply side
reforms, causing higher interest rates, lower growth and protectionist
pressures.

But diplomats said there was no indication a coup was under way in the

they said.
A Lesotho government spokesman said soldiers from the main Makonyane

At least five soldiers were killed and 11 people wounded in the January
fighting, which broke out initially over pay and conditions.

The tax package is one of the last elements in the economic stabilisation

He now has 30 days to decree a new 10 per cent levy on wholesale sales, to
raise the income tax ceiling for corporations and individuals from 30 to 34
per cent, to impose a new tax of 10 to 30 per cent on luxuries, and to bring
in a controversial tax on debit transactions at banks.
The special powers were proposed by Democratic Action, a main opposition
party. The government expects the new levies to raise the equivalent of
about Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.4bn) in revenue and to help cut the fiscal
dificit this year to 1.5 to 2 per cent of GDP, from a projected deficit of 6
to 8 per cent.

FT  15 APR 94 / Procedures that could have saved flyers' lives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The tragedy in northern Iraq yesterday will sharpen the debate about
procedures and command chains in multinational UN operations, a question
rapidly becoming one of the hottest potatoes in international relations.
The incident may well be the cause of bitter, behind-the-scenes
recrimination as details of the circumstances emerge.
Rear-Admiral Eugene Carroll, director of the US Centre for Defence
Information, said there were at least three reasons why, if normal
procedures were being followed, it should have been virtually impossible for
the pilots of the two F-15 fighters which shot down the two UH-60 Blackhawk
helicopters to mistake them for a Soviet-built Hind helicopter gunship.
First, he said, the Hind (Nato's codeword for the Mi-24 class of helicopter
which Moscow developed in the late 1960s) has internally mounted engines,
but the engines of the Blackhawk are in part mounted externally and should
have been visible to the F-15 pilots.
Second, the Awacs surveillance and command aircraft over the area, which was
supposed to be in communication with the F-15s, had sensors and computer
systems powerful enough to monitor every flying object in the entire no-fly
zone of northern Iraq.
Third, both the F-15s and the Blackhawk should have been transmitting
continuous IFF (identification - friend or foe) signals, which would have
told the pilots that they had nothing to fear from one another.
Adm Carroll, a former pilot, said the incident might fuel controversy over
the rules of engagement in the no-fly zone, which permit western fighters to
open fire immediately on any Iraqi aircraft. 'These rules ought be
reconsidered because they make no allowance for the possibility that local
aircraft may be engaged in humanitarian tasks, such as medical evacuation,'
he said.
Some 70,000 soldiers are now involved in UN peace-keeping missions around
the world, many of them dogged by mistrust among the participating nations
and ambiguity over lines of command. Clarifying those lines has become one
the highest priorities for the UN secretariat, and for senior officers and
strategists in many armies.

FT  15 APR 94 / Reviewing a fatal aerial engagement: Jurek Martin examines
the downing of two helicopters over Iraq yesterday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General John Shalikashvili,
almost bristled yesterday when asked a question about the rules of
engagement of US forces operating under UN mandate and over Iraq. The
general made clear that such rules were not in the public domain, for good
reasons of mission security.
But the tragic incident over the skies of northern Iraq yesterday - an
apparent accident - combined with the circumstances of the Nato air strikes
against Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde this week to demonstrate the
extent to which authority to initiate action may now be vested in local
commanders.
This represents a marked departure from the military practices of the Cold
War, when it was assumed that decisions to take offensive actions were
passed to the highest levels of the chain of command in both Washinghton and
Moscow, including the offices of the respective heads of government.
This was not an infallible safeguard, as the downing in 1983 by Soviet
fighters of the Korean airliner to the north of Japan showed. Nor, in the US
case, were local commanders completely hamstrung, as was demonstrated in
1987 when the USS Vincennes, sailing in the Gulf, misidentified and shot
down an Iranian Airbus.
In both Bosnia and Iraq, US officials made clear this week that no prior
authorisation for each action by the president or his secretary of defence
was now necessary. In the case of Bosnia, the authority to call in air
strikes resides with UN military and civilian officials in New York and on
the ground, specifically and respectively General Sir Michael Rose and Mr
Yasushi Akashi.
In the US view, Russian anger at not being informed in advance of the
Gorazde air strikes, even if that anger was relatively muted, might have
reflected real or feigned ignorance of the automatic rules of engagement of
the Nato air force. They point out that even President Bill Clinton himself
was not apprised of that action before the event.
Pending further knowledge of the latest incident over Iraq, all Gen
Shalikashvili could suggest yesterday was that the US Blackhawk helicopters
had been misidentified by the two F-15 jets which had shot them down, even
though visual contact had been established and even though an Awacs US radar
aircraft was on patrol at the time.
In New York, a UN spokesman emphasised that the downed helicopters were
neither on a UN mission nor were part of any operation under the
organisation's authority. He said they were from a military co-ordination
centre set up by Operation Provide Comfort, a multilateral exercise by the
US, Britain and France, albeit under the terms of UN resolutions.
Gen Shalikashvili resisted suggestions that operating procedures had been
broken. A clear comparison exists with the incident, days after Mr Clinton
took office last year, when US fighters shot down Iraqi jets flying in
apparently clear violation of the northern Iraq no-fly zone. The decision to
engage in combat was taken on the ground.
There is political concern in the US, shared by Mr Clinton, about any
abrogation of US military command and control in international peace-keeping
or enforcement operations. This reached a pitch last autumn after 18 US
troops in Somalia were killed in a Mogadishu firefight, a disaster brought
about at least in part by the determination of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary general, to strike at General Aideed, the Somali warlord.
Weeks before, Mr Les Aspin, then US secretary of defence, had refused a
request for reinforcement from the US ground commander in Somalia, on the
grounds that it would send the wrong signal while peace negotiations were
being explored. The administration's overall conclusion was that the views
of local US commanders should be respected.
But there was no inclination yesterday to shift the blame for what happened
over Iraq to local commanders. Both Mr William Perry, secretary of defence,
and Gen Shalikashvili assumed 'full responsibility' for what happened. They
implied that all local rules of engagement under the UN umbrella will be
thoroughly reviewed.

FT  15 APR 94 / Brazilian MPs expelled
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Brazilian Congress has expelled two members over a bribery scandal,
congressional officials said yesterday, agencies report from Braslia.
The legislature voted late on Wednesday to strip Mr Carlos Benevides of his
mandate. He is the son of a former senior congressman and was a leading
member of the Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), the biggest in Congress.
Earlier, a substitute legislator, Mr Feres Nader of the Brazil Labour Party
(PTB), was also expelled.
The two were the first to be sanctioned among 17 deputies recommended for
expulsion by a special Congressional commission examining a bribery scandal
that shocked Brazil when it came to light last October.
The 17 are accused of having manipulated public funds and having received
bribes to obtain public contracts for private contractors.
Three of the 17 accused have resigned their mandates rather than risk being
stipped of them.
Apart from losing their Congressional seats, the expelled deputies will be
barred from public office for three years.

<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday renewed his objections to a Singaporean
court's decision to cane a US teenager for vandalism, reports George Graham
in Washington.
Michael Fay, an 18-year-old student at Singapore's international school, was
sentenced to six strokes of the cane, four months in jail and a SDollars
3,500 (Pounds 1,500) fine for vandalism.
Fay is expected to appeal next week to President Ong Teng Cheong for
clemency over the caning, but diplomats say that Mr Clinton's repeated
interventions have drawn so much attention to the case that there is now
virtually no chance of Singapore over-turning the sentence.
Mr Clinton referred to the possibility of permanent scarring and said US
public opinion, overwhelmingly on Singapore's side, had mistaken the gravity
of the punishment.

FT  15 APR 94 / US tobacco companies go on defensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US tobacco companies yesterday denied that cigarettes were addictive or that
they manipulated the nicotine levels in their products, as they tried to
defend themselves against a ferocious assault by members of Congress.
'Cigarette smoking is not addictive,' said Mr William Campbell, president of
Philip Morris USA, one of the leading tobacco industry executives who
appeared before a House of Representatives health committee.
The industry faces a three-pronged assault with potentially devastating
consequences for its future.
The US Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to regulate
nicotine as an addictive drug - a move that could lead to a ban on
cigarettes containing nicotine - and the Labour Department has proposed a
ban on smoking in all US workplaces, including restaurants and bars, because
of the deaths caused by second-hand smoke.
Also, the tax on cigarettes is likely to leap from 24 to 99 cents (16p to
67p) a pack, to help pay for the reform of the US healthcare system.
The committee chairman, Congressman Henry Waxman, opened the ill-tempered
and confrontational hearing yesterday by requiring the tobacco executives to
testify under oath.
'This hearing marks the beginning of a new relationship between Congress and
the tobacco companies,' Mr Waxman said, before beginning a hostile
cross-examination of the industry representatives.
The executives denied manipulating the level of nicotine to keep smokers
hooked even when they switch to lower-tar cigarettes.
Under close questioning from Mr Waxman, all panies admitted they could
adjust the concentration of nicotine in their cigarettes through blending
different tobaccos.
All, however, said that they did not aim for any particular nicotine level
through the blending.
'We do not design our cigarettes with any specification for nicotine. We
design them for tar levels,' said Mr James Johnston, chief executive of R J
Reynolds.
But Mr Waxman said a study by Mr Alexander Spears, now vice-chairman of
Lorillard, another cigarette company, showed in 1981 that the tobacco
industry had deliberately aimed to raise nicotine levels in low-tar
cigarettes.
Mr Spears yesterday told Mr Waxman that he had totally misunderstood the
evidence.

<TEXT>
Kidnappers who seized the chairman of Mexico's largest banking group last
month have threatened to kill him unless their demands are met, agencies
report from Mexico City.
'We're set on executing him if you don't fulfil our conditions,' said a copy
of a typed letter, dated Tuesday and addressed to Grupo Financiero
Banamex-Accival, which is headed by billionaire Mr Alfredo Harp Helu.
He was abducted on the morning of March 14 while driving to work from his
home in Mexico City.
The letter was accompanied by a hand-written plea, apparently from Mr Harp,
and a photograph of him beside a newspaper dated April 12. 'Pay the ransom,
my life is in danger, give me the opportunity to return to you and to my
family,' said the letter.
Banamex-Accival officials were not available to comment. Police said the
family had asked that the police stay out of negotiations.
The documents did not disclose the ransom being sought or any conditions set
by the kidnappers, who accused the financial group of callousness in hiring
insurers to assist in the case.

FT  15 APR 94 / Charges over Chile metals losses

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two former executives of Codelco, Chile's state copper company, have been
charged with defrauding the state in connection with losses of more than
Dollars 200m (Pounds 135m) made on metals futures trading in London and New
York.
Mr Owen Guerrini and Mr Carlos Derpsch, former head and deputy head of sales
respectively, were the immediate superiors of Mr Juan Pablo Davila, the
futures operator accused of making the unprecedented losses.
Codelco, the biggest copper producer in the world, accounts for 20 per cent
of Chile's foreign exchange earnings.
The two former executives were charged on Wednesday and both were denied
bail. Mr Davila, also charged with defrauding the state, is also being held.
A fourth executive, Mr Gonzalo Trivelli, former vice-president of sales, was
released for lack of evidence. His uncle, former President Patricio Aylwin
who stepped down last month, has proclaimed Mr Trivelli's innocence.
Various teams investigating the futures losses have still not discovered
exactly how Codelco managed to lose the equivalent of 0.5 per cent of
Chile's gross domestic product in a matter of months.
It remains unclear whether controls to prevent big losses were deliberately
circumvented or whether the board of directors had been informed of
Codelco's speculative - rather than hedging - activities. Even the amount of
losses, put at anywhere between Dollars 207m and Dollars 312m, is still in
question.
The new administration of President Eduardo Frei has pledged to modernise
the unwieldy structure of Codelco. Privatisation has been ruled out but the
company's six divisions are to be split into autonomous units, some of which
would be able to undertake joint ventures with the private sector. Codelco
speculation on metals futures has been suspended indefinitely.

FT  15 APR 94 / Albania rattles a diplomatic sabre at Greece: Tirane fears
Athens has intentions on its territory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sheep-rustlers, cigarette smugglers and illegal immigrants have no
difficulty evading Greek paratroopers guarding the mountainous border with
Albania.
They participate in a flourishing black market in goods and services,
tolerated by authorities on both sides of the frontier despite political
hostility between Athens and Tirane. But the killing of two Albanian
soldiers at a training centre for recruits outside Gjirokaster on Monday
raises fears that Greek rightwingers may be exploiting official laxity to
undermine the socialist government's efforts to im-prove relations with
Albania.
Mr Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister, yesterday denied Albania's
claim that the attack was carried out by Greek soldiers.
Proposing a meeting with Mr Alfred Serreqi, his Albanian counterpart, to
discuss the incident, Mr Papoulias said Greece wants 'normal, co-operative
relations with Albania,' but not at the cost of discrimination against the
ethnic Greek minority in southern Albania. Albania accepted the Greek
proposal for talks.
The presence of the Greek minority in what Greeks call North Ipiros, however
diminished by massive emigration to Greece over the past three years, gives
the Albanian government some leverage in an awkward relationship with its
neighbour. Albania fears that Greece still has territorial designs on North
Ipiros, briefly occupied by Greek troops in the first world war.
Though successive Greek governments have repeated that existing borders in
the Balkans must be respected, a nationalist faction in the conservative
opposition New Democracy party speaks openly of the need to 'maintain the
Greekness' of southern Albania.
A claim of responsibility for Monday's attack by the North Ipiros Liberation
Front, last heard of as a right-wing resistance group during the German
occupation of Greece during the second world war, is causing the socialist
government concern.
The strength of the Albanian government's reaction, expelling the Greek
consul in Gjirokaster, asking the UN Security Council to condemn Greece and
calling for a European Commission inquiry, underlined the anxiety felt in
Tirane.
The attack followed reports that Tirane was encouraging Albanians from the
north of the country to settle in the south, left uncultivated since the
exodus of ethnic Greeks across the border.
At least half the estimated 200,000 Albanians working illegally in Greece
claim ethnic Greek origins, entitling them to residence permits and eventual
citizenship. As a result, dozens of villages in southern Albania are
populated by a few elderly people and school-age children. However, the size
of the ethnic Greek minority is disputed. The official Greek estimate is
200,000, while the Albanian government figure is less than 100,000.
Ethnic Greek communities claim frequent human rights violations, with
Albanian authorities restricting Greek participation in privatisation of
small businesses and curtailing teaching of Greek in schools.
The situation in Gjirokaster has been tense since last summer, when violent
demonstrations followed the expulsion of a Greek Orthodox priest accused of
distributing nationalist propaganda. Greece retaliated by expelling some
20,000 Albanian migrant workers.
Mr Papoulias, who did much to improve ties with Albania's communist
government in the 1980s, has been trying again, this time with President
Sali Berisha's Democratic party. One Greek official said yesterday that
implementing his policy of closer co-operation with Albania on border
security, customs controls and work permits for Albanian workers is 'now a
necessity.'

FT  15 APR 94 / Russia seeks to bind CIS economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The most far-reaching attempt to unite the members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States into a single economic unit will be launched today at a
CIS summit.
Russia, which hosts the meeting, will propose creation of an Inter-state
Economic Committee to be based in Minsk, the capital both of Belarus and of
the CIS. The Committee's responsibilities have not been defined, but it is
likely to be seen as forerunner of a central bank for states within the
economic union.
Also on the agenda of the one-day meeting will be creation of a free trade
zone, creation of transnational companies and the concept of a 'payments
union'.
The plan for the new institutions follows an accord between Russia and
Belarus on a close economic union under which Belarus would lose effective
economic independence, its temporary currency and its independent central
bank.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, has made as sure as he can
through active lobbying that the accord will be ratified by the Russian
parliament, while the Belarus chamber, dominated by pro-Russian deputies, is
also likely to produce the two-thirds majority required.
Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, governor of the Belarus Bank who signed the
agreement in Moscow, said in Minsk that he did so with the reservation that
it contravenes the Belarus constitution and that until that is settled, he
would regard the agreement as inoperative.
Mr Thomas Wolf, a senior official of the International Monetary Fund, said
yesterday that the agreement could spark off 'a new round of inflation' in
Russia, depending on the rate at which the rouble was exchanged for the
Belarus coupon - known as the 'bunny'.
At the CIS summit, the main problems will be with the leaderships of the two
states closest - after Belarus - to Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
Tension is still high between Moscow and Kiev after the weekend incidents in
Odessa where a Russian ship of the Black Sea Fleet seized radar equipment
and Ukrainian militia arrested Russian officers.
A Ukrainian government spokesman said yesterday three Russian ships were
sailing towards Odessa to collect the eight naval families there but, he
said 'why do you need such an armada for eight families?'
Talks in Kiev on Tuesday failed to solve the underlying question of the
fleet's ownership, and the issue will again be put before Presidents Boris
Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine.
One certain absentee today will be President Nursultan Nazarbayev of
Kazakhstan.
Mr Nazarbayev had proposed a 'Euro-Asiatic Union of the Slav and Asiatic
states in order to bind the western countries of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia
more tightly into association with the Central Asian ones - but had been
rebuffed by the Russian foreign ministry, which said it 'lacked detail.'
Mr Nazarbayev was said by the Kazakh embassy in Moscow to have been suddenly
taken ill yesterday.
'It's a real illness,' said the embassy spokesman, Mr Vyacheslav Kovolov.
'It's not a diplomatic one.'

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank made record profits of DM18.83bn (Pounds 7.48bn) last year,
defying the recession in Germany which its critics allege it helped to
foster with unnecessarily high interest rates, writes David Waller in
Frankfurt.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, expressed satisfaction but no glee
about the profits.
The profits reflect the turbulence in world currency markets last year and
are up from the DM14.73bn made in 1992. Of the total, DM18.26bn was
transferred yesterday to the government, where all but DM7bn of the cash
must by law be used to pay off government debt as it falls due. The rest can
be offset against the budget deficit.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said yesterday he was pleased with the
result but stressed that the profit did not create room for more public
spending. It would mean that the government would borrow DM11bn less this
year on the capital markets than originally planned, he said.

FT  15 APR 94 / Bundesbank rate cuts win praise abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's unexpected Bundesbank decision to cut both the discount and
Lombard rates by 0.25 percentage points to 5 per cent and 6.5 per cent
respectively won praise from the US Treasury and triggered a rash of rate
cuts in continental Europe.
But the German central bank itself was at pains to banish any idea that it
was currying favour abroad ahead of meetings later this month of world
finance ministers at the International Monetary Fund or the next
get-together of ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven
countries in Washington on Sunday, April 24.
Instead, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, underlined that the
decisive factor behind the Bundesbank's decision was its expectation that
inflation in Germany would fall in the months ahead to below 3 per cent in
the second half of this year.
Sharply reduced inflationary expectations - reinforced by the unexpectedly
favourable outcome to this year's spring wage round and falling unit labour
costs - have allowed the Bundesbank to discount any inflationary
implications in the very rapid growth of M3, the bank's targeted measure of
money supply.
Although broad money, as measured by M3, grew at an annualised rate of 17.5
per cent in February and so well above its target growth range of 4 to 6 per
cent by the end of this year, Bundesbank officials yesterday stressed that
this was due to special factors.
Changes in German tax laws had provoked a massive liquidation by German
investors of mutual funds held in Luxembourg earlier this year as well as
substantial sales of dwellings. Cash realised through these transactions
landed in German bank accounts just as bond markets worldwide were suffering
the repercussions of February's move to dearer money in the US. As a result,
the cash stayed on deposit, swelling German M3 numbers.
By cutting its psychologically important discount and Lombard rates, the
Bundesbank hopes to persuade investors that German rates are decoupled from
the rise in US rates and that they can place their money profitably in long
term instruments such as German government bonds.
Such action on a substantial scale would slow the growth in M3 and could
justify the Bundesbank's decision yesterday to keep to its money supply
target for this year.
Although a surprise to financial markets, yesterday's German rate cuts are
consistent with the cautious monetary easing pursued by the Bundesbank since
the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism in the autumn of 1992.
The important repurchase or 'repo' rate, which the Bundesbank uses to steer
monetary conditions, was left at 5.7 per cent yesterday.
At this level the repo is slightly below the mid-point of the new 'corridor'
set by the discount and Lombard rates. Yesterday's rate cuts create scope
for a further modest easing in German money market rates.
Although yesterday's action will have a modest fallout in terms of borrowing
costs, the move was warmly welcomed by ministers of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
embattled centre-right coalition in Bonn as support for the government's
efforts to boost growth and employment.
While convincing itself that it was adhering to its anti-inflationary duty,
the Bundesbank appeared for once to have pleased both international and
national opinion.
But a comment from the German Federation of Chambers of Commerce (DIHT) that
the Bundesbank 'should not neglect the still unsatisfactory growth in the
money supply' in its policy decisions was a reminder of the strong support
that rigorous anti-inflationary policies command in German business circles
and public opinion.

FT  15 APR 94 / Bosnia truce hopes raised as UN faces war of nerves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
International mediators last night guardedly raised fresh hopes of a Bosnian
ceasefire, even though defiant Bosnian Serbs stepped up their war of nerves
with the United Nations.
Lord Owen, the European Union mediator, said that a general ceasefire in
Bosnia was 'back on the agenda'. Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian envoy to
former Yugoslavia, said he had won Serb approval in Belgrade for an outline
ceasefire agreement covering the whole of Bosnia.
Both men sounded a hopeful note about the prospects of a truce after holding
talks in the Yugoslav federal capital with Serb President Slobodan
Milosevic.
Mr Churkin told reporters: 'We have been talking mostly about an agreement
on a cessation of hostilities for the whole of Bosnia-Hercegovina. I can say
that what I have in my hands is a good foundation for such an agreement.'
The Russian envoy will go on today to Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold, and
then hopes to confer with the Moslem-led government in nearby Sarajevo.
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator, flew to Belgrade
yesterday from Pale, where they had talks with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic on Wednesday night.
While Lord Owen returns to London, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN official with
responsibility for former Yugoslavia, will meet Mr Karadzic in Pale this
afternoon.
Lord Owen said he hoped today's meeting would lead to a restoration of
relations between the Bosnian Serbs and UN forces, since the UN peacekeepers
would have to police confrontation lines in the event of a general
ceasefire.
He said the ceasefire might start in Gorazde and 'then spread right across'.
Earlier yesterday, Nato command and President Bill Clinton both issued stern
warnings to the Serbs not to treat UN or Nato personnel as combatants.
The warnings came after the Bosnian Serbs threatened a UN compound near
Sarajevo with a tank and after the Serbs were accused of shelling the
UN-designated safe haven of Tuzla. Bosnian Serb forces sealed off two UN
compounds outside Sarajevo last night in their latest moves to put pressure
on UN forces since air strikes were launched at Serbs advancing on Gorazde
earlier this week.
The UN said Serb forces moved in on French soldiers at a UN depot at
Krivoglavci, just outside Sarajevo, and tried to take back heavy weapons
surrendered in February as part of a deal to avert air strikes.
Nato officials said shelling of Tuzla died down after US, British, French
and Dutch aircraft buzzed the Serb positions.
The alliance warned it still had a mandate to make air strikes against heavy
weapons in the Sarajevo area. Nato aircraft were in the air and ready to
strike, one US official said.
Mr Clinton said the Bosnian Serbs would be making a mistake if they treated
the UN or Nato personnel as combatants. He accused them of trying to
'leverage their position' by detaining UN staff.
In Belgrade, the local office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees reported mounting harassment, with Molotov cocktails thrown at its
premises.

FT  15 APR 94 / Car sales on the road to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New car demand in west Europe has begun a slow recovery from the worst
recession since the war.
Sales rose an estimated 5.7 per cent in March to 1.25m from 1.19m a year
ago, the third consecutive monthly rise year-on-year.
In the first quarter of 1994 west European new car sales have increased an
estimated 5 per cent to 3.23m from 3.07m a year ago.
Sales fell sharply by 15.4 per cent in 1993 to 11.4m throwing much of the
European motor industry into loss.
In the first three months this year new car sales were higher in 12 of 17
markets across western Europe, and last month the Italian car market ended
19 months of continuous decline.
The recovery has been led by the UK, which was the first large car market in
Europe to enter recession, but sales are now also recovering significantly
in France, Spain and in Scandinavia.
In March new car sales rose by 15 per cent in the UK, by 13 per cent in
France and by 16 per cent in Spain. Last month sales were lower than a year
ago in only four western European markets.
The pace of the recovery is still being slowed by Germany, the biggest car
market in Europe, where new car sales are estimated to have dropped by 2.1
per cent in March to 356,000.
Carmakers are reporting a substantial increase in new orders in Germany,
however.
Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US, said yesterday its
intake of new orders in March was 25 per cent higher than in the same month
a year ago following a 20 per cent increase in February.
The increase in new orders had allowed it to cancel short-time working
planned at its Bochum plant and would necessitate extra shifts at its plant
at Eisenach in eastern Germany.
Three west European countries - Denmark, France and Spain - are stimulating
new car sales through the introduction of cash incentives to encourage the
scrapping of old cars, and a similar move is under consideration in Italy.
PSA Peugeot Citroen of France and General Motors of the US (Opel in
continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) have gained most ground among the
big six volume carmakers in Europe in the first three months this year.
The French group increased its sales volume by an estimated 11.4 per cent in
the first quarter, while GM sales rose by 9.8 per cent.
The Volkswagen group of Germany and the Fiat group of Italy, which both fell
into heavy losses last year, are still losing ground in the west European
market, although Seat, the VW group's troubled Spanish subsidiary, increased
its sales by an estimated 13.7 per cent.
Mercedes-Benz, the German executive and luxury carmaker, is recovering
sharply after suffering two difficult years and has increased its sales by
40 per cent in the first quarter, helped by the successful launch of its new
C-Class executive car range.

FT  15 APR 94 / German parliament relaxes labour law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German parliament yesterday approved a long-awaited series of measures
to relax labour market regulations and encourage job creation, thereby
reducing Germany's jobless figures, which recently reached a post-war high.
The law will allow private employment agencies to enter a market which has
until now been run exclusively by a state-owned agency. It will also
encourage part-time working, a measure vigorously resisted by Germany's
trade unions.
Unemployed people will be encouraged to do paid work to help the community
without losing their benefits, and to take on more seasonal work.
The Social Democratic party and other left-wing opposition parties said the
law would not create new jobs but would whittle away workers' benefits.
Unemployment reached 4.03m in January, a post-war high. There have been
forecasts that the number of jobless could rise to 4.5m this year.
The official east German unemployment rate is 17 per cent, although German
figures do not include people on job creation schemes, short-time work or
early retirement.
With a general election in October, Chancellor Helmut Kohl hopes the new law
and subsequent measures will counter suggestions the government is doing
nothing.
However, it is unlikely the new legislation will bring any immediate relief
to the unemployed. Analysts say the present high unemployment rate has
little to do with a cyclical downturn in the economy and more with
over-manning and excessive wages.
Mr Norbert Blum, employment minister, said the government had created 3m
jobs in the last 10 years and that unemployment was still high in part
because a further 2.6m people had entered the labour market.

FT  15 APR 94 / Economic Watch: Spanish inflation disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The expected fall in Spanish inflation has so far failed to materialise as
March consumer price data showed a 5 per cent rise from the previous year.
The monthly increase of 0.3 per cent brought accumulated inflation this year
to 1.4 per cent, slightly higher than in the same period last year. The
government target for the year is to bring the rate down to 3.5 per cent.
The underlying inflation rate, excluding volatile fresh food and energy
prices, rose 0.5 points from February, leaving the increase compared with a
year earlier at an unchanged 4.9 per cent. Bank of Spain figures meanwhile
showed a 2.2 per cent monthly increase in broad M4 money supply, with an 8.7
per cent increase in lending to the private sector. David White, Madrid.
Norway's trade surplus fell to NKr1.67bn (Pounds 146m) in March from
NKr3.6bn in February and NKr4.5bn in March 1993. The cumulative
January-March figure fell to NKr9.90bn from NKr14.42bn in the same period
last year.
Italy's machine tool orders rose 30.7 per cent year-on-year in the first
quarter of 1994, the first rise for three years, the industry association
Ucimu reported. Domestic demand rose 17.4 per cent, while foreign orders
were up 44.9 per cent compared with the same period last year. Ucimu said
this was a sign of rising industrial confidence.
The number of registered unemployed in Poland dropped by about 19,000 in
March, a jobless rate of 16 per cent.

French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur (left) yesterday easily escaped
censure of his government's employment policy on a motion tabled by the
Socialist and Communist opposition that gained 87 votes, far short of the
289 needed for it to pass. But the prime minister was warned by his
supporters that a better dialogue within his own party would have saved him
from some recent mistakes. At a separate Gaullist party meeting, the leader,
Mr Jacques Chirac, told Mr Balladur: 'Don't be alarmed, dear Edouard, at the
suggestions made by members of your majority. They are only made out of a
desire to succeed together.'

Support for Sweden's opposition Social Democrats has risen to 50.5 per cent
against 39.0 per cent for parties in the centre-right government, according
to an opinion poll yesterday. The poll suggests the party is benefiting from
turmoil in New Democracy, the populist party which holds the balance of
power, where support has crumbled to 2.5 per cent from 4.5 per cent in a
month. A Social Democrat victory in September's general election is viewed
as strengthening chances of a 'yes' vote in the Swedish referendum on EU
membership on November 13.

FT  15 APR 94 / Mandatory energy saving urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mandatory targets on energy-saving should be introduced if voluntary
agreements prove insufficient to cut energy use and carbon dioxide
emissions, according to a working party of the Brussels-based Centre for
European Policy Studies. Over-concentration on the stalled EU carbon tax has
deflected attention from energy conservation, both as a means to sharpen
competitiveness and to meet EU commitments to stabilise carbon dioxide
emissions, the working party said.
The working party, comprising representatives of 10 oil companies and
utilities as well as manufacturing companies, prefers the voluntary approach
that industry has so far emphasised in opposition to energy taxes or
regulation. But it wants national targets for energy efficiency and a new
title in the Maastricht treaty committed to it. If the voluntary approach
falters, it calls for obligatory energy management in industry, regulations
to stop utilities promoting increased consumption, mandatory standards of
energy efficiency for appliances, and requirements for companies to report
on energy performance.

Germany's right-wing Republican party is becoming increasingly extreme but
members' behaviour has not reached a stage where the party could be banned,
Mr Manfred Kanther, the interior minister, said yesterday. Mr Kanther said
the constitutional court in Karlsruhe would throw out any case on the basis
of existing evidence. Although individual party members were committing
offences, this was not sufficient to ban the party.
The German Communist party was the last party to be banned by the
constitutional court in the 1950s, in a case which lasted five years.
Violent offences by right-wing extremists last year totalled 2,232, 15 per
cent lower than the year before. Seven people died in right-wing violence
last year, according to the annual report by the agency for constitutional
protection. The 23,000 party members have been under observation since
December 1992 in all 16 Lander (states).

Moscow's municipal authorities yesterday introduced a 0.1 per cent tax on
foreign exchange trading on the capital's currency exchanges. Bankers
predicted the bulk of business would shift to the unofficial interbank
market. The Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (Micex) said the tax, which
applies to all foreign currency sales and purchases through the city
exchanges, took effect immediately. Plans to introduce the tax were
announced earlier this year despite opposition by the central bank and
commercial banks. The shift in foreign exchange trade away from Micex will
hit the central bank's ability to intervene on markets, bankers said.
Average trading volume on Micex is around Dollars 40m a day, well below the
estimated Dollars 200m on the unofficial market.

A fund to help privatised enterprises in Russia develop their
competitiveness and efficiency was announced yesterday in Moscow. The fund,
approved by the Group of Seven last July, will have an initial capital of
Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m) and loan and other guarantees of Dollars 150m. Mr
Michael Blumenthal, the former US Treasury secretary and chairman of the
Fund for Large Enterprises in Russia, said the fund had already begun
looking for investment opportunities. 'The real process of privatisation has
only just begun - and that is to make the companies focus on becoming
competitive in the market,' he said.
Funds have been provided by USAID, with guarantees from the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation. The fund, to be headed by Mr Austin Beutner, a
former merchant banker, will have its headquarters in Moscow and an office
in New York. Foreign investment is picking up markedly - though from very
low levels. However, political and economic uncertainties have suppressed
rapid growth of foreign enthusiasm.

The European Union must set up new structures to assist the integration of
central Europe, according to a report for the European Commission published
today by Mr Richard Baldwin of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, the
independent think-tank.
Mr Baldwin says present arrangements consist of bilateral Association
Agreements which link the central Europeans separately to the EU. These
allow limited access to the EU market, but do nothing to promote
intra-central European trade and consequently inhibit investment in the
region.
Beyond the association agreements lies the far horizon of EU membership,
promised for an unspecified future at last year's Copenhagen summit of Union
heads of government. But in between these, Mr Baldwin said, 'there is
nothing to get us from here to there.'
He argues that two concentric circles should be built around the EU core
gradually to integrate central Europe.
The outer circle would comprise all central Europe and would create a
duty-free zone for industrial products.
A second circle would spread the single market to the EU for front-runners
like Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics.

FT  15 APR 94 / West threatens more air strikes against Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Bosnian Serbs received stern warnings from the White House and Nato
yesterday after they provoked the United Nations by threatening a UN
compound near Sarajevo with a tank and shelling the safe haven of Tuzla.
The UN said Serb forces moved in on French soldiers at a UN depot at
Krivoglavci, just outside Sarajevo, and tried to take back heavy weapons
surrendered in February, as part of a deal to avert air strikes.
Nato officials said the shelling of Tuzla, seen as a direct challenge to the
UN commander General, Sir Michael Rose, died down after US, British, French
and Dutch aircraft buzzed the Serb positions.
The alliance also stated pointedly that it still had a mandate to make air
strikes against heavy weapons in the Sarajevo area. Nato aircraft were in
the air and ready to strike, one US official said.
President Bill Clinton said the Bosnian Serbs would be making a mistake to
treat the UN or Nato personnel as combatants. He accused them of trying to
'leverage their position' by detaining UN staff in Serb-controlled
territory.
The attack on Tuzla, a UN-designated safe area in north-eastern Bosnia, was
a direct challenge to Gen Rose, who this week prompted Nato to carry out air
strikes against the Serb forces attacking Gorazde, another safe haven.
The airport at Tuzla is an especially provocative target. The UN three weeks
ago declared it open as a route for relief supplies to central Bosnia, but
no aid flights have yet landed there, because Serb forces insist on having
their own monitors on the spot - a demand rejected by the Bosnian
government.
Tuzla is the centre of the largest region of Bosnia still under government
control.
In Belgrade, the local office of the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees reported mounting harassment, with Molotov cocktails thrown at its
premises, and vandals slashing the tyres and smashing the windows of UNHCR
vehicles.
The Belgrade office of the relief agency Unicef has also received bomb
threats, and a UNHCR official was threatened with pistols as she was about
to be interviewed by a western television team.
Lord Owen, the EU mediator, said yesterday that the shelling of Tuzla 'can
only be a direct provocation'.
He was speaking on board a Ukrainian Yak 40 aircraft which was taking him
and his UN colleague, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, back to UN headquarters in
Zagreb, after talks with Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, in
his mountain stronghold of Pale, and with Gen Rose in Sarajevo, where 4,317
UN troops and other personnel are encircled by Serb checkpoints.
The mediators themselves had considerable difficulty reaching the airport
from Sarajevo, as the Serbs have blocked the main road with containers, so
that the party had to take a detour through the suburb of Dobrinja, where
they were held up by a traffic jam of UN vehicles.
Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg are so far the only western representatives who
have been allowed in to Bosnian Serb territory, in an obvious effort by the
Serbs to distance themselves from the UN and US and to revive the earlier
Geneva peace process.

FT  15 APR 94 / Italian allies agree choice of speakers: Northern League
insists on 31-year-old former student activist 'to breathe new life into
parliament'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The three main parties of Italy's Freedom Alliance yesterday buried their
differences over the choice of speakers for the two houses of parliament and
agreed on compromise candidates.
The agreement paves the way for a smooth opening of Italy's 12th postwar
legislature today and early election of the speakers of the senate and
chamber of deputies. This is the first constitutional step towards forming a
new government, which is likely to be headed by media magnate Mr Silvio
Berlusconi.
The Alliance parties - Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the populist Northern
League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance - have been squabbling for
four days over who should fill these two key institutional posts. The most
difficult has been that of the senate, where the Alliance is six seats short
of a majority and whose speaker deputises for the president of the republic.
Yesterday, the three parties agreed to propose Mr Carlo Scognamiglio, an
economist and former rector of the private Rome university, Luiss. Mr
Scognamiglio was a Liberal senator who transferred to Forza Italia.
His good contacts with the Rome establishment are considered likely to
attract some cross-party support to help the Alliance majority. He is also
well connected to the business world through his second wife, the daughter
of Susanna Agnelli (sister of Fiat boss Giovanni) and his current companion,
Cecilia Pirelli, daughter of Leopoldo Pirelli, the former head of the family
tyre and cables group.
The agreement on Mr Scognamiglio, 49, who studied at the London School of
Economics, was made possible by the withdrawal of the League candidate, Mr
Francesco Speroni. The League, as the party with the most parliamentarians
in the Alliance, had insisted on one of its own being the senate speaker. By
persuading him to stand down, Mr Berlusconi has been able to demonstrate he
is not going to be dictated to by the League with its strong federalist
aims.
But as a sop, the Alliance agreed to accept a League deputy to act as
speaker of the chamber. They chose to propose Ms Irene Pivetti, 31, a former
Catholic student activist and League deputy for Monza in the previous
legislature.
Never before has such a young and inexperienced person been proposed for
this key moderating post in the chamber; but the Alliance wanted to signal
their desire to breathe new life into a discredited parliament.
Commenting on the proposal to nominate Ms Pivetti, Mr Massimo Scalia, a
Green spokesman, said: 'We Romans are long used to being tolerant. Since
Caligula proposed a horse to be senator we are not surprised by anything.'
Today, as the new parliament convenes, the immunity of the members of the
11th legislature is finally removed. This means that 26 members risk
immediate arrest, the most prominent being Mr Giulio De Donato, the former
Socialist minister, whom Naples magistrates have been seeking to arrest on a
string of corruption charges for several months.

FT  15 APR 94 / US jets down own helicopters over Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Air Force jets accidentally shot down two US Army helicopters over
northern Iraq yesterday, killing all 26 people on board, including two
British officers. President Bill Clinton expressed 'deep sorrow' at the loss
of the lives of those on 'a mission of mercy' to protect Iraqi Kurds, and
promised a full inquiry.
Those killed included 15 US military personnel as well as three Turkish, two
British and one French officer and five Kurdish passengers, Lt Gen Richard
Keller, chief of staff of the US European Command, told reporters in the US
by telephone from Stuttgart, Germany.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, assumed 'full responsibility' for
the disaster, but was able to report only 'sketchy' details in a preliminary
morning briefing. The incident took place, he said, about 0850 GMT, 34 miles
north of Irbil in Iraq. Two US F15C fighters mistook the UH60 Blackhawk
helicopters for Iraqi Soviet-made Hind helicopters violating the 'no-fly
zone' over northern Iraq, and fired missiles at them.
The zone was established by the United Nations in 1991 to protect the Kurds
from attack by the Iraqi military in the wake of the Gulf war. A comparable
prohibition on Iraqi aircraft covers the south of the country, protecting
Shia Moslems.
Both Mr Perry and General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs
of staff, were unable immediately to explain the misidentification both by
the F15s, which could see the helicopters, and by a patrolling Awacs radar
aircraft. It was also unclear whether the helicopters had filed necessary
flight plans and whether there had been any voice communication between the
fighters and the helicopters before both jets fired their missiles. 'Clearly
something went wrong,' General Shalikashvili said.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, visiting Washington, said the
incident was particularly serious because 'it happened not at a time when we
are at war, nor when visibility was poor.'
A Kurdish spokesman said the helicopters were ferrying officials from the UN
office in Zakho, near the Turkish border, to a meeting with Kurdish leaders
in Salahaddin in the central Kurdish region.
About 70 US, British and French fighter aircraft operate their no-fly zone
patrols from the Nato base at Incirlik, in southern Turkey. First reports
were that Iraqi jets had downed the helicopters. But Baghdad radio,
initially silent, later said Iraqi forces had not been involved.
The US administration will be obliged to produce a speedy public inquiry. Mr
Perry has postponed a trip to Korea and Japan scheduled to begin today.
The inquiry is certain to centre on the rules of engagement under UN
mandate. General Shalikashvili refused for reasons of operational security
to reveal what these rules of engagement were. But in Bosnia, the rules vest
considerable discretion in local commanders and UN officials and do not
necessarily require, for the US military, prior approval from Washington.
A UN spokesman yesterday said the organisation was not directly involved in
the flight of the downed Blackhawks.
Immediate political reaction in Washington was neutral. Mr Tom Foley,
speaker of the House, described the accident as 'a very serious matter'.

FT  15 APR 94 / Bundesbank cuts quarter point from its key rates: Other
countries follow German lead to ease borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German Bundesbank yesterday lowered its key interest rates by a quarter
of a percentage point, saying that falling inflation justified the cut in
spite of rapid money supply growth.
The reduction of the discount rate to 5 per cent and the Lombard emergency
borrowing rate to 6.5 per cent was followed by rate cuts in Switzerland,
Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, and raised expectations of
similar moves by Italy and France.
The Bundesbank's move, bringing short-term interest rates to levels last
seen five years ago, came in spite of explosive growth in German money
supply so far this year.
The cuts signal the bank's determination to continue its policy of slow,
small reductions in short-term interest rates. Although the Lombard rate cut
was expected, the reduction in the discount rate - the first since mid
February - took financial markets by surprise.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said: 'We have studied the
situation very hard today and we are convinced that we are on the way to
fulfilling our most important goal of achieving price stability. Thus the
decision (to cut rates) is appropriate despite the strong monetary
expansion.'
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, praised the move as encouraging a further
strengthening of the economy.
The influential German Banks' Association said the cuts showed the
Bundesbank's willingness to provide support for the economy within the
framework of its stability-oriented monetary policy.
In spite of the rate cuts, the D-Mark strengthened to close in New York at
DM1.71 against the dollar, compared with DM1.709 on Wednesday, and was also
higher against most European currencies.
While most analysts expect German rates to fall considerably further, the
D-Mark's strength was attributed to market fears that yesterday's small cuts
might signal that German rates had bottomed.
European government bond markets jumped initially on the rate cut news,
although the performance of some, including Germany's, later showed
uneasiness about the possibility of higher US interest rates and about the
pace of Germany's cuts in rates.
Mr Tietmeyer said that stripping out the impact of higher taxes on mineral
oil, the inflation rate was 2.5 per cent in the first three months of this
year.
Even including the effect of the oil tax, it would be down to between 2 and
3 per cent in the second half of the year, he predicted, compared to an
annual rate of 3.2 per cent in March.
He judged that the inflationary outlook had improved as a result of moderate
settlements in this year's wage round as well as added flexibility in the
labour market, which benefited the economy as a whole.
He said the credibility of the Bundesbank's monetary policy had been
vindicated this year as German long-term interest rates had risen by only
0.4 per cent compared to a rise of 1.3 per cent in US long-term rates.
Mr Tietmeyer insisted that there was no need to abandon the M3 measure of
broad money supply as the central bank's most important indicator of
medium-term inflationary developments.
But he argued that the excessive money growth in January and February (when
M3 climbed by 21.2 and 17.6 per cent respectively, on an annualised,
seasonally adjusted basis) was caused by special factors. The development of
M3 would be studied carefully in the months ahead, but as yet there were no
signs that money supply should halt the gradual easing of monetary policy,
the Bundesbank president explained.
He said that the rate reduction would itself contribute to the gradual
reduction in money supply growth, narrowing the gap between long and
short-term rates and helping to dissolve what he described as a 'liquidity
blockage' of funds parked at the short end of the yield curve.

FT  15 APR 94 / Treasury warns ministers to rein in spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has fired the first shots in this year's public spending battle
with a warning that there will be no room for tax cuts before the general
election unless ministers rein back a threatened overshoot in Whitehall
budgets.
The cabinet's EDX spending committee was reconvened this week by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, to be told that recent spending trends are
jeopardising the targets set in last November's Budget.
Meanwhile, Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, told cabinet colleagues
to provide analyses of the impact on their programmes of possible reductions
of 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent in their budgets.
Amid alarm over a failure to curb social security spending, ministers
believe the existing targets will be met only through a clampdown on
public-sector pay for the third consecutive year.
But some departments are treating the Treasury's warning as a predictable
pre-emptive strike ahead of expected confirmation next week that that public
borrowing has undershot the Pounds 50bn predicted for last year. Mr Clarke
is determined that lower-than-expected borrowing should not provide an
excuse for a relaxation of spending controls.
The Treasury is also concerned that Mr John Major's precarious political
position has led the prime minister to come down on the side of the spending
departments in recent Whitehall battles over new commitments. But Mr
Portillo's fundamental review of underlying spending trends is in turn
coming under fire for failing to deliver promised large savings.
Some ministers are also complaining that the latest Treasury clampdown will
dilute the impact of the government's planned white paper on competitiveness
scheduled for mid-May. It has ruled out pledges for extra spending on
training, infrastructure and industrial support policies.
Mr Clarke reconvened EDX early in an effort to push through a rapid
endorsement by the full cabinet of another tough spending round. He wants
agreement on the parameters for the round by mid-June.
The Treasury's starting point in setting overall targets for the next three
years is that the cash figures of Pounds 263bn and Pounds 272bn pencilled in
for 1995-96 and 1996-97 must remain absolute ceilings. It also wants a
figure for 1997-98 that keeps the annual growth rate in real, or
inflation-adjusted, spending at well below 1 per cent.
In spite of cutbacks in invalidity and unemployment benefit, the Pounds 85bn
social security budget still appears likely to grow faster than the economy
as a whole.
Mr Portillo also warned the Pounds 11bn education budget and the Pounds 30bn
health budget may overshoot the targets set last autumn.

FT  15 APR 94 / Angry Leipzig counts the cost of Schneider failure

'Damn him and his greed]' said Horst, who has been working on reconstruction
of Leipzig's once elegant Hotel Furstenhof for the Jurgen Schneider property
group.
'This bloke comes with all the money from the west, thinks he can do what he
wants and then dumps us. He had better not come back here. Because if he
does, well, I'd rather not say what I would do with him.'
Horst and his colleagues were told yesterday morning to pack their tools and
leave the building site - a vast hole flanked by a fragile 19th-century
facade. 'We won't be coming back here for a while unless the banks do
something. Huh]'
They are not alone in Leipzig in reacting with anger, underpinned by
Schadenfreude, to the collapse of the Schneider group precipitated by the
disappearance on Friday last week of its 59-year-old founder and chief
executive.
Yesterday Deutsche Bank and the Frankfurt prosecutor's office launched
actions alleging fraud against Mr Schneider, while a meeting of bankers
decided not to push the group, whose liabilities are thought to total DM9bn
(Pounds 3.6bn), into bankruptcy.
Leipzig is asking local banks to help support more than 3,000 contractors
and subcontractors after the collapse.
Mr Hinrich Lehmann-Grube, the mayor, has set up a working group comprising
the city, the association of enterprises in Saxony, and the local trade and
industry chambers.
'We have to limit the damage as much as possible,' said Mr Christoph Sorge,
a spokesman for the city. 'The Schneider case has created a serious
psychological problem with respect to the market and property prices.'
'That guy pushed up the rents too much in Leipzig,' said one retailer. 'He
tried to control the most prestigious parts of the town centre. He has got
what he deserves. But a lot of people will suffer.'
He had rented from CIP, Mr Schneider's property agent, whose offices are
located on the second floor of the beautiful Madler-Passage, a sought-after
site in the heart of Leipzig.
The retailer, who asked not to be named, initially said he had rented the
property for DM80 a square metre. But when pressed further he said: 'OK. OK.
We have to pay DM200 per square metre. I have to pay monthly. I don't know
if I can cope. It really is high. I am running up debts.'
By mid morning, there were only four people in the dozen or so small,
elegant shops, whose prices - targeted at tourists and professionals - are
too high for most Leipzigers. Mr Ulrich Thevas, an employee at CIP, tried to
play down the affair. 'We have no problems with our clients. Everything will
be fine. We have rented out every square metre.'
The retailers themselves are beginning to question their rents. 'The going
rate in the centre of the city for office space is about DM50,' said Mr
Matthias Happ from Jones Lang Wootton, the international property
consultants.
But the going rate for retail property in the city centre was now between
DM120 and DM150, according to another consultant. He said Schneider had been
able to raise retail rental rates beyond that level because of the shortage
of prime renovated property in the centre of Leipzig.
Mr Schneider arrived in Leipzig soon after the collapse of the Berlin Wall
in November 1989. 'He took one look at some buildings and went for them,'
one official from the city council said.
As Mr Schneider raised rents, prices in the property market, which went
through a boom in 1991 and 1992, started to fall.
One property consultant said: 'What amazes me is that it took him ages to
start developing property. Doing nothing like that costs lots of money. I
wonder - is the Schneider case the tip of the iceberg?'

They are not alone in Leipzig in reacting with anger, underpinned by

of its founder.

By mid-morning, there were only four people in the dozen or so small,
elegant shops, whose goods - targeted at tourists and professionals - are
too highly priced for most Leipzigers.
Mr Ulrich Thevas, an employee at CIP, tried to play down the affair. 'We
have no problems with our clients. Everything will be fine. We have rented
out every square metre.'
The retailers are beginning to question the rents charged for the location.
'The going rate in the centre of the city for office space is about DM50 per
square metre', said Mr Matthias Happ of Jones Lang Wootton, the
international property consultant which has 120,000 square metres of
property in Leipzig on its books.
But the going rate for retail property in the city centre is now between
DM120 and DM150, according to another consultant. He said Schneider had been
able to raise retail rental rates beyond that level because of the shortage
of prime renovated property in the centre of Leipzig.
Mr Schneider arrived in Leipzig soon after the collapse of the Berlin Wall
in November 1989. 'He took one look at some buildings and went for them,'
one official from the city council said. Mr Sorge elaborated: 'In some
cases, he bought directly from the state itself - in fact three properties.
But he paid up. The city is not owed any money.'
In other cases, Mr Schneider approached former Jewish owners who had been
forced to flee Nazi Germany before or during the second world war. One of
them was the Bamberg family, now living in Canada, who had once owned a
large clothes shop at the Konigsbau, in the theatre quarter.
'Mr Bamberg had the right to get his property back,' said another city
official. 'When Mr Schneider heard about this man returning, he offered Mr
Bamberg a price which I think he found difficult to refuse - and I believe
above the market rate at the time.
'The thing is that Mr Schneider then had to jack-up the rents to cover the
purchasing and renovation costs,' he added.
As Mr Schneider raised rents, prices in the property market, which went
through a boom in 1991 and 1992, started to fall. A recent report from Jones
Lang Wootton says: 'Top rents have come down from the peak achieved for
short-term letting in 1991 to a more sustainable DM35-DM40 a square metre.'
'The guy got his fingers burned,' a property consultant said. 'But what
amazes me is that it took him ages to start developing property. The Hotel
Furstenhof is a classic example. Doing nothing costs lots of money. Surely
the banks knew. I wonder - is the Schneider case the tip of the iceberg?'

FT  14 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were very few raised eyebrows in the oil sector of the market as Lasmo
confirmed recent strong speculation of a big rights issue to bolster the
group's balance sheet and help fund the development of new projects.
Lasmo shares dipped to 125p as the cash raising operation news emerged but
later stabilised to close only a penny off at 128p. The market took the news
reasonably well although it was pointed out that many of the big US
investment houses were seen to be offering Lasmo stock during the afternoon;
'the US response to the issue will be crucial,' said one leading UK broker.
Strauss Turnbull said the market had heaved a sigh of relief at the
appearance of the rights issue and advised holders to 'take up their rights,
but exploit any short term enthusiasm in the shares,' which it described as
'over-rated stock in an over-rated sector.'
Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, focused on Lasmo's cash multiple saying:
'If Lasmo were to trade on a comparable multiple to the US companies in 1996
the share price would have to rise to 191p. In the aftermath of the rights
issue the stock overhang may lead to a dull performance but in the longer
term we continue to rate Lasmo a market outperformer.'
RMC was one of the FT-SE 100's star performers after the building materials
group delivered top of the range preliminary figures, including a 5 per cent
increase in the dividend. Analysts had been split on the likelihood of an
increase in the payment. The 21p total was the most optimistic forecast in
the market. RMC shares rose 16, or 1.7 per cent, to 966p, after 972p.
Turnover was 938,000 shares.
Aerospace and medical equipment group Smiths Industries jumped 15 to 485p,
in trade of 1.7m after it reported an increase in interim profits. A slight
adjustment in full year expectations was made by several brokers. These
included NatWest Securities which moved its forecast from Pounds 113.5 to
Pounds 114.5m saying 'it was a creditable performance from Smiths.' However,
Mr Paul Compton at Credit Lyonnais was more cautious and said: 'underlying
sales growth is minimal and margins are already 14 per cent so I see no
further upside.'
British Airways shed 4 1/2 to 439p, on fears of increased competition
following the announcement of a transatlantic partnership between Virgin
Atlantic and US carrier Delta Air Lines.
Chemicals group BOC slid 15 to 686p as Hoare Govett reiterated its sell
stance arguing that competitive prices and low inflation would lead to
'pedestrian growth'.
W Canning improved 2 to 180p, reacting to a recent buy note from Smith New
Court. Turnover in Takare the nursing homes group leapt to 25m. Shortly
before the market closed the group announced that Mr Dev Pritchard, the
former deputy chairman and co-founder of the company, had sold 12.5m shares
or 10 per cent of the company reducing his holding to a nominal 97,456
shares. The stake was placed with UK and US institutions by Credit Lyonnais
Laing at 249p a share and the underlying share price held steady at 258p.
Claremont Garments shares began trading in their new form following the
offer for Magellan Industries becoming unconditional. The stock fell 5 to
365p.
Marks and Spencer added 2 1/2 to 424p with UBS said to have upgraded profit
expectations. Speculative buying again boosted turnover in Brown &amp; Jackson,
40m shares being turned over, with the price steady at 5 3/4 p.
The potential break-up price put on Thorn EMI by UBS continued to excite the
shares, advancing 12 to 1156p.
Tour operators were in demand following reports of new charter destinations.
Airtours was further buoyed on continued talk of takeover ambitions, with a
Swedish travel group said to be favourite. The shares gained 10 to 496p.
Owners Abroad added 3 1/2 to 117 1/2 p.
Pizza Express steadied at 123p as it was revealed that the chairman had sold
2m shares - or 3.8 per cent of the company - at 120p a share. They were
placed with institutional clients by Greig Middleton and Credit Lyonnais
Laing.
A return to profits by the Savoy hotel group saw the shares edge forward 5
to 1130p.
The departure of the finance director at HP Bulmer, the cider maker, saw the
shares slide 8 to 400p. Big switching was reported between Grand
Metropolitan, off 13 at 465p, and Guinness, 6 1/2 up at 469p.
Reuters Holdings recovered 24 to 1980p with Henderson Crosthwaite, the
agency broker, arguing that Monday's share split will add 50p to the share
price.
Mirror Group added 2 at 178p and Euromoney 8 at 1643p as Kleinwort Benson
reiterated its support for the two companies as 'cheaper advertising linked
businesses'.

FT  14 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Baked beans across
Europe - Neil Buckley on the benefits and pitfalls of retail alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury already claims credit for introducing products such as creme
fraiche into the UK. Now UK customers could be confronted by increasing
numbers of continental European products, while shoppers in France, Belgium
and Italy may yet develop a taste for Sainsbury's baked beans.
In an unexpected move last week, the UK's largest grocery retailer
formalised a partnership, called SEDD, with three continental European
retailers - Esselunga of Italy, Belgium's Delhaize of Belgium, and France's
Docks de France.
The move, which means the four groups will start sharing expertise and
co-operating in buying and marketing, has focused attention on the potential
benefits and pitfalls of such alliances.
Retail analysts predict a growing network of alliances across Europe. As
western European retail markets become increasingly competitive and
saturated, they say, organic expansion overseas will no longer be an
attractive option. The best way for retailers to enter other markets may be
through acquisitions or alliances.
Moreover, consumer goods manufacturing is increasingly dominated by a small
number of pan-European companies.
Michael Jary, director of OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, says that in the case
of nappies, for example, the three biggest manufacturers together account
for 66 per cent of the western European market; in chocolate confectionery
it is 50 per cent; and in crisps and snacks, 40 per cent. Western Europe's
biggest three grocery retailers, by contrast, have only 15 per cent of the
grocery market.
The only way retailers can match the strength of manufacturers is to join
forces.
The Institute of Grocery Distribution, the UK industry research group, has
identified four types of alliance which have developed in the last few
years:
The buying group, where members co-operate in purchasing, allowing them to
increase their clout with manufacturers. An example is Eurogroup, made up of
Belgium's GIB, Switzerland's Co-op Schweiz, Germany's Rewe, and Vendex of
the Netherlands;
The development-based alliance, an agreement between retailers to co-operate
on a specific project - often entry into a national market. An example is
the agreement for Tengelmann of Germany to take a stake in Superal of Italy,
giving Tengelmann a toehold in the Italian market, and Superal the benefit
of Tengelmann's management experience;
The skills-based alliance, where retailers share knowledge and expertise.
Belgium's GIB group, for example, and Sainsbury's co-operated in developing
the Homebase chain, using GIB's experience in the DIY market and Sainsbury's
UK presence;
The multifunctional group - the category into which Sainsbury's SEDD
alliance falls - which combines elements of the other three types. Until
now, the best-known have been the European Retail Alliance, made up of the
UK's Argyll, Ahold of the Netherlands and France's Casino, and Associated
Marketing Services, which includes the ERA members plus retailers from
Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland and Spain.
Sainsbury says that in addition to their combined purchasing power, members
of SEDD will gain strategic advantages by sharing expertise in areas such as
IT and systems. They may also co-operate in functions such as distribution
and marketing.
The continental European partners are likely to gain from Sainsbury's
expertise in the area of own-label products.
Michael Morgan, Sainsbury's director of international buying, says
manufacturers will also benefit, with the opportunity eventually to launch
products simultaneously in four different markets with a co-ordinated
marketing campaign.
While there are no plans for cross-ownership of shares, its members are
committed to making it a success.
'If we go into something like this, we will not be keeping one hand behind
our back. There has got to be a relationship of trust and mutual respect,'
says Morgan.
Industry observers are more sceptical. 'European alliances so far have
generally been very disappointing,' says Jary. 'There was a great deal of
activity and publicity when they were first set up, but we have seen little
evidence of their success.'
One problem is that buying groups cannot exploit their combined power fully
unless they can threaten manufacturers with the ultimate sanction of
delisting products in all the member companies. In alliances of different
groups with no cross-ownership, one individual is unlikely to have such
authority.
Cultural differences are also important. Products, especially own-label
ones, do not always transfer successfully into new markets, limiting the
scope for joint buying by partners. Moreover, as one retail analyst puts it,
'if you put retailers from Britain, France, Germany and wherever in the same
room, they won't even be speaking the same language, let alone the same
corporate language'.
A final problem is that joining a retail alliance may limit the scope for
retailers to expand into other members' home markets - or to take over one
of their partners. Asko was to have been a member of AMS until it was
discovered that it had acquired a significant minority stake in one of the
other members, Ahold. Asko left to form its own group.
While European alliances may be one way forward for ambitious retailers,
analysts suggest that it is only through acquisitions and cross-ownership
agreements that retail groups will really be able to benefit from joining
forces.

FT  14 APR 94 / People: Lee moves team at Hollas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Julian Lee, chief executive of Manchester-based clothing and textiles
company the Hollas group, has moved relatively fast in ushering in some
senior managerial changes since he taking over the helm in November 1993.
Yesterday the group announced several senior personnel moves. It firms up
City belief that Lee intends steering the group into bigger waters,
following a March rights issue raising Pounds 17.3m, doubling the size of
the company.
That issue was used to acquire two companies - Textilion, a maker of ladies'
wear, knitwear and children's clothing, and JB Hunter, holding company of
Edward Macbean, which specialises in making clothing for foul weather.
Textilion's customers include Marks and Spencer, Next and Boots; Gardner
supplies BHS and Woolworths amongst others.
The newly expanded group is now to be split into two divisions - garments
and personal protective clothing - each led by a divisional managing
director. Peter Boyd, chief executive of the subsidiary Textilion, will led
the garments division while Jim Hunter, chief executive of JB Hunter will
take responsibility for personal protective clothing.
At the same time Bryan Hewson, who recently left Alexon, has been appointed
managing director of ladies' and children's wear at Textilion; Neil Bostock
remains managing director of Textilion's knitwear business. Clive Westbrook
becomes financial controller for the overall Hollas group, and Bill Coll
joins another subsidiary, Gardner, as finance director.
Lee presided, in 1990, over the highly successful sale of Bricom, a
two-year-old MBO from British Commonwealth.

First Chicago, the US bank, reported improved first-quarter earnings, but
said its results were hurt by its emerging markets trading unit, Reuter
reports from New York.
'Extreme volatility in global financial markets in the quarter led to a
(Dollars 25m) loss in this unit that more than offset profits in other
trading activities,' said Mr Richard Thomas, chairman.
A year ago, trading activities resulted in a gain of Dollars 54.5m.
First Chicago reported first-quarter fully-diluted earnings of Dollars 2 a

Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, has formed a
joint venture in Russia for the production of heavy-duty vehicles.
It is taking a one-third share in the venture along with Uralaz, the Russian
heavy truck maker, and Gazprom, the Russian natural gas agency, which will
also each hold stakes of one-third.
At full production the venture is planning an output of 600 Arctic vehicles
a year, 2,500 heavy duty-road vehicles and 9,000 cabs and components that
will also be used for Uralaz production.
Investment in the joint venture is valued at Dollars 33m.
Iveco, the second largest truck maker in west Europe, said that it would
provide know-how, dies and equipment as well as technical and marketing
support.
Uralaz, which produces around 20,000 medium-heavy duty vehicles a year, will
provide the buildings and machinery for the venture and the workforce, which
will total around 700 at full production.

FT  14 APR 94 / Seoul acts on exiled loggers from north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea yesterday indicated that it might accept loggers escaping from
North Korean-managed lumber camps in Russia.
Seoul has so far refused to grant asylum to at least 120 workers who have
fled the logging camps because of fears that it could antagonise Pyongyang
and disrupt inter-Korean negotiations on North Korean nuclear inspections.
But the recent collapse of the nuclear talks has persuaded the government
'to review the issue based on the principle of humanitarianism,' said Mr
Choo Don-shik, the presidential spokesman.
The government is also responding to growing public pressure to accept the
loggers, who are considered South Korean citizens under its constitution.
The lumber camps, which employ 15,000 North Koreans, were established in
Siberia in the late 1960s, with North Korea providing labour in return for
receiving wood supplies valued at Dollars 100m. The camps are estimated to
provide Russia with Dollars 300m worth of lumber annually.
North Koreans who have fled the lumber camps speak of food shortages,
beatings, and death sentences for those trying to escape.
Russia has pressed North Korea to improve conditions at the camps and
threatened not to renew the logging contract, which expired at the end of
1993. The contract has been extended until June as Moscow continues
negotiations with Pyongyang.
Seoul will consider granting the loggers immediate asylum or ask Russia to
accept them as refugees, with a promise that they would be eventually
resettled in South Korea.
But North Korea has warned against any interference by Russia or South Korea
and said it would hold Seoul responsible for 'kidnapping' loggers found
missing from the camps.
But even if South Korea accepts the loggers, officials remain worried that
it could trigger a bigger exodus from the camps and possibly encourage
people living in North Korea to flee across the border to Russia and China.
'President Kim (Young-sam) fears that allowing the loggers into South Korea
may eventually lead to the sudden collapse of North Korea, just as the
exodus of East German tourists to Hungary and Austria in 1989 led to the
collapse of the East German government,' said one presidential aide.
China has only limited influence in persuading North Korea to accept nuclear
inspections, a senior Chinese official said yesterday.
'Many people believe that China can instruct North Korea to do this or that.
But that's not true,' said Mr Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the Chinese
political consultative conference.

Taiwan will suspend all tours to China from next month over Beijing's
handling of a mysterious boat fire which killed 24 Taiwanese tourists last
month, the government announced yesterday, Reuter reports from Taipei.
'The incident has initiated indignation and the government supports the
decision by the travel agents' association to suspend tour groups to the
mainland starting on May 1,' Mr Chang Tzu-chiang, director of the Tourism
Bureau, said.
Taiwan Governor James Soong told the Provincial Assembly that visits by
civil servants to China would be suspended from next week. Taiwanese made
about 1m trips to China last year, down from 1.5m in 1992.
The victims burned to death or drowned when a fire started on a boat on
Qiandao lake in the central province of Zhejiang on March 31.
Relatives of the victims returned to Taiwan last week with cremated remains,
accusing Chinese authorities of covering up what they said was mass murder
and restricting their movement. China on Saturday acknowledged the blaze
could have been caused by saboteurs and promised the culprits would be
punished.

<TEXT>
The Malaysian government says there is no need for an official investigation
into foreign exchange losses by Bank Negara, the country's central bank, as
all the facts had now been made public and those responsible for the losses
had resigned, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
Bank Negara last month disclosed that it had incurred a forex trading loss
of MDollars 5.7bn (Dollars 2.1bn) in 1993. Mr Jaffar Hussein, Bank Negara's
governor, and Mr Mohamed Yakcop, believed to have been mainly responsible
for forex operations at the bank, then resigned. In 1992 Bank Negara was
forced to disclose forex losses of more than MDollars 9bn.
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister, told parliament that while Bank Negara
had made mistakes in its forex dealing, international market conditions had
been very unstable, particularly in 1992. Mr Anwar said Bank Negara's
financial position remained strong, with accumulated foreign exchange
reserves of more than MDollars 90bn.
'Errors were committed and this entailed huge losses,' said Mr Anwar. 'There
was neither any fraudulent practice nor were there any individuals
benefiting from the losses incurred.'

FT  14 APR 94 / Italian allies split over key posts
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The parties of the Freedom Alliance in Italy are deadlocked over the choice
of candidate for the key positions of speaker for the chamber of deputies
and Senate in the new legislature.
The disagreement underlines the serious differences that continue to dog the
formation of a new government in the wake of the Freedom Alliance's
overwhelming victory in the general elections held at the end of last month.
A meeting to resolve the deadlock, due to be held yesterday, was postponed
at the last moment without explanation.
The postponement was preceded by a meeting between President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate. Mr Berlusconi is the
man considered most likely to be asked to form the next government after the
strong polls performance of Forza Italia which he heads.
The choice of speakers for the two houses of parliament is the essential
first step in the opening of the new legislature. This will take place
tomorrow and precedes the formal consultations of the president on the
formation of a new government.
The most difficult choice concerns that of speaker for the Senate, where the
Freedom Alliance failed to obtain an absolute majority of the 320 seats.
The Alliance won 154 seats. It consisted of three main parties - Forza
Italia, the populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance - plus the rump of the former Christian Democrat party, the
Christian Democrat Centre (CCD).
The League has been arguing that the choice has to come from within the
Alliance and has been proposing its own senator, Mr Francesco Speroni.
However, Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia have been reluctant to endorse Mr
Speroni, both because he comes from the League and because he is seen to
lack the diplomatic talents necessary for such an institutional role. The
Senate speaker automatically steps in for the president of the republic.
Mr Berlusconi has also been looking for someone capable of attracting some
eight small party senators, including the two Radicals, to ensure an upper
house majority.
This has led to talk of Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the outgoing Republican
speaker and former prime minister, being asked to stay on. But the League
has placed a firm veto on Mr Spadolini.
Alternatively, Forza Italia has suggested a senator from its ranks - Mr
Cesare Previti. However, yesterday the MSI proposed its own candidate, Mr
Giulio Maceratini, a member of the national executive and a deputy in three
legislatures.
In the case of the chamber, the League has again been touting one of its
leading figures, Mr Roberto Maroni. However, Mr Maroni seems more likely to
be earmarked for a senior position in the new cabinet.
This could leave the way open for one of the veteran politicians who has
changed sides to back Forza Italia such as the long-time Liberal deputy, Mr
Alfredo Biondi.
These difficulties also reflect the intense bargaining going on over the
composition of the next government.
Mr Berlusconi is under pressure to draw his ministerial team from within the
Freedom Alliance but he has discovered in recent days a paucity of
ministerial talent. This has led him to look elsewhere, including an
approach to some members of the government led by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi
such as Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury minister. The latter is understood to
have turned down the overture.
It is now thought unlikely that President Scalfaro will formally request Mr
Berlusconi to form a government until after April 25.
This is because big demonstrations are being planned for April 25, the day
celebrating the anniversary of the liberation from fascism. The
demonstrations are expected to have a special poignancy, given the likely
inclusion of MSI members in the new government. The party is still inspired
by the ideals of Benito Mussolini against whom together with Nazi allies,
the liberation was directed.

FT  14 APR 94 / Balladur pledge on labour reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday said he would not be deflected
from reforming the country's labour market and claimed that success in
halting the rise in French unemployment was 'within reach'.
Mr Balladur returned to the issue of labour reform for the first time since
his controversial measure to cut wages for short-term apprenticeships was
abandoned following angry mass street protests.
Speaking at a jobs conference organised by the Patronat employers'
federation, the prime minister delivered what he called 'a message of
encouragement and hope in the future'. He said the increase in job-seekers
in the past three months was only one-sixth of its level in spring 1993,
while the number of unfilled vacancies and apprenticeships was rising. He
appealed to employers and union leaders to make his employment law work.
Among other things, this provides for the two sides of industry to negotiate
shorter, but more flexible working hours than permitted under edicts dating
back to 1936-37 and which still govern much of French labour practice.
Mr Balladur yesterday faced an unemployment debate in the National Assembly
tabled by the Socialist opposition. Because of his slim parliamentary
majority, Mr Balladur was in danger of losing the censure motion. However,
disputes within the UDF on the unrelated issue of the forthcoming
Euro-elections played in favour of Mr Balladur.
The Republican party, which is the largest element in the UDF federation,
has been threatening to form a separate parliamentary group, out of pique at
not getting their man put at the head of the government Euro-election list.
In the end, they decided to stay in the UDF fold in the short term, but in a
swipe at the federation's leader, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
said they would back 'a new candidate rather than candidates who have
already taken part in previous elections' in the 1995 presidential poll.
Support for Mr Balladur has fallen nine points since youth protests last
month, according to a poll yesterday.

FT  14 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sedgwick dips on placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By far the day's biggest event on the London market, the placing of a 21 per
cent stake in Sedgwick, the UK's biggest insurance broker, took place within
an hour of the market opening.
The stake, 114.5m shares, was sold by Transamerica International, the US
group, to Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, and SG Warburg Securities
for 191p a share and subsequently placed with a number of UK, European and
US institutions at 193p a share, giving the two purchasers of the stock a
profit of around Pounds 230,000 on the deal.
Insurance analysts said much of the stock was pre-placed by the two brokers
after the market closed on Tuesday and the remainder easily placed early
yesterday.
Transamerica has been keen to exit the property and casualty insurance
industry for some time and moved quickly to take advantage of the recent
upturn in the insurance broking sector.
Sedgwick shares dipped to 196p following the placing and later edged up to
close a net 15 off at 198p. Turnover reached 236m shares.

Weakness in UK gilts caused a reversal of early gains in stock index futures
which in turn pulled the underlying cash market lower, writes Joel Kibazo.
Buyers of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 saw it advance to 3,178 in
early trading. However that early buying ran out of steam as dealers waited
for the US Consumer Prices Index figures and a mood of caution set in ahead
of today's Bundesbank Council meeting.
The release of the US data over the lunch time period had little impact to
trading but it was the continuing weakness in bonds that brought the
afternoon falls in the contract as Wall Street also came off sharply.
June finished at 3,141, down 29 on its previous close and at a significant
discount to cash. Dealers said the volume of 10,673 at the official close
was an indication of a lack of willingness to deal amidst the uncertainity.

FT  14 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Special deals dominate a weaker share
market - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A handful of special situations kept traders occupied in the London stock
market yesterday, and the broader range of equities was left to drift lower
behind a weakening government bond sector. The placing by Transamerica
International of its 21 per cent stake in Sedgwick Group, Britain's largest
insurance broker, boosted trading volume. Sedgwick and four other stocks
accounted for around 37 per cent of the day's total business in equities;
without these deals, it would have been a thinly-traded day.
Although firm at first, London succumbed to a general malaise in European
markets after the fixed repo tender in the German money markets brought only
a modest dip in rates, leaving investors to wait for news from the
Bundesbank's policy meeting this morning.
London flagged towards the close when Wall Street was 11 Dow points down
early in its new trading session. Statistics on US retail sales and consumer
prices, while favourably received, gave markets little encouragement.
At the final reading, the FT-SE 100 Share Index showed a fall of 13.3 at
3,145.8, virtually the low of the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed at
3,801.2 for a net fall of 7.1 as the second line stocks reacted to the
overall lack of support but without seeing much genuine investment activity.
The day's Seaq volume totalled 885m shares compared with 907.8m in the
previous session, when retail business was worth a healthy Pounds 1.87bn.
The lion's share of yesterday's volume figure consisted of 236m shares
traded in Sedgwick as Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg placed the share stake
they had taken aboard from Transamerica. The shares were placed successfully
with a range of institutions in a smoothly-handled operation.
Hints of an impending rights issue were confirmed when Lasmo, the oil
exploration and production group, called for Pounds 219m from shareholders.
The move had been predicted and the share price held up comfortably. Market
specialists believe that other rights issues from UK companies are waiting
in the pipeline and will be brought forward when market conditions are
judged appropriate.
Weakness among insurance stocks towards the end of the session bore down on
the Footsie since many of these are components of the index. Traders
believed that the dip in share prices reflected liquidation of a life
assurance sector investment fund. The rest of the blue chip sectors lacked
support. After rising sharply last week on revived optimism on crude oil
prices, oil shares extended the minor losses suffered in the previous
session. Pharmaceuticals gave little support to the market.
Strategists expressed some disappointment with the relatively weak
performance by UK equities yesterday. In particular, analysts pointed to the
inability of UK shares to escape the influence of British government bonds.
The immediate outlook for interest rates appears uncertain, with markets not
looking for too much from the Bundesbank today. At best, the stock market is
looking for a cut in the Bundesbank's Lombard Rate and will be pleasantly
surprised if the Discount rate is cut at this stage.
Kleinwort Benson Securities, the UK securities and investment house,
reiterated its belief that UK base rates will fall to 4.75 per cent by the
end of the year, although it judges the likelihood of 4.5 per cent rates to
have receded.

FT  14 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Sliding bond prices leave Dow
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks ended moderately lower yesterday after succumbing to concern over
bond prices and a wave of program-guided selling, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 20.22 lower at 3,661.47, after
battling back from a 50-point plunge in early afternoon. The decline set off
the NYSE's 'uptick' rule, which restricts program trades.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.31 easier at 446.26, on
moderate NYSE volume of 278 shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite slipped 1.74 to 437.95,
while slumping technology issues dragged down the Nasdaq composite by 11.84
to 727.38.
After a positive but lacklustre opening, share prices began to slip.
Declines grew more pronounced as an initial rally in bonds, on news of
softer-than-expected retail sales, petered out.
Bond traders were selling into the market's strength soon after the Commerce
Department reported that March retail sales grew by a modest 0.4 per cent,
against expectations of a 1 per cent advance. The release of last month's
consumer price index, which precisely matched forecasts of a 0.3 per cent
rise, had no impact on either market.
Investors were discounting the CPI's significance as an inflation gauge.
Instead they were looking ahead to industrial production and factory
utilisation data, due out Friday. Many were fearing the figures would lead
to a quick boost in short-term interest rates.
Just after 1pm, the sell-off in bonds accelerated, triggering sell programs
and sending share prices reeling. But the market soon stabilised and stocks
moved well off their lows by the closing bell.
Semiconductor stocks remained under heavy pressure. On Tuesday, the
Semiconductor Industry Association reported that the March book-to-bill
ratio, an important indicator of the chip industry's strength, showed no
change last month. Texas Instruments dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 70 3/8
and Micron Technology tumbled Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 83 5/8 .
Among the Dow industrials, Caterpillar lost Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 113 1/2
, Union Carbide Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 24 1/2 . Aluminium producers fell
out of favour, with Alcoa dropping Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 69 1/2 and
Reynolds Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 45.
In the oil sector, Texaco was down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 63 3/8 . A
federal judge ruled that a lawsuit filed by Ecuadorean Indians against the
company may be heard in the US, if the plaintiffs proved that decisions
which, allegedly, had damaged their environment were made in New York.
Woolworth made a rare move upward after issuing revisions to its 1993
financial results. The stock added Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 17 1/8 .
Canada
Toronto prices closed sharply lower in moderate trading, sparked by declines
in New York. The TSE 300 index fell 46.61 points, or 1.09 per cent, to close
at 4,248.80. Declining issues outnumbered advances 488 to 289. Volume was
63.73m, compared with Tuesday's 53.07m.

FT  14 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses await a signal from
the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a suggestion, as bourses sagged yesterday, that they were waiting
for the Bundesbank to cut the German Lombard rate today, writes Our Markets
Staff.
A Lombard cut would mean little, since it represents an interest rate
ceiling at a time when rates are coming down, but traders said that they
were looking for a 'sign'. The Bundesbank, meanwhile, had cut repo rates by
another three basis points.
FRANKFURT's banks and financials had already discounted the interest rate
scenario, and only Deutsche Bank posted a reasonable rise, DM4 on the
session and another DM2 to DM797.50 in the post-bourse after Tuesday's
DM17.50 loss on the Jurgen Schneider property loans scare.
The Dax index eased 1.31 to 2,209.19 as turnover fell from DM9.5bn to
DM8.3bn.
Special situations and smaller cyclicals saw share price action, PWA putting
on another DM3.50 to DM233 on this week's Swedish pulp price rises and
Kugelfisher, the recovery hope in ball bearings, rising another DM13 to
DM271.
Klockner-Werke combined both characteristics. Tipped by Mr Werner Friedman
at Bank Julius Bar at DM129.50 at the end of February, and by Mr Hans-Peter
Wodniok of Flemings at DM142 early this week, it closed DM8.20 up at DM157.
Traditionally viewed as a steelmaker, K-W withdrew from the sector this
year, and Mr Friedman said that it was undervalued; Mr Wodniok had it on a
p/e of 9.5 (now about 10) for the engineering sector's peak year, against
the sector average of 18.4.
PARIS set its sights firmly on the Buba meeting today and decided to mark
time in the interim. The CAC-40 index gained 3.81 to 2,152.36.
Michelin was the day's most important news, the tyre group reporting 1993
results well in line with analysts' expectations. The shares slipped FFr3.50
to FFr269.50 as some investors decided it was time to take profits after
good performance earlier this week.
Peugeot rose FFr11 to FFr916, for a 5 per cent rise on the week to date,
while UAP slipped a further FFr4.30 to FFr166.00.
MILAN saw a wave of profit-taking in a shortened day's trading as the
telematic electronic trading system again struggled to cope with the
workload. The Comit index fell 11.86 or 1.5 per cent to 788.76.
Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa Sim in Milan said that selling pressure came
as little surprise at the end of a monthly account which had seen a 15.5 per
cent rise in the two weeks since the general election.
He noted that the day's biggest losers were issues that had seen the most
impressive gains in recent sessions and said that there could be further
selling pressure today. Yesterday's end of April's trading account was
extended by 24 hours to give the market more time to help clear its backlog.
Among recent strong performers, Fiat fell L397 or 5.9 per cent to L6,303,
Pirelli lost L165 or 5.1 per cent to L3,095 and Stet gave up L364 or 4.4 per
cent to L5,971.
One of the few shares to climb was Ferruzzi, up L58 or 2.6 per cent at
L2,308: on Monday the company said it was launching a complex L1,339bn
rights issue.
ZURICH extended morning losses, the SMI index falling 10.1 to 2,877.7. UBS
bearers fell SFr16 to SFr1,249 after reports that around Dollars 150m held
in accounts had been confiscated in connection with an investigation into
the laundering of drug money. One analyst commented that the fall in the
share price seemed 'ridiculous', adding that investors appeared to be
muddling the bank's own money with that of its customers.
A weak trend in the other banks and insurers was attributed to London based
selling: Zurich Insurance bearers were SFr24 down at SFr1,296.
Against the trend, Brown Boveri bearers put on SFr22 to SFr1,260, with one
portfolio management bank seen as a big buyer.
Schindler, the elevator and rolling stock manufacturer, rose another SFr35
to SFr1,695 in continued response to Tuesday's profits outlook.
AMSTERDAM moved little either side of opening values and the AEX index
finished just in positive territory, advancing 0.14 to 424.08.
Unilever showed a larger swing than most on the downside, losing Fl 1.30 to
Fl 205.20. This was partly on news that its rival, Procter &amp; Gamble, was to
sue a Unilever subsidiary over a domestic television commercial which it
alleged was misleading.
Heineken closed flat at Fl 206, after moving between a session high of Fl
206.50 and a low of Fl 205.70, after reporting that European beer conditions
remained under pressure. In the same sector Grolsch added 40 cents to Fl
51.90.
MADRID's heavyweight banking sector, relatively weak over the last month,
quarter and twelve months, continued to depress the general market after
pressure on bond prices.
The general index fell 3.39, or just over 1 per cent to 325.29. Among the
banks, BBV dropped Pta70, or more than 2 per cent to Pta3,200 and Popular,
similarly, by Pta350 to Pta15,100. The most active stock was Telefonica,
down another Pta30 to Pta1,765.

FT  14 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Poland is braced for a further setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's Kredytbank, which is offering a new issue of 5m shares to the
public next Monday in the midst of the country's heaviest stock exchange
fall to date has decided to stick to a price of 160,000 zlotys per share
(Dollars 7).
The decision comes in spite of an unprecedented move by the authorities to
lift a 10 per cent price limit for the next three sessions, after share
prices fell by 20 per cent early in the week, in a bid to allow prices to
find more stable levels. The WIG index has fallen by nearly 50 per cent
since the market peaked on March 8.
Mr Stanislaw Pacuk, chairman of the Kredytbank, defended the offer price by
arguing that it put the bank's book value to earnings on a multiple of two,
while the price/earnings ratio of 21.9 was still reasonable given the bank's
prospects.
Of the new share offer, 20 per cent is being offered to the management and
staff at a reduced price of 50,000 zlotys per share, while the bank is
negotiating guarantees for the 1.6m shares in the issue which need to be
sold for it to be closed.
Other banks quoted on the stock exchange were trading on p/e ratios of
between 23 and 15 on Tuesday, but these could tumble today.
The Kredytbank was established in 1990 and reported a 19,003bn zlotys net
profit last year on a balance sheet net worth of 4,072.9bn zlotys. The bank
reported a 24,800bn zlotys net profit in the first quarter of this year.
Arthur Andersen conducted the pre sale audit.

FT  14 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei advances 2.1% on
brighter political outlook
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A potential solution to Japan's current political instability comforted
investors and the Nikkei index rose by 2.1 per cent, closing above the
20,000 level for the first time since March 24, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225 average advanced by 412.08 to 20,060.41 on arbitrage buying and
short covering, falling to a low of 19,672.23 in the morning session and
peaking at 20,103.42 in late afternoon.
Investors were encouraged by reports that the split within the ruling
coalition had been tentatively put aside, and that the seven parties had
agreed to support Mr Tsutomu Hata, currently foreign minister, as the next
prime minister to succeed Mr Morihiro Hosokawa who resigned last Friday.
Volatile share price movements prompted by concerns over a possible
political realignment as well as prolonged haggling in choosing the next
prime minister, had sapped investor confidence during the previous few days.
The yen also stabilised on hopes of an early resumption in trade talks with
the US.
Volume rose to 341m shares against 263m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 18.17 to 1,618.89 and the Nikkei 300 recovered 3.02 to
296.35. Advances overwhelmed declines by 850 to 180, with 134 unchanged. In
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.98 to 1,330.12.
Low-priced resource stocks were favoured on hopes of an economic rebound.
Nippon Oil rose Y15 to Y725 and Teikoku Oil by Y31 to Y742. In non-ferrous
metals, Mitsui Mining and Smelting rose Y10 to Y393 while chemicals gained
ground with Showa Denko up Y13 to Y349 and Ishihara Sangyo Y14 better at
Y417.
Shipping stocks were bought as cheap laggards. Showa Line, the most active
issue of the day, rose Y27 to Y266 and Navix Line gained Y14 to Y364.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 202.70 to 21,289.22 in volume of 14.2m
shares. High-technology stocks were mixed in spite of the yen's stability.
Rohm, the semiconductor device maker, rose Y60 to Y3,850 and Nintendo, the
video game maker, fell Y70 to Y6,800.
Roundup
Many of the regional markets saw gains made earlier in the week eroded by
profit-taking. Bangkok and Colombo were closed for public holidays.
MANILA was propelled higher in heavy trade by San Miguel's better than
expected first quarter net income. The composite index jumped 61.11 or 2.3
per cent to 2,695.71 as San Miguel B shares rose 13 pesos or 6.1 per cent to
226 pesos following its 40 per cent rise in net profit.
AUSTRALIA continued ahead, boosted by offshore buying and a rise in futures.
Most indices were not available due to a computer malfunction but the
exchange authorities said that the All Ordinaries index put on 19.7 to a
provisional 2,114.7. Activity was mainly in the leading stocks with BHP 24
cents higher at ADollars 17.24 and CRA 22 cents firmer at ADollars 17.22.
HONG KONG ended a volatile day barely changed after profit-taking eroded a
strong opening rally that drove the market up by more than 167 points.
The Hang Seng index closed 15.67 higher at 9,753.76 after dipping briefly
into negative territory in late trade.
Turnover was HKDollars 5.56bn against Tuesday's Dollars 6.25bn.
The profit-taking, mainly by local investors, emerged at mid-morning while
overseas institutional selling into recent strength picked up pace in the
late afternoon.
Citic Pacific and Cathay Pacific slipped on worries about a possible curb on
Taiwanese tourism to China following the recent boat disaster in China's
Zhejiang province. Taiwan travel agents have urged that China be classified
as a danger area for travel. Citic lost 50 cents to HKDollars 23.70 and
Cathay Pacific slipped 20 cents to HKDollars 11.60.
TAIWAN ended down in slow trade although the paper and pulp sector was
strong on expectations that paper product prices are about to rise.
The weighted index fell 22.20 to 5,453.14 in turnover that declined to
TDollars 38.1bn from Tuesday's TDollars 52.44bn. Financials were the biggest
losers as speculators who drove prices up last week sold holdings before of
the Big Three banks go ex-rights on Saturday.
SEOUL closed a rumour-laden day slightly higher after an 11-point gain was
wiped out by immediate profit-taking. The composite index gained 1.46 to
882.33.
KUALA LUMPUR finished well off its highs as afternoon profit-taking wiped
out most of the morning's gains and the composite index finished 4.63 ahead
at 1,029.45 after a day's peak of 1,045.24.
SINGAPORE turned back after the strong advance of the previous two sessions,
the Straits Times Industrials index easing 2.0 to 2,231.66.
BOMBAY recovered from a weak opening to end marginally higher on
short-covering by speculators and fresh buying by mutual funds. The BSE
30-share index closed 29.41 higher at 3,944.53 in trading subdued by a 4-4
1/2 per cent unofficial badla or carry forward cost fixed on Tuesday.
NEW ZEALAND edged lower in a day of largely listless, direction-less trade.
The NZSE-40 capital index slipped 6.38 to 2,145.4.

FT  14 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar loses ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unexpected decision by UK officials to release the minutes of the
monthly monetary policy meeting between the Bank of England and the Treasury
provided some late afternoon excitement yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
Sterling fell by half a pfennig when confirmation emerged that the
chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, and the governor of the Bank, Mr Eddie
George, had differed in their approach to the controversial UK rate cut on
February 8. The pound closed in London at DM2.5275, down from a high for the
day of DM2.5382.
Earlier the dollar had fallen after the release of weaker than expected
March retail sales figures - up only 0.4 per cent compared to market
expectations of a 1.2 per cent increase - dampened expectations of a
near-term rate rise. March consumer prices rose by 0.3 per cent compared to
the 0.2 per cent gain expected.
The US currency finished half a pfennig lower at DM1.7135 from DM1.7188 on
Tuesday. It had lost ground in the morning when the Bundesbank cut its repo
rate by only three basis points - at the low end of market expectations.
Trade was fairly quiet ahead of today's Bundesbank council meeting, the
first for four weeks.
Analysts yesterday cautiously welcomed the trend towards greater openness in
the conduct of UK monetary policy. Concern was expressed that sterling would
be vulnerable if serious differences between the Bank and Treasury were to
emerge. The weakness of sterling, after the release of minutes showing
disagreement, lent support to this view.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, commented: 'I think
it (the openness) is a little baffling to the market and therefore on
balance there will be modest downward pressure (on sterling).'
He said it was not immediately clear what the Chancellor stood to gain from
openness. Also, it was 'unhelpful' to have public confirmation of a
difference of opinion.
Earlier, sterling's recent recovery had continued. It held its ground
against the stronger D-Mark, and appreciated against the dollar after the
release of fairly subdued US sales and inflation data.
Mr Peter Luxton, economist at Barclays, said the risk was that the currency
could be derailed by a combination of continuing political uncertainty and
unfavourable economic data. January trade data will be released today and
evidence of a poor external position could weaken sterling.
There was little response in the futures market to the announcement. The
June short sterling contract continued its recovery from recent lows to
finish slightly firmer at 94.61 from 94.57.
This view of a rise in short-term rates is not supported by most analysts. A
survey of traders at 24 institutions published by IDEA, the financial
markets advisory service, found that a large majority believed the next move
in rates would be down, would be 25 basis points, and that it would happen
in early May.
UK money markets reverted to type yesterday with the Bank of England
declaring a Pounds 750m shortage after Tuesday's surprise Pounds 400m
surplus. The Bank provided late assistance of Pounds 375m after earlier
putting Pounds 76m liquidity into the system. Overnight rates moved between
4 1/8 per cent and 6 1/2 per cent.
Mr Luxton said the dollar had been sold down on disappointment, particularly
with the retail sales figure.
An earlier setback had come in the form of the fairly small Bundesbank repo
cut. The Barclays analyst said the dollar had been undermined by 'unwinding
of early-week expectations of an official rate cut in Germany.'
Mr Robert Thomas, currency strategist at Natwest Markets, said he still
believed US rates would go up before the end of May, and that DM1.80 per
dollar was more likely than DM1.60 on a 3-6 month view. Mr Thomas said the
dollar's weakness against the yen had spilled over into weakness against the
D-Mark too.
With the cut in the German repo rate at the bottom end of expectations,
expectation of a lowering in official rates at today's council meeting
receded. There is still some speculation about a cut in the Lombard rate
from 6.75 per cent, but little anticipation of a cut in the discount rate
from 5.25 per cent.
Ample liquidity in the banking system helped German call money rates ease to
5.65/5.75 per cent from 5.75/5.80 per cent. This trend towards lower rates
is endorsed in the futures markets. The June euromark future finished at
94.60 from 94.59, discounting a fall in short term interest rates to 5.40
per cent by mid-year.
Elsewhere in Europe the D-Mark performance was mixed. It was unchanged
against the French franc at FFr3.419.
The most noticeable move came from the Swedish krona which retreated from a
recent high of SKr4.598 against the D-Mark to SKr4.624. Analysts said
investors were taking profits as they have done in recent days with the
Italian lira.

FT  14 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian aluminium cuts still
well short of target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is having severe difficulty keeping to its undertaking, given to some
western nations in January, to reduce its aluminium production by 500,000
tonnes a year.
This emerged yesterday when Concern Aluminiy, the Russian producers'
association, gave output figures for the first time. By the end of March
annual cuts totalling 142,000 tonnes had been made at seven smelters. This
was well short of the 300,000 tonnes Russia promised to make by the end of
April. Aluminiy officials admitted that the data were incomplete and that it
would be difficult to persuade some smelters to agree on more cuts.
Mr Alexander Isayev told Reuter in Moscow that the Bratsk smelter, the
biggest in the world with an annual capacity of about 820,000 tonnes, was
refusing to supply statistics and there seemed no way the government could
force it to comply because it had been privatised.
'It's ending as we expected, a complete shambles in Russia,' said Mr Angus
MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group. 'Most people were pretty sceptical about whether the
Russians could deliver what they promised. At some stage, though, the
Russians will be forced to cut production. They can't keep the smelters
together for ever with paper clips and string.'
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, an affiliate of Jardine Fleming, said
there was scepticism because it was doubted if the Russian smelters could
afford the social cost of cuts - nearly every one has a complete community
to support. Nevertheless, western producers should be encouraged that some
cuts had been announced in good time for another meeting in Brussels next
week between the big producers (Australia, Canada, the European Union,
Norway and the US as well as Russia).
He pointed out that, since aluminium reached an all-time low of 47.2 cents a
pound in November, cuts announced by western producers - now totalling more
than 900,000 tonnes a year - had helped it climb by 24 per cent to an
average of 58.5 cents in March.

FT  14 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India heads for oilseeds record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aided once again by a good monsoon season - the fifth in a row - India hopes
to achieve a record production of over 21m tonnes of oilseeds in 1993-94
(November to October), up from 20.6m tonnes in the previous year.
The significant improvement in the total oilseeds production is coming about
in spite of a setback in the groundnut crop, the most important of all the
oilseeds grown in the country, caused by drought in Gujarat and Maharashtra.
According to trade officials, the country's groundnut production in 1993-94
will be about 7.5m tonnes (in shell), down from 8.5m tonnes last year. The
crop would have been even shorter had not production in Andhra Pradesh, a
south Indian state, risen by nearly 350,000 tonnes to 2.4m tonnes. However,
there is a shortfall in production in Tamil Nadu in the south.
As a result of the reduction in groundnut output and the unwillingness of
farmers to dispose of their stocks at this stage, prices of groundnut oil
have risen sharply. In sympathy, the prices of other edible oils have also
gone up, much to the discomfiture of the federal government.
The government has formulated a two-pronged strategy to stem the price rise.
Firstly, it will import at least 58,000 tonnes of edible oils, mainly
palmolein. And secondly, it will release the stocks of oils held for
distribution through fair price shops. The Central Organisation for Oil
Industry which expects a total supply of 7m tonnes of indigenous oils this
season does not, however, think that imports are necessary. Last year, India
imported only 43,000 tonnes of oils, against the sanctioned limit of 100,000
tonnes.
Not very long ago, India was the world's largest importer of oils. In
1987-88, its imports amounted to 1.8m tonnes, causing a lot of pressure on
its balance of payments position. A sea change in the oilseeds scene has
since been brought about by the government-constituted technology mission on
oilseeds.
While production of oilseeds has risen from 12.7m tonnes in 1987-88 to over
21m tonnes, the national oilseeds development project has set a production
target of 26m tonnes and productivity target of 1,100kg a hectare by the
year 2000. The government officials are confident that the targets will be
achieved.
According to farming experts, the extra production has to be sought through
productivity improvement as it will not be easy to get much extra land under
oilseeds. The total land under the nine major oilseeds  - groundnut,
rapeseed and mustard, soyabean, sunflower, sesame, castor, safflower,
linseed and nigerseed - is about 25.5m ha. Except for soyabean and
sunflowerseed, no oilseed has found extra land in the last few years.
The TMO wants to ensure that besides the nine major seeds, secondary sources
like cottonseed, rice bran, minor oilseeds of tree and forest origin and oil
cakes should make a greater contribution to India's quest for
self-sufficiency in vegetable oils at a satisfactory level of consumption.
Indian annual consumption of about 7kg a head is less than half the world
average.
It is also expected that by the turn of the century, India will achieve some
success in promoting the cultivation of oil palm. An expert committee has
identified 575,000 hectares of land in nine Indian states for oil palm
cultivation. The crop has attracted the attention of a number of big Indian
corporations as it gives up to six tonnes of oil a hectare, compared with
500kg to 600kg for other oilseeds.

FT  14 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK spends Pounds 1m more on
animal inspections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government has spent Pounds 1m to boost its on-farm inspections of
live animals imported to Britain after the dismantling of border controls as
part of the introduction of the European single market last year.
But still some diseases had succeeded in finding their way across the
channel, such as warble fly infestation and brucellosis in cattle, Mr Keith
Meldrum, the government's chief veterinary officer told the agriculture
select committee of MPs yesterday.
The import of live cattle to the UK has increased six-fold since the single
market came into effect at the beginning of last year. Half of these animals
have their documentation checked at the farm and 10 per cent receive blood
tests and other examinations.
Mr Meldrum said the Ministry of Agriculture was adding 30 man years' worth
of work to conduct on-farm checks of imported animals. Before the single
market came into effect, officials checked all animals at their port of
entry.
'There are not a large number of holes in the internal market arrangements.
We are now identifying those holes and blocking them up,' he said.
Mr Meldrum said the outbreak of brucellosis last November in Anglesey, which
was largely blamed by farmers on the single market, might still have
occurred under the previous arrangements. He estimated that outbreak had
cost farmers and Maff between Pounds 400,000 and Pounds 500,000 to stamp
out.
Warble fly infestation was introduced last year from France after the UK had
been free of the disease for two years. He said 1,500 herds of cattle had to
receive the complex treatment for the infestation.

FT  14 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile expects regrowth in fruit
exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chilean fruit exports, severely hit last season by counterveiling duties
imposed on apples by the European Union, should rebound by 15 per cent this
year to Dollars 1bn, according to Mr Ricardo Ariztia, president of
producers' association Fedefruta.
'Generally, exports should be better to the extent that we have not been
affected by compensatory duties from the European Union,' said Mr Ariztia.
Producers say the fruit industry, which accounts for 10 per cent of Chile's
export revenue, suffered losses of Dollars 100m-Dollars 120m last year
because of EU import surcharges.
Mr Ariztia said that exporters had partly countered European restrictions by
co-ordinating their shipments to ensure that prices did not fall below EU
reference prices. 'I believe that this has been the most noteworthy and
important development of this season,' he said.
However, prospects as a whole were far from rosy. Profits were being
squeezed by low international prices, an appreciating peso and rising labour
costs. There was also stiff competition from South Africa and New Zealand,
as well as from emerging producers such as India, which also grows grapes -
Chile's most important fruit export.
'The industry's profitability in Chile has truly deteriorated. I would even
go so far as to say that, talking globally, the fruit industry this year
will be in the red,' Mr Ariztia said.
Last year, the sector, which had seen spectacular growth over the previous
decade, suffered its first big bankruptcies.
This season, European resistance to imports had been replaced by problems
with Argentina and Mexico, two of Chile's biggest Latin American customers.
Argentina had been refusing entry to about 60 lorries a month, while Mexico
recently held up two ships in the port of Manzanillo because of a fruit-fly
scare.
Such actions were evidence 'of continued protectionist barriers' that had no
basis in international law or in bilateral agreements, Mr Ariztia said.
In the long-term, the sector could only prosper by concentrating on quality
rather than volume, he said. For this reason it was vital that the industry
reached agreement on regulations to guarantee the quality and
standardisation of exports.
Although producers and exporters had been arguing over details for three
years, Mr Ariztia thought agreement might soon be reached and appropriate
legislation sent to congress in June.

COPPER flattered to deceive at the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon
when the three months delivery position briefly snapped above Dollars 1,900
a tonne. But prices were back in the well-worn Dollars 1,880-1,900 band at
the close of the after hours 'kerb' session.
'It looked like it might find the stops (stop-loss buying orders) above
there (Dollars 1,900), but with so little business around it just failed,'
one dealer explained.
Copper's setback rubbed off on the ALUMINIUM market, which eased back
towards the day's lows on late liquidation, although the market continued to
be supported by Chinese interest.
The LEAD market made another attempt to move above Dollars 470 a tonne for
three months delivery in the afternoon, but again lacked follow-through,
slipping back below that technically-significant level to end unchanged on
the day at Dollars 468 a tonne.
ZINC, bereft of fundamental support, was unable to build on Tuesday's upward
movement, and the three months position finished at Dollars 961 a tonne,
down Dollars 6.50.

FT  14 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shortfall seen boosting coffee
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A substantial shortfall in coffee supplies this year and a further deficit
next year will lead to greater than expected price rises, according to the
Economist Intelligence Unit.
The EIU has sharply raised its forecasts of price rises this year to 24.3
per cent for arabica and 23.6 per cent for robusta. In its February forecast
for world commodities, it predicted rises of just over 16 per cent for both.
Coffee futures prices continued their upward drive yesterday morning. The
London Commodity Exchange's second position robusta futures briefly broke
through the key psychological barrier of Dollars 1,500 a tonne but then ran
into selling and closed Dollars 7 down at Dollars 1,483.
The EIU says the worsening outlook for Brazil's harvest, starting this
month, explains the cut in its forecast of global supplies in 1994-95 to
72.5m bags (60kg each) from 75.4m two months ago.
It predicts a Brazilian crop of 20m bags, down from 24m in 1993-94, but says
a recovery is expected in 1995-96.

FT  14 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pipe work to boost gas sales to
Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 1.6bn loan agreement to refurbish the Russian gas pipeline system
was signed by 47 western banks in London yesterday in a deal which will
allow Gazprom, the gas monopoly, to boost exports to Italy, one of its main
customers.
The credit, which will be drawn down over the next five years, will finance
refurbishment by an Italian consortium consisting of Nuovo Pignone and
Snamprogetti.
The main aim is to reduce the large losses of natural gas as it moves from
Siberia through the Russian pipeline system. The refurbishment will result
in Italy gaining an additional 5.5bn cubic metres of Russian gas - taking
the total above 19m - without any new, expensive wells being drilled.
Mr Earl Teitler of West Merchant Bank, one of the arrangers of the loan,
said it could serve as a model for future energy export contracts with
Russia and other former Soviet republics. Funds from the sale of the gas to
Snam, the national Italian gas company, will be deposited in a US dollar
escrow account, from which the loan will be repayed. The present value of
the gas sales is Dollars 500m a year, rising to Dollars 900m when the
additional amounts become available.
The arrangement was made possible by a World Bank waiver allowing Russian
government revenues to be pledged to a specific project.
Syndication commitments of Dollars 2.2bn exceeded the Dollars 1.6bn
required. Bankers said the positive reaction reflected Gazprom's record of
exporting gas to western Europe without interruption for 25 years.

FT  14 APR 94 / Government Bonds: US sector weakens despite soft retail
sales data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After a short-lived rally, US Treasury prices weakened yesterday afternoon
as traders looked ahead to Friday, when economic data which could lead to a
further tightening of monetary policy is due.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  17/32 lower
at 87 27/32 , with the yield rising to 7.25 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 15/32 , to yield 5.396 per cent.
The Commerce Department gave the market an early lift. It reported retail
sales last month up 0.4 per cent, well below the consensus forecast of 1 per
cent. But the news was not enough to sweep aside a sense of caution. Prices
could only sustain a modest move higher.
Meanwhile, March consumer price data matched expectations, and failed to
provide support.
The CPI came in at 0.3 per cent, with and without the volatile food and
energy components factored into the data.
But traders were less concerned with the CPI, which reflects current prices,
than with Friday's figures on industrial production and factory utilisation,
which suggest future inflationary trends.
With many anticipating bad news, a flurry of selling by dealers forced
prices into retreat.
Speculation that the data would provide sufficient cause for the Federal
Reserve to lift short-term interest rates once again accelerated the
sell-off, but bonds managed to climb from their lows in late trading.
The Bundesbank pared another three basis points off its repo rate yesterday,
and left the European government bond markets speculating as to whether the
German central bank would announce cuts in its key interest rates at today's
council meeting.
Most European bond markets opened on a firm note but then drifted off in the
course of the day on profit-taking.
In the German government bonds market, the Liffe bund futures contract
opened at 97.29 and picked up to reach a high of 97.36 ahead of the repo
announcement.
The Bundesbank accepted bids amounting to DM55.1bn in 13-day securities
repurchase agreements at 5.70 per cent and above. But the market then
drifted lower and reached a low of 96.87 before ending the day at 96.89.
The Bundesbank is due to hold a press conference today to release its
results. Few analysts or dealers expect the central bank to lower its
discount rate, although some feel there is a chance that the Lombard rate -
now at 6.75 per cent - may receive a 'cosmetic cut' of 25 to 50 basis
points.
Given that recent economic data - including yesterday's German retail sales
figures for February, which showed better than expected growth of 1 per cent
from the previous month - have suggested that the German economy is showing
signs of picking up, 'the urgency to cut interest rates no longer exists,'
says Mr Kit Juckes, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities.
However, he pointed out that the Bundesbank's monthly report, released
yesterday, suggested that the German bank is placing more emphasis on growth
and inflation figures, while appearing to play down the M3 figures.
The release of minutes from the regular monthly meetings between the
governor of the Bank of England and the chancellor of the exchequer provided
the highlight of the day for UK government bonds, giving hope of a further
cut in the base rate, dealers said.
The short sterling contract and short-dated gilts took heart from news that
the chancellor had favoured a bigger cut in UK interest rates than the
governor at the February meeting. The news raised hopes of a further base
rate cut, provided inflation stays under control. But while the news
provided a mild boost for the short end of the market, the rise proved quite
short-lived.
The Liffe long gilt future contract fell from a high of 108.03 to a low of
107.06 before closing at 107.13.
Japanese government bonds staged a rally in the futures market shortly
before the close after spending much of the day flat or slightly weaker.
Bond prices dipped on news that the Nikkei stock index had risen back above
20,000 for the first time in over a week. But dealers said a burst of
short-covering in the futures market late in the session, which appeared to
be one big player, pushed up prices. The June futures contract, which opened
at 111.29, rallied to close at the high of 111.70.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Bonds: Sweden uses flexible allotment for
Ecu500m five-year deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eurobond market saw a handful of new issues yesterday, but activity was
slow as many participants remained sidelined ahead of today's Bundesbank
council meeting.
Close on the heels of Tuesday's Ecu500m five-year deal for the EBRD, the
Kingdom of Sweden issued Ecu400m of five-year bonds via joint leads Morgan
Stanley and Swiss Bank Corporation.
The 6 1/4 per cent bonds were priced to yield 12 basis points over the
French Ecu BTAN at the fixed re-offer price of 99.40, Although the bonds
closed lower at 99.20 bid on a weaker BTAN, the spread held steady at 12
basis points.
Sweden's deal was allocated to the underwriting houses on a flexible
allotment basis, with banks taking only as many bonds as they felt able to
place. 'Allotting bonds to demand allowed for very little flowback,' said
one of the lead managers.
Meanwhile, Rabobank Nederland piggy-backed Tuesday's successful AT&amp;T
Eurodollar deal with Dollars 250m of three-year bonds via SBC. The bonds
yielded 20 basis points over the Treasury note at their 99.91 re-offer
price, which was deemed fair by most market participants.
'Quite a few investors are looking for dollar exposure, and triple-A rated
three-year 6 per cent paper sounds like a safe bet,' said one dealer.
In the D-Mark sector, the German building materials company Heidelberger
Zement Finance made its Eurobond debut with DM700m of 6 3/8 per cent
five-year bonds via joint lead Dresdner Bank. The unrated bonds were priced
to yield 50 basis points over the corresponding domestic bond and traded
around 99.55 bid in the afternoon, yielding 6.46 per cent. Strong demand
from German, Swiss and Benelux investors helped the yield spread narrow to
48 basis points, a syndicate official said.
Elsewhere, Unilever returned to the Euroguilder sector with Fl 350m of 6 1/2
per cent 10-year bonds via ABN Amro Bank. Paying 20 basis points over the
Dutch government bond at the 99.60 re-offer price, the triple-A rated paper
met healthy demand from institutional and retail investors, lifting the
price to 99.65 bid and causing the spread to narrow to 16 basis points.
Standard &amp; Poor's has raised its ratings on Chase Manhattan Corporation's
senior debt to single-A from single-A-minus, on its subordinated debt to
single-A-minus from triple-B-plus, and on its preferred stock to
triple-B-plus from triple-B. Chase Manhattan Corporation's and Chase
Manhattan Bank of Canada's commercial paper ratings were raised to A-1 from
A-2. About Dollars 5.7bn of debt is affected.
The upgrade reflects the success of the company's attack on its credit
quality and capital needs by raising reserves, cutting costs and accessing
the equity markets, the agency said.
IBCA, the European rating agency, raised its long-term and short-term
ratings for Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corporation and Chemical Banking
Corporation. The holding companies of all three banks were accorded single-A
long-term ratings, from single-A-minus, and A1 short-term ratings, from A2.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: CBoT meets on Globex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors of the Chicago Board of Trade are meeting today to discuss the
exchange's future on Globex, the electronic futures trading system it
developed with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuter.
However, despite a flurry of communications between the partners this month,
CBoT, the world's busiest futures exchange, is preparing to leave Globex
next week.
'Unless something changes, our Globex screens will go dark on April 22,'
said Mr David Prosperi of CBoT. That is when the current agreement between
Reuter and the two Chicago exchanges expires.
With Reuter, the CME and the Matif endorsing a new Globex contract that
would require CBoT to run its evening floor trading session side-by-side
with computer trading, CBoT has few options.
If the CBoT board votes to remain with Globex by extending the terms of its
existing contract, it will be overridden by either Reuter or the CME, which
favour a new arrangement to attract other exchanges to the system. The CBoT
is still disputing details of that arrangement, and is not obliged to
endorse it.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: More supervision of
derivatives urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the US House of Representatives banking
committee, yesterday introduced legislation that would give bank regulators
broader powers to supervise banks' derivatives dealings.
The Gonzalez bill requires full disclosure of bank derivatives activities
and would make improper management of derivatives or inadequate derivatives
disclosure by banks a direct violation of law.
The proposed legislation applies only to banks, and would not affect
derivatives dealings by securities firms, unsupervised derivatives dealing
subsidiaries, or hedge funds. However, Mr Gonzalez said that if banks engage
in fuller derivatives disclosure, 'other market participants will be forced
to follow because ratings agencies and other market participants will demand
matching disclosure.'
Regulation of this fast-growing sector of the financial markets has come
under renewed scrutiny this year because of losses by hedge funds on swaps
and other derivatives investments when bond prices tumbled in the first
quarter.
Although bank regulators, including a committee of the Bank for
International Settlement, have concluded that derivatives markets are
well-organised and sufficiently supervised, Mr Gonzalez, in introducing his
bill, said: 'It is the role of Congress to ensure that the regulators have
not erred in their assessment.'
Mr Gonzalez's bill is the second of its kind introduced in the House this
year. The first, offered by Mr James Leach of Iowa, is likely to be
superseded by Mr Gonzalez's initiative.
In addition to enhancing bank regulators' powers to supervise bank
derivatives activities, Mr Gonzalez's bill would require the General
Accounting Office to study the extent to which banks speculate in the
derivatives markets, and to look at the feasibility of imposing a
transaction tax or margin requirements on such activities.

Paramount Publishing, the largest US book publisher, has formed a joint
venture with Davidson &amp; Associates, a leading multimedia computer software
company. The alliance is the latest move by a traditional publisher to
branch into the emerging multimedia field.
The companies said they would develop a broad range of multimedia products
for the consumer, education, business and reference works markets, based on
Paramount's extensive library of book titles.
As part of the alliance, Davidson will develop education software for
schools to be marketed in conjunction with Paramount's school textbooks.
Paramount expects to initially spend Dollars 50m on the development of these
products, which it will own.
The companies are also entering into a joint venture to create and publish a
range of multimedia products under a Simon &amp; Schuster/Davidson imprint for
other market segments. In the joint venture, the companies will equally
share investments and revenues.
'This alliance is an important step in our evolution into the largest
interactive publisher,' said Mr Richard Snyder, chairman of Paramount
Publishing, a division of Paramount Communications, which is being acquired
by Viacom. 'This new relationship will accelerate our efforts to exploit our
vast library of copyrights by creating multimedia products for the entire
publishing spectrum.'

   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International retail chains are announcing expansion plans in Argentina,
attracted by its rapid economic growth, relatively high incomes and the
absence of a sophisticated retail industry.
French-owned Carrefour said on Tuesday it would paid the local subsidiary of
British American Tobacco Dollars 20m for a 91,000 square metre site in
metropolitan Buenos Aires.
Carrefour is Argentina's leading retailer and already owns seven
hypermarkets there. It is building an eighth in Cordoba. It is expected that
a new Buenos Aires hypermarket will be ready next year.
Wal-Mart of the US was yesterday reported to have paid Argentina's Bunge y
Born industrial and food group Dollars 18m for a prime site in Buenos Aires.
El Cronista Comercial, a business newspaper, said that Wal-Mart took an
option on the site, currently occupied by a textile factory, that will
expire by mid-year.
Yesterday Mr Eduardo Elzstain, president of Buenos Aires-based property
developer IRSA, said a court had rejected legal objections to his company's
development of a hypermarket in the city centre.
Mr Elzstain said he hoped the Dollars 30m Abasto shopping centre project,
which IRSA took over from the failed El Hogar Obrero co-operative chain,
would open in 1996. IRSA is listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange but
its principal shareholder is New York investor Mr George Soros.

Seiyu, a leading Japanese supermarket operator, and Hong Kong's Wing On
group, plan to open a department store in Tianjin, China, before the end of
this year, Saiyu said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
Seiyu and Wing On will buy management rights to and rebuild an existing
department store called Long Men Mansion Department Store in Tianjin.
Seiyu is planning to set up a distribution centre in Tianjin to provide
goods to an additional department store chain.
Seiyu, which operates supermarkets selling clothing and other non-food goods
as well as groceries, is the nucleus of the Seibu Saison group in Japan, and
has a stake in the Wing On department store chain.
Seiyu's announcement came as it reported a 26 per cent fall in group pre-tax
profit for the fiscal year to end-February
In the latest year the company made a pre-tax profit of Y23.39bn (Dollars
226m) compared with Y31.69bn 12 months earlier. The net profit of Y7.3bn was
29 per cent lower than the Y10.34bn last time. Sales of Y1,306bn were down
5.2 per cent from Y1,377bn.
For the 12 months to February 1995, Seiyu is forecasting consolidated
pre-tax profit of Y26bn - up 11 per cent on the latest results - and net
profit 9.5 per cent ahead at Y8bn on sales 2.4 per higher at Y1,337bn.

<TEXT>
HJ Heinz, the US grocery products group, yesterday revealed it was in talks
with Borden, the US food and wallpaper group. However, Heinz refused to
confirm reports it was buying the bulk of its food-services division.
Borden also declined to comment. The sale of its food business, which
generated Dollars 270m in revenues last year, would represent the first
divestment since the troubled group announced a massive restructuring
earlier this year.
The company is seeking to concentrate on its most profitable lines,
including pasta sauces and several niche grocery products. After posting a
net loss of Dollars 593.6m last year, it promised to sell over Dollars
1.25bn in assets, including its salty snacks and seafood businesses, which
generated nearly 20 per cent of its 1993 revenues.
For Heinz, the Borden food services division would make a logical fit with
its own core business, which supplies individual plastic pouches of
mayonnaise, ketchup and other condiments to restaurants, schools and
hospitals.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Restated results reveal losses
at Woolworth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Woolworth, the US-based retailer, yesterday restated its financial results
for all four quarters of the year ending January 29, 1994, and confirmed
that profits reported for the first two quarters had been illusory.
Last year, Woolworth reported it had scraped into profits of Dollars 1m for
the first quarter and Dollars 2m for the second. Yesterday's restated
figures show, however, that the company actually made losses of Dollars 24m
and Dollars 10m in the first and second quarters respectively.
Woolworth said it was not yet ready to explain the errors. A special
committee of the board of directors was investigating the events that made
the restatement necessary, it said.
However, the fact that the first two quarters' profits have turned into
losses is likely to reconfirm suspicions that costs which should properly
have been taken in the first two quarters were deferred until later in the
year, in a misguided attempt to keep the company out of the red.
Woolworth had warned at the end of last month its quarterly figures would
have to be restated. A few days later, it announced that Mr William Lavin,
chairman and chief executive, and Mr Charles Young, chief financial officer,
were temporarily stepping aside while an investigation was carried out.
Yesterday it announced that its full-year figures for last year would stay
the same, but that the quarterly breakdown had been changed 'to reflect a
correction of gross margins and certain selling, general and administrative
expenses'.
It also brought forward to the third quarter the reversal of a Dollars 145m
repositioning reserve that had been taken in the fourth quarter.
Significantly, the board also reconfirmed the fourth-quarter dividend of 29
cents per share on the common stock, bringing comfort to the company's
institutional shareholders, who hold the shares mainly as a yield stock. The
shares closed Dollars 1 3/4 up at Dollars 17 1/8 .
Mr John Adams, interim chairman and chief executive, said yesterday's
announcement concluded the part of the inquiry relating to the financial
results, and should put to rest any concerns about the company's financial
position.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Procter may sue Bankers Trust
over swaps losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, has raised the possibility
that it will take legal action against Bankers Trust over losses it incurred
on interest rate swaps contracts designed by the banking group. P&amp;G said it
has been forced to take an after-tax charge of Dollars 102m in the first
quarter to cover the losses.
The company said that although it has been using derivatives instruments
such as swaps to cut the cost of its borrowing and manage its exposure to
interest rate and foreign exchange for years, the losses were incurred on
two highly leveraged swaps contracts that were inconsistent with the
company's internal policy on the use of derivatives.
P&amp;G said it lost money on the swaps because of the recent sharp rise in
interest rates. Mr Edwin Artzt, P&amp;G chairman and chief executive, said:
'Unlike the other swaps the company has historically used, it turned out
that the two leveraged swaps in question were based on highly complex
formulas that multiplied the effect of interest rate increases. Derivatives
like these are dangerous and we were badly burned. We won't let this happen
again.'
Mr Artzt said that P&amp;G was 'seriously considering our legal options relative
to Bankers Trust'. The company, however, would not discuss whether it was
considering filing a lawsuit against the bank.
Bankers Trust said that while it had entered into a number of derivatives
transactions with P&amp;G, some of which were profitable, when market interest
rates began to affect the company's position adversely on some of the
contracts, the bank 'strongly and formally recommended that Procter &amp; Gamble
limit its risks by unwinding all or part of the transactions'. However,
Bankers Trust said senior officials at P&amp;G rejected its recommendations.
The two contracts that soured were designed to allow P&amp;G to swap fixed
interest rate loans for floating interest rate loans, and assumed that US
and German interest rates would stay low.
P&amp;G would not comment on whether any of its executives involved in the
derivatives transactions had been disciplined for buying swaps from Bankers
Trust that breached its internal policies, but the company admitted that
some of its officers had become involved in transactions they did not fully
understand.
The group said that its first quarter earnings, to be released later this
month, will show a gain of about 15 per cent, in spite of the swaps-related
charge.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: First credit rating for UK
pension scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS), the second-largest pension
scheme in the UK, has become the first one outside the US to obtain credit
ratings from Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, the two leading international
ratings agencies.
According to Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which guided ESPS through
the rating process, S&amp;P has assigned an implied triple-A rating to the
senior debt obligations of ESPS while commercial paper (CP) guaranteed by
the scheme has been rated A-1 plus by S&amp;P and P-1 by Moody's.
With assets valued at more than Pounds 13bn (Dollars 19bn), ESPS provides
the principal pension arrangements for the 12 regional electricity companies
in England and Wales, the National Grid Company, National Power, National
Electric and PowerGen as well as two electrical retailers, Hornepower and
Powerhouse.
Mr Brian Matthews, finance director of ESN Pension Management Group, said
the rating would allow the scheme to achieve fine financing terms.
The rating would also provide the scheme with greater access to the
derivatives market and would be a useful marketing tool when pitching for
pension fund management business outside the electricity industry.
Mr Matthews noted that the CP rating enabled the scheme's US investment
property company, Eastern Realty Investment Corporation, to raise Dollars
105m in the US CP market last month at an average interest rate of less than
3 1/2 per cent.
This financing route provided two advantages to the scheme, he said. First,
it was tax-efficient because the scheme did not have tax-exempt status in
the US.
Second, if the scheme had lent the funds to the US subsidiary, it would have
had to give up a return which was much higher than the interest rate which
the US company was paying.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Winter Olympics help CBS lift
income 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A strong boost from its highly successful coverage of the Winter Olympics
helped CBS, the US broadcasting group, report a 28 per cent increase in net
income to Dollars 69.3m from Dollars 54.2m in its first quarter.
During the Olympics, the CBS Television Network had two weeks of the highest
ratings it has yet recorded.
Largely as a result of this event, net sales for the group surged by 42 per
cent to Dollars 1.25bn from the comparable quarter's Dollars 878.7m. CBS
said that if the effect of the Olympics were excluded, sales would have been
about 6 per cent ahead.
Earnings per share rose by 21 per cent to Dollars 4.23 from Dollars 3.50
last time.
The CBS Television Stations division was the biggest beneficiary of the
Olympics coverage, with sales and profits ahead very strongly.
In addition, CBS said, the improving US economy had brought substantial
strengthened demand for local advertising. Sales growth was particularly
strong at WCBS-TV New York and WCIX-TV Miami.
Local and spot radio sales also benefited from more robust business
conditions, and CBS Radio reported better operating results led by improved
sales and earnings at the AM group of stations.
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive, said that the group's
operating results continued to show steady improvement, reflecting the
combined effect of a strong programming schedule, strengthened demand for
advertising and active cost control.
He said that the CBS Television Network was heading towards 'an exceptional
triple crown' in winning the ratings in prime time, day time and late night
television in the current season.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese unit behind Alcan loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcan Aluminium of Canada posted a loss in its first quarter, in spite of
strengths in fabricated products in North America and Canada.
Weak prices and heavier losses at its Japanese associate were the main
reasons for the loss, but 'if recent increases in metal prices are
sustained, we should see gradual improvement in our results,' said Mr
Jacques Bougie, president.
Alcan's consolidated net loss for the March quarter was USDollars 25m, or 13
cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 20m, or 11 cents, a year earlier.
The 1994 period included an Dollars 11m after-tax restructuring charge,
offset by an Dollars 11m special gain. The 1993 period included Dollars 6m
restructuring charges.
Sales and other revenues rose 3 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn. Sales and
operating expenses rose slightly, while administration, research and
interest costs were lower.
More cost reductions were planned, said Mr Bougie. Several businesses not
meeting strategic priorities have been put up for sale.
Spot ingot prices have risen nearly 20 per cent this year to around 60 cents
a pound, from the late 1993 lows of about 49 cents, following international
agreement on production cuts.
Including processing of customer-owned metal, shipments of fabricated
products were up sharply at 442,000 tonnes.
Canadian operations returned to profit, but Brazil continued to be
difficult. Europe showed signs of recovery with the UK, Germany and
Switzerland profitable. Pacific operations were affected by the Japanese
losses.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Alcoa pushes on with spaceframes
 -John Griffiths visits the latest car body plant at Soest, near Dortmund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) expects to set up at least two more
plants in Europe within the next five years to produce revolutionary
aluminium 'spaceframe' bodies for cars.
It is also prepared to spend Dollars 1bn or more on a partnership with any
carmaker seeking to produce the first high-volume - 100,000 units or more a
year - aluminium-bodied cars, according to Mr David Schlendorf, president of
Alcoa's automotive structures division.
His remarks came as Alcoa yesterday formally opened its plant in Soest,
which supplies the spaceframe bodies to Audi, the Volkswagen group's
upmarket car division. Audi is to use this type of body in the A8 luxury
model to be launched soon.
Alcoa has invested DM140m (Dollars 81m) in the plant, which employs 160
people and has the capacity to make 50,000 to 60,000 bodies a year.
Audi hopes to sell 20,000 A8 cars a year. It is expected to use up the
remainder of Alcoa's Soest capacity with another niche car, to be produced
in slightly higher volumes than the A8 as well as being cheaper, although
Audi executives were giving no details of the project yesterday.
'Five years from now in Europe you'll be seeing at least 10 aluminium
spaceframe-bodied niche cars, to be produced at a rate of up to 20,000 units
a year, either in production or announced by a number of manufacturers,'
said Mr Schlendorf.
Claiming that the motor industry is making an 'inevitable' progression to
aluminium rather than steel bodies, because of its light weight, lower
tooling costs and recyclability, Mr Schlendorf said that before the end of
the decade Alcoa may have installed a satellite production system for
aluminium bodies across Europe. It was likely to consist of one large
components manufacturing site - possibly in Hungary or another low-cost
eastern European country. This would produce the extrusions, castings and
other individual parts of the body. 'We'd then ship these to assembly plants
we set up close to each carmaker,' said Mr Schlendorf.
The low overheads and relatively simple tooling in spaceframe assembly means
that 'we can set up such assembly plants cheaply, and sufficiently quickly
that we wouldn't even need to make an investment until a supply contract
with an individual carmaker had actually been signed'.
The A8, which has started production at Audi's Ingolstadt plant, is itself a
landmark vehicle for the motor and aluminium industries in terms of both its
construction and the volumes in which it is to be built. Honda produces an
all-aluminium luxury sports car, the NSX, but uses conventional pressings
procedures and currently makes only about 1,500 units a year.
While Audi and Volkswagen executives have indicated a belief that all their
output will move to aluminium by relatively early in the next century, Alcoa
expects that it will be in North America that the 'breakthrough' car for the
world aluminium industry, one produced in volumes of at least 100,000 units
a year, will first appear.
Ford is already building and testing a fleet of 40 aluminium-bodied Mercury
Sables. The next generation of the Ford Taurus, scheduled for delivery in
North America late next year, is expected to use a substantial amount of
sheet aluminium but is not itself expected to be the 'breakthrough' car.
Ford is predicting that the use of aluminium by the motor industry will
triple from the current 200lb per car within the next decade, not least
because some significant obstacles to its more widespread use - particularly
aluminium's historic price volatility - are now being overcome.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: United Airlines workers agree to
pay cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Employees of United Airlines, the world's biggest airline, have agreed to
take pay-cuts of up to 23 per cent in return for shares that will give them
a controlling stake in the company, it emerged yesterday.
They have also agreed to forgo wage increases for the next three years, take
cuts in fringe benefits and accept changes to working practices that will
together save the airline Dollars 5.2bn over the next 12 years, or Dollars
3.3bn in today's money.
In exchange, employees will get stock under an employee share ownership plan
that will give them between 53 per cent and 63 per cent of United's shares,
depending on how the share price performs over the next year.
The intended effect of the transaction - one of the biggest employee
buy-outs - will be to achieve drastic cuts in United's costs and enable it
to fight back against low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines, which
have been driving down fares on short-haul routes in the US and grabbing
market share.
Full details of the plan emerged as United Airlines filed its proposals with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The plan has already been agreed by
labour unions and management but has yet to be approved by shareholders, who
will vote on it in about two months.
The prospectus shows that the biggest pay cuts will fall on pilots. All have
agreed to take a cut in hourly pay rates of 15.7 per cent, and those working
for a new low-cost operation that will take over United's short-haul flights
will take a further reduction of 7.1 per cent.
Maintenance crew and other blue-collar workers have agreed to a pay cut of
9.7 per cent and will also lose the 5 per cent rise they were due to receive
next month.
Like the pilots, they have also agreed to forgo pay rises for three years
except on promotion, and will not get any 'snap-back' to previous pay levels
when the pay freeze ends.
On top of the Dollars 3.3bn resulting from pay cuts and other benefit
reductions, United expects to make other savings as a result of its decision
to set up a low-cost, short-haul airline-within-an-airline dubbed 'U2' - for
example, through more intensive use of its employees and assets. The total
of all savings over the next 12 years is estimated at Dollars 4.9bn in
today's money.
United believes this will enable it to lower operating costs per available
seat mile on short-haul routes by 30 per cent to 7.4 cents - only slightly
above Southwest's 7.2 cents - while continuing to offer frills, such as
assigned seating and first-class accommodation.
In a presentation to analysts yesterday, Mr Gerald Greenwald, the former
Chrysler vice-chairman chosen by United's unions to replace Mr Stephen Wolf
as chairman and chief executive, sought to allay concerns in the investment
community that the airline would be subject to worker control.
He said the unions would nominate two of the board's 12 members and have a
say in the selection of four other independent directors. 'But the company
must be managed in a professional manner, and management is clearly not a
role that they seek.'
Mr Greenwald said the unions would, however, have the power of veto over
asset disposals worth more than Dollars 1bn, over the selection of
'inappropriate or inexperienced' board members, and over big mergers or
non-airline acquisitions.
United's existing shareholders will get a basket of Dollars 25.80 in cash,
Dollars 31.10 in debentures and Dollars 31.10 in preferred stock for every
share they hold, together with half a share in the recapitalised company.
The existing shares closed down Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 126 7/8.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Hilton Hotels slips 14% in first
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hilton Hotels saw its first quarter net income fall 14 per cent to Dollars
22.7m, or 47 cents a share. However, the US group's hotel operations put in
a strong performance.
Group revenues rose 2 per cent to Dollars 338.8m from Dollars 331.6m a year
ago.
The hotel side, continuing the recovery that began in the second half of
1993 and reflecting improved results at many of its leading-market
properties, posted operating income of Dollars 20.7m, a 62 per cent
improvement.
Several Hilton flagship hotels, including the Waldorf-Astoria, New York
Hilton and Towers, New Orleans Hilton Riverside, Hilton Hawaiian Village and
San Francisco Hilton and Towers reported stronger results.
While occupancy was flat at 66 per cent, compared with last year operating
results benefited from an overall increase of 4 per cent in average room
rate and a 5 per cent rise in revenue per available room.
Hilton said a 20 per cent decline in operating income from gaming - to
Dollars 38.6m from Dollars 48.3m a year ago - was attributable primarily to
unusually high table game win percentages in the 1993 quarter at the Las
Vegas Hilton.
The 1994 quarter was also hit by construction work at the Flamingo Hilton
Las Vegas.

<TEXT>
Fleet Financial, the largest banking group in New England, which recently
announced a large cost-cutting programme, yesterday reported a 25 per cent
increase in first quarter net income.
The group, rumoured to be in preliminary merger talks with Bank of New York,
reported net income of Dollars 133.1m, or 80 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 106.3m, or 66 cents, in the same period last year.
However, the figures were towards the bottom of analysts' expectations,
which ranged as high as 90 cents a share, and Fleet shares dipped Dollars 1
3/8 to close at Dollars 38 1/4 .
The results included an additional pre-tax restructuring charge of Dollars
25m for the cost-cutting programme, which involves staff cuts of 5,500 and
is designed to increase pre-tax earnings by Dollars 350m a year. The group
recorded a Dollars 7.4m after-tax gain on the sale of a factoring business.
Mr Terrence Murray, chairman, said the bank was experiencing 'both strong
earnings and significant reductions in asset quality costs. We expect to
sustain these encouraging trends if the economy continues to improve,
particularly in the north-east.'
Fleet's return on assets was 1.14 per cent, compared with 0.96 per cent, and
its return on equalised equity was 16.08 per cent, up from 15.24 per cent.
The improved ratios were helped by a sharp fall in non-performing assets,
which totalled Dollars 609m at the end of the quarter, down 35 per cent from
12 months earlier. Net write-offs were 60 per cent lower, at Dollars 32m,
and the provision for credit losses was Dollars 22m, down from Dollars 85m.
Fleet's net interest margin dipped 25 basis points, from 5.03 per cent to
4.78 per cent, compared with the previous year, due to the Federal Reserve's
tightening of monetary policy, and net interest income fell Dollars 9m to
Dollars 504m. Non interest income totalled Dollars 299m, down from Dollars
310m.
IBCA, the European ratings agency, yesterday raised its long and short term
ratings for three New York money centre banks, Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and
Chemical Banking, citing the improving performance and prospects for the
trio.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Caremark in low-cost drugs
alliance - Pharmaceutical companies respond to the hard bargaining of
healthcare providers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three pharmaceuticals companies - Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer of the US,
and France's Rhone-Poulenc - have joined Caremark International, a US drug
distributor, in an alliance intended to offer lower cost drugs to buyers.
Caremark manages the pharmacy aspects of healthcare provided by corporate
clients to their employees. Customers include companies such as retail group
Sears, oil company Amoco and United Airlines, and it is involved in the
healthcare management of more than 12m people.
The areas of healthcare identified as being the most expensive to deal with
were for corporate clients and include heart disease, asthma, depression,
diabetes and HIV/Aids. Of the three companies which have joined Caremark,
some have allocated their entire portfolio of drugs to be sold through
Caremark, while others have allocated specific products.
The collaborative work will involve so-called outcomes analysis in which
financial comparisons are made between different treatment regimes.
The move is partly in response to the Dollars 6bn purchase last summer of
drug distributor Medco by the US drugs company Merck. That was, in turn, a
response to the determination of healthcare providers - both hospitals and
companies - to drive hard bargains with drugs companies.
Caremark is involved in several of these cost-cutting methods, called
capitation, in which a company agrees to look after the health of a group of
people on a per-head basis.
This involves having access to a variety of drugs to deal with a range of
illnesses and means that a deal should involve as many different therapeutic
areas as possible.
The company held talks with 11 pharmaceutical companies last summer just
after the Merck-Medco deal. It said yesterday that it was still in talks
with at least two further potential partners.
Caremark already distributes drugs made by US biotechnology company
Genentech, the UK's Zeneca and Swiss drugs company Sandoz.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: St Barbara finds a philosophy
that pays off - The Australian gold producer is expanding production fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Birchmore, once one of the key figures in Mr Alan Bond's
corporation, had a dream of building a London-based mining finance house.
That dream has faded. Instead he is concentrating his entire attention on St
Barbara Mines, a fast-growing gold producer in his native Australia.
Now 55, Mr Birchmore severed his links with the Bond Corporation before it
imploded. He quit when Bond International Gold was sold to Lac Minerals of
Canada in 1989. He judged then that London, still the mining finance capital
of the world, needed a new mining finance house following the disappearance,
via acquisition, of such groups as Selection Trust and Consolidated Gold
Fields.
His timing could not have been worse. London institutional investors had
watched the value of their investments in a number of small mining companies
launched in the 1980s dwindle away. And the gold price was on a seemingly
never-ending bear track.
Mr Birchmore says it took him about a year to realise that 'the mining
finance house idea was not feasible and that, instead, I had to focus on one
place'.
That one place is a 500,000-acre holding in the Murchison region of the
Western Australian gold fields. This area, not far from the town of
Meekatharra, is where St Barbara Mines is concentrating its activities.
Mr Birchmore is chairman of St Barbara which was established by Mr Ross
Atkins, a gold exploration expert who called Mr Birchmore in to sort out his
group's tangled finances.
Between them Mr Birchmore and Mr Atkins own 58 per cent of St Barbara via
their 100-per-cent-owned Bengal Star company. The next biggest group of
shareholders, with 8 per cent, are based in North America and are clients of
Mr Dick Pomboy, a Greenwich, Connecticut, money manager and enthusiastic
gold bug.
St Barbara stands apart from most other Australian gold companies in that it
owns all its equipment rather than relying on contractors to do the work.
Mr Birchmore says: 'This is an exploration-driven company - we will spend
ADollars 6m (USDollars 4.2m) this year - and having our own equipment means
the lowest possible costs.' That looks a clever policy at present because
the Western Australian gold rush has tied up every drilling rig.
St Barbara owns eight drilling rigs, each with its own driller, field
assistant and geologist, plus its own assay laboratory with the capacity to
handle up to 1,500 samples a day.
Mr Birchmore says: 'All the drills, all the geologists are in the same area,
within 150km of our Bluebird plant, working 10 hours a day. And when you are
drilling on gold fields all the time you are going to get gold.'
That philosophy seems to be paying off. Costs of finding gold are well below
the industry average - only ADollars 13.12 an ounce for the 166,160 ounces
of proven reserves added in the second half of 1993.
And at the end of March St Barbara reported spectacular results from
drilling on its prospect at Cuddingwarra, near Cue, which sent its share
price rocketing.
St Barbara said: 'The results from Cuddingwarra during the 1994 drilling
programme have been robust, in terms of width and grade, indicating the
presence of mineable ore in considerable volumes and at a substantial grade
(quantity of gold per tonne of ore).'
Drilling at Cuddingwarra was initially aimed at finding additional ore to
feed St Barbara's Bluebird mill near Meekatharra but, if the tonnages make
it worthwhile, St Barbara would consider a stand-alone operation.
The company is on track to produce at least 120,000 troy ounces of gold in
the financial year to end-June, making it a large producer by Australian
standards.
The Bluebird plant was recently expanded at a cost of ADollars 6m and, after
initial troubles, output is running at an annual rate of 150,000 ounces.
Reserves at the end of 1993 totalled 1.13m ounces, enough for a mine life of
seven and a half years.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Heineken to step up Asia
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
Heineken, the Dutch brewer, plans to take advantage of the swift growth of
beer markets in Asia with an 'aggressive' programme of investment in the
region.
Asia Pacific Breweries (APB), the company's Singapore-based joint venture
with Fraser &amp; Neave, expects to spend Fl 800m (Dollars 417m) on Asian
investments over the next five years. This is nearly four times the Fl 220m
invested over the past five years.
Mr Karel Vuursteen, Heineken chairman, said Asian beer markets were growing
at spectacular rates, with China showing a 20 per cent increase last year.
He said the company was planning three or four new brewery projects in China
over the next two years. APB, Heineken's investment vehicle for Asia,
already owns parts of breweries in Shanghai and Fuzhou. In recent years, it
has also been active in Vietnam and Thailand.
In 1993, Heineken's strong growth in Asia and in the US made up for a
downturn on European beer markets, which still account for 75 per cent of
group turnover. Last month, Heineken, the world's second-largest brewer,
reported a 12 per cent increase in 1993 net profit before extraordinary
items, to Fl 519m.
Figures contained in the annual report, released yesterday, showed an 0.8
per cent fall in Dutch sales and a 2 per cent drop in European sales last
year. These declines were more than outweighed by a 5.3 per cent rise in the
western hemisphere, and a sharp 23.7 per cent gain in Asia/Australia.
Mr Vuursteen said Heineken had recently reached a 'satisfactory' arrangement
with Vereenigde Glasfabrieken, a bottle manufacturer which supplied Heineken
with flawed bottles that had to be recalled in August.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BCE of Canada has warned that Northern Telecom is likely to record an
operating loss for the 1994 first quarter, AP-DJ reports.
For Northern Telecom, 52 per cent owned by BCE, 'the effect of pricing
pressures, product mix, and traditionally lower first-quarter volume is
expected to have a significant impact on gross profit and will likely
generate an operating loss in the first quarter of 1994,' BCE says in its
annual report.
'The annualised effect of improvements in the cost structure and volume
growth from a strengthened portfolio of products is expected to become
evident in the second half of the year.'
BCE says its Bell Canada unit's earnings target for 1994 'is at the low end
of the 11 per cent to 12 per cent range of regulated rate of return' set by
Canadian authorities.

<TEXT>
Elsag Bailey Process Automation, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica, the Italian
state-controlled engineering group, is to buy Fischer &amp; Porter, a US
manufacturer of measurement and control products, for Dollars 158m, after
outbidding one of Fischer's competitors.
Elsag Bailey Process Automation, which makes process automation and
numerical control equipment, yesterday announced an offer of Dollars 24.25
for each Fischer &amp; Porter share. The bid has been accepted by Fischer &amp;
Porter.
It is the first important deal for the Finmeccanica subsidiary since 40 per
cent of its shares were floated on the New York stock exchange last
December.
The Elsag Bailey offer beats, by Dollars 1 a share, the bid tabled last
month by Moorco International, a Houston-based maker of fluid measurement
and pressure-control products, which valued Fischer &amp; Porter at about
Dollars 150m.
Finmeccanica, based in Rome, explained that the deal would add control
system components - particularly in flow measurement - to the central
systems which Elsag Bailey already manufactures, and increase the
geographical spread of its products, notably in Germany.
Finmeccanica said this would allow the subsidiary to rationalise its
production, distribution and administrative structure.
In 1993, Fischer &amp; Porter reported net profits of Dollars 1.1m on turnover
of Dollars 222m.
Elsag Bailey Process Automation, assisted in the deal by a consortium of US
banks, recorded net profits of Dollars 21.6m on revenue of Dollars 606m for
1993.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Turkish government has closed the small Istanbul-based Turkish Tourism
and Investment Bank (TYT), in the first bank failure for almost a decade.
The move also represents the first casualty of the country's currency
crisis.
The Treasury announced that banking activity and deposit-taking was
suspended at TYT's eight branches. The bank had total assets of TL1,400bn
(Dollars 41.3m) at the end of 1992, the most recent figure available.
Isbank, the semi-autonomous state bank, had been mandated to liquidate the
balance sheet of the bank, with the government promising to pay out up to
TL150m for each depositor from the state insurance scheme.
The collapse stems from liquidity problems at TYT's parent, Lapis Holding, a
company better known for gold trading and tourism. Last July, Lapis agreed
to pay Dollars 213m for Disbank, a trade finance bank.

Accor, the French travel company which earlier this week announced a fall in
profits for 1993, expects this year to return to profits growth, according
to Mr Paul Dubrule and Mr Gerard Pelisson, joint chairmen.
They said they hoped Accor would, in 1994, see net profits return to the
1992 level of around FFr802m (Dollars 136.6m) against 1993's FFr615m. They
also anticipated faster profits growth, to around FFr1bn, for the following
year.
Accor, which suffered last year from the effects of recession on its
European hotel business, is now waiting to hear whether its offer for
Meridien, the luxury hotel chain controlled by Air France, has been
accepted.
Air France has invited offers for its 57 per cent majority stake in
Meridien. Accor, still burdened by debt after its 1991 takeover of
Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel group, is mounting a joint bid with Price Al
Waleed, a nephew of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
Accor, which hopes to merge Meridien with its Sofitel luxury hotels, will
provide 51 per cent of the cash required for the bid. The prince, whose
fortune is estimated at Dollars 10bn, will provide the rest.
However, their offer faces stiff competition from Forte, the UK hotel group
which has also bid for Meridien.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Morris, the US food, beer and tobacco group that makes Marlboro, the
world's biggest-selling cigarette, is considering splitting its tobacco
operations from the rest of the business.
The aim is to limit the damage caused by the problems afflicting its
domestic tobacco business.
Mr Hans Storr, executive vice-president and chief financial officer, said
that the plan was one of several options being studied by the group as a
means of enhancing the value of Philip Morris shares.
Mr Storr emphasised that no decisions had been taken and that other options
were available, such as continuing with the company's aggressive share
repurchase plan. Philip Morris bought back 3 per cent of its shares last
year.
However, Mr Storr said it was clear that Philip Morris's share price was
suffering excessively from the problems associated with the domestic tobacco
business, and the group was seeking a solution. 'We are keenly interested in
shareholder value, and we are very distressed at the present low value of
the stock,' Mr Storr said.
Like other US tobacco manufacturers, Philip Morris is facing increasingly
intense opposition to its cigarette products from politicians and
anti-smoking groups. It is also facing a tough fight in Congress over
President Clinton's plan to help pay for healthcare reform with a steep rise
in cigarette tax.
Meanwhile, it continues to suffer the effects of last year's cigarette price
war in the US.
Philip Morris's interest in splitting its tobacco and food businesses echoes
a similar proposal by RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group, last
summer.
RJR Nabisco's plan foundered because Wall Street disliked the structure of
the scheme, but the company is expected to come back with a fresh attempt at
a stock split this year.

Adidas, the German sports-wear producer, is confident that new products and
changes in marketing strategy will boost results for the year.
'Adidas is in good shape and ready to go on the offensive to once again
become the leading sportswear maker in the world,' said Mr Robert
Louis-Dreyfus, chief executive.
The company reported 1993 profits of DM9m (Dollars 5.3m), compared with a
loss of DM149m last time. However, turnover was down 3 per cent, at
DM2.63bn, and worldwide turnover including licensees was down 1 per cent at
DM3.9bn.
Mr Jan Runau, a company spokesman, said turnover was no longer a priority.
Adidas was putting more emphasis on the higher margins attainable by moving
sportswear products up-market.
The company said it hoped to recover its former market position with several
new products, including a football shoe called Predator.
Although Adidas's market share in Germany, its most important market, fell 1
per cent, to 33 per cent, Mr Runau said there were signs sales were picking
up, following better results in the second half of 1993.
Nike, the American sportswear maker, is second in Germany with a 20 per cent
market share.
Extensive restructuring at the formerly family-owned company, based outside
Nuremberg, has seen the workforce fall 26 per cent to 5,096.

FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Restructuring pushes Michelin
into net deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Depressed European markets and the costs of an ambitious restructuring
programme pushed Michelin, the world's largest manufacturer of tyres, into a
net loss of FFr3.67bn (Dollars 625m) last year, the group announced
yesterday.
The French company said, however, that recovery was under way and that it
was well positioned to return to profit this year. Industry analysts
predicted that net profits could exceed FFr1bn for 1994 as markets revive
and the benefits of the company's restructuring programme feed through.
Last year's loss, which compares with a net profit of FFr79m in 1992, was at
the upper end of industry forecasts and included a FFr2.76bn charge for the
group's two-year restructuring plan. Sales fell by 5.3 per cent to
FFr63.29bn.
Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, finance director, said that Michelin was
on course to achieve its target savings of FFr3.5bn by 1995 through a
package of job cuts and productivity measures.
The package, launched last April, had brought savings of FFr1bn in 1993 and
allowed a return to profit on ordinary activities in the final months of the
year, the company said.
Mr de Charbonniere also described a recovery in the group's principal
markets. 'In Europe, first-quarter sales to the original equipment markets
have shown a clear improvement,' he said.
Sales of replacement tyres have also improved, although this is more a
reflection of the introduction of new products than of a recovery in the
market, the company said.
In the US, according to Michelin, recovery started last year and is more
firmly established. The end of a price war launched in the spring of 1993,
confirmed by an increase in prices by the five major tyre companies in the
US market in the first quarter of this year, had further strengthened
prospects, said Mr de Charbonniere.
Net debts fell slightly, from FFr29.3bn at the end of 1992 to FFr28.7bn at
the end of last year.

The change may be largely invisible to the outside world, but its
significance is enormous to an insider. Nomura International is becoming
less like the European arm of the largest Japanese broking house and more
like the US and European investment banks that it wants to emulate.
Reforms which came into effect this month are an attempt to turn the face of
Nomura International away from Tokyo and towards London. However, the
changes also imply a belated recognition that the institutional customers
Nomura serves in Europe are different from its Japanese retail investors.
'In the past, we played by Japanese rules. Now we have got to play by
international ones,' says Mr Koichi Kane, Nomura International's chairman.
Mr Kane has masterminded a shift in the firm's strategy to place its 16
European offices firmly under the guidance of its London headquarters.
On the face of it, this is a straightforward management reform which
emphasises functional reporting lines - such as those from bond salesmen in
Zurich to the heads of the fixed-income business in London - and reduces the
control exercised by regional directors in Zurich and elsewhere.
Yet it signifies a big step in the development of Japanese securities
houses, which have traditionally modelled their overseas businesses on those
in Japan.
Offices in London, Zurich or Madrid have traditionally had a single purpose:
to distribute products from Japan to European investors.
This meant that Nomura International operated less as a single entity than
as a collection of 16 offices reporting to Tokyo. 'We wanted the European
offices to look to London as their big brother, but they did not think that
way,' says Mr Kane.
The need to run the business more from London was prompted by the bursting
of the Japanese 'bubble' economy in 1989, which affected Nomura's mix of
business in Europe. Until then, when interest in Japanese equities and bonds
flagged, it had largely sold Japanese financial products.
This forced it to compete directly with US and European securities houses to
sell European products, in which it had some disadvantages. Nomura had to
build up its expertise in selling equities, bonds and complex hybrids, and
re-think its sales strategy.
Nomura in Japan is primarily a retail operation which sells to a mass of
individual customers rather than the institutional funds that dominate the
European market. This means it has relied on what Mr Kane calls 'a strong
army of sales people' to distribute its mix of products through the
branches.
To compete in Europe, it had to offer sophisticated research in equities,
and gear itself to offer complex products such as warrants and derivatives.
These must be sold to funds, which are more influenced by the returns on
products than whether the salesman is locally-based.
This drove Mr Kane to the conclusion a year ago that Nomura would have to
change to reflect the shift in business. Sales people in different European
countries would have to be members of teams run from London, rather than
being controlled primarily by heads of businesses in Switzerland or France.
Instead of changing the structure immediately, he decided to phase it in
over a year, with the full switch taking place at the start of April.
'Rather than bringing things in quickly and finding problems later, we had a
long pretending period to make sure it worked smoothly,' he says.
One problem was to persuade those in European offices to accept the
authority of newly-appointed divisional heads in London. 'Some people were
very distressed at having to report for the first time to heads in London.
They thought there had been an invasion,' says Mr Kane.
A second difficulty was to get the heads of European offices to change their
roles. 'The president of Nomura France is still there, but his role is
dramatically changed,' says Mr Kane. He says that such country heads must
now concentrate on administration and playing an 'ambassadorial' role.
However, Mr Kane says the shift has brought an immediate improvement for
some of those based in smaller European offices: notably sales people who
were previously isolated. 'Some felt they had been left alone too much
before, and they have been made members of a larger group,' he says.
Prospects have also improved for senior European nationals in smaller
offices, whose promotion chances were limited under the previous structure
because the highest local grade was as country manager, and this role was,
in effect, reserved for a Japanese expatriate.
'Even if the top European kicked out his Japanese boss, he would still only
be in charge of 25 people,' says Mr Kane. He says that by breaking national
borders, the new structure allows easier promotion; he also believes that
Europeans will increasingly dominate the new Nomura International.
Nomura's European reform could be taken further. At the moment, it operates
in Europe through 10 legal entities subordinated to its Japanese parent
company. It has stuck to this legal structure for tax and regulatory
reasons, which means its debt must be guaranteed by Nomura Securities.
Mr Kane believes it could eventually form a separate European holding
company with its own capital base. He also believes that the reforms
undertaken in Europe could form a model for other businesses outside Japan,
as Nomura develops a distinctive way of operating overseas.
It might be logical for a distinctively European business to be headed by a
European, a point Mr Kane accepts. 'I am, unfortunately, Japanese, but that
has to change some time in the future,' he says. When that happens, the
inner change wrought at Nomura may become visible for outsiders.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles pay boost
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Courtaulds Textiles may have suffered a tough 1993, with particular problems
in continental Europe, but recession did not stretch as far as directors'
pay packets.
The company saw earnings per share fall 3 per cent last year and was forced
to issue a profits warning. This was reflected in the lack of
performance-related payments.
The salary of the highest-paid director, Mr Martin Taylor, the
recently-departed chief executive, rose Pounds 18,000 to Pounds 224,000
although this will not have added to the comfort of his last year in the hot
seat. His Pounds 42,000 performance bonus from 1992 was not repeated.
Mr Taylor, who left the company in December to become chief executive at
Barclays, received no renumeration for his role as chairman.
However, two other directors pushed their salaries through the Pounds
150,000 barrier.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Unit plans rights and restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit Group, the lossmaking USM-traded timber pallet manufacturer, has
announced moves to reduce its borrowings and finance a restructuring via a
subscription and rights issue.
Glenbank, a private company controlled by Mr J Wilton and Mr Harry Sproule,
is taking 26 per cent of the enlarged capital through subscription for 2.77m
shares at 24p apiece, raising Pounds 666,000 before expenses.
Mr Wilton and Mr Sproule will join the Unit board.
The rights issue of up to 2.47m shares, on a 5-for-11 basis, also at 24p,
will raise Pounds 592,000, conditional on the subscription taking place.
The measures will result in gearing falling from 129 per cent to 44 per
cent.
Unit anticipates pre-tax losses of not more than Pounds 1.64m for the 12
months to March 31 1994, of which Pounds 750,000 will cover closure and
reorganisation costs.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: M&amp;G accepts GKN's offer for Westland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G, one of the largest institutional shareholders in Westland Group,
yesterday said it was accepting GKN's revised takeover offer for the
helicopter manufacturer.
The institution said it did not want to remain as a minority shareholder
following the engineering group's hostile bid for Westland, in which it
holds 12 per cent.
M&amp;G's decision is expected to prompt other institutions to accept the 335p a
share offer. GKN has also offered a partial share alternative or 290p plus a
share of any compensation received from the Arab Organisation for
Industrialisation.
The AOI has been ordered to pay Westland Pounds 385m in damages over an
alleged breach of contract in the late 1970s.
Institutions which have yet to formally accept GKN's offer are understood to
favour the partial share alternative, worth 344 1/2 p on GKN's 584p share
price yesterday. They include Schroders, controlling 13.5 per cent of
Westland, and Royal Insurance with 4 per cent.
GKN, which expressed confidence that the institutions would accept its
offers, yesterday confirmed that it had invited shareholders to take part in
the second tranche of its Pounds 248m rights issue to fund the Westland
takeover.
It also said discussions were continuing between Sir David Lees, its
chairman, and Mr Alan Jones, his Westland counterpart, on the integration of
the helicopter company into GKN's defence division.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Jones will remain with the enlarged group
once the integration has been completed.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Savoy back in the black with Pounds 0.73m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Savoy Hotel yesterday announced a turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds
1.43m to profits of Pounds 725,000 for the year to December 31 but is
proposing to halve its dividend.
In 1992 Savoy, whose hotels include the Savoy, Claridge's and the Connaught,
paid a maintained dividend of 7p on its A shares and 3.5p on its B shares
because it believed recovery was on the way.
However, yesterday the group said this did not take place as quickly as
expected and business only picked up in the middle of September. Although
this improvement had been maintained in 1994, Mr Giles Shepard, managing
director, said the group thought it prudent to reduce the dividend to 3.5p
per A share and 1.7p per B share.
Earnings per A share were 1.8p, against losses of 1.3p, while earnings per B
share were 0.9p (0.6p losses).
Mr Shepard said occupancies at the group's hotels were currently running at
between 63 per cent and 65 per cent, compared with less than 60 per cent in
the first half of last year. He said average room rates last year were
Pounds 193 excluding VAT, compared with Pounds 186 in 1992. Room rates this
year were at about the same level as in 1993, he added.
Turnover rose by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 76.8m) with the second
half showing a 13 per cent rise compared with 3 per cent in the first half.
Operating costs rose by 6.2 per cent to Pounds 74.8m. Staff costs increased
by only 2.3 per cent. However, the cost of raw materials and consumables
increas-ed by 5 per cent. Savoy said this was partly because of the increase
of business in the second half.
Operating profits amounted to Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 57,000 losses). The
pre-tax result was struck after higher investment proceeds of Pounds 589,000
(Pounds 229,000) and reduced interest costs of Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 1.6m).

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: MAI sells insurance business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAI, the financial services, information and media group headed by Lord
Hollick, has sold the business of Safeguard Insurance to Hill House Hammond,
a subsidiary of Norwich Union, for about Pounds 6.4m cash.
HHH will take on about half Safeguard's 174 branches to add to its existing
network of 185 offices which are concentrated on market and small provincial
towns. It deals in a range of motor, household and general insurance.
It will interview all 900 or so Safeguard staff, but some job losses are
certain. The combined operation will probably total about 2,000 staff.
MAI will put the sale proceeds towards the cost of closing the other
branches. The net costs, together with the write-off of historic goodwill
totalling Pounds 18m, will be treated as an exceptional item in MAI's
accounts for the year to June 30 this year.
Safeguard lost Pounds 1m in the second half of last year, having been hit by
intense competition from direct telephone sales. It last made a profit in
1991. 'The sale represents a satisfactory exit for MAI from a lossmaking
business,' the company said.

<TEXT>
ACCBank, the state-run Irish bank which the government has said it intends
to privatise, reported a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds
11.2m (Pounds 10.8m) for the year to December 31.
Originally dedicated to the agricultural sector, the bank has in the past
six years diversified into the personal lending and small business sectors.
Net interest income expanded by 9.4 per cent to IPounds 37.1m in 1993, and
total assets rose by 8.3 per cent to IPounds 932m. Administrative costs were
up 9 per cent to IPounds 23.6m. Dealing profits of IPounds 1.6m gave an
important boost to the bottom line.
The bank reported a loan book of IPounds 574m, two thirds of which has a
maturity of more than five years. A further IPounds 218m was loaned to other
banks, 75 per cent on short-term deposits of less than three months.
Mr Dan McGing, chairman, pointed out that this marked the sixth successive
year of double-digit growth, although he acknowledged that the level of
performance would be difficult to maintain.
Total dividends are doubled to IPounds 1.53m, which go to the Irish
government as the 100 per cent shareholder.
Two years ago Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, said that the
government intended to dispose of the bank, but the present Fianna
Fail-Labour coalition appears to be procrastinating over whether to
privatise it or merge it into a larger entity with other financial
institutions from both the private and public sectors.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Smiths turns in Pounds 46m midway - Advance
achieved despite depressed conditions in aerospace market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smiths Industries reported a recovery in pre-tax profits from Pounds 40.3m
to Pounds 46m on turnover up by Pounds 23.2m to Pounds 351m in the six
months to January 29, in spite of depressed conditions for its aerospace
business.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said that the production phase
of several defence projects had been delayed and that the prospects for the
aerospace arm remained difficult.
But he declared himself 'optimistic' about the outlook for growth in group
profits and earnings per share.
Both the medical systems and industrial divisions reported higher profits,
partly due to acquisitions, and earnings per share rose from 9.2p to 10.4p.
The interim dividend rises 7 per cent to 4.6p.
Excluding a Pounds 3m exceptional loss in the first half of last year
pre-tax profits rose by 6 per cent, with about half the rise the result of
acquisitions. Mr Hurn said he was 'delighted' with the performance of
Vent-Axia, the fans and hand driers maker bought for Pounds 56m in December
1992.
Its inclusion increased profits from the industrial division to Pounds 11.7m
(Pounds 8.6m) on turnover of Pounds 84.7m (Pounds 68.4m).
Profits from aerospace edged up to Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 13.9m) on flat sales
of Pounds 174m. The aerospace workforce, which is down by 40 per cent from
its peak, was cut by another 600 in the period.
There were a total of 750 redundancies across the group in the first half
with costs, charged against profits, at a similar level to last year.
The shares rose 15p to 485p.
Smiths paid out Pounds 9m in deferred acquisition costs in the first half,
but its net cash still grew from Pounds 34m to Pounds 62m, before the recent
Dollars 32m (Pounds 21.9m) purchase of Tutco in the US. Mr Hurn said the
group was looking for further acquisitions.
COMMENT
As the aerospace recovery continues to recede, more of Smiths' staff are
shown the door. But the company believes that process is largely over,
convincing the more cautious observers that its aerospace profits have
bottomed in spite of the expected downturn in orders for the Boeing 737.
Although kit for the new 777 will kick in from next year, Smiths will not
know until September how much work it will get for the updated 737-700.
Given the heavily reduced cost-base, a reasonable upturn in workload should
bring a sharp upturn in profits. But until that happens Smiths' can only
look to some recovery from its industrial division, where margins are
already a healthy 14 per cent, and continued expansion from medical, where
underlying profits growth was between 6 and 8 per cent in the first half.
That should take profits to about Pounds 113m this year, but after a strong
run the shares look high enough on 19 times earnings.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Sims Food shares fall 21p on guarded
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sims Food Group fell 21p to 82p yesterday after the meat processor
and supplier warned that it had been unable to pass on seasonal raw material
price increases to UK retailers.
In December, the company announced first half losses of Pounds 1.3m, which
it blamed on high livestock prices and the devaluation of sterling. The
interim dividend was cut by a third.
It said yesterday that management accounts showed a small pre-tax profit for
the year to March 31 as a whole.
In addition to the pressure on gross margins due to raw material price
increases, Sims said volumes had also suffered. Demand was flat,
particularly in the case of beef where recent publicity about the BSE
disease had had an effect.
However, the company continues to trade profitably with the full benefits of
last year's restructuring now being felt.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Likely Pounds 40m tag for Hamleys -
Necessary to prove the Regent Street performance can be replicated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hamleys, which claims to be the finest, and is arguably the largest, toy
shop in the world, is to issue Pounds 20m worth of shares through a
placement and intermediaries offer which is expected to value the company at
about Pounds 40m. Its pathfinder prospectus was published yesterday.
The current management team has revitalised Hamleys since it joined in 1991,
increasing operating profits from Pounds 1m in 1991 to Pounds 3.6m in the
year to January 29 1994. Operating margins have more than doubled to 17 per
cent.
Some analysts argued that it would have to prove that it can replicate this
performance outside Regent Street - in new stores and franchise arrangements
 -to justify the management's claim to a premium stock market rating.
However, the issue is expected to come to the market on an historic p/e
ratio of less than 17 (excluding interest costs), compared with the retail
sector average of 19.
The company will raise about Pounds 12m from the flotation, which will pay
off the remainder of its long-term debt. Some Pounds 8m of shares will be
sold by existing shareholders, and after the flotation the management will
own about 9 per cent.
Hamleys was founded in 1760, and by 1990 it had passed through the hands of
Lines Toys, Burtons, Harris Queensway and a 1989 US-led management buy-in,
before the current management arrived.
Mr Howard Dyer, chairman, and Mr Stephen Woodbridge, managing director -
both senior members of the Williams Holdings management team - have
transformed its operating performance, but by January 1993 the company had
only returned to its 1986 profit levels.
Mr Dyer argues that an anticipated pick-up in tourism to the UK should
improve sales, since about 50 per cent of customers are tourists.
In addition, improving economic conditions should encourage greater spending
from the 5m customers that enter the store each year, of whom only 30 per
cent buy something.
The management is also pushing to capitalise on the Hamleys name and its
retailing skills. It has opened outlets in Covent Garden and Heathrow's
Terminal 4, and will open another at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel.
Mr Dyer said Hamleys would not try to replicate the disastrous foray into
high street toy stores, instigated under Harris Queensway. New stores are
small, focused, and aimed at tourists.
Hamleys will increase own-brand product sales, which currently account for
about 3 per cent of sales, in order to further develop its reputation.
It has also started operating toy concessions for other retailers, signing
an agreement to manage toy departments for 18 House of Fraser stores, and
supplying a further six.
The pricing of the issue will be announced on April 26, and dealing is
expected to start on May 6. The lead sponsors are JO Hambro Magan and
Cazenove.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Barry Wehmiller suffers 49% fall to Pounds
1.65m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Barry Wehmiller International fell 6p to 162p yesterday after the
packaging equipment manufacturer reported a 49 per cent decline in half-year
profits.
At the pre-tax level they fell from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 1.65m in the six
months to January 31 as its businesses suffered under the impact of intense
price competition and shrinking demand.
Mr Michael Windsor, chairman, said: 'First order intake for several of our
businesses, particularly those dependent upon continental Europe and the UK
dairy industry, was unusually low.'
The decline was offset by increased orders at a number of subsidiaries -
including BWI Manesty, its coating operator - and new sales in east Asia and
Latin America.
Contributions from these operations helped restrict the fall in group
turnover to Pounds 37.3m (Pounds 38.6m).
Prospects in such markets encouraged the board to declare an unchanged
interim dividend of 2.4p, even though earnings per share fell by more than
half to 2.4p (5p).
The decision reflected the group's optimism that it would reverse the drop
in orders during the second half.
Mr Windsor said the company had seen demand increase significantly in recent
months, and orders were now 20 per cent ahead of 1993's year-end levels.
'We are looking for a significant recovery in the second half of this year
and believe that we will enter the next year with an enhanced order book, a
clear direction for our business and a strong balance sheet to support
further development.'

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: NM Smaller Australian
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A conversion share issue by NM Smaller Australian Companies Trust has raised
Pounds 27.9m through a placing and intermediaries offer, approximately
doubling the size of the trust, which was launched in December.
However, like most investment trust issues in the last few weeks, the
outcome fell short of the target size, set at Pounds 35m.
Another conversion issue, from Fleming European Fledgeling Investment Trust,
has raised Pounds 14.7m, well below its target of about Pounds 50m. Of the
new money, Pounds 10.5m came from an institutional placing, and Pounds 4.2m
from a public offer.

British Land is acquiring Barwell Business Park in Chessington, Surrey, for
a total Pounds 19.2m and the investment will be offered to the BL Quantum
Property Fund, the joint venture that British Land set up with Mr George
Soros' Quantum Fund last summer.
The consideration is to be satisfied by some Pounds 2m cash and the balance
by the issue of 4.1m new British Land ordinary shares at 420p each.
The 26-acre park comprises 343,000 sq ft of new industrial and warehouse
buildings and a further 44,000 sq ft currently occupied by the Property
Service Agency. The rent roll is about Pounds 2.8m a year and the average
lease length is 19 years.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: New look Nurdin &amp; Peacock 7% ahead at
Pounds 32m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry operator, yesterday announced a 6.5 per
cent increase to Pounds 32.1m in 1993 pre-tax profits.
It also boasted that its first discount warehouse shopping club had drawn
almost 30,000 members in less than a month of trading.
Compared to the traditional cash and carry, 'Cargo Club is a much sexier
proposition,' said Mr David Poole, Nurdin &amp; Peacock's chief executive.
The programme had proved to be extremely successful so far, with membership
increasing at the rate of 1,000 a month.
N&amp;P planned to open a further two warehouse clubs before the end of the
year.
The group also announced it was buying 10 cash and carry outlets in the
north of England. N&amp;P is paying Pounds 21.9m for M6, previously owned by
Ireland's Fitzwilton group, where Mr Tony O'Reilly is chairman.
Mr Nigel Hall, N&amp;P's finance director, said the acquisition was likely to
result in some restructuring costs, which would depress profits. However, it
was too early to quantify the levels of spending needed.
The benefits of the acquisition were expected to come through next year,
when increased buying power and cost reduction began to feed through. N&amp;P
would also benefit from a full year's inclusion of sales against eight
months this year.
For the year to December 31 sales fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn, while
like-for-like sales were down 6.6 per cent. Operating profits rose by 7 per
cent to Pounds 30m due to marketing campaigns and strict cost cutting.
The rise was held back by a series of charges which came to Pounds 5.3m.
The final dividend is increased from 4.16p to 4.44p, for a total 6 per cent
higher at 6.5p. Earnings rose 4 per cent to 17.6p per share.
COMMENT
Fair dues to Nurdin &amp; Peacock's management for squeezing out this advance
after the exceptional costs and falling sales. Praise also for drawing in
new customers as the independent sector comes under pressure. Yet, looking
forward, there seems to be a big question mark over the latest acquisition.
Without knowing the true scale of the write-offs and provisions, it is
almost impossible to judge whether N&amp;P is actually getting a good deal.
Forecasts of Pounds 32.9m pre-tax before exceptionals leave little doubt
that an advance will be a struggle this year. The picture might become a
little clearer at the interim stage.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: RTZ chief's remuneration rises by 13% to
Pounds 589,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining
group, received a 13 per cent increase in his total remuneration last year
to Pounds 588,681, according to the company's annual report.
The increase follows a rise in 1992 to Pounds 520,316.
Excluding bonus and benefits in kind, his remuner- ation for 1993 went up by
8.8 per cent to Pounds 495,000 (Pounds 455,000) following an 11.5 per cent
increase in 1992.
The total remuneration paid to RTZ's executive directors for 1993 went up by
10 per cent, from Pounds 1.87m to just over Pounds 2m. In 1992, the
executive directors received a 5.35 per cent increase.
Attributable earnings for 1993 improved by 20 per cent to Pounds 287m and
the dividend for the year is to be increased by 5 per cent to 20.5p.
In their joint statement, Sir Derek and Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive,
point out that in spite of the excep- tional severity of the fall in metal
prices, the average annual total return on RTZ shares - that is growth in
the share price coupled with dividends paid - over the past five years has
been 20.7 per cent, com- pared with the 18.1 per cent average annual total
return on the FT-SE-A All-Share Index.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Transamerica sells its stake in Sedgwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Transamerica Holdings, the US-based financial services holding company,
yesterday disposed of its 21 per cent stake in Sedgwick Group in a deal
valued at about Pounds 220m.
The shares were offered for sale at 193p to European investors yesterday
morning in an underwritten offering by Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg. On
Tuesday, the shares had closed at 213p.
The 30.7m shares offered for sale were A Ordinary Shares in Sedgwick, which
carry no voting rights. In order for the transaction to be completed,
Sedgwick's board must vote to convert the shares into 114.5m ordinary shares
which carry the same dividend and other rights, but have voting rights as
well.
Sedgwick's board is set to meet to approve the conversion within the next
few days, and it is expected that settlement of the share purchase will
occur on the Stock Exchange's May 3 settlement date.
Two Transamerica directors serve as non-executive directors on the Sedgwick
board. Mr Jeremy Pinchin, Sedgwick company secretary, said it is not
intended that the two will resign from the board in the near future.
An official at Morgan Stanley said the shares were placed with a variety of
institutional investors, more than half of them in the UK. US securities
laws classified the shares as a restricted offering, barring them from being
offered publicly in the US.
Transamerica said it was disposing of the shares in line with its plans to
withdraw completely from the property and casualty insurance businesses. It
acquired them in 1985, when Sedgwick purchased Fred S James, its US-based
insurance brokerage subsidiary.
In that paper-based transaction, which would have given Transamerica voting
rights over 40 per cent of Sedgwick's equity and triggered a requirement to
make a bid for the full company, Sedgwick elected to create a special class
of non-voting share.
In 1991, Transamerica reduced that stake to about 25 per cent, and it has
since been slightly diluted by a Sedgwick rights offer last autumn.
Sedgwick's shares have risen significantly since that offering, which valued
them at about 165p.
Last night they closed 15p lower at 198p.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Secure Trust, the financial services group, is buying Aitken Hume Bank for
up to Pounds 10.5m, and partly financing the purchase with a placing of new
shares to raise Pounds 2.5m.
Secure will pay Pounds 3.2m at completion, and a further Pounds 1.3m within
the next year. The rest will be payable depending on the extent of recovery
of certain loans made by the bank.
AHB will be renamed Arbuthnot Latham and play a critical role in Secure's
plans to reorganise its UK banking operations.
The existing 30 staff in the sole office in London will be maintained.
It is intended the organisation will give Secure a focus for providing
banking services to professional employees and people who own and manage
small businesses.
Secure's existing banking business, the People's Bank, which is based in
Bradford and focuses more on skilled manual workers, was acquired last year
and as part of the reorganisation will become part of Secure Trust Bank.
Mr Henry Angest, Secure's chairman and chief executive, is looking to the
group's banking activities to provide much of its future growth.
Pre-tax profits increased by 4 per cent to Pounds 7.61m in 1993.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce and Jaguar progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the luxury car subsidiary of Vickers, the UK
engineering group, increased its worldwide retail sales by 9.3 per cent in
the first three months of the year.
Sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars rose from 321 to 351 over the period,
helped by a surge in registrations in the UK.
Jaguar, the UK luxury car subsidiary of Ford of the US, is also enjoying
improving fortunes with a 12 per cent increase in worldwide sales in the
first quarter to 7,073.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, which managed to break even last year following
drastic restructuring and two years of heavy losses, appears to have halted
the erosion of its sales suffered in 1991 and 1992.
Worldwide retail sales stabilised last year at 1,360, compared with 1,378 in
1992. Sales reached a record 3,333 in 1990.
The higher sales in the first quarter this year were due chiefly to a 68 per
cent rise in registrations in the UK from 85 to 143.
Jaguar's sales were also boosted by rising demand in the UK but unlike
Rolls-Royce, it is sharing in the strong growth of car sales in the US, its
single largest market worldwide. Registrations in the UK rose by 25 per cent
in the first three months to 2,029, while sales in the US increased by 18
per cent to 3,016.

FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Further shots in Regina war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More shots were fired yesterday in the battle for control of Regina, the
USM-quoted royal jelly group. The current management has written a second
letter to shareholders urging them to vote against changes proposed by Mr
Shiraz Malik-Noor, the largest shareholder.
'Since Mr Malik-Noor took control of Regina, sales have plummeted by 60 per
cent', wrote Mr Paul Geoghegan, the chairman. 'Regina cannot afford an
expensive Knightsbridge office, it cannot afford costly mistakes like polo
sponsorship, it cannot afford any more extraordinary meetings, and in your
board's view it can no longer afford Mr Malik-Noor.'
However, the fate of Mr Geoghegan is in the balance. An EGM on April 27 will
vote on Mr Malik-Noor's reinstatement as chairman and the appointment of two
associates to the board. This would give him control.
Mr Geoghegan's second letter is another attack on Mr Malik-Noor's
performance. He also condemned Mr Malik-Noor's salary and the fact that
loans from connected companies were made to Regina at 5 per cent above base
rate.
Mr Malik-Noor is drafting his own response to shareholders.

FT  14 APR 94 / Tenneco may spin off JI Case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tenneco, the Texas-based industrial company, is considering spinning off its
JI Case division, the Wisconsin-based subsidiary that is a leading
manufacturer of farm and construction equipment worldwide.
Mr John Stark, editor of a Chicago-based newsletter that follows the heavy
equipment industry, believes Tenneco will announce plans for a Case spin off
this month. 'We understand the announcement could come as early as next
week,' he added.
Mr Thomas Hayes, Tenneco spokesman, said the company could not comment on
rumours about possible strategic actions.
Few analysts believe Tenneco could find an outright buyer for JI Case,
citing a contraction worldwide in heavy equipment. However, a spin-off of
Case stock to Tenneco shareholders, with majority interest still held by
Tenneco, would follow successful spin-offs last year by Dresser Industries,
the energy resources equipment group, and Detroit Diesel.
However, earlier this year, Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's president, said he would
not overlook any option that would enhance shareholder value.
Talk of a potential spin-off intensified this month, when Tenneco appointed
Mr Jean-Pierre Rosso, a former Honeywell executive, as Case's president.
'The appointment (of Mr Rosso) showed Case is becoming more serious about
dealing with losses in Europe,' said Mr Frank Manfredi, editor of
Illinois-based Machinery Outlook. 'Rosso looks good to the financial
community.'
Tenneco has been carrying out a big restructuring and cost-cutting effort
for two years, with its JI Case division delivering the most remarkable
turnround. Case last year reversed a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) 1992 loss,
reporting operating income of Dollars 82m.
While sales were down slightly at Dollars 3.7bn, analysts say a slight
upturn in demand for construction equipment and the company's return to
profitability make it ripe for a spin-off.
'Case is debt-free and has no underfunded pension liabilities,' said Mr
Stark, 'This would be an ideal time to spin them off.'

FT  14 APR 94 / RMC rises to Pounds 178m with German help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong performance in Germany, Europe's busiest construction market,
helped lift pre-tax profits at RMC Group, the world's largest concrete
producer, by nearly 7 per cent from Pounds 166.4m to Pounds 177.8m.
Mergers and joint ventures involving RMC's growing German operations have
brought substantial tax advantages, reducing the tax charge from almost 36
per cent in 1992 to just under 26 per cent last year.
As a result, earnings per share rose more than a quarter from 31.2p to
39.4p. The final dividend is going up from 13.4p to 14.4p, raising the total
payment by 5 per cent to 21p.
The better than expected figures sent the shares up from 950p to 966p.
The German construction market continues to steam ahead, with housebuilding
and renovation in the former east Germany more than offsetting reductions in
infrastructure investment and commercial building in the west.
RMC's experience echoed that of other UK building companies, including
Redland, the materials group, which last year increased pre-tax profits by
40 per cent to Pounds 279m. Redland earned more from its eastern German roof
tile operations than it did in the whole of the UK.
RMC's German profits last year rose almost 17 per cent to Pounds 140.6m on a
10 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 1.49bn.
German profits were more than four times UK profits, which last year more
than trebled from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 34m helped by a recovery in
housebuilding, cost cuts and slightly firmer prices for sand and gravel,
ready-mixed concrete and coated stone. The group's DIY and builders'
merchants businesses also performed well.
The group said further progress was expected in the UK this year as the
construction market continued to pick up. The main engine for profits,
however, was likely to remain Germany which last year accounted for 44 per
cent of group turnover and 67 per cent of pre-interest profits.
Mr Derek Jenkins, finance director, said total housing starts in western
Germany were forecast to rise to 550,000 this year, compared with 198,000 in
the UK. Cement sales from RMC's Berlin works were forecast to rise to 1.8m
tonnes from 1.5m tonnes.
By the end of this year, RMC would have invested Pounds 500m in eastern
Germany since the Berlin Wall was dismantled, said Mr Jenkins. The group had
also seen a strong performance in Israel and improvement in the US.

FT  14 APR 94 / Ask my bank, said Schneider, before the fall: David Waller
tells how one of Germany's property empires has come close to collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In February Mr Jurgen Schneider, the entrepreneur whose property empire is
on the verge of collapse, granted an interview in which he sought to calm
fears about the finances of the group bearing his name.
'My projects are sound and profitable,' he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine
newspaper, bragging that he had never sold a property at a loss. If anybody
had doubts about this, they should ask his bank, he said defiantly.
Today 'his' bank - he did not name the institution but it is probably
Deutsche Bank which is owed more than DM1bn - will meet more than 40 other
creditors to work out whether the group has a future. With debts estimated
at DM9bn (Pounds 3.6bn), his ventures have turned out to be far from 'sound
and profitable'.
Mr Schneider, 59, a self-made man with a passion for restoring old
buildings, will not be at the meeting. He and his wife disappeared on
Friday, leaving fellow board members with a fax saying that he had been
advised by doctors to play no further part in the group's affairs. He has
not been heard of since.
A controversial figure, with a reputation for meanness in paying suppliers,
Mr Schneider was rumoured yesterday to be in Switzerland. Wherever he is,
the repercussions of his disappearance will be profound for the German
business community.
Still reeling from the near collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the mining,
metals and industrial group, bankers and businessmen are facing the
implosion of one of Germany's largest privately owned property empires. The
group has more than 80 large properties in Germany alone and employs more
than 2,000.
The affair signals the end of Germany's immunity to the property crashes
which have been a feature of business life in other leading economies. When
German property developers eyed the problems of prominent foreign property
groups, there was tendency to think that 'this sort of think can't happen
here'. The Schneider case has punctured that complacency.
'This is absolutely typical for this stage of a recession, however untypical
for Germany,' commented Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist at the
International Bank of Japan's German arm. 'Schneider was always very
aggressive and very speculative, and now the bubble has burst.'
In the absence of concrete information, it is difficult to say exactly what
has happened. But property experts said yesterday that it appeared to be a
classic case of over-expansion, financed by gullible banks. 'For two years
we've been asking ourselves: how on earth does he do it?' said one
developer. 'His organisation has always paid 20 to 30 per cent over the
odds. His valuations always seemed overly optimistic and he never seemed to
sell anything. It does not surprise me that it has come to this.'
Critics say that it is only by overpaying that he has managed to assemble
his portfolio of properties. Most of these are prestigious commercial
developments in the heart of German cities. Schneider owns the Bernheimer
Palace in Munich, the Hotel Rose in Wiesbaden, and important retail sites in
Frankfurt, Berlin and Leipzig. The group's headquarters is itself a castle,
in Konigstein near Frankfurt.
The desirability of many of the properties is likely to limit the immediate
impact of Schneider's problems on the German property market. Consultants
said there would be buyers for most of the portfolio if the group were to be
liquidated.
But the affair will hit German banks, already suffering mounting bad debts
from their exposure to industrial companies. Analysts suggest that many of
the bigger banks will have already provided for their exposure to Schneider
in their 1993 figures. Shares in Deutsche Bank and other leading German
banks nevertheless dropped sharply this week, reflecting fears about a sharp
deterioration in the quality of their loan books.
Over time, the impact on bankers' confidence is likely to depress the German
property market, where rental income has fallen substantially from 1991-92
highs. More immediate will be the impact on the numerous small businesses
owed money by the group, a fact recognised by Chancellor Helmut Kohl
yesterday when he urged banks to be mindful of their responsibility to the
community. Trade creditors are believed to be owed DM3bn of the debt total.
In Leipzig alone, where Schneider owns street after street of buildings in
the historic city centre, some 3,000 construction jobs are said to be at
risk.
As in the Metallgesellschaft affair, it will be asked: how could it happen?
Probably Mr Schneider is the only one with the full answer. In his absence,
the question will be directed at the Frankfurt banking community which has
once again been surprised by the dire problems of a company on its very
doorstep.

FT  14 APR 94 / OFT investigates supply of Japanese electrical goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading is investigating the trading practices of at
least six Japanese electrical goods manufacturers following complaints that
they are refusing to supply discount warehouse clubs.
Complaints have been received from Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry
retailer which opened a warehouse club last month, and CostCo of the US.
CostCo last year launched the concept in Britain of a discount shopping club
which charges membership fees. The US company complained to the OFT in
December that electrical goods manufacturers refused to supply products.
Only N&amp;P, however, has specified the manufacturers it alleges are proving
obstructive. These are Aiwa, JVC, Panasonic, Sanyo, Sony and Toshiba.
'Refusal to supply is something we take a very serious view on,' the OFT
said. 'If a retailer cannot get a certain product, the market is not working
competitively and prices might be artificially high.'
N&amp;P has claimed it is forced to buy electrical goods such as televisions
from the so-called 'grey market' - distributors who supply independent
retailers. This means it has to pay 3-5 per cent more for its products, says
Mr David Poole, chief executive.
Mr Poole criticised the manufacturers while announcing N&amp;P's annual results,
implying they sought to keep prices high. If warehouse clubs sold such goods
at the normal discounts, 'prices would come down in all the other shops,' he
said. N&amp;P claims it sells brand-name televisions for up Pounds 150 less than
high street outlets.
Sony yesterday denied that it had refused to supply N&amp;P's warehouse clubs.
'We are currently in the middle of discussion with them,' the company said.
'We have an open mind and have not said no.'
Mr Poole said US warehouse clubs were believed to have experienced similar
difficulties.

FT  14 APR 94 / Lasmo rights to cut debt and fund new fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo, the loss-making oil exploration and production company, yesterday
announced a Pounds 219m rights issue to reduce its Pounds 794m debt and fund
low-cost oil and gas fields.
The company, regarded as the most vulnerable in the exploration and
production sector to low oil prices, said the proceeds would cut gearing
from 75 to 30 per cent and enable it to develop fields in Liverpool Bay, the
North Sea and Pakistan.
Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, predicted that exploration funded by the
issue - on a 2-for-7 basis at 105p a share - would help lift oil and gas
production by 25 per cent to 210,000 barrels a day by the late 1990s.
Although Lasmo had strong operating cashflow, he said its cost base rendered
it unprofitable at current oil prices. Prices of Dollars 13-Dollars 14 a
barrel last year led to losses attributable to shareholders, before
exceptional charges, of Pounds 59m.
Although the company has sold assets worth more than Pounds 1bn in the past
two years, Mr Darby said further large disposals were unlikely. Instead, he
signalled a strategy dominated by cost-cutting and restructuring. Such moves
have already seen an 18 per cent cut in unit operating costs to Pounds 4.10
a barrel and a 20 per cent cut in staff to 327.
The change of emphasis follows a boardroom clear-out at Lasmo, which began
last February with the removal of Mr Chris Greentree as chief executive. Mr
Michael Pavia, finance director, resigned late last year and Lord Rees,
non-executive chairman, is due to stand down next month.
'We're no longer driven by volume and production but by the need to improve
our financial performance,' Mr Darby said. His stance was echoed by Mr
Norman Davidson Kelly, director for corporate development, who added: 'We
had a structure of management which was inadequate in a low oil price
environment.'
They were speaking before flying to New York last night to brief US
institutions, which are expected to take up to 25 per cent of the rights
issue. The share offer is underwritten by Schroders and investors have until
May 6 to register acceptances.
Lasmo's shares fell 1p to 128p yesterday.

FT  14 APR 94 / Hamas vows more attacks in Israel after bus bomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel braced itself for a surge of violence on Independence Day today after
the Hamas Islamic resistance movement bombed a bus in northern Israel
yesterday and vowed to turn the day's celebrations into 'hell' and make
'Zionists and settlers cry blood on their dead'.
Six people were killed and 30 wounded in the bomb attack on a crowded bus in
the town of Hadera. Many of the wounded were soldiers - the attack came
during Memorial Day for the country's forces killed in Arab-Israeli wars.
Police and witnesses at Hadera said the bomb exploded in the hands of the
Palestinian attacker as he approached the bus. The attacker was among the
dead.
The assault in the heart of Israel was the second in a week by Hamas, which
is opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and has vowed to make five
attacks to avenge the massacre of 29 Palestinians by a Jewish settler in a
Hebron mosque on February 25.
The bus bombing also coincided with a missed deadline last night for Israeli
military withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank town of
Jericho. Rightwing religious parties called immediately for the cancellation
of peace talks and the resignation of the government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin.
However, Mr Rabin, who called the attack a 'despicable murder', said he was
determined not to allow Islamic militants to wreck the fragile peace
process.
'I am convinced the only answer to these murderers is not to allow them to
succeed in their evil plot, which beyond the murder of Israelis is the
murder of peace,' he said.
In Strasbourg, Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman,
said the killing 'strikes at the heart of the peace process'.
But the PLO leader also launched a bitter attack on Israel, which he said
had thwarted the talks by 'mass killings, detention, imposing curfews and
isolating towns'.
By delaying implementation of the peace process, he said, Israel 'causes
these catastrophes because it gives the extremists the possibility to have a
good reason to act'.
In a letter to President Bill Clinton, however, Mr Arafat reiterated that he
'regretted and strongly rejected such actions because they are directed
against innocent people. . . .'
Although the letter did not expressly condemn either of the recent bomb
attacks, the US welcomed it as a step forward.

FT  14 APR 94 / DSS resists identity card scheme for benefit claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, ROLAND RUDD and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Social Security is fiercely resisting a recommendation
from the government's efficiency unit for the introduction of an identity
card system which it is claimed could prevent fraud costing the department
hundreds of millions of pounds a year.
Senior government officials said yesterday that the unit, under Sir Peter
Levene, the prime minister's adviser on efficiency, is urging that a pilot
scheme be launched involving claimants in one small town being issued with
plastic identity cards.
The recommendation is based on a report, Security, Fraud and Benefit
Expenditure, recently completed by a DSS team.
However, the government is unlikely to approve the pilot scheme, officials
said yesterday. 'They are afraid of being embarrassed if anything goes wrong
with the scheme,' one official said.
An identity card system would probably involve benefit claimants being
issued with cards which store encoded data on the shape of their hands. The
cards would be 'read' by electronic scans each time they collected benefit.
Although the error rate on such scans is small, ministers fear that a huge
political row would be caused if anyone was wrongly denied benefit.
The efficiency unit had expected its recommendation would be supported by Mr
Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, and by Mr Michael Portillo,
chief secretary to the Treasury, because of the potentially significant
savings.
'A system of identity cards could save the government hundreds of millions
each year lost in fraud on the Pounds 80bn social security budget,' one
official said.
However, the official complained that both ministers were 'dragging their
feet'. Some senior DSS officials are also hostile to the identity card
scheme.
While both the DSS and the Treasury are publicly committed to what another
official called 'a wait and see approach' to identity cards, ministers say
privately that the difficulties associated with introducing them are likely
to prove intractable.
One senior DSS official said: 'Ministers will obviously read the report from
the efficiency unit with interest, but anyone who thinks it is a panacea to
their problems is misguided.'
The efficiency unit is particularly disappointed with the government
response because it believed it had persuaded Mr John Major, the prime
minister, that the civil liberties arguments against carrying identity cards
were unconvincing.

FT  14 APR 94 / Government signals halt to pre-privatisation pit closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday signalled a halt to pre-privatisation pit closures
as it unveiled details of the five British Coal regions it is offering for
sale to the private sector.
It said it expected to complete the sale of the regions, comprising 16 deep
mines and 32 open cast sites, by the end of the year.
British Coal confirmed yesterday that it is to close Kiveton colliery in
South Yorkshire in the autumn.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said it was a 'fair assumption' no other pits
would be closed before the industry is privatised, other than Tower in south
Wales, whose closure British Coal announced recently, and Kiveton.
In addition to the five packages, the government is to offer for sale on a
stand-alone basis seven pits which are being closed, including Kiveton and
Tower. Mr Eggar said up to 32 pits could be operating under private sector
ownership next year.
This is because up to nine other mines are being leased out under different
arrangements. 'Not so long ago people were talking about the industry being
left with 10 pits so there has been quite a change,' said Mr Eggar.
His comments were viewed as optimistic within the industry, since it is
unlikely that many of the stand-alone pits being offered for sale will be
bought.
N M Rothschild, the merchant bank advising the government, is to mail the
glossy 24-page document outlining the five packages to around 100 companies,
including 30 or 40 overseas.
Companies interested in buying one or more of the packages have until May 25
to qualify to take part in the sales process. This will cost them Pounds
15,000 for each region and Pounds 5,000 for each stand-alone mine and will
entitle them to confidential information to inform their bids.
Mr Eggar said it was impossible to say how much the packages would be worth.
One reason for that is that questions surrounding the liabilities,
particularly arising from subsidence, have yet to be resolved. Mr Eggar said
they would be defined in time for a detailed information memorandum to be
sent out to serious bidders in June.
Prospective bidders will also need to take a view on the possibility of
future closures which seem highly likely in the next few years.
Yesterday's 'preliminary memorandum' details showed that the 16 deep mines
and 32 opencast sites being offered for sale in the five regions produced
41m tonnes last year.

Yesterday's glossy brochure does not make British Coal any easier to value.
The carve-up into five regional companies will go ahead as expected. The two
regions which contain most deep-shaft pits have been allocated the lion's
share of contracts with power generators. Three years of guaranteed cash
flow under these contracts should make up for higher operating costs
relative to the predominantly open-cast regions. The apportionment of
environmental and other liabilities between public and private sectors has
also been clarified. It is a relief that the regional companies will be
ring-fenced from subsidence claims caused by mining which took place before
privatisation.
Until the scale of potential liabilities is clear, though, even rough
valuations are difficult. This information will be available only once
potential bidders have convinced the government of their credentials and
paid the requisite fee. Environmental risks, such as water pollution by
deep-mined pits, are a particular worry. British Coal has always shouldered
such risks itself. Whether insurance companies will be prepared to extend
sufficient cover, and at what price, remains an open question.
Either way, the ability of private sector companies to manage such
liabilities will be almost as important as their skill in getting coal out
of the ground. In the autumn, the government must decide whether any high
bids reflect the bidders' willingness to accept an unusually low rate of
return or an overly-optimistic assessment of the risks.

<TEXT>
RMC has become a byword for reliability in the building materials sector.
Its 1993 results show why. Despite suffering badly in France, California and
Spain, RMC still lifted pre-tax profits 7 per cent. Good husbandry ensured
its earnings grew even faster, climbing 26 per cent. Unlike Redland, RMC has
demonstrated an old-fashioned aversion to issuing paper during the
recession, protecting its earnings line. Moreover, RMC's tax rate has
dropped from almost 36 per cent to 26 per cent as it has reaped the benefits
of investment incentives in east Germany and started utilising accumulated
tax losses at its merged German businesses. RMC is now in the happy position
that the higher its German profits climb, the lower its group tax rate
falls. Given that the German construction sector is still riding the
unification wave and accounts for two-thirds of group profits, it becomes
easy to understand RMC's attractions.
The problem is that like most building material stocks, RMC's shares already
anticipate the good news. RMC's ability to deliver on its latent promise
should prove more certain than most. But the spread of its operations may
ensure its profits rebound is slower than that on offer elsewhere.
Shareholders will be amply rewarded if RMC really can achieve the 25 per
cent target return on its Pounds 500m investment in east Germany. But that
will take time and there is a threat that the slackening of demand in
western Germany and cheap imports from eastern Europe may yet make life
trickier in the meantime.

There was never any prize in guessing who argued for an interest rate cut at
February's meeting between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of
England. What is surprising is the candour with which the disagreement is
laid bare in the newly published minutes of the meeting. The reminder that
the authorities were not speaking with one voice sent a brief frisson
through the exchange market yesterday afternoon. Presumably fear of
publicity means there will be fewer such disagreements in future.
The Bank of England's hand ought thus to have been strengthened. Its
authority has already been increased through its quarterly inflation report
and, to a lesser degree, by its freedom to decide on the timing of rate
changes. Having disagreed with the Bank on rates in February, it would be
harder for the chancellor to do so again in the summer. Similarly, it will
be more difficult for him to resist pressure from the Bank for higher
interest rates as the cycle turns.
But it would be rash to exaggerate the impact in practice. The long time lag
between the meetings and publication of the minutes means the markets, which
are quite good at detecting politically-inspired rate changes anyway, will
usually have moved on by the time all is revealed. Final authority for
policy still rests with the chancellor. Mr Clarke pushed through a rate cut
in February, albeit smaller than he originally wanted. Doubtless he would do
so again if the political advantages outweighed the costs.

FT  14 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Lasmo drills for cash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo's rights issue had been telegraphed to the market with all the skill
of an amateur fighter's punch. As well as being obvious, the issue's deep
discount speaks volumes about how hard it must have been to get away and how
badly the company needs the money. A sense of urgency is also implied by the
indecently short three-week gap between passing the dividend and demanding
money from shareholders. On the surface, Lasmo's interest cover and gearing
looked sustainable, but the demands of developing fields will soon prove a
heavy drain on cash. It is hard to resist the idea that banks required more
comfort before supporting the management's expensive plans.
There is also a nasty feeling that investors are paying for management
mistakes. Lasmo has proved an effective machine for melting down shareholder
value in recent years, and institutions must have been reluctant to feed in
more raw material. Presumably the discount will encourage most to stump up.
Enthusiastic US holders may also come in provided that the novelty of a
rights issue in New York does not deter them.
The company is even trying self-help by cutting its costs. Yet it is not the
operator of much of its production and there is a limited degree to which it
is master of its own destiny. Lasmo may be a call option on the crude oil
price whose expiry date has just been extended, but the company still needs
oil consistently above Dollars 16 a barrel to make money. If that had been
the bet investors wanted, they might have got the same thing a good deal
cheaper on the commodity exchanges.

FT  14 APR 94 / Minutiae mask the big picture: Violence and symbolic
wrangles threaten to undermine the Middle East peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After more than half a century of bloodshed in the Middle East, a new
beginning could have been celebrated yesterday. Israel was due to complete
its military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho to
make way for Palestinian self-rule.
Instead, Israel missed the deadline and Hamas, the extremist Islamic
movement opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, bombed a crowded
commuter bus deep in Israel. The bombing, which left five Israelis dead, was
the second attack in a week - another reminder of the escalating violence by
both sides which threatens to explode the fragile peace process.
On the Israeli side, attacks by settlers and the heavy-handed use of force
by soldiers continues. In the occupied West Bank, Israelis shot dead two
Palestinians - including a pregnant teenager - on Tuesday, imposed a rigid
curfew on the town of Ramallah and blasted a house with anti-tank missiles,
later destroying it with a bulldozer.
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
bitterly criticised Israel yesterday, saying it had thwarted peace talks,
with its 'policy of mass killings, detention, imposing curfews and isolating
towns . . . supporting and encouraging the fanatic settlers to continue
practising the most horrible acts of aggression'.
Just seven months since the peace agreement was sealed on the White House
lawn with a reluctant handshake between Mr Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, concerns are growing that the understanding is so flawed that
it has little chance of ending the conflict.
Months of tortuous delays in negotiations and bitter wrangling over details,
such as where to position the Palestinian flag at border crossings, has
created deep scepticism on both sides.
For many observers the problem lies with the agreement itself - the
Declaration of Principles. It creates a five-year interim period of
Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank, and shelves sensitive
issues such as the creation of a Palestinian state, control of Jerusalem and
the right of Palestinian refugees to return. Later talks are scheduled to
address the question of a permanent solution for the Palestinians' political
aspirations - one of several grey areas open to interpretation and
negotiation.
The greyest area is the status of the Israeli settlements in the occupied
territories, which are to remain untouched during the interim period. Mr
Rabin shied away from the tough decision to begin evacuating the 120,000
settlers. The consequence was that weeks have been spent discussing the
complex security arrangements necessary to protect the remaining settlers.
But leaving these people, some of whom are religious ideologues, in the
thick of the Arab population of 1.9m has proved a recipe for violence, as
demonstrated by the February 25 Hebron Mosque massacre of 29 Palestinians by
one settler.
'The settlements are a self-destruct mechanism in the peace process,' said
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent Palestinian who has resigned from the
negotiating team. 'They cause friction, are a blatant injustice to
Palestinians, fragment Palestinian land and prevent the emergence of a
geographically contiguous Palestinian entity. Leaving the settlements
untouched is like putting a flame next to a powder keg and saying:
'Coexist.' '
Mrs Ashrawi claims that Israel has imposed rigid security requirements on
the PLO, and denied the Palestinians the political sovereignty they expected
the peace process to deliver. She wants the declaration renegotiated and
says Mr Arafat must now consider suspending the peace talks if he is to
maintain his credibility with the increasingly disaffected Palestinian
people.
Many Israelis also believe the settlement issue must be faced sooner rather
than later. Mr Joseph Alpher, director of the Jaffe Centre for Strategic
Studies at Tel Aviv University, says the government should find the courage
to give both settlers and Palestinians a clear timetable and map for Israeli
withdrawal from the territories - otherwise more violence is in prospect.
The Israeli government, however, says the agreement can work only if it can
guarantee to its mounting domestic opposition that security for Israelis
will strengthen with peace. The Labour-led coalition government is firm in
its refusal either to open up the settlement question now or begin talks on
a permanent solution. 'We are negotiating an interim agreement and that
won't change,' said Mr Ephrahim Sneh, a Labour member of parliament. 'Now is
not the time to deal with the settlement question and, as more terrorist
attacks occur, the more difficult it will be to deal with the settlers in
the future.'
Mr Arafat, therefore, has a stark choice - to abandon the peace talks and
push, even at this late stage, for a renegotiation of the declaration, or to
try to convince sceptical supporters to implement what they see as a flawed
agreement.
Many Palestinians believe that if Mr Arafat presses ahead with the latter
course, he risks losing credibility to the point where the PLO may no longer
command majority Palestinian support. Walking out of peace talks, however,
would be difficult. All the reasons which forced the PLO to sign the
declaration - its lack of funds, its marginalisation in the Arab world and
the strength of Palestinian opponents in the territories - remain urgent
concerns.
Even if the Israelis made substantial concessions to strengthen his hand, Mr
Arafat faces a formidable challenge. Many Palestinians feel he has sold them
short by signing the interim declaration. After 27 years of Israeli
occupation, they seek an urgent improvement in living standards and a
significant measure of democracy in their political life - both of which Mr
Arafat has so far been unable to deliver.
'If Arafat does not bring democracy, there will be a revolution, not only
against his dictatorship but against the peace process,' said Mr Soufian Abu
Zaiyda, a PLO leader in the occupied Gaza strip.
Mr Zaiyda said the Palestinian authority to be established after the Israeli
withdrawal has to accomplish four urgent tasks to win credibility: enhance
the economic wellbeing of Palestinians, protect their security, convince
them their leaders are 'working for the people and not against them', and
establish democratic institutions 'far away from corruption, bureaucracy and
discrimination between people'.
As both Israeli and Palestinian negotiators prepare to sign a Gaza-Jericho
agreement to usher in Palestinian self-rule, and prepare for the
establishment of Mr Arafat and his entourage in Jericho, the question
remains of whether the PLO can shore up its dwindling support.
'We accepted Arafat to be the president of Palestine but he has accepted to
be the mayor of Gaza- Jericho,' said Hisham Elakra, a disappointed,
19-year-old refugee in the rubbish-strewn Palestinian Jabalya camp. 'He has
betrayed our struggle and we must fight against the peace process.'
Mr Arafat yesterday seemed to acknow-ledge his supporters' frustrations when
he warned that the settlement issue and conduct of peace talks 'will lead us
all to catastrophe which will kill any remaining hope, confidence and
credibility our Palestinian people . . . still have in the peace process.'
He appears to be banking on returning to Gaza-Jericho in a fanfare of glory,
and on using international aid to buy off political opposition and create
jobs. But even his supporters doubt these measures alone will secure his
political base.
'We have reached a moment of truth,' said Mrs Ashrawi. 'Israel's negotiating
strategy will continue to erode Arafat's support to the point where the
leadership may no longer be able to hold the people.'
Thus Israel confronts a dilemma. It does not wish to cede real power or
sovereignty to the Palestinians now, but it cannot afford to leave Mr Arafat
exposed to criticism from extremists bent on destroying the peace process.
Israel knows it must walk a difficult tightrope and, for better or worse,
must stick with Mr Arafat as its best negotiating partner. But many
Palestinians say Israel has been too stringent in its security requirements
and has left Mr Arafat with little ammunition to fend off his most vocal
opponents. The danger remains that if Israel does not heed Palestinian
demands for more substantial concessions, it may unwittingly play into the
hands of those extremists it most fears.

The role of the Bank of England in the conduct of UK monetary policy has
long been subsidiary to that of the Treasury. While individual governors
have exerted influence over successive chancellors, the extent of that
influence has tended to remain a well-kept secret. The decision announced
yesterday to reveal the minutes of the monthly meeting between Mr Kenneth
Clarke and Mr Eddie George is thus an important and welcome step towards
more open government which bears some comparison with the disclosure
requirements observed by the US Federal Reserve's open market committee.
Transparency will lend strength to Mr George's arm in acting as a
countervailing influence against the politicians.
The nature of the implicit sanction was made clear by the markets' unhappy
initial reaction to the publication of the minutes of the first three
meetings of the current year. It had been widely suspected that February's
quarter-point cut in interest rates reflected disagreement between Mr Clarke
and Mr George over the extent to which policy should be loosened - a
suspicion that was increased by the assertion in the Bank's own inflation
report that there was now a greater risk of rising than falling inflation.
Those suspicions have now been confirmed: the quarter-point cut was indeed a
compromise along predictable lines. The minutes also reveal that both men
are prepared to cut rates if this month's tax increases put a brake on
economic activity. Gilts and sterling promptly weakened in response to this
unexpected generosity with the actualite.
That hardly suggests enhanced policy credibility. Yet in the longer run the
markets' verdict may look over-hasty. The governor has won some ground in
his battle to achieve independence for the Bank. At the same time the
chancellor appears to have accepted the argument that openness, while it may
lead to occasional discomfort, will be conducive to more stable markets.
This belief was reinforced by the conviction that the speculation in
February over a Treasury-Bank clash was needlessly overblown.
What is clear from yesterday's unexpected revelations is that the minutes
will contain genuine substance. To that extent they represent a much more
significant advance in the framing of monetary policy than the earlier (and
no less welcome) innovations of the inflation report and the grant of
discretion over the timing of rate cuts to the Bank. Yet transparency is not
synonymous with full accountability. The lines of policymaking are likely to
remain somewhat tangled since the whip hand remains in Whitehall.
In the final analysis levels of inflation in democratic societies reflect
the preferences and priorities of the people. That, as much as a tough
central bank, is the explanation for low German inflation and the poor
British inflationary experience. The biggest mistakes in UK monetary policy
have anyway tended to happen when persuasive chancellors carried Bank
governors with them. The latest step towards greater central bank autonomy
is welcome. But it is no low-inflation guarantee.

FT  14 APR 94 / Personal View: Services can offer scope for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEANNE JULIUS and RICHARD BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1956 manufacturing employment in the UK peaked at 38 per cent of the
workforce; it has fallen relentlessly to less than 20 per cent today. Many
see this shrinkage as another symptom of British economic decline. In fact
it is a phenomenon common to all the richer first-world countries. Germany's
manufacturing jobs peaked in 1960, Japan's in 1973, France's in 1974 and the
US's in 1979. This suggests universal factors are at work. They include the
tendency for demand for services to rise faster than demand for goods in
rich countries, the shift in the labour force in favour of women who have
revealed a preference for more flexible service-sector jobs, and the impact
of labour-saving technology in manufacturing.
A new factor is that a growing number of third-world countries are
developing a strong manufacturing advantage. Initially the preserve of east
Asia, this advantage has spread to Latin America, India and parts of the
former Soviet bloc. Workforces have been educated and producer-friendly
economic policies adopted. Productivity is rising fast. This, combined with
low wages and rising domestic demand, provides a magnet for companies to
locate new manufacturing production in those countries.
The result will be intensified pressure on manufacturing jobs in the OECD
countries. Over the next 30 years, we estimate that the share of the
workforce employed in manufacturing will fall below 10 per cent in most rich
countries.
Can, or should, this job loss be resisted? As we climb out of recession,
with unemployment still high in Europe and growing in Japan, governments are
under great pressure to do so. However, protection - for example, tariffs or
anti-dumping duties on cheap manufactured imports - would be expensive and
self-defeating, as we learnt with the Common Agricultural Policy.
OECD governments should instead take the offensive. Too many people still
believe that services will never be truly tradeable. Our view is the
opposite: unless we can make services tradeable, by liberalising the rules
surrounding services, OECD countries are in for a bitter and ultimately
fruitless battle against developing countries over manufacturing goods.
An OECD shift away from manufacturing can be accommodated as long as two
conditions are fulfilled. First, service sector jobs must continue to grow.
Second, service companies must be able to compete internationally. The first
requirement poses little concern. In most OECD countries, job growth in
services has been much faster than in other parts of the economy for a long
time. The driving force for this is the growing demand for services, such as
design and business services, travel and entertainment.
There is little doubt such demand will continue to grow. The big question is
who will supply it? This is where the importance of trade in services
becomes critical. Traditionally, service companies such as telecoms,
insurance, electricity and airlines were restricted to their home market
and, as quid pro quo, were protected from international competition on their
home turf. This cosy arrangement has limited both industry size and
productivity growth. Economies of scale could not be sought beyond the home
market and competitive pressures there were not sufficient to drive
technological or managerial change. This catch-22 led to the erroneous
belief that services were inherently less capable of productivity growth
than manufacturing. Few in the fiercely competitive parts of the service
sector still believe that.
Market access is now the critical factor. Once service industries can expand
beyond home markets, they can gain from economies of scope of the kind that
economies of scale brought for manufacturing in the 1960s. To reap such
gains will require a trade regime that does more than lower trade barriers.
The new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreement contains a
framework for services, but the specifics must still be negotiated and some
fundamental thinking remains to be done. This deserves top priority.
Building the legal basis to make services fully tradeable will not be easy.
But equally, we must not underestimate the pressures that our economies will
face if we fail. In manufactures, about 50 per cent of world production is
traded. Even if services were only half as tradable as manufactures, that
would still imply scope for a doubling of service trade at today's output
levels. The potential gains are enormous. Our task now is to build the World
Trade Organisation, the Gatt's successor body, into the driver for this new
growth dynamic.

No sooner has BMW gobbled up Rover, than the Germans seem poised to get
their hands on another British success story.
Tucked away inside the Lancer Boss fork lift truck factory is the world's
greatest fork lift truck driver - chief demonstrator Bart Harman.
Leighton Buzzard-based Bart's delicate stunts include constructing a
champagne glass pyramid with the forks of a giant truck and closing a box of

outside the cab, with a piece of string.

Who will be the next director of the left-leaning think-tank, the Institute
for Public Policy Research, now that James Cornford is off to the richer
pastures of the Paul Hamlyn Foundation?
Patricia Hewitt, the current deputy director, must be the favourite. As Neil
Kinnock's former press secretary, she combines a keenly analytical mind with
inside knowledge of Labour politics. More important, she is more telegenic
than Cornford.
Unfortunately, she doesn't suffer fools gladly and may be penalised because
she's associated too much with yesterday's man. A safe alternative would be
David Ward, John Smith's youthful policy assistant. He's an effective fixer
who could be relied upon not to rock the boat.
If Labour won the next election, he could move seamlessly into Sarah Hogg's
role as head of the No 10 Policy Unit.

Appearances can be deceptive. Yasushi Akashi, the top UN civilian in former
Yugoslavia, from whom General Sir Michael Rose takes his orders, is not a
typically faceless Japanese bureaucrat.
Indeed, he has taken to showing visitors to his Zagreb office a letter from
John Major, in which the British PM thanks him for the convivial evening
they spent together last month in Split. 'In future when I want a good
Churchill anecdote, I shall know where to turn,' the letter concludes. What
can he have meant? Sadly, Akashi refuses to unlock his fund of Churchill
stories 'in mixed company'.
When a female colleague protested that little shocked her after several
years in Yugoslavia, Akashi smiled evasively. 'Perhaps after a few drinks,'
he said. What's Japanese for party-pooper?

Forget the Goyas in the Prado. Highlight of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's three-day trip to Spain was a sausage factory on the outskirts of
Madrid where the owner speaks Russian.
Spain's secret antipasto weapon at the Campofrio company, whose glistening
pipes spout out mortadella and chorizo, was a natural taster on Yeltsin's
programme. Pedro Ballve, the boss, opened a sausage-producing joint venture
in Moscow four years ago, and plans to have a second plant up and running at
the end of this month.
The company has apparently made a hit with the Moscow housewife by marketing
tinned tushonka pork, a concoction of 25 per cent meat and 75 per cent fat
to be heated up and added to potato stew. 'We know all about this because we
started up in Spain's hungry '40s,' Ballve explains. 'Hungry people really
value fat, not meat.'
But Campofrio is not the first to bring tushonka to Russian soil. The stuff
was a staple of the Wehrmacht's iron rations.

<TEXT>
Finance ministries and central banks were never designed to agree about
everything - but things are particularly delicate in Japan just now. For the
latest note of discord has been struck over the identity of the Bank of
Japan's next boss.
BoJ officials and vice finance ministers take it in turns to pilot the
central bank. So when Yasushi Mieno, a BoJ man, steps down in December, the
fight is on between two ex Ministry of Finance bods, Yasuo Matsushita,
chairman of Sakura Bank, and Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, president of the Export
Import Bank of Japan.
The prospect of Yamaguchi spooks the bankers, as he is regarded as being far
too political an animal. They have found an ally in Minoru Nagaoka,
president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, school friend of Mieno, and himself
once a vice finance minister. For Yamaguchi would be neatly off the scene
provided Nagaoka's 'personal' wishes are respected - that Yamaguchi take his
place at the TSE when he bows out in June.
But MoF, which boasts particularly close ties to Yamaguchi, is just about
equally unhappy with Matsushita. Ever since the latter was mentioned as heir
apparent to Mieno, he has faced a deluge of bad press, including allegations
of tax evasion, sourced in the popular weeklies to - why, anonymous MoF
bureaucrats.
Who cares about the course of the yen when there are other such fascinating
diversions with which to pass the time of day?

FT  14 APR 94 / Leading Article: Unsound deals in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany has proved comfortingly resistant to the speculative asset price
inflation of the sort that has plagued economic management in recent years
in Anglo-Saxon countries and Japan. The apparent near-bankruptcy of the
Jurgen Schneider property group, an unquoted company heavily indebted to
banks and to trade creditors, does not prefigure a collapse of the German
property sector.
The group's difficulties, and the disappearance of Mr Jurgen Schneider, do
however provide further evidence of the strains on the corporate and banking
sector in the recessionary aftermath of the 1989-91 unification boom.
Schneider's troubles also raise questions about unsound financing in east
Germany, where some of Mr Schneider's best-known projects are based.
Schneider appears to have become over-exposed in prestige projects in both
east and west Germany. Investment in many building projects east of the Elbe
seems to have been driven more by the provision of generous tax breaks than
by a realistic assessment of the economic outlook. In an election year,
Schneider's misfortunes have political repercussions. Chancellor Helmut Kohl
yesterday voiced worries about the prospect of lay-offs on east and west
German building sites.
There are some parallels with the pre-Christmas difficulties of the
Metallgesellschaft metals group, which had to be bailed out with a DM3.4bn
banking rescue after large losses through ill-supervised oil futures
trading. The leading bank involved in both affairs is the Deutsche Bank.
Damage to banks' balance sheets may be limited by the secured nature of most
of their credits to Schneider. But after two highly-publicised corporate
failures within six months, Germany's largest bank will not be able to avoid
questions about its credit procedures.
Deutsche Bank executives have recently started to limit their activities in
steering the long-term fortunes of German companies through supervisory
board chairmanships. Banks are bound to become more exposed to credit risks
in the advanced stages of a recession. An effort to concentrate energies on
core banking business seems prudent.
As the example of the late Mr Robert Maxwell shows, banks can sometimes be
seriously misled by charismatic figures running groups with entangled
accounting practices. Deutsche and its partner banks seem to have invested
exaggerated trust in Mr Schneider's personal capacities. His operations have
been protected from scrutiny by the low standards of accounting disclosure
to which unquoted German companies are subject.
The Schneider affair may prompt the German authorities to take steps to
clear up shortcomings in the transparency and accountability of privately
held groups. The short-term priority, however, as Mr Kohl indicated
yesterday, is to prevent the setback from disrupting the slow recovery in
east Germany.

FT  14 APR 94 / Leading Article: Paying for parties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The business of fighting elections is an expensive one in modern
democracies. Political parties need large sums of money to pay for their
campaigns, advertising and mailshots. Frequently, raising the finance
requires them to sell their souls to special interest groups such as
companies, trade unions or even crime syndicates.
In the UK, the Conservatives rely on corporate supporters and wealthy
individuals, including foreign businessmen whose motives in making donations
are unclear. Labour depends on trade unions, which make no bones about the
fact that they expect influence in return for their support. Each party has
in recent times received suspect gifts - the Conservatives from Mr Asil
Nadir, the disgraced tycoon; Labour from Mr Robert Maxwell. Public concern
over these gifts last year led to an inquiry by the all-party Commons Home
Affairs committee, which reported yesterday.
Sadly the report is a wasted opportunity. The Conservative majority on the
committee saw no advantage in changing the rules. Their party gains
financial advantage from the generosity of its individual supporters, who
are wealthier than Labour's. They therefore backed a code of practice that
would change little.
The Labour minority report sought to rectify the current imbalance in
resources between the two main parties. Its recommendations, which include a
ban on overseas donations, go well beyond what is needed to restore public
confidence. It also calls for state funding of political parties, a measure
for which there is little support among voters. State funding has not, in
any case, stopped parties becoming embroiled in fund-raising scandals in the
countries that have adopted it.
On one point, however, the minority report is right: donations of more than
Pounds 5,000 a year from a single source should be publicly disclosed.
Wealthy people, companies and trade unions are all entitled to give money to
the parties they support - including parties overseas. But the source of
party funds is a matter of legitimate public concern to voters. The public
has a right to know who is trying to influence politicians with the
deployment of significant sums of money.
One further measure might be considered on company donations to political
parties, which must currently be declared in annual reports. A few companies
seek endorsement of such donations at regular intervals through a vote at
the annual general meeting. Trade unions must rightly seek support for their
political links at regular intervals, to ensure that they reflect the wishes
of their members. Shareholders have the same right to be consulted when
their money is to be spent on political machines.

FT  14 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Advertisers see need for additional
TV channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the Broadcasting Act the government made it clear that a fifth TV
channel (and possibly a sixth), financed by advertising and sponsorship,
would be high on the agenda. Channel 5 will provide a 25 per cent increase
in terrestrial channel choice for all UK viewers, and added opportunity for
broadcasters, programme makers and advertisers.
Naturally, all issues have a number of different sides, and the letter from
Mr Richard Norman (April 8) quite clearly stated his interest - that of the
manufacturers of TV sets. He argued that the case for Channel 5 had now been
overtaken by technology, suggesting that digital technology 'offers the
prospect of extra channels within three to five years'.
However, there is another important side, and this is the case that I would
like to put. Advertisers throughout industry need an additional commercial
channel, particularly in the light of all the mergers and takeovers now
proceeding in ITV. We need Channel 5 without delay and the mere prospect of
something else within three or five years is simply not a good enough
argument to stand in its way. Viewers, too, need this additional viewing
opportunity - only a small minority of homes currently chooses to pay for
satellite or cable and, even by the year 2000, it will still be a minority -
a larger one, perhaps, but still a minority.
Consequently, my association believes strongly that the case for Channel 5
is still very powerful and we urge the government and all concerned to allow
this new opportunity, promised in the act, to proceed without delay. We
believe in competition, and we know that they will want competition too. The
technological opportunities will not disappear, but there is no reason why
they should be given first priority over a new terrestrial channel in the
immediate future.

FT  14 APR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Markets fret over future inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securities markets have been pausing for breath since Easter after a bout of
nerves in the early months of this year. The main pressures have come from
US bond markets.
Part of the turbulence has been due to what the US bond analyst Henry
Kaufman calls structural changes, such as 'the leveraged activities of
high-octane portfolio managers' and the spread of mutual funds to high-risk
areas. But there are also economic reasons, or at least fears.
The smart thing to say during much of 1993 was that inflation was
yesterday's worry, and that the present concern was deflation in the sense
of falling prices of assets and tradeable commodities. This is still true in
Japan. In the US, however, the fashionable view has changed almost
overnight, to that of inflation being a danger after all.
US short-term interest rates have risen by somewhat more than suggested by
the headline rises in the Fed Funds rate. The Fed is, however, being
criticised for not moving earlier and more sharply to raise interest rates.
Wayne Angell, until recently a Fed governor, has criticised the US central
bank for seeming to give zero inflation a secondary priority compared to
'getting the economy going'. Angell was in the Fed minority voting for
higher interest rates last December. His present prescription is to raise
the rarely moved official discount rate by a shock full percentage point to
4 per cent, which he believes would take the Fed Funds rate to 4 1/2 per
cent and no doubt shift market rates higher still.
The Clinton administration is trying to shout down the worriers with the
assurance that there is no inflation on the horizon. But the neat division
of labour under which the White House exhorts and the Fed acts is, however,
threatened by the administration's continuing desire to edge the dollar
down, and the already ridiculously high yen still further upwards. This will
be - fortunately - more difficult if US interest rates are rising, thus
increasing the attractions of dollar over yen holdings.
The existence of indexed gilts in the UK allows one to make slightly more
informed guesses about market dynamics. The redemption yield on the UK
medium-term benchmark bond has risen since the end of the year by nearly 1
1/2 percentage points to about 7 1/2 per cent. During the same period the
yield on longer-term indexed gilts has increased by slightly less than  3/4
percentage points, which is a rough index of the increase in long-term real
interest rates. The remaining rise represents an adverse shift in
inflationary expectations. Indeed the bond market evidence suggests a
long-term expectation of UK inflation of a little more than 4 per cent a
year. This is much below the average of the past two decades, but worse than
appeared likely during last winter's euphoria, and a whisker above the upper
end of the UK government's target range.
The yield on US 10-year bonds has risen even more than the UK yield: by
about 1 3/4 percentage points from a lower trough in the autumn of 1993. But
international capital market integration may have reached the point where UK
indexed gilt yields are relevant in US markets. In that case we have to
conclude that inflationary expectations have deteriorated by more than a
whole percentage point in the US - quite a lot when one is talking about a
decade ahead.
What is the source of this inflationary pessimism? A survey by the UK
broking firm, James Capel, concludes that underlying US inflation is around
the headline rate of 2 1/2 per cent, and that there are no visible upward
pressures on costs. The main adverse signal comes from commodity market
indices, where price rises are relatively modest and may be in response to
exaggerated world growth expectations.
Nevertheless James Capel shares the worries of the Fed hawks about the
inflationary outlook. The lags in monetary policy are so long that policy
has to be tightened now if inflationary pressures in 1995 and 1996 are to be
countered. The danger is illustrated in the chart. US output is now believed
to be pressing against the limits of capacity - not physical capacity, but
the rate of operation beyond which inflation accelerates.
No country has solved the question of how to set policies whose full effects
on inflation will not be apparent for two or three years. Although I am a
fan of charts of 'output gaps', I use them to illustrate fundamental ideas,
and not because I take the posited numerical relationships seriously.
James Capel, for instance, expects that a modest acceleration in the actual
US growth rate to 3 1/2 per cent in 1994 would be sufficient to trigger a 4
1/2 per cent inflation rate in 1995. In fact, we do not know even
approximately, either the underlying growth trend, or the safe level of
capacity utilisation, or the degree of sensitivity of inflation to a given
pressure on capacity.
We do not even know the relative weight that US policymakers ought to put on
the divergent output gaps in the US and the rest of the world. For the very
same estimates, which show the US working slightly above the safe limit of
capacity, show all the other Group of Seven leading industrialised countries
working at an average of no less than 6 per cent below capacity
What then should Alan Greenspan do (apart from making sure of a majority on
the Open Market Committee)? An appropriate policy would be a mixture of
something he has already discussed and something he has not. He has said
that real short-term interest rates have been artificially low while the
economy needed support, but they now need to return to a normal level.
What might that be? US three-month real interest rates are about 1 1/2 per
cent a year on the basis of a conventional backward look at inflation, but
only about  1/2 per cent on the basis of medium-term inflationary
expectations. What is a normal short-term real rate? One might say 2-3 per
cent on the basis of historical averages. Reasoning along these lines would
suggest that US market rates be jacked up by a further 1, or probably 2,
percentage points at the earliest opportunity.
But the Fed needs a safety device as well, and should not put all its faith
in a fallible estimate of normal real interest rates. Faithful readers will
not be surprised to find my suggesting Nominal Gross Domestic Product as a
check. This can be looked at as a combination of inflation plus real growth.
It is better than an inflation target alone, because how fast the economy is
growing sheds some light on likely inflationary pressures - or the absence
of them - some time ahead. A Nominal GDP guideline also gives headroom for a
little more growth, if inflation continues to come in at rates lower than
expected, and would support a further tightening if inflationary pressures
build up unexpectedly.
To summarise: the US needs a further rise of 1-2 percentage points in
short-term interest rates. The process should be halted or reversed if the
growth of US GDP falls in nominal terms much below 5 per cent, but
intensified if it rises much above 6 per cent. Need I say that I am talking
about trends and not quarter-to-quarter vagaries of the national income
figures?
By the same criteria, German monetary policy needs to be loosened further,
especially if a forward rather than backward-looking view of inflation is
taken in estimating both real interest rates and Nominal GDP. In Japan
short-term real interest rates seem below 1 per cent if measured by consumer
prices; but they are a good deal higher if related to producer prices, which
have fallen by more than 2 per cent in the past year. All three countries
are moving in the right direction, but too slowly and too late - with
Germany lagging a good deal more than the US.

FT  14 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Scale of likely economic problems in
Turkey is exaggerated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From EMRE YIGIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I must disagree with certain of the conclusions in the two articles
'Turkish package fails to put doubts to rest' and 'Falling back to earth
with a bump', published on April 7.
My first problem is with the statement that 'recent lira depreciation means
Turkey's foreign currency debt has more than doubled'. Turkey's foreign debt
is, of course, denominated in foreign currency. Indeed, the debt-to-gross
national product ratio has, perhaps, doubled. So what? Foreign debt is
serviced from hard currency earnings. Are you implying that foreign exchange
revenues, in particular net exports, are likely to halve this year? I would
hope not - imports of non-essential goodies and certain investment items
have already been cut dramatically, and exports should surge soon. For that
matter, the 1993 current account deficit, at just above 3 per cent of GNP,
was not a figure to excite gloom.
You say that the economy will contract sharply in 1994. Our calculations
indeed show that domestic demand will fall sharply; but the rise in net
exports should compensate, and lead to a year of overall zero growth. You
exaggerate also the problems to be encountered during the proposed lay-offs;
indeed, where has an austerity package been met with delirious joy?
Finally, concerning the performance of the Welfare party which, in a fair
and free election, gained some support. Among other things, Turkey is the
only Islamic state that has no vestiges of sharia law; where a woman can
rise to be prime minister not on the strength of her surname but on her own
merit; which is a member of the OECD and an associate member of the European
Union; and where the pro-western faction is much more numerous and possibly
even more vocal than the fundamentalist. The Turkish republic is strong
enough in its institutions and sincere enough in its democratic ideals to
greet the result with equanimity.
The ultimate question is two-fold. The first part is sophistry: where do the
Turks want to see themselves? The second, of greater value, is: where do our
long-standing partners and allies wish to see us? The conclusion should
ultimately be: fully integrated into the EU. This would both cement the EU's
claim of global political importance and rejuvenate it. For Turkey, it would
be consummation of a passionate dream and of cool pragmatism.

Mortgaging The Earth - The World Bank, environmental impoverishment
and the crisis of development
By Bruce Rich
Earthscan Publications, Pounds 14.95. Beacon, Dollars 29. 376 pages
Fifty years after its creation, the World Bank faces a chorus of complaints
that the Dollars 24bn worth of loans it makes a year is failing to bring
about the kind of economic development it intends. One of the most frequent
accusations is that the bank's projects are also destroying the environment.
That charge was partly acknowledged by the bank last year, when it withdrew
a proposal to lend India money to build the Narmada dam in Gujarat state,
west India. Critics of the Dollars 3bn project to provide electricity and
irrigation said it would destroy wildlife habitats and force thousands of
people to resettle.
According to Bruce Rich, the Narmada episode is just one example in a long
list of World Bank projects which have brought 'ecological devastation'.
Rich, a campaigner at US lobby group the Environmental Defence Fund, is
right in his criticism of the bank's lending practices on many counts.
Several World Bank-funded schemes have become notorious for their ecological
impact. Road building through the rainforest of north-western Brazil
accelerated logging of hardwood trees; the bank then felt obliged to back
further projects intended to counteract that damage. Indonesian
transmigration - the relocation of people from the western Indonesian
islands into the untouched forests of Irian Jaya - caused extensive
disruption of the island's native communities and of the plants and animals
that supported them. The scheme did not alleviate poverty, but simply
redistributed it, Rich argues.
He is right, too, in his analysis of some of the causes of these
misjudgments. He points to the bank's preference for projects such as dams,
road building and irrigation schemes, which have environmental and social
consequences that are often hard to anticipate.
But he seems misguided in ascribing the bank's failings to a thirst for
power and to its 'official culture of secretiveness'. A sprawling chapter,
'From Descartes to Chico Mendes' (who campaigned against Brazil's timber
policies), declares that the bank represents a centuries-old western
tradition of dominating other societies and the natural world.
A better explanation might be that the bank favours large schemes because of
the difficulty and expense of gathering information on smaller projects, and
because of the need to control overheads.
Rich's taste for grandiose pronouncements on cultural trends makes many of
his descriptions frustratingly abstract. 'To see Singrauli today is to
witness a nihilistic negation of nature and humankind', he says of one
Indian industrial region - which hardly conveys what it feels like to be
there.
Even where he introduces particular cases of ecological destruction, his
attacks on the World Bank are frequently imprecise. For example, when
talking about the environmental impact of commercial shrimp farming in Thai
mangrove swamps, he does not say how much tree felling would have happened
regardless of the bank's involvement.
However, the book's main weakness is that it judges the bank only by an
ecological yardstick. Rich makes no attempt to assess how the bank rates
against its own goals of fostering economic development and reducing
poverty. He quotes people who object to projects, but does not examine
whether other groups - or the countries overall - have benefited from the
World Bank's presence.
Rich does not give sufficient credit to recent soul-searching at the bank -
including a conference last year on proposals for reforming its lending
practices and environmental standards. After Narmada, the bank produced a
series of scathing internal reports, which concluded 'neither the board nor
the president wants more surprises about problems with ongoing projects'.
It becomes clear, as Rich rails against 'the seemingly unstoppable,
inevitable face of development', that he is at heart uncomfortable with the
pursuit of economic growth. As helping countries to grow is one of the
bank's central aims, it is perhaps inevitable that no World Bank project
meets with his approval.
Tellingly, he concludes that 'nature itself appears in revolt against this
empire of man over things'. Readers may feel at many points that Rich does
not much like people, unless they belong to indigenous tribes.
These weaknesses are unfortunate, because Rich poses timely questions about
the World Bank's role. Anxieties about whether resources are applied to the
most deserving projects, and about how success should be measured, now
confront many of the international institutions set up after the second
world war - notably the International Monetary Fund, the World Health
Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear
watchdog.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, set up in 1991 to help
rebuild eastern Europe and modelled partly on the World Bank, has grappled
with similar issues.
If the World Bank now faces more searching questions about its role than in
the past, that is not entirely the fault of its lending record. It also
reflects the growing debate about the proper economic and environmental
relationship between the developed and developing world.
For instance, how much financial help should industrialised countries give
to the third world, and what strings should be attached? Are western
campaigners wrong to try to impose their 'green' standards on other
countries?
Rich does not solve such conundrums. He is right, though, to argue that the
bank needs to find answers, because the questions will not go away.

FT  14 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: John Smith likely to be offered more
sympathetic view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From GILES RADICE MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your leader ('Mr Major's anniversary', April 9) on John Major's
record since the election two years ago, you tacked on a dismissive last
paragraph about the Labour party, ending with the eccentric judgment that
John Smith's last two years as leader had been 'a nullity'.
Of course, Labour's massive lead in the opinion polls is partly a reflection
of the government's deep unpopularity. But for some time, the trend of
underlying attitudes, always a more accurate guide to public opinion, has
also been running in the party's favour. Voters now trust Labour far more,
believing it to be both united and sensible. They also think that it would
handle the economy better than the Tories. Equally important, they perceive
John Smith as caring, competent and, above all, prime ministerial.
As to policies, it is ludicrous to expect the Labour party to produce
detailed policy statements two years before the next election is due.
However, on the direction of the economy, on tax and spending, on law and
order and on democratic reform, it is developing a fresh approach, while
Labour's European policy is very different from that of the Tories.
Of course, it would be wrong for Labour to be complacent when there is still
such a long time before the next election. But the Smith leadership has made
a promising start which will be fully tested in the coming local and
European elections. I predict that the voters will take a much more
sympathetic view of the Labour party than your leader writer.

FT  14 APR 94 / Arts: Ghost from a Perfect Place - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Philip Ridley's second Hampstead Theatre play, the 'ghost' is Travis
Flood, a revenant from lengthy American exile back to Bethnal Green, the
'perfect' scene of his younger gangsterhood. He manifests himself in the
dingy flat of crumbling old Torchie Sparks, as a pre-booked client for her
whoring granddaughter Rio, met by chance in a graveyard. Their sudden
acquaintance has much older roots than they realise. It takes most of the
play to dig them up, rather slowly, though things take a nasty turn well
before that.
The names represent a certain restraint on the playwright's part: in his
award-winning Fastest Clock in the Universe (1992), the dramatis personae
included Sherbet Gravel and her fiance Foxtrot Darling. There is room for
conjecture that Ridley begins a play by thinking up such monickers, and then
imagining characters who could fit them. That would explain a lot. His
director here is again Matthew Lloyd, who anchored the evasive, quirkily
formal dialogue of The Fastest Clock in a densely palpable situation, kinky
and explosive.
Ghost is a tougher nut, for its very structure is wilfully formal. The first
act comprises two extended duets: one for Torchie and Travis, including her
long recall of the old days when he was a respected East End brute, and his
own account of his plushy Hollywood retirement now; the other for Travis and
Rio (a Pirandello echo: remember the father-daughter confrontation in the
Six Characters brothel?). Each narration draws its hearer into helping to
re-enact it on the spot. Inevitably, there is a whiff of Actor's Exercises
in the air.
Act 2 goes directly over the top, with Rio joined by her teenage
'Cheerleaders' - Miss Sulphur and Miss Kerosene, sister-harpies in matching
gold get-ups - to subject her client to sado-masochistic torment
(choreographed by Ian Poitier). At least one woman in the audience fled
during the cigar-burn treatment. When the weightiest facts come out at last,
Travis drops another mask or two as the action curdles into a dying fall.
But the dramatic force of a return-to-bleak-reality presupposes an earlier
brave facade; here, since what went before was all actorish games, no room
has been made for any real, ground-level pain to surface.
Nonetheless, John Wood has a whale of a time as Travis. Initially six feet
of baleful loom, in a rectangular don't-mess-with-me suit and improbably
black hair and beetle-brows, he soon melts into a kind of blinking
benevolence in his old stamping-ground. Enthralled by Torchie's memoirs, he
multiplies his tics, double-takes, horse-faced moues and sudden stentorian
roars to a ripe Michael Hordern level. Bridget Turner's Torchie keeps pace
with him; and as Rio, Trevyn McDowell's vicious Madonna-clone fulfills the
darker promise of her Middlemarch Rosamund for the BBC. I didn't believe a
word of any of it, but others might find its arch rhythms weirdly
compelling.

A new series of Taking Liberties begins with allegations that a British
based multinational company has used legal chicanery to cheat employees and
their widows out of compensation for mesothelioma, an asbestos-related
disease. One of the company's workers, Doreen Percival, who now has the
disease, says that even if the expose comes too late to help her, 'It is
some sort of revenge for what they have done to us' (7.50 BBC2).
On C4 Jonathan Glancey begins a three-part series called Heaven, Hell And
Suburbia. According to Glancey 'The Englishman's home is less a castle than
a half-timbered, bay-windowed semi with a fanlight neo-Georgian door'. He is
not in favour of suburbs: 'They undermine cities, consume the countryside,
and bleed both dry'. Yet more and more people want to live in them (8.00).
I hesitate to label Class Act as 'formula drama' because that is a
pejorative phrase and this series works. Well, the opening episode did
anyway. Joanna Lumley is perfectly cast as the embattled Sloane ranger (9.00
ITV).

FT  14 APR 94 / Arts: Peter Grimes - Scottish Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From politicians' sex lives to violent videos, public concern over morality
seems a peculiarly British phenomenon. It is at the heart of Britten's first
full-scale opera, which shows a small seaside town embarking on a moral
crusade to bring the outsider Peter Grimes into line - with tragic results.
Although it is 50 years since the opera was written, it still packs a
powerful punch. Scottish Opera has largely done it justice with this new
production, as it has with other operas tackled this season. The company
seems to be moving on to firmer ground, announcing yesterday at its annual
press conference that it has cleared its financial deficit a year early and
is cautiously optimistic about the future.
There were no signs of skimping in Peter Grimes. After a long period in
which the opera has been played against bare sets stripped down to the
essentials, the style here was quite elaborate. The sea-front of 'The
Borough' (Britten's barely disguised portrayal of Aldeburgh) has once again
become a picture-postcard parade of shops and houses, including the local
church and Auntie's pub, 'The Boar'.
When Joachim Herz was active in Britain in the 1970s, East Germany was still
in existence and he was one of its roving band of controversial producers
overseas. He seems to have mellowed since then. His assertion in the
programme that the townspeople of 'The Borough' are ants slaving to work for
Mammon can be read as an attempt to keep old socialist beliefs alive, but
the idea is not worked at insistently on stage.
By and large the production is as traditional as Reinhart Zimmermann's
designs. As dawn breaks, a fishing community starts the day's work, the
women scraping the newly-caught fish, the men weighing them for market. Only
a tendency to staginess weakens the effect, for Britten's first success at
opera is a touch naive and responds best to handling which is natural and
sincere.
It gets that in Anthony Rolfe Johnson's Peter Grimes, which was no doubt the
raison d'etre for the production. (He will sing the role at Glyndebourne and
New York.) The contradictions of Grimes the visionary and the bully are held
judiciously in balance. He treats his young apprentice roughly but gives him
his own jacket in the storm, hits him but tells him gently not to worry.
Most tenors find this a taxing part to sing and in Rolfe Johnson's case that
manifests itself as some strain at the top of the voice.
Rita Cullis sings beautifully as an elegant Ellen Orford, who looks as if
she has had a softer life than most in 'The Borough'. Russell Smythe plays a
sympathetic, but lightweight Balstrode, not the usual hardened sea-dog. 'The
Boar' is well staffed by Patricia Boylan's hearty Auntie and her two
tempting 'nieces', Anne Dawson and Ann Archibald. Anthony Roden as the moral
ring-leader Bob Boles has a fanatic gleam in the eye. Catherine Wyn-Rogers
is too young by half for the old busybody, Mrs Sedley.
At the start there is not much sea spray in the music, but Richard Armstrong
builds up a tidal wave of intensity. Scottish Opera must be glad to have a
Music Director with his experience. For the 1994-5 season Armstrong will
conduct three of the new productions: Beethoven's Fidelio, Donizetti's Maria
Stuarda and Schnittke's Life with an Idiot. Nicholas McGegan will look after
Le nozze di Figaro.

FT  14 APR 94 / Arts: Posturing with Bill T Jones - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of an evening spent with Bill T Jones and his dancers - and
rarely can an evening seem longer - you realise that there is no substitute
for choreography. Jones and his troupe have been industriously trying, as
the aeons pass, to show that there is an alternative - it is called
posturing - but attitudinise and scamper as they may, the stuff on display
is artistically naif, visually dire.
Jones and his cohort opened a week's season on Tuesday. After a 25 minute
wait while Sadler's Wells - which wins my vote as the most graceless theatre
in London - crammed in the last of the audience, the curtain rose to reveal
two figures in a setting of white drapery, a male dancer having made a
swift, acrobatic exit. One was slowly tightening a length of cloth about her
head; the other, a man spreadingly obese and naked (but mercifully with his
back to us), was auditioning for Lucian Freud's next study of all-too-solid
flesh. A Pendericki score accompanied these enchanting activities.
Thereafter, events were a Gadarene rush entitled Absence. Absence of what -
talent; interest; purpose - was left to us to decide.
Battening on good music is the mugger's way with dance. Jones next chose to
torment Berlioz' Nuits d'ete - in the exquisite Regine Crespin recording -
by nailing a sequence of fatuous incidents on the music's shimmering
surface. Men wore long skirts but were bare chested. Women, in tights or
little black dresses, registered grief. Jones took flash photographs of his
dancers. Posturing was epidemic. Dull mime, heavy breathing, cheap-jack
sentimentality, were the currency of a piece where every coin was false. The
finale - set, dear Heaven, to Le spectre de la rose - showed the cast in
white sheeting (the stage looked like a linen-draper's window in Hell)
trailing up-stage into the white drapery while one of the men proved that
nudity on stage is no enhancement to religiosity. This miserable scene might
pass as a beatific vision from a television evangelist: on any other terms
it was insufferable.
The two other works in the programme were equally noisome. Achilles loved
Patroclus was a solo for Arthur Aviles who shimmied and strutted among
classical columns, fragments of speech and a clattering rock score. D-Man in
the waters jumped on the Mendelssohn octet and was a survey of the cliches
in Jones' compositional kit. (Bodies rolling over the stage; hands flapping
in front of the face; feverish but unfocussed energy; portentous, hollow
gesture). It does not bear comment. The Jones manner is not about dancing at
all. It makes all the politically correct moves for our time - ethnically,
emotionally, sexually, even in its vagaries of dancers' size and skill - but
none of the moves has choreographic interest.
Bill T Jones and Company are at Sadler's Wells until April 16.

<TEXT>
Tom and Viv (15) Brian Gilbert
Widow's Peak (PG) John Irvin
Stalingrad (15) Joesph Vilsmaier
Fearless (15) Peter Weir
It is a shame that in Tom and Viv, which recounts TS Eliot's tortured
marriage to first wife Vivienne Haigh-Wood, the poetry does not extend to
the marketing campaign. 'For Better - For Worse. Forever,' simpers the
poster above a shot of Tom (Willem Dafoe) and Viv (Miranda Richardson)
canoodling in a punt. But this, we soon learn, is the kiss of betrayal. As
Eliot becomes famous, finds God and renounces the devil, he renounces his
wife too, discarding her like a first draft. It is a bit rich: Viv has
mopped his brow, rewritten his work and provided the title for 'The Waste
Land'. Less helpfully, however, she has trashed hotel rooms, embarrassed him
in public and drawn a knife on Virginia Woolf.
In Richardson's wild-eyed hand wringing performance, Viv's illness - a
hormonal imbalance which causes manic mood swings - is distressingly vivid,
though occasionally overblown. Dafoe exceeds expectations. His clipped,
repressed tones (Vincent Price meets Edward Fox) betray the bewilderment and
distaste of a man who can only communicate through his pen.
Adapted from Michael Hastings' stage play, these are complex, harrowing
emotions, handled for the most part without sentiment by director Brian
Gilbert. The finger is only pointed firmly at Eliot when Dafoe dons his
Crippen specs and, instead of his usual tactic of packing Viv off to the
sales, carts her off to the asylum. The final scenes fall foul of
bathchairs-on-the-lawn syndrome and some ropey symbolism, but does not
belittle the pain of what Viv calls 'a quarter of a century of
frightfulness'.
There is an immediate feeling of familiarity in the first scene of Widows'
Peak, as a vintage car zooms down a country lane, unsettling cap-wearing
cyclists. This hoary old device, also gainfully employed in Tom and Viv, is
a standard scene-setter for British period dramas. Having witnessed the
sepia-tinted landscape change gradually to colour, we fear the worst.
This comedy mystery is set in a 1920s Irish village, where widows are as
'plentiful as freckles on a redhead'. The indomitable Mrs Doyle Counihan
(Joan Plowright) has, inexplicably, taken impoverished spinster Miss O'Hare
(Mia Farrow) under her wing. Aha, the armchair psychiatrist exclaims. What
better way to get over her Manhattan marital misery than starring in a saga
of retribution and small-town female solidarity where a woman is not
complete until himself is six feet under? And, what is more, in a role
originally intended for Mia Farrow's mother, Maureen O'Sullivan. But,
thankfully, this is no Irish Steel Magnolias. The village is a hotbed of
tittle-tattle which erupts into no little malice. Farrow's passive persona
in Woody Allen films is pepped up by a spiteful tongue and a nice line in
anti-English vitriol. Soon, she is embroiled in a seething vendetta with
Edwina Broome (Natasha Richardson), who sets her coquettish sights on Mrs
Counihan's idle son, Godfrey (Adrian Dunbar, trying manfully to be boyish).
As insults are hurled and poison pen letters dispatched, John Irvin's
otherwise unremarkable direction makes good use of Farrow's curious mix of
innocence and obsession. Plowright holds proceedings together with
full-throated ease and there is a mischievous performance from Jim Broadbent
as Farrow's suitor.
The moral terrain is just as treacherous in Stalingrad, German director
Joseph Vilsmaier's account of the Nazis' siege which foundered amid the
frozen wilderness of the Russian winter. It is a brave film that seeks to
enlist sympathy for a batallion of stormtroopers as they set about the
locals in the name of the Fatherland.
While not an apologist, Vilsmaier is quick to draw the distinction between
the generally honourable foot soldiers ('I'm not a Nazi, Otto') and the
jack-booted sadists who command them. Betrayed by inept generals and
unfaithful wives, these men are decent sorts, albeit recruited from the
ranks of cinema's military stereotypes.
Flushed with success in Africa, the men are sent north to face slaughter at
the hands of the Red Army. Dreaming of the future as their train trundles
past innocuous fields towards an impending doom, there are already uneasy
parallels with the transportation of Jews to the death camps. Both fates,
the film suggests, are equally horrific.
Unflinching in its graphic condemnation of war, the film only loses its way
as the men lose theirs on the long march home. It is not helped by some
cheesy death scenes ('Mom, I'm sorry to leave you') and a mournful score -
all lone trumpets and soaring strings - which confuses perpetrator and
victim.
And when the closing creditsglumly inform us that only 6,000 Germans
returned from the campaign, it is difficult to suppress the blimpish
response: 'Well, you started it.'
Peter Weir's fascinating new film Fearless is about an air crash and its
effect on the lives and minds of two survivors, writes Nigel Andrews. The
movie's under-performance last year at the US box office is probably due to
its not being Airport '93.
First sin: the story begins after the crash, with the living emerging into
the smoking debris, crying out for lost loved ones. There are no scenes of
panic in the cabin, of flying food-trays or of Charlton Heston/Karen Black
wrestling with the controls. Second sin: the story then goes all
Antonioni-esque. The architect hero Max Klein ((Jeff Bridges) wanders the
landscape of his past life (wife Isabella Rossellini, children, colleagues),
sensing the new powers and 'freedoms' that his brush with death has brought.
Is he quite alive? Is he unknowingly dead? And the Hispanic girl he
befriends (Rosie Perez) who lost her baby in the crash - can he save her
from despair and misplaced guilt? Add a whole lot of Christ symbolism, from
Max's stigmata-like body wound to his very name (Max Klein - Big Little -
Father Son), and it is no wonder that popcorn-eating America fled screaming
towards Sylvester Stallone in Cliffhanger.
My advice: take a set of working brain cells and see. Occasionally the
high-symbolist seriousness becomes ponderous. But mostly, Weir's
allegorising is lightfooted and Rafael Yglesias's script, from his own
novel, is full of dark ingenuity and sly metaphysical jokes.
Peter Weir can be an maddening director. He has spent his career looping in
and out of his vocational forte - that eerie, playful pop-mysticism - like
an aeroplane receiving faulty messages from the tower. Now Picnic At Hanging
Rock and The Last Wave; now Green Card, Dead Poets Society . .
But Fearless is the real, daring thing. The screen and soundtrack shimmer
with animating uncertainty for two hours. Changing camera speeds are used to
conjure moments of scarce-perceptible slow motion; a pedestrian crossing
sign's red hand has a sudden other-worldly menace; the toys in a shopping
mall seem more 'real' than the ghostly Bridges and Perez; the babble of
voices at the crash site are interwoven with eerie cries and chitterings as
if from another planet. The style is fit to dazzle us and Bridges and Perez
keep a human pulse beating, like an ostinato, even when the style itself
threatens to overpower the drama.

FT  14 APR 94 / Technology: The message is loud and clear - Nikki Tait kicks
off a worldwide series on collaborative research between industry and
academia by looking at Australia's bionic ear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<TEXT>
In the midst of an industrial estate on Sydney's North Shore, a roomful of
technicians hunch over their workbenches. With painstaking delicacy, and
shielded in a 'clean' environment, they are hand-building the parts which
make up a bionic ear.
This is a system which can return sound to a profoundly deaf person. It
works by surgically implanting a small electronic device in bone behind the
patient's ear. Sounds are then picked up by a small microphone worn over the
ear and digitalised by an attached speech processor. The result is
transmitted to the implant, which converts the codes into electronic signals
and stimulates the hearing nerve fibres. These, in turn, send impulses to
the brain.
Cochlear, which commercialised this system, is the sort of company which
Australian politicians exult over. On the one hand, it dominates its global
market and earns most of its money overseas. On the other, it is proof that
collaborative research can pay dividends. Graeme Clark, a professor at the
University of Melbourne, supplied the initial research. The federal
government, through two commitments totalling almost ADollars 4m (Pounds
1.9m), funded the development cost up to clinical trials. Private industry
in the shape of Nucleus, Cochlear's parent (now part of Pacific Dunlop), did
the rest. Today, Mike Hirshorn, Cochlear's chief executive for
manufacturing, says royalties have more than repaid the public investment.
More than 8,000 systems have been sold.
While some countries debate the merits of collaborative research, Australia
has actively encouraged it for a decade at least. The reason is simple.
Politicians can see the attractions of building future growth on
high-technology, value-added exports, but know that Australia fares poorly
in the international research and development stakes. On average, OECD
countries spend 1.87 per cent of gross domestic product on R&amp;D. In
Australia, the figure is 1.35 per cent.
This R&amp;D weakness, however, is centred in the private sector. If amounts of
public expenditure on R&amp;D are isolated, Australia easily surpasses the OECD
average - and, in proportional terms, beats the US. A single statistic makes
the point more bluntly: as recently as 1987, only 5 per cent of Australian
manufacturing companies spent any money at all on R&amp;D.
So the need to maximise the commercial opportunities thrown up by
public-sector research is paramount. 'To a great degree, there have been
three major ideas behind the government's science and technology policy in
recent years,' remarked Senator Chris Schacht, former federal minister for
science, in last year's budget statement. One of these was 'to look for ways
which would give a better commercial return on publicly funded research'.
This commitment has led to a range of government initiatives, of which the
creation of more than 50 'co-operative research centres' is probably the
most high-profile. CRCs are formal research programmes, drawn up between
educational establishments and industry but federally funded. In most cases,
government research organisations also have an input.
An example would be the 'Cochlear CRC', which handles ongoing research
related to the implant system. Other CRC areas vary widely, from viticulture
to maritime engineering. Funding for the CRCs is targeted to reach ADollars
130m in 1996-97, when Schacht anticipates more than 60 centres.
A second initiative was the formation of the Australian Technology Group in
1992. This was designed to play an 'early stage' investment-style role
similar to that of the UK's British Technology Group. Government provided an
initial ADollars 30m budget, but expects ATG to raise future cash from the
private sector.
Simultaneously, the authorities have attempted to wring a more commercial
approach from existing public research organisations. Inevitably, the main
focus of this policy has been the country's biggest scientific research
organisation, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation, which has more than 7,000 employees spread around some 100
sites.
Back in the 1980s, CSIRO was given a 30 per cent external funding target - a
figure which it now meets, although not uniformly across all divisions.
That, in turn, has forced the organisation to take a more proactive,
'service' role towards industry.
Partly as a result of this, CSIRO has also shifted its internal priorities.
Research in the mineral resources, manufacturing and communication fields,
for example, is given more weight when the organisation considers funding
allocations, while the influence of areas like animal production and primary
products, defence and community services has declined.
These changes have not come easily, and there has been debate - both inside
and outside CSIRO - over their merits. As John Stocker, CSIRO's chief
executive, admits: 'We went out, sometimes rather naively, and touted for
and found business. In the early days, there was a real risk of
short-termism, of accepting everything that came our way, because the main
performance indicator was not the outcome (of the research), but the
achievement of the input of 30 per cent external earnings.'
But he claims that the organisation is now more 'hard-headed' about the work
it takes on. 'I guess it's gratifying that in the recent review of the
consequences of the external earnings target, it's been concluded that the
mixture of strategic research, basic research and applied research is back
to levels we had before the target was set.'
Manufacturing industry, at any rate, seems appreciative - although some
scientists do mourn the loss of informality which, they say, used to
permeate CSIRO, and the time taken up in negotiating contracts. 'In the past
few years, we've found that they're much more able to identify with industry
needs . . . and become far more open and receptive,' says ICI Australia.
Even so, no one pretends that collaborative research in Australia works
perfectly. One basic problem is the size of the domestic economy and the
small number of big corporations. Because of the home market's limitations,
many high-technology products must be exported from the outset. Finding an
Australian enterprise which has the expertise to do this is not easy.
In Cochlear's case, the authorities were successful. Nucleus drew on the
management expertise which had developed its cardiac pacemaker business,
Telelectronics, and the Cochlear team targeted the US market from the
outset. The first US implant took place in 1983, only a year after the
initial Australian trials. A Denver-based subsidiary was formed in the
following year. By 1986, US Food and Drug Administration approval for the
implant system had been secured.
By contrast, when it came to the marketing of Australia's gene shears
technology - the result of molecular biology work by CSIRO scientists, and
essentially a means of manipulating or neutralising genes - the authorities
were unable to find appropriate local partners. In the end, it was decided
to commercialise the technology in conjunction with Johnson &amp; Johnson, the
US pharmaceuticals group, and France's Groupe Limagrain.
Aware of these problems, CSIRO called in McKinsey, the management
consultants, to review its relationship with small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) last year. McKinsey found that the country's largest
research organisation interacted with only 10 per cent of SMEs, and that
even in these instances the results were mixed.
Almost 90 per cent of SMEs who had used CSIRO would recommend the research
organisation, but with qualifications. These ranged from complaints about
'intellectual aloofness' to the need for more timely responses. Some of the
comments from CSIRO employees were equally blunt. 'Lack of stability', 'too
few senior people with technical skills', and 'they want fast answers to
ill-posed problems' were some of the scientists' whinges.

FT  14 APR 94 / Technology: When chips get too close for comfort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB CAUSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 30 years since the invention of the silicon chip, researchers have
concentrated on squeezing more and more circuitry on to the chip's surface.
For the first time, they are now also beginning to worry about what happens
underneath these circuits, inside the silicon.
The goal of silicon research has been to make the transistors in the
circuits smaller. The more transistors on one chip and the faster each
works, the more each chip can do for the user.
But the transistor is basically a switch. Like a light switch, the moment it
is flicked a great deal of current starts flowing. Although the effect is
invisible inside a chip, the sparks can be big enough to affect other
transistors nearby, making them switch when they should not and possibly
causing the computer to malfunction.
This effect is called leakage and is similar to a crossed telephone line
when the electrical signals from one circuit pass on to another. As
transistors become rapidly smaller, so do the signals switched. But for
reasons to do with the physics of silicon, the sparks are not reduced at the
same rate, making leakage more and more of a problem.
In the past, leakage was cut out by building walls, called isolation, around
each transistor. But as the transistors get smaller, the part of the chip
taken up by isolation becomes excessive, so a new solution had to be found.
A number of companies now believe the answer is to put a layer of insulator
under the transistors. This is because computer models of silicon chips
suggest the leakage current goes down into the silicon before affecting
other transistors. The most common such technology is called Silicon on
Insulator or SOI.
Researchers at NTT, the Japanese telephone company, have built a number of
SOI chips. Mitsubishi engineers have used the same techniques to make
circuits for a 256Mbit memory chip. This is two generations of technology
beyond the most advanced memories used in PCs today, or about five years
ahead of the market.
European chipmakers such as SGS-Thomson and the French operation of IBM are
also developing chips based on the technique, as are Japan's Toshiba and
Motorola of the US. IBM in the US has helped set up a company called SiBond
to supply the right kind of silicon. Chenming Hu, a professor at the
University of California at Berkeley, says the technique would be vital for
chips used in battery powered systems such as personal digital assistants
like Apple's Newton.
The SOI technique does not require drastic manufacturing changes. The
difference is in the silicon wafer which the chips are made on. Instead of
pure silicon, a layer of insulator is injected below the surface of the
silicon using high energy beams. These make it relatively easy to control
the depth and thickness of the layer of insulator.
Not all chipmakers agree that SOI is the right answer, however. Researchers
at AT&amp;T's Bell Labs in the US have developed their own technique and are
sceptical about SOI's long-term usefulness. They point to damage to the
wafer which can be caused by the process of injecting the insulator as a big
drawback of SOI.
The Bell Labs technique creates two tiny areas of insulator under each
transistor rather than a layer under the surface of the whole wafer. One of
these areas has to be implanted using the same technique as SOI, but the
team believes that because it is much smaller, it will cause less damage to
the wafer. The second layer can be created using ordinary chipmaking
techniques.
As computers become more portable, what goes on inside the silicon will
matter as much as the ever-shrinking transistor on its surface.

FT  14 APR 94 / People: Cornford's charity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After five years of applying for grants for policy research and development,
James Cornford, director of the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy
Research, has decided to switch to handing out funds.
On August 1, he becomes director of the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, one of the
50 wealthiest charities in the UK.
The foundation was established in 1989 by publisher Paul Hamlyn following
the sale of his interests in the Octopus Group to Reed. His initial gift of
Pounds 50m is now worth more than Pounds 61m, with income of Pounds 4.7m in
1993 and expenditure of Pounds 3.2m.
Cornford, 59, is no stranger to handing out grants; before joining the IPPR,
he was director of the even wealthier Nuffield Foundation. Previously he was
professor of politics at Edinburgh University and has been fellow of Trinity
College, Cambridge, and All Souls, Oxford. He is also chairman of the
Campaign for Freedom of Information.
His five years at the helm of the IPPR have taken it from an idea in the
head of Neil Kinnock, the then Labour leader, to an institute with a staff
of 12 and an income last year of Pounds 0.75m.
The Hamlyn Foundation's projects reflect its founder's interests: arts,
education, book publishing and the third world.
It supports projects ranging from the Royal Opera House Westminster Week (to
encourage first-time visitors to the opera and ballet), to the Jaipur Foot
project in India which fits artificial limbs to the disabled.
The highest profile project supported by the foundation was the National
Commission on Education set up in July 1991 at the instigation of Sir Claus
Moser. This has now completed its work, giving Cornford a relatively clear
field to establish a new generation of projects.

FT  14 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Corporate zits
beware - Diane Summers looks at how to become a 'marketing excellent'
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is marketing facing a mid-life crisis? This uncomfortable question was
considered by members of The Chartered Institute of Marketing, the UK
professional body, at its annual conference this week.
If the question sounds familiar, it is because the conference was addressing
a similarly-titled, highly-critical report* from consultants McKinsey, which
argued that the marketing function must take the lead in reinventing itself.
The McKinsey critique, published last year, was damning from the first
paragraph: 'Whatever the reality behind marketing's vaunted contribution to
corporate success, the large budgets it has enjoyed for decades are finally
beginning to attract attention - even criticism. So much so, in fact, that
doubts are surfacing about the very basis of contemporary marketing: the
value of ever more costly brand advertising, which often dwells on seemingly
irrelevant points of difference; of promotions, which are often just a fancy
name for price cutting; and of large marketing departments, which, far from
being an asset, are often a millstone around an organisation's neck.'
Marketing's bad press has continued in recent months. One respondent to a
survey** in December from accountants and consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand
said: 'In my 10 years as managing director, the marketing department has
kept on growing but I'm not quite sure why.'
The survey of the marketing and managing directors in 100 of the largest
companies found marketing departments lacked accountability and were not
involved in activities central to companies' success. Fewer than half of the
marketing departments surveyed were responsible for the development of
pricing strategies, while only a quarter had responsibility for customer
service; only 42 per cent were involved in just-in-time programmes and 31
per cent in total quality initiatives.
Alarmed by these critiques, The Chartered Institute of Marketing
commissioned Cranfield School of Management's Centre for Advanced Research
in Marketing to examine the mid-life crisis question and present the
findings to the institute's conference.*** Over five months, Cranfield
reviewed the literature, questioned leading academics and consultants in the
field, and spent at least six hours with each of 15 companies judged to be
'excellent' in marketing terms. The decision was made largely to steer clear
of the fast-moving consumer goods companies which normally get all the
attention.
Malcolm McDonald, who led the Cranfield research, told delegates that four
decades of marketing appeared to have had little impact on British business:
for most companies, marketing remained synonymous with promotion and
selling, rather than integral to all-pervading, customer-geared philosophy
and practice, as it was in 'marketing excellent' companies.
Some organisations have acquired the veneer and vocabulary of marketing,
said McDonald, but their marketing departments operate at the periphery.
Such a department, he said, drawing a circle and sticking a blob on its
circumference, is like a 'corporate zit'. He is disdainful of the
organisations which fail to understand their customers, provide them with an
unsatisfactory product or service and then expect a marketing department to
'sprinkle a bit of magic marketing dust' on at the end of the process.
One trend noted in the Cranfield study was for 'excellent' companies to do
away with marketing departments altogether and marketing professionals to be
integrated into multi-disciplinary teams organised around processes or
customers.
This process is being speeded by the current fashion of 'business process
re-engineering', or 'redesign' - a concept which aims to do away with
organisations' 'functional barons', radically redesign business processes
and eliminate the 'waiting time' as departments pass partly-finished jobs to
each other. AT&amp;T Global Information Systems, Boots Healthcare International
and Standard Life are all examples, says McDonald, of companies moving away
from the single marketing department.
Cranfield found the 'excellent' companies had other features in common which
could be summarised to form a checklist of how to become 'truly
market-orientated':
Start at the top - strong leadership and commitment to customer focus at the
top of the organisation is indispensable;
Involve everyone in the organisation in the marketing philosophy;
Be prepared for structural change;
Use the new structure to feed a 'customer facing strategy';
Review marketing tactics to see whether the 'four Ps' - product, price,
promotion and place - work from the customers' point of view;
Accept that change is a way of life;
Understand the difference between quality systems and quality products or
services;
Focus on the customer, not the competition;
Look at 'end-to-end', not piecemeal processes - the customer should
experience seamless service;
Keep the end user in sight. Do not become distracted by the middleman;
Measure the success of the marketing approach and be able to demonstrate the
link between customer focus and profit.
Far from being in a mid-life crisis, McDonald concludes that marketing is
'somewhere between childhood and adolescence'. Marketing has not failed -
for most companies, it has yet to be tried.

'marketing excellent' companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the 'marketing excellent' companies selected by Cranfield was Land
Rover, part of the Rover Group. Everyone who buys a Discovery (above),
Defender or Range Rover gets a telephone call or a postal questionnaire
asking about the product and service they have received.
The boundaries between engineering and marketing are being blurred through
training: recruits are expected to have practical experience of assembling
work, as well as marketing. Even Land Rover's security man in the UK, on
duty over Christmas, was able to deal with a Defender driver stranded in
Croatia. An ex-sapper himself, he arranged for spare parts to be despatched
and talked the driver through their fitting.
The other companies studied for the report are: In the service sector:
Allied Dunbar; British Airways; British Telecommunications; Rentokil;
Standard Life. In consumer manufacturing: Black &amp; Decker; Boots Healthcare
International; Johnson &amp; Johnson; SmithKline Beecham; Sony (UK); In
industrial manufacturing and distribution: AT&amp;T Global Information
Solutions; Electrospeed; Renishaw; Rolls-Royce Aero Engines.

FT  14 APR 94 / People: New Clerical chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Next week, after 30 years as a non-executive director of Clerical Medical,
Michael Hamilton (below) will take over as chairman of the mutual life
insurer.
Formerly senior partner at City law firm Taylor Garrett - now part of Taylor
Joynson Garrett - his long association with Clerical Medical began when he
was invited to join the board by Lord Geddes, then chairman, for whom he had
done some work on shipbuilding contracts.
Hamilton does not intend to emulate the 15 years-plus in the chair of Sir
Douglas Morpeth, his predecessor, expecting instead to retire in three
years' time when he is 70. He estimates his new role will take up one to two
days a week.
While Clerical Medical still regards its main distribution channel as
independent financial advisers, it is also in the process of building up a
direct sales force, though this is still in a pilot stage at present.
Hamilton sees the direct sales force and prospects for doing business
overseas as the main areas of opportunity for the company in the coming
years.
The main problem he feels is keeping costs down - both in terms of the
company and also in ensuring that the regulatory regime for life companies
is itself cost-effective.

FT  14 APR 94 / Accountancy Column: Standard setting not the panacea for all
ills - Gerry Acher argues that business life is too complex for prescriptive
rules to override personal judgment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERRY ACHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today, the Accounting Standards Board has published FRS 5, the standard
primarily designed to curb off-balance sheet finance. It reflects how
accounting judgment is rapidly taking second place to prescriptive rules.
By comparison with earlier standards - even SSAP 16, which introduced
current cost accounting and an entirely different system of profit
measurement - this standard is of colossal length, albeit much in the form
of application notes.
Business life is far more complex than the one dimensional approach of
double entry bookkeeping. Very few accounting facts can be expressed in
black and white. The function of the accountant is to communicate the
colourful reality to a particular audience in an honest way that makes sense
to them and enables them to make informed decisions.
The process of standard setting started innocently enough more than two
decades ago. Because of the complexities of business, it was possible to
adopt a number of completely different, but arguably equally acceptable,
ways of looking at the same result. Some narrowing of the range was
desirable.
But this perfectly reasonable process is increasingly in danger of
transformation into an ever expanding 'cook book' exercise in which it is
more important to observe the rules than it is to get the message across.
One has only to look at the example of the leasing standard, SSAP 21, and
the distinction it makes between finance leases (which feature on the
lessee's balance sheet) and operating leases (which do not).
What it actually says is that the criteria for a finance lease should be
presumed to apply if the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts
to 'substantially all' the fair value of the leased asset. It says that
'substantially all' will normally mean 90 per cent or more. In practice, the
figure is taken as an absolute barrier, and almost limitless effort is
expended in order not to breach it. This is not what judgment, still less
auditing, is all about.
The US experience of goodwill is another example of the way in which a
detailed standard degenerates into a mechanistic approach. Under US GAAP,
goodwill is capitalised and amortised, over a period not exceeding 40 years.
Of course, practically everyone opts for the longest possible period,
relying on the standard for support. It has taken the Securities and
Exchange Commission, a much more interventionist regulator than exists in
the UK, to force certain types of company to use a shorter period.
A number of factors have contributed to this cook book situation. One could
look to Brussels as a convenient bogey, with its directive-driven mentality.
But the fault, I am afraid, is much nearer to home and lies with
professional accountants.
The process of preparing and auditing accounts varies in its nature. In many
cases, there is a relationship of mutual respect between management and
auditors, who see their joint objective as that of arriving at audited
accounts which best reflect the activities of the company.
In others, the process involves a degree of tension. Managements wish to
emphasise their successes and to minimise their failures. It is one of the
auditors' roles to moderate this tendency and to ensure that a more balanced
picture is presented.
It is sometimes forgotten that it is the duty of the directors to present a
proper account of their actions to the owners of their business, the
shareholders. Equally, auditors have retreated from their task. The
existence of an increasing body of standards has provided a crutch for lazy
minds.
There arises a perception that as long as you comply with the standards, the
accounts must be 'right' and, more dangerously, it risks an attitude that if
there is no rule against a treatment, then it must be acceptable. Quite
apart from the fact that the standards we have are by no means a
comprehensive set of principles, this is an abdication of judgment. More
attempts by the standard setters to produce a comprehensive set of
instructions will simply encourage us to fall into this trap.
In the days before we had accounting standards, the 'true and fair' view was
paramount and weighed heavily in auditors' minds. Since then, we have
allowed the audit to become an exercise in compliance, a checklist to be
completed, rather than an endorsement of the way commercial and financial
judgments are presented. This is totally wrong: the independent attestation
of financial reports is fundamental to the efficient operation of our
economic system.
I see FRS 5 as a watershed. It is not the fault of the Accounting Standards
Board. Indeed, David Tweedie, its chairman, is on record as saying that the
standard was only as long as it has turned out to be because of pressure
from the accounting firms. This pressure simply represents the demand from
audit partners for rules which they can turn to when confronted with a
difficult situation.
We can either move further towards a US system, where fair presentation
simply means that accounts comply with the rules, or we can try to
revitalise the process of financial reporting so that judgment has a greater
role to play and the myriad facets of a business are synthesised into
something more than the sum of a cook book's parts. We, as auditors, have to
convince the financial community that we have the qualities to exercise the
judgments required, in a proper, timely and consistent way.
I am not looking to reverse the clock. Business life evolves continually,
and accounting must do so too. Today's complexities were unthought of 20
years ago. But I would much rather my intelligence was taxed and I was able
to make a positive contribution to financial reporting, than my role should
be reduced simply to checking that all the rules have been observed - and to
hell with the result.
Can this be accomplished? The precedents are not encouraging. If we are to
achieve the necessary change in attitude and approach, directors must
remember their reporting responsibilities as stewards, rather than as
management, and auditors must be worthy of the respect their responsibility
entails.
The auditing profession has already moved a considerable way towards this
objective. As a profession we have made mistakes in the past, but the
accounting firms are putting their houses in order. I sense a new awareness
of the importance of auditing even at the potential expense of new jobs and
the top line.
In my firm as in others, senior partners review difficult issues and poor
judgment is not tolerated. We need to build on our philosophy and encourage
robustness of opinion, based on proper consideration of the facts and not on
truculence.
Externally, the workings of the Financial Reporting Review Panel have at
least made people pause for thought, although I have to say that the way the
panel's remit is phrased, and the approach it often adopts, is far too rule
book-driven for my taste.
I am by no means certain that this change can be accomplished. I am much
more certain that if we, collectively, do not attempt to change direction
now, the juggernaut will gather even more momentum and we will never be able
to get off the path that we are presently following towards a cook book of
rules, and ultimately more interventionist regulators as we have seen
elsewhere.
It is up to auditors, directors and regulators to decide if they are up to
making the necessary effort of will. My opposite numbers in the accounting
firms, the 100 Group of finance directors and the ASB, will all have a
central role to play. If we fail, we will be all the poorer as a result.

FT  14 APR 94 / Lancer draws bid interest: Receivers 'hands tied' without
control of whole lift-truck group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Grant Thornton, administrative receivers for the UK operations of Lancer
Boss, said last night that considerable interest had been expressed from
potential bidders, but that its hands were tied by not having control of the
whole lift-truck group.
Meanwhile Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told MPs at
question time yesterday that ministers and officials had already been in
touch with both the company and the receivers.
'My department will do all it can to assist, but it cannot become involved
in the receiver's administration of the case,' he said. 'However, there does
seem to be a good possibility of an offer being made for the Lancer Boss
group as a whole.'
It is understood that an unidentified UK company has made a bid for Lancer
Boss, and another bid is expected today. Receivers would also not deny the
existence of a bid based on a 'management buy-in' - like a buy-out but
involving outside managers. It is believed former Lancer Boss executives may
be involved in the buy-in.
JC Bamford, the UK's largest construction equipment producer, would not
comment on the receivership.
Some observers have suggested that JCB would welcome the opportunity to
expand its materials-handling business, but it is believed the company is
not interested in bidding.
In Brussels, Komatsu Forklift said it was watching the situation very
closely and had been in contact with the receiver, but had not made a bid.
Lancer Boss makes engined lift-trucks for Komatsu at Leighton Buzzard and
electric trucks for the Japanese group at the struggling Steinbock Boss unit
near Munich.
Grant Thornton pointed out last night that all the serious bids were for the
whole group. However, the administration of Steinbock Boss, from which
German banks withdrew facilities last week, is being handled by a German
lawyer, Mr Werner Fogel, based at Freising near Munich.
The difficulties of the UK receivers were underlined yesterday when
Bayerische Hypo-Bank, which led the group of German banks that funded
Steinbock Boss, said it hoped Mr Fogel could resolve the future of the
German unit by the end of this week.
This would probably be achieved through the takeover of Steinbock Boss by
Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck producer. Last night Jungheinrich
said it would offer to buy Steinbock Boss and that its supervisory board had
endorsed a draft takeover bid. Industry sources said Mr Fogel may decide on
the offer today.
Hypo-Bank also denied the accusation by Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, chairman of
Lancer Boss before the receivership, that the German banking group acted
precipitately in withdrawing facilities from Steinbock Boss. 'After weeks
and months of negotiations, you can't say it was too hasty,' it said.

FT  14 APR 94 / Black cab revisited
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest design for a London taxi hit the road yesterday (above). But its
design is far from futuristic - it is inspired by a 1930s taxi.
Asquith Motor Carriage Company, which makes the new taxi, aims to combine
1930s style with 1990s comfort in the cab. The new taxi - which will cost
about Pounds 30,000 - boasts air suspension, power steering and a Ford
gear-box.
But perhaps most importantly for London's taxi drivers, the new Asquith can
still turn in a 25-foot circle. The new taxi, built in Essex, joins the two
other designs - the 1950s Austin FX4 and the Metrocab - on the streets of
London.

FT  14 APR 94 / Van and truck purchases up 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
New commercial vehicle sales rose 28 per cent in March, accelerating the
recovery which began late last year.
The commercial vehicle sector has previously lagged the recovery in new car
sales, but figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show
that activity is now picking up strongly in most parts of the market.
New commercial vehicle registrations rose 12.7 per cent in the first three
months this year to 56,602 from 50,244 in the corresponding period a year
ago.
In March alone registrations jumped to 22,648 from 17,741 a year earlier.
The market was depressed early last year by the collapse of Daf, the Dutch
commercial vehicle maker.
The recovery in commercial vehicle sales has been led by the heavy-truck
market (above 16 tonnes gross vehicle weight), where registrations rose 34
per cent in the first three months this year to 5,368.
Sales are also picking up in the lighter vehicle areas as confidence
improves in the small business sector.
Registrations of light vans, the weakest area last year, rose 10 per cent in
the first three months to 19,000. Sales of medium and heavy vans - such as
the Ford Transit - increased 15 per cent to 23,700.
Ford, the leader of the UK light commercial vehicle market, has lost ground
in the light and medium van segments in the first quarter.
Renault of France is strongly increasing its market share for light vans,
while both Leyland Daf Vans and Mercedes-Benz have increased their sales of
medium and heavy panel vans.
Leyland Daf Vans, which was rescued by a management buy-out a year ago, is
regaining some ground lost after the collapse of the Daf group. In the first
three months this year it has increased its sales by 69 per cent in an area
of the market which has grown 15 per cent. It has increased its market share
to 11.3 per cent from 7.7 per cent a year ago.
Most commercial vehicle markets in west Europe are still in recession, and
European truckmakers have intensified their efforts in the UK.
MAN, the German truckmaker, increased its sales of heavy trucks in Britain
by 75 per cent in the first quarter, while Iveco of Italy raised its
registrations by 50 per cent.
The demise of Daf, the former UK truck market leader, has left Iveco, the
commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat, as the dominant truck group in the
UK market, with 26 per cent in the first three months.

FT  14 APR 94 / Companies expect sales to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies are highly optimistic about prospects for increased sales and new
orders in spite of fears that this year's tax increases might damage the
recovery, according to a new survey by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business
information company.
Like many other business surveys, Dun &amp; Bradstreet calculates its figures by
subtracting the percentage of respondents forecasting a decrease in a
variable, from those predicting an increase.
The balance of companies expecting an increase in net sales over the next
three months is 60 per cent - its highest level since the second quarter of
1989.
The balance of companies expecting an increase in net new orders, the
balance is 56 per cent, up from 41 per cent in the first quarter of 1994.
The survey also reveals a revival in the fortunes of the construction
sector. Of 200 construction companies surveyed, 70 per cent expect sales to
be higher over the next quarter.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet's figures on inflationary pressure are somewhat
contradictory.
The balance of companies expecting to increase prices over the next three
months, at 23 per cent, has increased only slightly on the 20 per cent
recorded in the previous quarter.
More than six out of 10 retailers intend, either to keep their prices at the
same level, or reduce them.
However, among retailers, the balance expecting to increase prices over the
next three months was 34 per cent, up sharply from 23 per cent in the
previous quarter.
Mr Philip Mellor, senior analyst at Dun &amp; Bradstreet said: 'Companies are
well aware that the recovery is too weak to pass increases in costs on to
the customer. Consequently, profit margins are being sacrificed in a bid to
offset price rises.'
In general, companies were less optimistic about profits than about sales or
new orders in the next three months.
A balance of 42 per cent of companies expected to increase profits over the
next three months, up only slightly from the 41 per cent recorded in the
first quarter.
On employment, a balance of 27 per cent of companies expects to take on new
staff, the highest figure since the third quarter of 1989.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet questioned more than 2,000 managing directors between March
18 and March 28.

FT  14 APR 94 / Tyne's workforce falls to record low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tyne and Wear's economy outperformed the national average in the early part
of the recession, but setbacks in 1992-93 have resulted in the number of
employees in the county dropping to a post-war record low of 418,100, says a
report published yesterday.
The study, by the Tyne and Wear Research and Intelligence Unit, suggests the
county's official unemployment rate - 13.4 per cent in January - is a
substantial underestimate.
It argues that if 32,100 training scheme participants, under-18s and older
job-hunters ineligible for benefits are added to the 70,100 official jobless
claimants, the unemployment rate rises to 19.5 per cent of a labour force of
523,200.
Tyne and Wear's GDP grew by 5 per cent, against a 2 per cent UK decline, to
Pounds 8,734m during 1989/1991; manufacturing output grew 1 per cent and
productivity 4 per cent, against national falls of 14 per cent and 7 per
cent. Output per head rose from 84.9 per cent to 91.5 per cent of the UK
average.
But, the report says, between mid-1992 and mid-1993 the county lost 12,000
jobs, 2.8 per cent of its total across all industrial sectors. The UK figure
was 2.3 per cent.
