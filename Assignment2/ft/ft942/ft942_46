FT  14 APR 94 / Impetus grows for working mothers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Single mothers will have a greater incentive to seek employment by the end
of the decade, according to a survey by the Equal Opportunities Commission.
The activities of the Child Support Agency will increase maintenance
payments to single mothers while reducing their dependence on state
benefits. This will bring tax advantages for those who work, the survey
says.
Women will make up nearly half the labour force by the end of the decade,
with a net growth of 500,000 over the next six years. But the survey adds
that most women will be in low-paid, low-status jobs.
The report shows that women's independent income is half that of men, while
two-thirds of adults in the poorest households are women.
Women are likely to account for 38 per cent of Britain's managers and
administrators, 41 per cent of professionals and 53 per cent of associated
professional and technical workers by 2000.
The survey forecasts no employment growth for ethnic minority women, because
they are likely to seek jobs in decaying industries in inner cities, but
also because of racial and gender discrimination.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has agreed terms with Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance
group, to provide support for reinsuring short-term political risk cover for
exporters.
When the government privatised the short-term credit businesses of the
Export Credits Guarantee Department it said it would withdraw entirely from
supplying reinsurance support.

FT  14 APR 94 / Teleworking gains popularity slowly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Teleworking - working from home using computing or telecommunications
equipment - remains a minority activity but is gaining in popularity,
Incomes Data Services, the pay and employment analysts, said.
In a report IDS said that the consensus view is that between 5 per cent and
15 per cent of organisations employ staff who spend at least half of their
working time at home.

FT  14 APR 94 / Temps boost labour market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Temporary employment has held up much better through the recession than
permanent jobs, according to an employment index published published
yesterday by Reed personnel services.
The index shows that demand for permanent jobs fell to a low of 28 in the
fourth quarter of 1992 from a base of 100 in the first quarter of 1990. The
index now stands at 43.
The lowest demand for temporary staff, recorded in the first quarter of
1992, was 65. The figure for temporary staff is now higher than the 1990
base point.
Reed said this confirms temporary staff as a significant part of the labour
force.

FT  14 APR 94 / MoD settles Airwork dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ministry of Defence said yesterday it had settled its latest dispute
with Airwork, a military maintenance company based in Birmingham, over the
unsatisfactory execution of a contract to upgrade Hercules transport
aircraft.
It said flaws in the company's work, identified four months ago, had been
ironed out and the contract would be properly completed next month, with no
extra cost to the ministry.
The problem over the Hercules was the second between Airwork and the
ministry.
The latest dispute is seen as an embarrassment to the government at a time
when it is proclaiming the need to increase efficiency by making greater use
of civilian contractors.

FT  14 APR 94 / CBI backs insolvency law move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday said 500 companies could be
saved each year if insolvency laws were revised, Jenny Luesby writes.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, backed the government's aim of
introducing a more flexible insolvency procedure, saying 'every possible
step' should be taken to keep good companies afloat.
'The economy cannot afford to lose firms which a more sympathetic approach
would save,' he said.
The DTI has suggested that companies should be able to declare a moratorium
for 28 days while they tried to arrange creditor terms for at least 75 per
cent of their debts.
The CBI backed the idea of a moratorium, but suggested that companies should
be able to extend the initial 28 days to a period of up to six months,
rather than the maximum three months proposed by the DTI.

FT  14 APR 94 / British Coal makes new offer to Tower miners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal last night made a new offer to miners at the Tower colliery,
the last deep mine, in South Wales to continue working at reduced wages with
higher production targets. The men are due to consider the offer at a mass
meeting today, Roland Adburgham writes.
This emerged after it was announced that an extra Pounds 10.8m is to be
spent in Cynon Valley, Mid Glamorgan, to counter the impact of the
colliery's closure.
Miners voted last Saturday to reject British Coal's redundancy terms and
instead to seek a formal review of the closure. The mine's shutdown is
threatened for tomorrow with the loss of 200 jobs.
The Welsh Development Agency is allocating the extra money to the Cynon
Valley joint venture, a regeneration partnership with the borough council
and Mid Glamorgan County Council.
The funding is an increase of 63 per cent on the WDA's planned expenditure
in the valley over the next two years. It is intended to accelerate job
creation.
The joint venture said yesterday that its priority was to encourage
companies to relocate to the valley.
A second fund would help local businesses to expand and develop. Existing
programmes will be speeded up, especially improvements to the valley's road
communications; and a skills training programme will be targeted at
unemployed young people.
Meanwhile, it emerged that miners at Tower may try to run it privately.

FT  14 APR 94 / Unionists flinch at Mayhew remarks on IRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Assurances from Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, that the IRA
will not be expected to 'surrender' in order to join the peace process
provoked a political row in the province yesterday.
While firmly restating London's insistence on a permanent cessation of IRA
violence, Sir Patrick aimed to encourage republicans to enter the peace
process in a speech to the Foreign Policy Association in New York. He said
an end to the armed conflict in Ulster was 'not going to require any
surrender'.
The recent three-day ceasefire was not enough, said Sir Patrick, and he made
clear that any similar gestures - hinted at by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein
president - would also be dismissed. He stressed that if Sinn Fein renounced
its support for violence and delivered an end to armed action it would
within three months join exploratory talks leading it to a full role in the
democratic process.
His remarks were being seen last night as recognition of the need to enable
the republican movement to extract itself from violence without having to
concede defeat.
Downing Street insisted they did not change government policy 'one iota',
however. The Downing Street declaration did not require any party to give up
its aspirations or beliefs but simply to renounce violence as a means of
pursuing them, it said.
Sir Patrick's measured comments, in which he also acknowledged Sinn Fein's
electoral mandate in the province, drew condemnation from unionists. Mr
David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said the speech undermined
the government's integrity and would create 'confusion and alarm' among
Ulster's law-abiding majority.
Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, said the remarks were 'ill-judged'.
Mr Nigel Dodds, secretary of the Democratic Unionist party, said he was
alarmed that Sir Patrick should send signals to terrorists saying they need
not surrender. 'It confirms our view that the government is not in the
business of seeking to defeat the IRA at all,' he said.
The speech was given a qualified welcome by Mr Tom Hartley, national
chairman of Sinn Fein, who said it appeared to recognise 'the reality that
there will be no unilateral surrenders by any side'.
Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party,
also welcomed Sir Patrick's remarks, saying they were in accordance with the
declaration.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he had always maintained
there was no question of a military victory or a military defeat for either
side. The road to a just solution could be 'long, slow and painful,' he
acknowledged.
The Commons Northern Ireland committee meets today for the first time and is
expected to elect Sir James Kilfedder, leader of the Ulster Popular Unionist
party, as chairman.

FT  14 APR 94 / For sale: fossilised industry, one owner - Its market and
profits are shrinking but British Coal will find a buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one of Britain's most politically sensitive industries, it is
frequently lossmaking, and its markets are shrinking fast. So who would want
to buy British Coal?
The government, which started marketing the company yesterday, will not be
spoilt for choice when it comes to choosing who to sell to later this year.
Yet there are enough potential buyers around to suggest that, much to the
disappointment of privatisation's opponents, the government will be able to
sell.
The proceeds for the taxpayer will not be great compared with previous
privatisations; certainly less than Pounds 1bn and perhaps less than Pounds
500m. But making money is not the government's prime motive.
It wants rid of an industry that has caused it constant political problems -
the latest was the 1992 furore over pit closures - and which it believes
would be far better run in the private sector.
That view is shared by Mr Richard Budge and Mr Malcolm Edwards whose
companies, RJB Mining and Coal Investments, are mining, or intend to mine,
seven pits closed by British Coal in the last year.
If they are right in their belief that they can make the pits profitable,
the same improvements would presumably be possible at the 16 deep mines and
31 opencast sites put up for sale by the government yesterday.
The attractions of the package are further enhanced by their shares of
contracts with the generators of 30m tonnes a year to 1998.
Mr Edwards is wary of the liabilities attached to the pits being put up for
sale, which he says are more onerous than those at the four former British
Coal pits he will mine under leasing arrangements. It is uncertain that he
will bid for any of the packages.
RJB is one of the few companies thought to be considering putting in tenders
for all five packages. Hanson and RTZ, the two UK companies with the biggest
investment in coal, all of it abroad, express doubts privately about joining
the bidding. That may be a negotiating ploy, but analysts believe they are
serious.
Other than RJB, Hanson, and RTZ, few UK companies are capable of bidding for
and managing all the regions. It was partly for this reason that the
government ignored the pleading by British Coal that the industry be sold as
one company. Selling it in five chunks enables smaller companies to join in
the bidding.
Each of the five regions is thus likely to attract at least one bid.
The Scottish region is considered one of the most attractive. Mining
(Scotland), a consortium of several companies, and Scotcoal, a joint venture
between Miller Group, a construction and mining company, and Ryan Group, a
coal producer, have already declared they are likely to bid.
Ryan has also formed a joint venture, with Canadian aluminium company Alcan,
to consider a bid for the north-east region, where Caledonian Mining has
also expressed an interest.
Ryan is also said to be looking at south Wales, where it may face opposition
from a local buyout team. Mr Bob Siddall, director of British Coal's
opencast operation, may lead a bid for the central north and central south
regions.
For central north, comprising mainly pits in Yorkshire, he may be opposed by
Mr Alan Houghton, regional director. A consortium including the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers and and Jim Walter Resources, may also bid.
Jim Walter and Alcan are the only overseas companies so far to have
expressed interest. The government and NM Rothschild, the merchant bank
advising it, aim to remedy that within months by a marketing drive focusing
on the US.
They have their work cut out. Australian companies prefer to invest in Asia,
South African companies lack the cash to bid, and US companies such as
Ziegler, Consol and Cypress Amax appear unenthusiastic. The US is wary of
buying into an industry perceived abroad as problematic for its industrial
relations following the 1984-85 strike.
US companies have their own problems with rationalisation. They and their
investors are also acutely aware that all the UK mines' contracts with
electricity generators end in 1998. That bewilders a country where power
contracts are negotiated on a rolling basis with several contracts on
different timescales.
Rothschild's task will be to persuade the likes of Consol and Cypress Amax
that the generators will need large quantities of coal after 1998 and,
provided UK mine owners can trim costs, that they will want mainly British
coal.
If Rothschild fails to convince overseas companies, ministers can take
comfort that they will avoid a row about selling UK industry abroad. The
drawback would be that the sales price of the five regions will be lower.
British Coal will in any case be sold.

FROM NATIONALISATION TO PRIVATISATION
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
January 1947: Coal industry taken into state ownership under the
National Coal Board
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1950: First Plan for Coal envisages output at 240m tonnes a year by 1965
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1954: Annual production at its peak: more than 223m tonnes mined from
867 collieries
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1963: NCB sets objective of breaking even after paying interest and
making 'proper provision' for depreciation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1972: Seven-week national strike over pay. Substantial damage to
industry requires huge capital injection from government. Coal Industry
Act 1973 writes off deficit and provides further grants
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1973: Plan for Coal drawn up by National Coal Board and endorsed by
government in 1974 seeks to recapture markets from oil as world oil
prices rise sharply. Plan sees output increasing to 135m tonnes by 1985
and aims to reverse decline through investment at long-life and new
collieries
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1974: Month-long national strike over pay. Further government cash
injections required, together with large price increase. Edward Heath
loses general election called during strike and three-day week
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1979-80: Second oil price rise makes coal prices more competitive, but
recession hits demand and by middle eighties imported coal, natural gas
and oil more attractive
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1984-5: Year-long pit strike follows election of Arthur Scargill as
president of National Union of Mineworkers in 1981
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
March 1987: NCB name formally changed to British Coal
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1988: Energy secretary Cecil Parkinson announces government plans for
the 'ultimate privatisation' of the coal industry
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
1990: Electricity industry privatised, giving power companies more
freedom about choice of energy for generation. Coal suffers as a result
October 1992 Government announces closure of three-fifths of remaining
50 pits following growth in market share of nuclear power and emergence
of gas as leading generation fuel. Outcry fails to stop closures but
delays privatisation
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
March 1994: Production tops 12 tonnes per per man shift, compared with
two tonnes in 1984
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
April 13: Government puts five regional packages on market in spite of
British Coal's fears that splitting the company will weaken the industry
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
May 25: Deadline for preliminary applications
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Early June: Fuller sales details to be published
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mid-September: Submission of bids
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
End December: Completion of sales
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

FT  14 APR 94 / New rule outlaws 'creative' accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies will be forced to include substantial concealed liabilities in
their accounts under a new accounting standard published yesterday.
FRS 5, the fifth financial reporting standard from the Accounting Standards
Board, clamps down on 'off-balance-sheet' finance, one of the most important
elements of 'creative' accounting employed during the 1980s.
Under the standard, companies' transactions must reflect their substance and
not simply be recorded in accordance with their legal form.
The document is 140 pages long, although Mr David Tweedie, chairman,
stressed that the standard itself was just a few pages. The rest is detailed
notes specifying the treatment of a number of off-balance-sheet vehicles.
He said that he would have preferred to keep simply to the 'spirit' of the
standard, but that pressure from accounting firms had forced inclusion of
more detailed guidelines.
He also warned that the Accounting Standards Board would clamp down on any
attempts by companies to evade the new standard by devising new vehicles
which attempted to avoid the spirit of the rules.
He said it would raise any such transactions with its urgent issues
taskforce, consider reissuing an amended standard and would refer any
companies introducing such schemes to the Financial Reporting Review Panel,
the accounts watchdog.
Among the transactions discussed in detail are consignment stock, sale and
repurchase agreements, factoring, securitised assets and loan transfers.
At the heart of the standard is the need to recognise on the balance sheet
any assets or liabilities of the company as defined in the board's statement
of principles.
Assets are defined as rights to future economic benefits controlled by an
entity; and liabilities as an entity's obligations to transfer economic
benefits.
Mr Tweedie said: 'Off-balance-sheet schemes often involve complex
arrangements that can obscure the true extent of a company's borrowings and
the assets and activities they finance. Such schemes can also be used to
generate a false profit on the so-called sale that is in reality a
financing.'
FRS 5 broadly follows the proposals made the financial reporting exposure
draft on the subject issued last year.
One difference, however, is that companies will be permitted to offset the
debtor or creditor amounts outstanding with a counterparty if they are
denominated in different hard currencies or interest rates calculated on
different bases.
Strict criteria previously proposed for when assets cease to be recognised
in the accounts have also been relaxed.

FT  14 APR 94 / Right urges fresh DSS cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rightwing Conservative MPs are renewing pressure on the Department of Social
Security to cut spending, claiming moves to contain expenditure on state
benefits have not gone far enough.
In a policy paper Mr Iain Duncan-Smith, MP for Chingford, calls for an end
to universal state benefits and a new drive on private pension provision.
The paper, Social Security - Time for a Revolution, follows a similar paper
from the Adam Smith Institute in February, and reflects Tory rightwingers'
growing concern that the government is backing down on its commitment to cut
public expenditure.
Mr Duncan Smith,a member of the No Turning Back Group of neo-Thatcherite
Tories, said yesterday: 'There is an assumption that we have been cutting
social services for years. But the reality is that we are actually
increasing spending.'
The government has introduced greater targeting of benefits for invalids and
the unemployed and abolished the statutory sick pay subsidy for large
employers. However, the DSS budget is still projected to increase between
1994 and 1997.
The pamphlet calls for a single income-assessed benefit, to replace the many
benefits currently available.
It also calls for the abolition of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme
(Serps) and reform of National Insurance Contributions.

<TEXT>
The decision to publish the minutes of the monthly meetings between the
chancellor and the governor was broadly welcomed by politicians.
Downing Street said the measure was meant to introduce greater transparency
and promote a better understanding of the way in which monetary policy is
made.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the minutes proved that his claims
of a rift between the chancellor and the governor were true.
There was 'confusion and disarray' over the government's economic policy, he
said. He added: 'These minutes leave the chancellor as someone who is
exposed and who does not know where he is going in economic policy.'
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour City spokesman, said the decision would be
welcomed provided that future minutes were 'full and extensive'.
Mr Giles Radice, a senior Labour member of the Treasury and civil service
select committee, said it was a 'useful improvement'. Mr Nigel Forman, a
Tory member of the committee, said it was 'an excellent step forward'.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, the Tory Euro-sceptic who is a frequent critic of the
Treasury, said the move would 'help clear away a few cobwebs'. Mr Alan
Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said publication should
'discourage bad interest rate decisions'.

FT  14 APR 94 / Political donations charter outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Proposals for governing company donations to political parties, including
the establishment of a political fund controlled by small shareholders, were
yesterday outlined by the Labour party.
Labour's charter for political funding was issued as the Commons home
affairs committee published its own report on political funding. The report
effectively split the committee along party political lines.
The Conservative majority on the committee published a report recommending
few changes except for a new code of conduct and the possible use of a civil
servant for each political party represented in parliament.
The Tory MPs were accused by Labour of 'hiding behind a weak code of
conduct' to prevent embarrassing their party, which has received millions of
pounds from companies.
Mr Chris Mullin, supported by the Labour MPs on the home affairs committee,
published a minority report which advocates that all donations of more than
Pounds 5,000 in one financial year should be published with the annual
accounts of political parties. 'The issue of funding of political parties is
an area of darkness into which the Conservatives on the committee did not
want to travel,' he said.
The political row intensified as Downing Street conceded that it did not
charge the Conservative Party for the use of its facilities.
Sir Ivan Lawrence, the Conservative chairman of the home affairs committee,
said he could see no reason to tighten the rules on the use of Downing
Street since the use of it by political parties was 'open and transparent'.
However, Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry secretary, said:
'I am serving notice on the Conservative party that we shall be closing down
the loopholes that have permitted company directors to hand over vast sums
of corporate money, with virtually no accountability.'
Committing the party to introducing statutory regulation of corporate
political donations, he advocated state funding of political parties; strict
limits on spending by each party; a ban on foreign donations; and published
accounts listing donations.
By these proposals, companies wishing to give money to political parties
would be required to establish a political fund which would have to be
supported by shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Contributions to the fund could only be made out of funds set aside for the
dividend.

FT  14 APR 94 / Major backs 'exceptional' Commons lies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister has for the first time publicly backed a recent claim by
Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for open government, that
ministers can lie to the Commons in exceptional circumstances.
In a letter to Mr Giles Radice, the Labour MP for Durham North, Mr John
Major says: 'It is clearly of paramount importance that ministers give
accurate and truthful information to the House.'
But the prime minister's letter goes on to say: 'If they knowingly fail to
do this, then they should relinquish their positions except in the quite
exceptional circumstances of which a devaluation or time of war or other
danger to national security have been quoted as examples.'
The prime minister responded to Mr Radice after he had written asking
whether it was the duty of ministers not to mislead parliament and to resign
if they do so.
The first exchange of letters followed a statement made by Mr Waldegrave to
the Treasury and civil service select committee, of which Mr Radice is a
member, that ministers had to lie to the Commons in exceptional
circumstances.
In particular, Mr Waldegrave claimed that Lord Callaghan, the former Labour
prime minister, had told untruths during the devaluation crisis of 1967.
This has been fiercely denied by Lord Callaghan, who was chancellor at the
time. He claims that he chose his words on the issue very carefully, and
that he has never lied to the Commons.
Until now, the prime minister has given only a guarded endorsement of Mr
Waldegrave's comments.
On a BBC programme in March, Mr Major said: 'Mr Waldegrave answered an
intelligent question frankly about what had happened under another
government a quarter of a century ago.'
Asked whether lying could be justified in parliament, he said: 'Nobody can
and nobody does.'

FT  14 APR 94 / Eastleigh by-election poised for date in June
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Eastleigh by-election is almost certain to be held on June 9, the day of
the European elections, after the government failed to move the writ
yesterday.
By ensuring that it will not be held on the day of the council elections on
May 5, the government has prevented the winner - expected to be the Liberal
Democrats - from receiving a boost in advance of the European elections.
But the Tories have also raised the political stakes in June since the date
of the Eastleigh by-election may now be seen akin to a 'super Thursday',
with three east London by-elections and the European elections on the same
day.
The loss of Eastleigh coupled with a poor peformance in the European
elections could mark the end of Mr John Major's prime ministerial career.
Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, said: 'It is a disgrace that
Conservative fear has resulted in a serious delay to the election of a
representative for the people of Eastleigh.'
He accused the government of being afraid of the election because of the
dispute over qualified majority voting in Europe.
Only the Rotherham by-election will take place on May 5, after opposition
business managers yesterday began campaigning for the first poll in a Labour
seat this parliament.
The vacancy was caused by the death in January of Mr Jimmy Boyce.

FT  14 APR 94 / Hurd urges more confident Britain: Foreign secretary's
speech hits at Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd last night warned Britain not to turn in on itself and urged
the country to make more vigorous use of its distinctive skills and
experience.
The foreign secretary used his traditional speech at the Lord Mayor's Easter
banquet at the Mansion House in London to map out a three-pronged agenda,
focusing on Europe, for British foreign policy in the 1990s.
In a wide ranging address, he also underlined the government's determination
to restore full trading relations between Britain and Malaysia.
The government was 'working hard in our contacts with the Malaysian
government, and through the business community, to get things back on an
even keel', he said.
Speaking with the European elections less than two months away, the foreign
secretary delivered a thinly veiled rebuke to diehard Euro-sceptics, saying
that 'while we dispute among ourselves' on issues like Maastricht and
European Union voting rights, 'we risk failing to notice how the world is
changing'.
Maastricht - though necessary and important - would not go down as 'one of
the great turning points in European history'. The 'endless, fevered'
discussion of the treaty often led people to lose sight of the real issue.
In a strongly worded passage, Mr Hurd said Britain ran the risk of
'intellectual shrinkage . . . as if we simply wanted to devise ways of
protecting ourselves against a Europe and a world which was bound to run
against us'.
He continued: 'This is negative and damaging nonsense . . . Let us use what
I hope may be a period of relative calm to regain the self-confidence we
need.'
He said Britain had to use assets like the City of London, its experience of
successful privatisation, and the reputation of the BBC and the armed
forces, 'more vigorously than hitherto'.
Mr Hurd enumerated three main strands of British foreign policy in the
1990s:
Shaping a Europe with which Britain and its partners could feel at ease.
This would be 'more than a single market' and would require policies and
institutions which were 'sensitive to the citizen'. Opening Europe to the
east. This would come partly through the search for security. Britain had
made it clear that Nato enlargement was 'not a question of 'if' but 'when''.
Putting new substance into old friendships around the world. Mr Hurd made
positive and conciliatory remarks about Britain's relations with both
Argentina and China. The country was injecting 'new vitality' into
commercial links with Argentina; relations with China were 'returning to
calm'.
The foreign secretary's remarks came as another staunchly pro-European
minister attacked hardline Euro-sceptics and federalists for attempting to
define the terms of debate on Europe 'in a way which excludes the viewpoint
of the great majority'.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, used a speech in
London to argue that the priorities of Britain's European policy should be
economic.
'The binding force of the Union is our shared interest in improving European
living standards,' he said.

FT  14 APR 94 / Minutes reveal sharp rift at the top: Graham Bowley and
Philip Coggan on remarkable rows between Kenneth Clarke and Eddie George
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For institutions which have prided themselves on secrecy throughout their
history, the published minutes of the monthly meetings between the Treasury
and the Bank of England are remarkable for their candour.
The minutes of the February meeting, in particular, clearly show the extent
of the disagreement between the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke and the
governor, Mr Eddie George.
The governor opened discussions in February by arguing that economic
evidence published since the January meeting had 'if anything, weakened
rather than strengthened the case for an immediate rate cut'.
Mr George said the most likely projection was that economic 'growth would
pick up to perhaps 3 per cent on current policy settings, in part as a
continuing response to the reductions in interest rates at the end of 1992
and early 1993. Although the best projection was that underlying inflation
would remain around the middle of the (1 to 4 per cent) target range, there
were upside risks. The case for an immediate cut in interest rates rested on
a view that the Budget measures would significantly slow down the pace of
growth.'
In Mr George's opinion 'it would be safer to wait for more evidence of the
effects' of the tax increases before acting, the minutes report. 'To cut
rates now in advance of this evidence would run a risk of higher inflation
and some loss of credibility, and he strongly advised against.'
The chancellor's response was to state that 'he was concerned that advice
was erring excessively on the side of caution. He had been more inclined to
cut interest rates last month, and in his view the case for a cut had become
stronger since then'.
'In recent months inflation outturns had consistently been better than
expected, and inflation projections were still being lowered.'
The minutes report: 'The chancellor thought that the monetary indicators
provided a good case for an interest rate cut . . . In addition, pay
settlements remained between 2 and 2 1/2 per cent on average, with a
significant minority of employees accepting a pay freeze.'
Mr Clarke said he was 'determined that inflation should not accelerate
again. However, with a significant fiscal tightening in prospect and
considerable spare capacity in the whole economy, he saw little risk of an
increase in inflation. He was inclined to take the opportunity to cut rates
from their present relatively high levels.'
The minutes then summarise the discussion between the chancellor and the
governor and their officials. Here remarks are not attributed to individuals
because of the Whitehall convention that advice to ministers is
confidential. But someone made the point that 'there was a danger that an
interest rate cut now would be interpreted as being influenced by political
considerations'. That is exactly what did happen, as the eventual cut
coincided with newspaper headlines about the death of Tory MP Mr Stephen
Milligan.
It was during the discussion that the possibility of a  1/4 percentage point
rate cut was raised. On the second day of the meeting, the chancellor said
'he still favoured reducing interest rates now. He saw little risk of
inflation picking up, but a significant risk that the fiscal measures would
slow down the recovery. An interest rate cut in April would be too late to
offset the effect of the fiscal measures. Although he thought an immediate
1/2 per cent reduction would be justified, he saw advantage in a  1/4 per
cent cut. Moving interest rates by smaller amounts was quite common in other
countries, and was consistent with the current low inflation and low
interest rate environment.'
The governor said he could 'agree to a  1/4 per cent, but not to  1/2 per
cent'. The minutes record his parting shot that 'his concern stemmed from
experience that it would be difficult to restrain inflation if it started to
rise'.
However, Mr Clarke got his rate cut which shows that, in spite of the Bank's
hopes for independence, the Treasury is still firmly in charge of monetary
policy.
The minutes of the last three meetings also show that the governor has been
consistently much more optimistic about the UK's growth prospects than has
the chancellor. In the February meeting, for example, while the governor
talked of possible 3 per cent GDP growth, ahead of the official forecast,
the chancellor spoke of 'a significant risk that the fiscal measures would
slow down the recovery'.
Mr Clarke's utterances in the monthly meetings seem less upbeat than his
more public statements on the economy. In March, he said that 'anecdotal
evidence did not suggest that activity was growing strongly.' In February,
referring to the fall in unemployment, for example, he said that 'much of
the employment created so far had been in part-time jobs'.
In addition to the February disagreement, there were signs of a difference
in views in the January meeting. The chancellor then said that 'the
objective case for a further  1/2 per cent cut in rates was quite strong'
but the governor argued that 'the risk associated with cutting interest
rates now was greater than the risk associated with waiting'. On that
occasion, the chancellor agreed to do nothing.
A greater measure of unanimity was achieved at the March 2 meeting: the
minutes reveal that there was no intention to raise bank base interest
rates, as was feared by some commentators in the City.
The chancellor said in March that 'it would be appropriate to consider a
further reduction in interest rates if indicators subsequently suggested
that activity was subdued and inflationary pressures remained under firm
control'.
Meanwhile, the governor said 'there would be a case for a further easing of
interest rates if the evidence suggested that activity was slowing',
although he concluded 'at this stage there was insufficient evidence to
warrant a cut'.
A further meeting between the pair was held on March 30, and minutes will
not be published until May 18.
The chancellor's stated aim in publishing yesterday the minutes of his
monthly meetings with the governor of the Bank of England is to promote
accountability and transparency in the operation of monetary policy.
At a press conference with Mr Clarke yesterday, the governor welcomed the
move. It would enable financial markets, parliament and the public to gain a
better appreciation of the nuances of policy and realise that divergences
between governor and chancellor 'were very rarely black and white.'
Mr George said the February disagreement and his final acceptance of a 1/4
point cut in base rates to 5 1/4 per cent had to be seen in the context of
his January remark that he had 'recommended adopting a bias towards easing'
monetary policy.
Although governor and chancellor appeared the best of friends yesterday,
there may be some costs involved in the new policy of transparency.
Financial markets rarely like to see open disagreement between policy-makers
and there may come a time when the published minutes lead to a sharp, and
unfavourable, market reaction.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The decision to publish the minutes of the monthly meetings between the
chancellor and the governor was broadly welcomed at Westminster by
politicians from both ends of the political spectrum.
Downing Street said that the measure was meant to introduce greater
transparency. It was also intended to promote a better understanding of the
way in which monetary policy is made.
For Labour, Mr Alistair Darling, City spokesman, said the decision would be
welcomed provided that the minutes were 'full and extensive.'
He said that it would be interesting to see whether future minutes disclosed
differences of opinion between the chancellor and the governor - 'or even
robust discussion'.
He said that the government's track record did not give much ground for hope
that this would be the case.
'I only hope William Waldegrave (minister for open government) is not in
charge of the exercise,' he said.
Mr Giles Radice, a senior Labour member of the Treasury and civil service
select committee, said it was a 'useful improvement'.
Mr Nigel Forman, a Conservative member of the same committee, said it was
'an excellent step forward' and 'part of the move towards gradually greater
transparency'.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, the outspoken Tory Euro-sceptic who is a frequent critic
of the Treasury, welcomed the measure on the grounds that it would 'help
clear away a few cobwebs'.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said publication should
'discourage bad interest rate decisions'.
'The revelation that the chancellor went against the governor's advice with
the ill-timed February interest rate cut of 0.25 per cent fully justifies
the decision that these minutes will now be published on a regular basis,'
he said.
Mr Beith pointed out that the government had refused an earlier
recommendation from the Treasury committee that the minutes should be
published.
'Now they have agreed, partly as a cover for their failure to accept the
committee's recommendations for central bank autonomy. Central bank autonomy
will come in the end,' he said.

FT  14 APR 94 / British worries over works councils eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only about 90 British multinationals will be directly affected by the
European Union works council directive following publication of its final
draft yesterday.
The British government and employers' organisations had feared that up to
300 UK-based companies could be drawn into the directive, which requires
companies to set up a forum to consult employee representatives at least
once a year.
Overall, more than 1,000 pan-European companies will have to set up elected
works councils under the proposals adopted by the European Commission
yesterday, which are expected to pass into European law by October.
The plan, beset by controversy for nearly 20 years, affects companies with
more than 1,000 employees, including more than 100 in at least two member
states. They will be required to consult workers' representatives on
cross-border business decisions affecting the workforce.
But the final draft of the directive makes it clear that UK employees of UK
multinationals will not count towards the thresholds at which the directive
becomes applicable. There is also no requirement on pan-European companies
to invite their UK employees to participate in the councils.
This was welcomed last night by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry, who said: 'That in itself is a good
thing, but we are still opposed to the principle of the directive.'
EU labour and employment ministers will start discussing the proposal next
Tuesday, after which it will get a fast-track first reading from a
supportive European Parliament. Ministerial approval is expected in June,
with formal adoption in October after a second reading.
The UK - which has an opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht
treaty - will not have to put the EU directive on its national statute book.
But because many transnational companies will respond to union pressure for
common practice, the number of UK firms affected could still be near 300, EU
officials believe.

FT  14 APR 94 / Government acts to restrict quarry growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government moved yesterday to sharpen its green credentials by giving
local authorities planning guidance to restrict the growth of quarries
supplying rock, sand and gravel for construction.
In a separate development, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said no more
than four coastal 'super quarries' should be developed over the next 15
years. This included the existing Glensanda quarry operated by the privately
owned Foster Yeoman. It had been expected that crushed rock from a new
generation of large Scottish and Scandinavian quarries planned by British
building material companies would compensate for a more restrictive planning
regime in England and Wales.
Instead, ministers expect the industry in England to double the use of
recycled and secondary material such as slate, colliery spoil and china clay
waste from 30m tonnes a year to 60m tonnes by 2006.
Mr David Curry, environment minister responsible for planning, said: 'We
need to seek better patterns of supply and use of resources and more
environmentally acceptable ways of working mineral sites and restoring these
once work has ceased.'
He added that local authorities should plan to have no more than seven
years' supply of planning consents for aggregates instead of the 10 years'
they have now.
RMC, one of Britain's largest aggregate company, said yesterday: 'This is
potentially very damaging and could cause a shortage of sand and gravel,
particularly in south-east England where the time taken to win consents can
be anything up to 10 years.'
Rules restricting the development of quarries in national parks and areas of
outstanding natural beauty have been strengthened.
The guidance note for English local authorities envisages that the
proportion of land-won sand and gravel will fall from 39 per cent to 24 per
cent by 2001 to 2006. Land-won crushed rock would fall from 54 per cent to
44 per cent. To compensate, the use of secondary materials is expected to
rise from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. Imports from Scottish quarries and
elsewhere in Europe would increase from 1 per cent to 5 per cent. Use of
marine-dredged aggregates would remain constant at about 7 per cent. Similar
restrictions are being introduced in Wales.
Annual demand is expected to rise from 230m tonnes in England and Wales to
330m-365m tonnes by 2006. Under the new guidelines this would mean a small
increase in crushed rock production but no rise in land-won sand and gravel
supply.
British Aggregates Construction Materials Industries, the trade body, said
the position might have been worse and questioned whether there would be
sufficient supply of quality secondary and recycled material to compensate
for cutbacks elsewhere.
The council for the Protection of Rural England said: 'The guidance note is
far weaker than originally proposed and the government clearly has given in
to the construction industry.'

FT  14 APR 94 / Accountancy TV calls in the receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Administrative receivers have been appointed at Accountancy Television, the
specialist service for accountants backed by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants.
The television service broadcast by BBC Select, the specialist subscription
arm of the BBC, is the second of four services to go into receivership.
It is believed that Accountancy TV only attracted between 1,300 and 1,400
subscribers.
However, about half of those were sent videos through the post, rather than
recording the broadcasts on specially adapted video recorders.
Mr Lee Manning, joint administrative receiver from Buchler Phillips, said
yesterday: 'I am very hopeful that I can sell the business and move
forward.'
There have been several expressions of interest in the business, including
an intention to bid by Television Education Network, the producer of The
Accountants Educational Channel, which distributes programmes on videos
through the post.
Accountancy TV only owes about Pounds 300,000. However, when its main
shareholders, who include the BBC and the financial training organisation
BPP, were asked for bank guarantees they instead decided to call in the
receivers.
The decision is a further blow to BBC Select which was set up with the hope
that as many as 20 specialist services would eventually use BBC transmitters
in the middle of the night to broadcast scrambled subscription services.
Last year the BBC, which invested more than Pounds 10m in the service,
decided that although it would honour existing contracts it would not launch
any new services.
Executive Business Club, which went into receivership last year, survived
after being bought by Lancashire Enterprise Trust and Legal Network
television.
Yesterday it said that it was 'doing fine'.
BBC Select continues to broadcast a number of services which are not
scrambled and which are aimed at nurses and social workers.

FT  14 APR 94 / Ofgas leader retracts claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas industry
regulator, has withdrawn an allegation that her predecessor acted
'illegally' in allowing the costs of energy efficiency projects to be passed
to consumers.
In an appearance last month before the Commons environment committee, Ms
Spottiswoode made clear that she believed Sir James McKinnon, her
predecessor at Ofgas, had exceeded his authority in approving certain
conservation programmes.
She had earlier told the Commons trade and industry committee that consumer
funding of so-called 'E factor' schemes was tantamount to a tax, therefore
outside her powers.
But in a letter to the environment committee, published yesterday, Ms
Spottiswoode says: 'On further reflection I believe that the 'E' factor
expenditure authorised by my predecessor falls within the Director General's
powers of discretion and is therefore not unlawful.'
The controversy centres on whether customers should pay for savings
projects.

FT  14 APR 94 / Mersey Docks director resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Vincent yesterday resigned from the board of Mersey Docks and
Harbour Company only six months after joining the company following MDHC's
takeover of his Medway Ports company, Stewart Dalby writes.
Mr Vincent's resignation from MDHC, in which he owned nearly 1 per cent of
the ordinary shares and was thought to be the largest private
non-institutional shareholder, was said to be so he could develop 'other
interests'. Mr Vincent's appointment was surrounded in controversy because
of the terms of the takeover.
MDHC purchased Medway Ports, which has docks in Sheerness and Chatham in
Kent, for Pounds 104m in September 1993, valuing the shares at Pounds 37.50,
making Mr Vincent's own holding worth Pounds 12m.
But 270 dockers - dismissed in November 1992 for refusing to accept new
working practices - were obliged to sell back shares which they had been
given or bought at privatisation in March 1992. These were valued at Pounds
2.50 each which meant the dockers missed out on profits made by Mr Vincent
and other staff.

FT  14 APR 94 / Motor camps try to forge friendship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European carmakers and automotive components suppliers have launched a joint
initiative aimed at improving their often hostile relationship.
The move follows a recent report sponsored by the Department of Trade and
Industry and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders which criticised
the motor industry's lack of progress in improving co-operation between the
two groups.
The report said the 'necessary levels of trust' were not present between
vehicle makers and components suppliers.
The two European trade associations representing the carmakers and the
components suppliers have now agreed guidelines for encouraging improved
co-operation.
The action is aimed at raising the competitiveness of the European motor
industry, as it seeks to restructure to meet the fierce challenge from rival
vehicle makers and suppliers in the US and in Japan.
The protocol signed by both sides of the industry is aimed at providing a
'framework for co-operation'.
The protocol seeks to create greater transparency in negotiations over costs
and prices, to improve co-operation in design and manufacturing, to promote
modern manufacturing processes and to raise quality.
Improving relations between the two sides of the motor indutry is seen as
crucial to raising the sector's international competitiveness, but the
rhetoric has seldom been matched in practice.
'The mistrust which is in evidence is the result of many years of broken
promises, abuse of confidence, and general acrimony in the industry,' said
the report by Professor Richard Lamming, of Bath University School of
Management.

FT  14 APR 94 / Cost of IT failures rises to Pounds 1.2bn a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four in five organisations in the UK have suffered a breakdown in their
information technology systems during the past two years, according to a
government-sponsored survey published yesterday.
The survey of 850 organisations estimates that the annual cost of such
incidents exceeds Pounds 1.2bn, a 12 percentage point increase on the last
survey two years ago.
Fire is the threat most feared, but viruses, power failure and computer
failure are the most common problems.
The estimated average immediate cost of an incident was Pounds 9,000. A
quarter of incidents led to serious losses.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, technology minister, said: 'Information technology
security is becoming a serious issue for almost all organisations and every
organisation using computers is at risk.'
The report, co-sponsored by the IT company ICL and the National Computing
Centre, an information systems consultancy, highlights contingency planning,
staff training and risk assessment as strategies to reduce the risk of
breakdown and breaches of security.
Virus attacks and theft were found to have risen sharply since the last
survey in 1992, with twice as many organisations reporting such incidents.
Half of all breaches were found to be covered by a contingency plan and
almost half of respondents said that contingency planning - including
back-up systems - had proved effective in dealing with incidents.
But fewer than half of respondents had tested their plans regularly.
'In almost all cases where a contingency plan existed, it was felt to have
been at least moderately effective in minimising the effects of the breach
and facilitating recovery,' the report concludes.
The most costly incident was a Pounds 1.2m fraud which was reported by an
insurance company. The worst cases of flood, power failure and computer
failure cost Pounds 200,000 or more. The most expensive virus outbreak,
which infected three large local area networks and more than 200 personal
computers, led to a bill of Pounds 100,000 in immediate costs.
The 1990 Computer Misuse Act has had a significant impact in encouraging
companies to tighten their security measures. One third of companies claimed
to have reviewed their disciplinary measures in light of the legislation, up
from 23 per cent in 1992, with a further 22 per cent indicating their
intention to do so.
Larger organisations have proved more willing to carry out such reviews than
smaller organisations. More than half of those employing 1,000 staff or more
had done so.
Organisations using specialised IT security staff or risk analysis were in a
minority, the report says.
Barely one-in-seven was found to have a specialist security function, and
only 43 per cent had used formal risk analysis.
A code of practice on information security management was published by the
Department of Trade and Industry last year after consultation with leading
UK companies.
Procedures for systematic checking for viruses, and immediate back-up
facilities for computers and power in the event of breakdowns, are the most
important measures recommended. Employee training and high corporate
standards are also highlighted as important precautions.

FT  14 APR 94 / Byatt rejects allegations on appointments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator,
yesterday rejected allegations that he had appointed friends and business
contacts to head Ofwat regional customer service committees, which represent
customer interests.
He told the Commons environment committee: 'I resent and regard as stupid
the accusation that I give jobs to my friends.'
Pressed by Ms Helen Jackson, Labour MP for Sheffield Hillsborough, Mr Byatt
said that his decision in February not to reappoint Ms Diana Scott, who had
chaired the Yorkshire customer committee, was 'categorically nothing to do
with metering'. Ms Scott, unlike Mr Byatt, was critical of water company
plans to extend household metering.
Mr Byatt added: 'I think that her (Ms Scott's) work in Yorkshire has been
comparatively more powerful than her work on the group (of Ofwat committee
chairmen) - but that is all I will say about it.'
The committee expressed its concern that household water bills will continue
to rise faster than inflation to pay for quality improvements, including
compliance with new environmental regulations. Next month Ofwat will tell
the companies the rate at which it will allow them to raise prices between
1995 and 2005.
Mr Byatt said that he wanted overall rates of return to fall by more than
half in the next decade, although he was not going to claw back historic
profits. According to Ofwat, water companies have been earning 13 per cent
return on capital, defined by Ofwat as their stock market value when they
were floated in 1989 plus investment spending since then.

FT  14 APR 94 / Channel rail fare to undercut air price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The operators of train services through the Channel tunnel said yesterday
they plan to undercut airlines' prices for fares from London to Paris and
Brussels.
Unlike the car shuttle service through the tunnel between Folkestone and
Calais, which has been priced at a small premium to competing ferry
services, Eurostar through-trains are to adopt aggressive pricing.
The British, French and Belgian railways had originally considered
undercutting the airlines by up to 25 per cent, but a recent airline price
war will mean there is a smaller discount, a senior official involved in the
project said yesterday.
European Passenger Services, a joint venture of the national railways,
expects to announce details of its fares on May 17, when it hopes to give a
definite starting date for services.
Officially EPS is saying that its fares will be similar to the airlines'.
'We'll offer a business class fare which will be similar to the club fare of
the airlines,' said Mr Malcolm Southgate, deputy managing director. 'Our
leisure fares will be similar, but the conditions will be less restrictive
to achieve a fares advantage.'
He was speaking on the first Eurostar demonstration run to carry passengers
which took place between Paris and Arras.
The Pounds 24m train covered the 112 miles in 50 minutes reaching a top
speed of 186mph.
Eurostar trains have yet to carry passengers through the tunnel. A limited
service is due to start in July increasing to a full service in September or
October. Journey times from London Waterloo will be three hours to Paris and
three hours 15 minutes to Brussels.
The Eurostar trains are based on the French TGV but are lower and narrower
to fit on the UK network. They have been designed to work on three different
power systems and four different signalling systems.

FT  14 APR 94 / Recycling levy 'must fall on consumers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and JENNY LUESBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customers should bear much of the cost of schemes to recycle and recover
waste packaging, the packaging industry said yesterday in a strongly worded
statement.
In a statement at its annual lunch in London, the Packaging and Industrial
Films Association called for a levy on retailers to help pay for recycling
proposals.
Mr Robert Atkins, environment minister, told the industry gathering that if
it wanted to avoid 'detailed prescriptive legislation from government' on
recycling, it had to come up with its own proposals quickly.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has called on the industry to find
ways of recycling between half and three-quarters of the UK's waste
packaging. Last year, the UK recycled less than a third of its 7.3m tonnes
of household and commercial waste packaging.
According to estimates published in February by an industry working group,
recycling or recovering half of waste packaging would add 1p to every Pounds
10 food shopping bill. Ambitious recycling targets could cost Pounds 100m to
implement, industry estimates suggest.
Ministers and industrialists are concerned that whatever the solution
devised in the UK, a new European packaging waste directive, to be voted on
soon by the European parliament, may impose additional expensive
obligations.
According to these plans, countries must recycle between 25 per cent and 45
per cent of packaging waste within five years of the directive coming into
force.
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for a levy to finance
recycling schemes to be raised 'as close as possible to the consumer'.
'If you place this levy early in the production chain it will affect
exports,' the employers organisation said.

FT  14 APR 94 / Regulator in deep water: Ofwat's chief faces tough scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I didn't come into this job to have an easy time', Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat
director-general, told the Commons environment committee yesterday.
The next four months will see more scrutiny of Mr Byatt's performance than
at any time since the industry's privatisation in 1989.
Staff at Ofwat's Birmingham offices are now sifting through stacks of paper
from the 33 water companies of England and Wales which set out their
investment plans for the next 20 years. The real test of Mr Byatt's success
as a regulator will come in the next four months when he will tell water
companies how quickly he will let them raise prices between 1995 and 2005.
The deadlines for this review are tight: he must tell them of his decision
by May 20, then hear any considerations which they feel he has omitted, and
announce his final decision by the end of July. That timetable is intended
to leave time for the companies to challenge his decision through the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission and for a judgment to be reached by the
start of next year.
However, the politics of his task are increasingly labyrinthine. On one
side, like other utility regulators, he has faced criticism from consumer
groups and backbench and opposition MPs for failing to protect the consumer
enough and letting prices rise too fast.
That was the thrust behind this week's allegations in the Yorkshire Post
newspaper and from Labour MPs that he had appointed friends and business
contacts to the Ofwat customer service committees.
On the other side, leading City investment houses have called on the water
companies to challenge his decisions through the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. Investors are concerned that the review will be severe. Their
fears are based on his remarks that the industry's rate of return on capital
is too high.
The companies themselves appear ambivalent about the prospect of going to
the commission. Some chief executives, who have become uncharacteristically
coy ahead of Mr Byatt's announcements, fear this will play into his hands.
One director of a large water and sewerage company, who asked not to be
named, said: 'Referrals to the MMC are just what Mr Byatt needs to cover
himself in glory as a tough regulator and I'm not sure I feel like
obliging.'
Mr Peter Ainsworth, a member of the environment committee, and Tory MP for
Surrey East, also suggested yesterday that provoking several companies to
'rush off to the MMC' made the regulator look tough, instead of provoking
outrage if he is 'not tough enough'.
Mr Byatt also faces a tough battle with other environmental regulators in
the UK and Brussels over the issue of how tight environmental standards
should be.
The cost of compliance with environmental regulations - which industry
estimates suggest could reach Pounds 40bn this decade - is one of the main
reasons why water bills are rising much faster than inflation. Mr Byatt told
the environment committee that this debate left him 'betwixt the devil and
the deep blue sea' as companies are obliged to comply with environmental
standards.
The debate had also led to 'robust exchanges' with Lord Crickhowell,
chairman of the National Rivers Authority, the water quality watchdog, he
said.
Mr Byatt added however, that he would not escape criticism whatever his
rulings. 'Sometimes people think I have powers I don't. Regulation is an
imperfect tool.'

FT  14 APR 94 / Elusive viruses take costly toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Viruses are the single most frequent cause of computer breakdown, according
to yesterday's report.
More than one third of respondents reported one or more virus incidents
during the past two years, a large increase on the 16 per cent reported in a
similar survey two years ago.
One case study, of a retail company with 10,000 employees, highlights the
danger even for those with elaborate checking procedures.
At the time of the incident, virus-checking software was installed on each
PC in the company's computer centre and head office, but checking was at the
discretion of the user.
To make the system foolproof, the company decided to buy disk authorisation
software. A virus was detected at the computer centre during trials of the
software. It was eradicated but kept reappearing.
Only at the fourth outbreak, two months after the first, was the virus
traced to an incoming disk from a leading software supplier. The disk
contained updates to bespoke software being produced for the company.
Further checks showed that the virus was present in the software supplier's
own development centre.
In the end, teams had to check more than 2,000 disks; a scanner was hired
for a week and 20 disks were found to be infected.
The up-front cost was Pounds 10,000 for the 70 working days it took to
investigate. But That did not take into account the disruption and
considerable ill-feeling among the staff - including accusations as to who
was the culprit.
The moral: you can't be too careful in checking for viruses.

FT  14 APR 94 / IT breakdowns cost Pounds 1.2bn a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four in five organisations in the UK have suffered a breakdown in their
information technology systems during the past two years, according to a
government-sponsored survey published yesterday.
The survey of 850 organisations estimates that the annual cost of such
incidents exceeds Pounds 1.2bn, a 12 percentage point increase on the last
survey two years ago.
Fire is the threat most feared by organisations, but viruses, power failure
and computer failure are the most common problems.
The estimated average immediate cost of an incident was Pounds 9,000. A
quarter of incidents led to serious losses.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, technology minister, said: 'Information technology
security is becoming a serious issue for almost all organisations and every
organisation using computers is at risk.
'Effective management of security threats can help make organisations more
reliable.'
The report, co-sponsored by the IT company ICL and the National Computing
Centre, an information systems consultancy, highlights contingency planning,
staff training and risk assessment as strategies to reduce the risk of
breakdown and breaches of security.
Virus attacks and theft were found to have risen sharply since the last
survey in 1992, with twice as many organisations reporting such incidents.
Half of all breaches were found to be covered by a contingency plan and
almost half of respondents said that contingency planning - including
back-up systems - had proved highly effective in dealing with incidents.
But fewer than half of respondents had tested their plans regularly.
'In almost all cases where a contingency plan existed, it was felt to have
been at least moderately effective in minimising the effects of the breach
and facilitating recovery,' the report concludes.
The most costly incident was a Pounds 1.2m fraud which was reported by an
insurance company.
The worst cases of flood, power failure and computer failure cost Pounds
200,000 or more.
The most expensive virus outbreak, which infected three large local area
networks and more than 200 personal computers, led to a bill of Pounds
100,000 in immediate costs.
However, organisations were far more likely to make such plans for cases of
computer equipment failure, viruses, sabotage or power failure than for
theft, hacking, flooding, or fraud.
The 1990 Computer Misuse Act has had a significant impact in encouraging
companies to tighten their security measures.
One third of companies claimed to have reviewed their disciplinary measures
in light of the legislation, up from 23 per cent in 1992, with a further 22
per cent indicating their intention to do so.
Larger organisations have proved more willing to carry out such reviews than
smaller organisations. More than half of those employing 1,000 staff or more
had done so.
Organisations using specialised IT security staff or risk analysis were in a
minority.
Barely one-in-seven was found to have a specialist security function, and
only 43 per cent had used formal risk analysis.
A code of practice on information security management was published by the
Department of Trade and Industry last year after consultation with leading
UK companies.
Procedures for systematic checking for viruses, and immediate back-up
facilities for computers and power in the event of breakdowns, are the most
important measures recommended.
Employee training and high corporate standards are also highlighted as
important precautions.
More than half of the organisations which were surveyed gave written
warnings to staff that unauthorised access to computer systems might result
in dismissal.

FT  14 APR 94 / Mersey Docks director resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Vincent yesterday resigned from the board of Mersey Docks and
Harbour Company only six months after joining the company following MDHC's
takeover of his Medway Ports company, Stewart Dalby writes.
Mr Vincent's resignation from MDHC, in which he owned nearly 1 per cent of
the ordinary shares and was thought to be the largest private
non-institutional shareholder, was said to be so he could develop 'other
interests'. Mr Vincent's appointment was surrounded in controversy because
of the terms of the takeover.
MDHC purchased Medway Ports, which has docks in Sheerness and Chatham in
Kent, for Pounds 104m in September 1993, valuing the shares at Pounds 37.50,
making Mr Vincent's own holding worth Pounds 12m.
But 270 dockers - out of a workforce of 600 - dismissed in November 1992 for
refusing to accept new working practices had been obliged to sell back to
the company before the takeover for Pounds 2.50 each shares they had been
given or bought at privatisation in March 1992. They thus missed out on
profits made by Mr Vincent and other employees.
The Pounds 2.50 valuation was reached by the accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
In March this year, the sacked dockers won a ruling for unfair dismissal
from an industrial tribunal and are to receive Pounds 10,000 each.
The dismissed dockers are taking legal advice as to whether they can use
section 459 of the 1985 Companies Act - which refers to unfair treatment of
minority shareholders - to apply for rectification of the shareholders
register. They are also seeking legal advice over whether to pursue a claim
that KPMG was negligent in valuing the shares at Pounds 2.50.

FT  14 APR 94 / Hamas bombers see violent deaths as a way to heaven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Islamic extremist who yesterday blew up a crowded Israeli bus in the
town of Hadera, killing five Israelis and wounding 30, knew he was going to
die. Like Raed Zakarneh, the 19-year-old suicide bomber who last week drove
a car packed with 385lb of explosives into a bus in the town of Afula, he
died thinking his violent act would guarantee him a special place in heaven
as a martyr to Islam.
'As Islamists we know that life is everything we have but we also have the
belief that if you sacrifice your life for your people, for your land, for
your cause, you are a martyr,' said Dr Omar Farwana, one of the 415
Palestinians deported to Lebanon by Israel in December 1992 for Hamas
activities. 'Violence is the only language the Israelis understand and these
attacks are very painful for them.'
The Islamic resistance movement Hamas, responsible for both attacks, has
emerged as the best organised and most devastating threat to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Yesterday's attack was the second in what
Hamas claims are five planned operations to revenge the February 25 Hebron
mosque massacre of 29 Palestinians by a fanatical Jewish settler. Its strike
was intended to show Israel that Hamas can still strike despite the closure
of the occupied territories by Israel after last week's suicide bombing and
despite widespread Israeli precautions.
In leaflets Hamas has threatened to turn Israel's Independence day
celebrations today into a 'hell' and make 'Zionists and settlers cry blood
on their dead'.
The six-year underground movement, originally funded by Israel to challenge
PLO political dominance in the occupied territories, is opposed to the peace
process, committed to the annihilation of the Jewish state by armed struggle
and wants to create an Islamic state in all of the land of Israel, the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip based on Sharia Koranic law.
Hamas, an acronym which means zeal, has become the main opposition group to
the PLO and is particularly strong in the Gaza Strip, where it has won a
bedrock support among the poor and the young fed up with the corruption in
the PLO. It also has active cells in Hebron, Jenin, Nablus and Jericho in
the West Bank.
While Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, is entangled in lengthy peace
negotiations with Israel, Hamas has been building its underground military
wing, Izz el-Deen al-Qassam, and parading itself as the only player in the
armed struggle against continued Israeli occupation.
'All Palestinians support resistance, the right of all occupied people,'
said Dr Farwana in Gaza City. 'Arafat is afraid to condemn the attacks
because he knows the Palestinian people will spit on him.'
Apart from stepping up violent pressure on Israel, Hamas is preparing for
the return of Mr Arafat to the occupied territories and the possibility of
conflict with the incoming 9,000-strong PLO police force.
'Hamas has kept the option of staying powerful by remaining underground,'
said Dr Farwana. 'Hamas is against civil war but is ready to protect itself
by force if attacked by Arafat. Hamas will continue attacks on Israelis and
the Palestinian police will not be able to stop them. Then the Israeli army
might come back into the territories and every Palestinian will know they
are still under Israeli occupation.'

<TEXT>
South Korea yesterday indicated that it might accept loggers escaping from
North Korean-managed lumber camps in Russia.
Seoul has so far refused to grant asylum to at least 120 workers who have
fled the logging camps because of fears that it could antagonise Pyongyang
and disrupt inter-Korean negotiations on North Korean nuclear inspections.
But the recent collapse of the nuclear talks has persuaded the government
'to review the issue based on the principle of humanitarianism,' said Mr
Choo Don-shik, the presidential spokesman.
The government is also responding to growing public pressure to accept the
loggers, who are considered South Korean citizens under its constitution.
The lumber camps, which employ 15,000 North Koreans, were established in
Siberia in the late 1960s, with North Korea providing labour in return for
receiving wood supplies.
North Koreans who have fled the lumber camps speak of food shortages,
beatings, and death sentences for those trying to escape.

FT  14 APR 94 / Foreign bears maul financial rand: Mark Suzman on the
collapse of South Africa's investment currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's ebullient finance minister Derek Keys was at his bullish
best. There were many good reasons, he told a lunchtime gathering on Monday,
for confidence in the country's economy: a government of national unity had
been in place for several months and was working well, the economy had moved
out of recession into recovery and the country had enjoyed a bumper maize
harvest.
But in Johannesburg's Diagonal Street financial centre the bears were
running rampant. The financial rand, the yardstick of external investor
confidence, was at its lowest level ever as the market reacted to the
breakdown of the country's peace summit in the early hours of Saturday
morning.
Nothing Mr Keys said then or says subsequently can alter the fundamental
concern that will determine the outside world's judgment of South Africa as
an investment risk. Its financial services may be sophisticated, its stock
exchange capitalisation ranking it in the top 10 in the world, its
infrastructure excellent, its potential enormous: without stability and a
negotiated resolution of the country's constitutional crisis, these things
are worth little.
When trading opened this week the financial rand lost 14 per cent of its
value, finishing the day at a record low of R5.71 to the dollar and leaving
many foreign investors with hefty losses.
Although the currency partly recovered on earlier hopes of a successful
outcome to international mediation, its continued instability is leaving
investors distinctly nervous. Dealers report heavy foreign selling of South
African bonds and equities over the past two weeks, which has toppled the
markets from their mid-March highs.
It was a wave of such selling, in particular in the gilt market, that was
largely responsible for the fall on Monday.
One broker tells of an American investor who phoned him and ordered the sale
of his entire South African stock by the next day, whatever the price.
'It's all politically driven,' said another broker. 'Foreign investors are
very fickle.'
Although South African markets are no stranger to panic selling, the current
wave is particularly damaging because it comes in the wake of greatly
increased investor interest that followed the demise of apartheid and the
ending of sanctions against the country. The recent boom in both bond and
equity markets has been almost entirely foreign driven, in particular by
American funds looking for good deals abroad and attracted by South Africa's
relatively mature securities markets.
As a result, the discount between the financial and commercial rand,
regarded as a good barometer of international investor confidence, had been
steadily narrowing for most of the past six months. This in turn led to
speculation that the financial rand might soon be scrapped, a goal to which
both President FW De Klerk and African National Congress leader Mr Nelson
Mandela are publicly committed.
However, with the discount now around 30 per cent compared with a 21 per
cent average last year, most economists see little prospect for its removal
in the foreseeable future. 'If anything the financial rand is likely to drop
again,' notes Mr Kevin Lings, an economist at Nedbank.
The position is further complicated by South Africa's foreign debt
repayments. Combined with the interest and dividend payments due to
non-residents who have invested via the financial rand, these put enormous
pressure on the balance of payments as, without new foreign investment or
loans, the commitments have to be met through a current account surplus.
And with the country's reserves currently able to cover only around five
weeks' imports, room for manoeuvre is limited.
The commercial rand too has come under increased pressure in recent weeks,
also hitting new lows against the dollar. Its fall, however, has been less
precipitous than that of its financial counterpart and partly as a response
to the dollar's strength. Similarly, the stock market has remained
relatively steady, reflecting continued support from local institutions and
some bargain hunting by more experienced foreign investors prepared to take
the political risk.
But Mr Keys' stout defence of South Africa's economic future
notwithstanding, the volatility seems likely to continue, with many analysts
predicting further sharp movements in the markets in the run-up to the
election.

FT  14 APR 94 / South African Elections (April 26-28): Buthelezi rejects
mediation terms

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign mediation of South Africa's constitutional conflict was stalled even
before it began yesterday when Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha Freedom
party leader, demanded that a new date for all-race elections be put on the
mediators' agenda. Foreign mediators, led by Dr Henry Kissinger, former US
secretary of state, sat helpless in their Johannesburg hotel rooms yesterday
as the African National Congress, Inkatha and the government bickered over
the terms of reference for mediation.
The situation degenerated into farce when Chief Buthelezi called a hastily
convened press conference in the lobby of the Carlton Hotel to denounce the
ANC and government, claiming they were sabotaging mediation. He said they
were colluding to exclude the IFP from the April 26-28 elections.
'This is creating an insurmountable problem. It means that there is no
possibility that an acceptable mediation can be concluded on its own merit,'
Chief Buthelezi said. 'It is putting the cart before the horse. Our initial
agreement with the ANC was that the issue of an election date could be
discussed,' he said. The ANC denied this.
Lord Carrington, former British foreign secretary who is also part of the
seven-man mediation team, expressed frustration at the lack of a clear
mandate from the parties. 'It's clear that the mediators can't mediate if
there isn't agreement between the three parties on what they are mediating
about,' he said.
But it remained unclear why mediators had agreed to travel to South Africa
before the terms of reference for their task had been agreed. The dispute
over terms will have brought home to them the complexity of the task
required, given the wide differences in principle between the ANC and IFP.
As the parties bickered in Johannesburg, killings continued in Natal. In one
of the worst politically-linked attacks since a state of emergency was
declared on March 31 in the KwaZulu homeland and surrounding Natal province
a fortnight ago, seven people distributing election literature were burned
and hacked to death late on Monday. Police said a further nine people died
in violence in KwaZulu/Natal overnight, bringing to 193 the death toll in
political violence there since the state of emergency was imposed.

FT  14 APR 94 / Buddhist group to be probed

<TEXT>
The South Korean government has agreed to a parliamentary investigation of
allegations that the Chogye order, the country's main Buddhist group, was
involved in illegal financing of President Kim Young-sam's 1992 election
campaign.
At the same time the administrative head of the Chogye order resigned
yesterday, yielding to pressure from reformist monks who have staged violent
protests.
The Rev Suh Eui-hyun has been criticised by reformers for abusing his office
by allegedly accepting bribes from monks who sought appointments to head
some of the Chogye order's 1,700 temples. The Chogye order claims 90 per
cent of the nation's 20m Buddhists, who account for almost half South
Korea's population.
Reformist monks attacked the Chogye temple headquarters in central Seoul at
the weekend after Rev Suh was elected for a third term. Intervention by riot
police to quell the protest provoked opposition charges that government was
supporting Rev Suh because he was allegedly involved in financing President
Kim's election campaign.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's seven-party coalition yesterday moved closer to choosing Mr Tsutomu
Hata, foreign minister and deputy prime minister, as the country's new
leader.
The warring left and right wings of the alliance declared a conditional
truce in the power struggle set off by last Friday's decision by Mr Morihiro
Hosokawa to resign as prime minister. Neither side had managed to attract
enough support to overcome the other, forcing socialist supporters to call a
halt.
Coalition leaders now tentatively aim, barring last minute skirmishes, to
put the new candidate to the vote on Monday in both houses of parliament and
announce a new cabinet line-up the same day. The prospect of the
pro-business Mr Hata as prime minister cheered equity investors, lifting the
Nikkei index by 2.1 per cent, or 412.08 points, to 20,060.41.
Mr Hata, who had been a possibility for prime minister when the coalition
chose Mr Hosokawa last summer, is an activist for political reform, a keen
advocate of economic de-regulation and believes Japan should play a wider
part in United Nations peacekeeping.
His closeness to Mr Ichiro Ozawa, joint leader of Mr Hata's Japan Renewal
party, the dominant group on the coalition's right wing, may go down well
with the Washington, where Mr Ozawa is respected as a useful
behind-the-scenes negotiator in the US trade dispute.
Mr Hata is due this evening to meet US Vice President Al Gore at the Gatt
ministerial meeting in Marrakesh, to discuss US-Japan relations, including
the deadlocked trade talks. He returns to Tokyo on Sunday.
The coalition has not yet formally adopted Mr Hata as its candidate, and one
of its smaller members, the New Harbinger party, refused to negotiate
yesterday, but there are no rivals with a chance of commanding majority
support.
The alliance looked well on the way to breaking up early this week, but it
now appears it will merely miss its end-of-week deadline for choosing a
prime minister by a few days.
The left wing's decision to end its breakaway bid came in response to a plea
for coalition unity from Mr Akira Yamagishi, president of Rengo, the
8m-strong trade union confederation, a powerful backer of the Social
Democratic party, which is the largest coalition member and leader of the
left wing. Mr Hata is 'the most likely candidate,' said Mr Keigo Ouchi,
leader of the Democratic Socialist party, an SDP partner.
Until yesterday, the SDP and its allies were reluctant to accept Mr Hata
because they feared this would strengthen Mr Ozawa's dominance and pull the
coalition to the right. They still feel suspicious, indicating the next
government might be as unstable as the current one, but accept that Mr Hata
may be the only option.
Mr Ozawa yesterday insisted coalition members should reach 'at least a rough
agreement' on the main issues facing the next government, such as tax
reform, deregulation and a response to North Korea's suspected nuclear arms
programme. The socialists differ with Mr Ozawa's supporters on all three
issues.
Negotiations in the next few days are expected to focus on policy
co-ordination and make-up of the cabinet. Mr Wataru Kubo, deputy head of the
SDP, was tipped yesterday as possible chief cabinet secretary. That includes
being government spokesman and the prime minister's chief of staff, a job
which may help assuage socialist fears of being dominated by the
conservatives.

Rwandan rebels and government troops fought pitched battles in the capital
Kigali yesterday as more than 100,000 refugees left the city, Agencies
report from Kigali.
Up to 20,000 troops of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front advanced from the
north to reinforce small groups already in the city. Members of the
provisional government completed a retreat to the countryside.
In New York, the United Nations Security Council was due to consult in
private last night. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, after a
meeting on Tuesday night with Mr Willy Claes, foreign minister of Belgium,
the former colonial power, set out several options in a report to the
Security Council. These appeared to include abandoning the 2,500-strong
peacekeeping operation. However, the UN might instead 'add additional troops
(to) replace the Belgian troops in case they would withdraw'. Belgian radio
said yesterday that Mr Boutros Ghali had agreed Belgium could withdraw its
420-strong contingent of UN peacekeepers, ten of whom have been killed.
An estimated 20,000 people have been slain in Rwanda in a week, the latest
eruption of a long feud between the country's two main ethnic groups.

<TEXT>
The attempts of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to broaden democracy
in the territory were yesterday given strong support by an all-party UK
parliamentary committee which has conducted a nine-month study of Britain's
relations with China.
The House of Commons foreign affairs committee, which took evidence from Mr
Patten as well as British and Chinese ministers and officials, fell short of
asserting unequivocally that Mr Patten had no alternative course when he
announced electoral reform plans in October 1992. But it firmly endorsed the
steps Mr Patten took at key points in the resulting dispute with China,
which resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
The report also supported proposals that a statutory commission and an
independent watchdog body be established to monitor abuses of human rights
in Hong Kong.
It said fears that China would not honour its commitments were
understandable given its 'increasingly threatening noises' over electoral
reform, its unwillingness to co-operate even on straightforward aspects of
the transfer, and its threats to pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong.
Mr Patten's proposals, the committee said, were within the letter of
previous agreements with China. Although it objected to the concept of
functional constituencies - business groups electing members of the
Legislative Council - it said: 'We support the widening of the democratic
base of these functional constituencies as proposed by the governor.'
The committee said Mr Patten was right not to negotiate proposals with
Beijing before announcing them in Hong Kong, and in ensuring that the final
decision on them would be taken by LegCo. 'In the face of Chinese
unwillingness to find a compromise, the governor had no choice but to put
his proposals in full to LegCo.'
Using language which echoed that used by Mr Patten himself, the committee
said: 'We hope LegCo will. . . be able to agree electoral arrangements which
are within the terms of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and which
are open, fair and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.'
The Joint Declaration was the 1984 Sino-British agreement on the return of
sovereignty, and the Basic Law is Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution,
written by Beijing.
The report implied a firm rebuke for Sir Percy Cradock, the retired diplomat
who negotiated the Joint Declaration and subsequent Sino-British agreements.
Sir Percy told the committee Mr Patten's reforms risked harming Hong Kong.
The committee said: 'We endorse the foreign secretary's refusal to do a deal
which could appear shabby and inadequate.' Giving in to China would have
undermined the Hong Kong government to the extent that Hong Kong's stability
 -including, perhaps, financial stability - could be at risk.
However, the committee acknowledged that China's treatment of Hong Kong
after 1997 could not be predicted. It cited a letter to the committee from
Mr Ma Yuzhen, Beijing's ambassador in London, saying China would dismantle
the reforms and the 1997 transfer would imply full recovery of
administrative power.
The committee's broader recommendations included calls for broadening
Sino-British cultural links and the government's pursuit of dialogue with
Beijing on human rights and Tibet. It expressed concern that BBC World
Service Television will no longer be broadcast to China by Mr Rupert
Murdoch's Star TV network and hoped the BBC would quickly find a new means
of broadcasting news into China.

<TEXT>
US and Japanese tax authorities have agreed that Japan should reimburse AIU,
the US insurance company, a proportion of back taxes collected under Japan's
transfer pricing tax rules, according to AIU.
The agreement represents a significant blow to the efforts of Japan's tax
authorities to win penalty taxes from foreign groups which they believe have
transferred overseas profits made in Japan.
It also underlines the difficulty governments face in trying to determine
how to tax a foreign company engaged in cross-border transactions.
Japan's National Tax Administration levied back taxes of about Y9bn (Pounds
59m) on AIU, which the company's branch in Japan paid in 1991. The demand
was prompted by concern that AIU's Japan branch had paid an excessively
large amount of reinsurance fees to overseas insurers and received less
commission than would have been expected. As a result, it was thought that
profits which AIU had made in Japan were transferred overseas.
AIU disagreed and asked the National Tax Administration to discuss the case
with the US Internal Revenue Service. The US company was also slapped with
about Y2bn in back taxes by the Tokyo Taxation Bureau in 1990, a move which
is also likely to be discussed by Japanese and US authorities.
The transfer pricing tax system is not intended to penalise companies for
avoiding tax payment, AIU said in a statement. The focus of the talks was
how much tax AIU should pay the Japanese government and how much it should
pay the US government, it said.
In line with a growing international trend, Japan has used its transfer tax
pricing system introduced in 1986 to try to get foreign companies to pay
taxes on what the authorities consider profits made in Japan.
Last month, the Tokyo tax authorities levied a Y15bn penalty on Coca-Cola,
which it believes transferred around Y36bn of profits to the US by paying
its parent company excessive royalties. Coca-Cola said it would seek
bilateral government talks on the issue.
'It is easy for corporations operating internationally to decide where to
pay their taxes,' says Mr Mitsuru Komiyama, an accountant familiar with
international tax rules. Disagreement has to do with which country gets to
claim tax revenues from multinationals and the outcome is often determined
by a political settlement, he says.
The US has been aggressive in applying transfer pricing tax against Japanese
companies. For its part, Japan has applied penalty taxes under the system 50
times since 1986 but in only five cases has the penalty been cut through
government-to-government negotiations.

FT  14 APR 94 / A currency regime born from violence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial rand was first introduced to protect the country's reserves
after massive capital outflows followed a police massacre of black
protesters at Sharpeville in 1960.
Although it was scrapped in February 1983, the unit had to be re-introduced
in response to the upsurge in township violence that erupted in 1985. The
currency's previous low - before this week's collapse - was reached in
August of that year when the foreign exchange markets had to be temporarily
closed by the government after then President PW Botha's notorious Rubicon
speech that was supposed, but failed, to mark a no-return shift to reform of
apartheid.
In essence, financial rands comprise a pool of rands that can only be used
by foreign investors. They are created when a non-resident sells a South
African asset to a local investor. The payment is made in rand and deposited
in a local bank. It can only be used again by another non-resident in
exchange for foreign currency.
For all regular transactions on the current account the commercial rand, in
effect the country's trading currency, is used. In addition to acting as a
penalty against capital withdrawal, the financial rand also serves as an
incentive for new foreign investment because all yields are remitted in
commercial rands giving a greatly augmented return.
However, the currency has several obvious shortcomings, especially its
susceptibility to 'roundtripping' or illegal arbitrage between the two
units. Another problem is that the market is thinly traded and thus easily
moved by large orders, which is what happened on Monday.
Because of the financial rand's role as a foreign investment vehicle, the
South African Reserve Bank cannot support it. 'Its level is purely a
consequence of non-resident transactions,' says Mr James Cross, Reserve
(central) Bank general manager for foreign exchange.

US consumer and environmental organisations are recommending a moratorium on
challenges against food safety, health and environmental measures brought
under rules to be inherited from Gatt by its planned successor, the World
Trade Organisation.
In 'Trading Away US Food Safety', Mr Ralph Nader's Public Citizen and the
Environmental Working Group charged that rules agreed in the Uruguay Round
jeopardised key federal and state standards. They want a three-year
moratorium to give a trade and environment committee the chance to rewrite
the new rules and to 'democratise' the new Gatt dispute settlement
procedure.
US consumer and environmental groups have long warned that, under the
Uruguay Round global trade pact, many US standards would be subject to
challenge. In response, trade negotiators tightened language in the text of
the Sanitary and Phytosanitary and Technical Barriers section of the new
trade pact and now insist that they have safeguarded any rules which are
scientifically based.
However, Mr Nader says the new pact could undermine bans on hormone treated
beef, restrictions on food irradiation, meat and poultry inspection, and
nutritional labelling on rules. 'Nothing is more likely to pull down our
present US consumer and environmental protections and derail future advances
than the proposed trade deal,' he said.
The trade pact uses the standards of the Rome-based Codex Alimentarius
Commission (Codex), a group strongly influenced by the chemical and food
industries, as the model for legitimate standards-setting when relevant
scientific evidence is insufficient. Many US standards are stronger that
Codex standards.

Ministers from developing countries railed yesterday against moves by
industrialised nations to include labour standards in trade negotiations,
saying they would provide a cover for protectionism.
Mr Pranab Mukherjee, India's commerce minister, told the ministerial meeting
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that although India was
strongly committed to internationally recognised labour standards 'we see no
merit whatsoever in the attempt to force link-ages where they do not exist'.
Mrs Rafidah Aziz, trade minister of Malaysia, said the linkage of trade with
labour standards 'would in effect provide a convenient cover for trade
protectionism'.
Under a compromise between the US and developing countries hammered out in
Geneva last week, labour standards will not be specifically mentioned in the
formal documents of the Uruguay Round, due to be signed in Marrakesh
tomorrow.
However, it and other issues may be raised in the preparatory committee for
the World Trade Organisation, which will replace Gatt.
Sir Leon Brittan, European Union trade commissioner, said the issue was 'a
legitimate global concern and cannot be taboo among participants in the
world economy'.
The US and the EU say they do not want to curb competition from low-wage
countries but to tackle slavery, child exploitation and bans on trade
unions.
Apart from labour standards, industrialised countries this week proposed the
WTO discuss competition policy, investment rules and finance/exchange rate
policies.
Developing countries have put forward free movement of workers and
restrictive business practices - the latter aimed mainly at alleged abuses
by multinational companies of dominant market positions.
Third world nations also called for compensation for poor countries which
stand to lose from the Uruguay Round's provisions. Some have urged a
permanent monitoring mechanism within the WTO to assess the Round's impact
on individual nations.
Among other proposals, developing countries want assistance to exploit new
market opportunities, including help to diversify exports and outlets, as
well as financial aid, debt relief and extra trade preferences.
Many developing countries complain that industrialised nations have not done
enough to open their markets to their goods, with the poorest feeling that
they have had a raw deal from the Uruguay Round.

FT  14 APR 94 / World Trade News: Union falls short on solidarity -
Marrakesh Diary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's ministerial conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has not so far been a glorious showcase for the European Union's
post-Maastricht solidarity.
Indeed, many member governments have seemed determined to cling to sovereign
prerogatives with a tenacity which would warm the hearts of diehard Tory
Eurosceptics in Britain.
Take France, for instance. Mr Gerard Longuet, its industry minister,
astutely captured the headlines by making his first priority a bilateral
meeting with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, within hours of
the latter's arrival on Tuesday.
Mr Longuet had the double satisfaction of getting to see Mr Kantor before
Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, did so and of then immediately
holding a packed press conference at which he pontificated on the great
global economic issues.
Mr Longuet justified this exercise in freelance diplomacy on the grounds
that he was entitled to act independently in those areas not covered by
'Community competence' - the jargon for jointly agreed EU policies. He
freely admitted, however, that he would be hard put to say exactly where the
boundaries of such policies fell.
* * *
Since Sir Leon arrived in Marrakesh, his life has been complicated by the
antics of EU states seemingly intent on demonstrating the truth of the old
parliamentary adage that 'your opponents are in front of you and your
enemies behind you'.
Soon after his first meeting with Mr Kantor, he had to rush off to an
emergency session of the Council of Ministers, summoned because of Germany's
last-minute doubts about whether an arcane legal dispute about banana
imports would allow it to sign the Uruguay Round trade deal tomorrow. The
Portuguese, meanwhile, have seized the opportunity to make a fuss about
textiles trade.
As if this were not enough, all 12 member states decided to stage an
eleventh-hour protest yesterday about the signing of the Round. The
Commission had suggested that it and member state ministers should sign as a
group under the collective rubric of the EU. That is how EU members are
listed in the official Gatt list of delegations.
The suggestion was, however, too much for the 12 governments. They insisted
that they follow the overall alphabetical order of the list of Gatt
delegations. As a result, France's signature will precede Gabon's, the
Netherlands will follow Namibia and the UK will sit next to the United Arab
Emirates.
* * *
The actual document to be signed tomorrow is a monster. Consisting of the
final text of the Uruguay Round, lists of detailed tariff schedules and
sundry last-minute additions, it will run to more than 20,000 pages and
weigh in at around 175kg. Just the thing for insomniacs with strong arms.

FT  14 APR 94 / World Trade News: Canada wheat row talks due
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Top-level efforts will be made in Marrakesh today to head off a tit-for-tat
trade war over Canadian wheat exports to the US market.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture
secretary, and their Canadian counterparts, Mr Roy MacLaren and Mr Ralph
Goodale, will make a final attempt to settle the dispute before a US-imposed
deadline of April 22.
The US has threatened to clamp down on imports of Canadian wheat, prompting
a warning of retaliation by Ottawa. These imports have surged in recent
years, from 330,000 tonnes in the 1989-90 crop year to 1.5m tonnes in
1992-93 and an estimated 2.5m tonnes in 1993-94.
The latest jump arises partly from the need to plug the gap in animal feeds
supply after a sharp drop in US corn (maize) production because of the
Mississippi floods.
Another factor has been high wheat prices in the domestic US market caused
by the diversion of supplies under the US Export Enhancement Programme. This
has made the US an increasingly attractive market for Canadian wheat.
The unfamiliar sight of Canadian trucks unloading grain at US elevators has
enraged wheatgrowers in the northern US states. They have mounted a strong
political campaign in Washington to curb the trade, spearheaded by the
influential Senator Max Baucus from Montana who is chairman of the trade
subcommittee of the Senate finance committee.
This has caused a big headache for the US administration. While it could
invoke so-called Section 22 import quotas, which are covered by a waiver
from fair trade rules under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
waiver is due to lapse next year when the Uruguay Round trade accords take
effect.

The European Union and the US hinted yesterday that they might withhold full
free trade privileges from China if it were admitted to the new World Trade
Organisation without accepting all the obligations and disciplines required
by other members of the body. Their statements, at a ministerial meeting of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakesh, appear designed to
increase the pressure on China as its negotiations on joining the WTO enter
a crucial stage.
China is pressing to join as a full member when it is set up as successor to
the Gatt at the start of next year. However, the US and EU insist Beijing
has failed so far to demonstrate conclusively that it is prepared to abide
by the body's rules.
Sir Leon Brittan, European trade commissioner, said yesterday: 'If a country
can't comply with absolutely everything, one could say that one way of
dealing with it might be to say, okay, we might defend ourselves with action
that isn't normally to available to us.'
Sir Leon, talking after a meeting of the 'quad' powers - the US, the EU,
Japan and Canada - stressed that he was speaking only for the EU. However,
senior US trade officials later said they 'did not disagree' with his
statement. The US administration has already said that if China did not meet
demands that it improve its human rights record, the US might unilaterally
deny Most Favoured Nation treatment to China's exports after it joined the
WTO.
However, US officials said yesterday they were also concerned with China's
apparent reluctance to conform with existing Gatt requirements. They were
particularly concerned by its insistence on keeping secret certain import
quotas, on national security grounds.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, deputy US special trade representative, is understood to
have emphasised at a meeting with senior Chinese diplomats yesterday that
the US wanted to improve bilateral economic relations, but that China must
take steps to curb widespread piracy of compact discs and computer
programmes.
On Tuesday, Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, said his government
favoured China's membership of the WTO but expected it to fulfil all its
obligations - including any new standards the body set on workers' rights.
Singapore has offered to host the first WTO ministerial meeting, due to be
held in 1996. The offer was made yesterday in Marrakesh by the trade and
industry minister, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong.

FT  14 APR 94 / World Trade News: Agriculture accord could leave poorest
worst off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International aid agencies are worried. The Gatt agreement on agriculture is
likely to leave the poorest countries worst off while perpetuating the
subsidies that help farmers in developed countries dominate world markets,
they say.
'There's a lot of talk about level playing fields,' Mr Kevin Watkins, senior
policy adviser to Oxfam, told a conference on Gatt and agriculture in
developing countries this week.
'We're talking about a level playing field that runs downhill all the way
from the US and Europe to the developing countries.'
One of the biggest bones of contention is that European Union compensation
to arable farmers for cuts in support prices under the common agricultural
policy reforms is excluded from the Gatt agreement to reduce domestic
support to agriculture. This also applies to US farm support payments.
'If you put public funds into the hands of big farmers producing cereals,
it's reasonable to assume some of that will go into production,' said Mr
Watkins. 'About a third of cereal production is exported. So shouldn't these
compensatory payments be treated as export subsidies?'
According to some independent forecasts, the preservation of support for
European arable farmers, coupled with likely rises in output per hectare of
at least 1.5 per cent a year, will leave EU cereal production close to its
1992 level by the end of the century.
'In cereals at least, it seems clear that US and more particularly EU
production will be higher with these (support) payments than it would be
without them, and that the additional production will have a material effect
on the world market,' said Ms Jenny Pryke of the Catholic Institute for
International Relations, which organised the conference in conjunction with
Oxfam and Christian Aid.
'Development agencies are concerned about the effect on food-importing
countries of large volumes of cheap imports being available because it
discourages local farmers from producing for their markets,' she said.
This imperils their ability to become self-sufficient and to trade food
regionally. Only 5 per cent of Africa's overall trade is with other African
countries.
At the same time, however, the agencies are concerned that poor
food-importers would be badly hit if world prices did rise, as predicted by
the European Commission and the US Department of Agriculture, as a result of
the 21 per cent cut in subsidised export volumes under the Gatt.
They argue that current food dependence is bad. But the alternative scenario
of rising world prices, while welcome to some middle-income agricultural
exporters like Argentina and Thailand, would make things at least
temporarily worse for low-income food-importing countries.
The Gatt deal allows for extra help for these countries. But rather than
being limited to aid, support should boost domestic agricultural production,
said Mr Clive Robinson of Christian Aid. 'That needs to be in place before
the adverse price effects take place,' he said.
Another target of attack by the development agencies is the incoherence of
policies which destroy with one hand the help they provide to developing
nations with the other.
The Zimbabwe dairy industry, supported by the EU, is one of the few in the
region, according to Ms Carol Thompson, associate professor at the
University of Zimbabwe. But when it tried to expand by exporting to other
parts of southern Africa, 'it ran into dumped powdered milk from the EU.'
Many conference participants said developing countries must make use of
their numerical strength in the new World Trade Organisation to defend their
interests.
The alternative looked grim for the poorest countries. Mr Luis Hernandez, of
the Centre of Studies for Change in Rural Mexico, found direct similarities
with the North American Free Trade Agreement. 'Like Nafta, the Gatt will
accelerate the integration of unequal partners without the financial and
institutional arrangements to protect the poor,' he said.

FT  14 APR 94 / World Trade News: Singapore offer to host WTO meeting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore has offered to host the first ministerial meeting of the new World
Trade Organisation, due to be held in 1996.
The offer was made yesterday in Marrakesh by the trade and industry
minister, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong. Mr Yeo said the choice of Singapore would be a
recognition of Asia's contribution to global trade. It would complete the
circle of Uruguay Round meetings that began with the round's launch in
Uruguay in 1986.

FT  14 APR 94 / World Trade News: EU countries lose sight of solidarity -
Marrakesh Diary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's ministerial conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has not so far been a glorious showcase for the European Union's
post-Maastricht solidarity. Indeed, many member governments have seemed
determined to cling to sovereign prerogatives with a tenacity which would
warm the heart of diehard Tory Eurosceptics in Britain.
Take France, for instance. Mr Gerard Longuet, its industry minister,
astutely captured the headlines by making his first priority a bilateral
meeting with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, within hours of
the latter's arrival on Tuesday.
Mr Longuet had the double satisfaction of getting to see Mr Kantor before
Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, did so and of then immediately
holding a packed press conference at which he pontificated on the great
global economic issues.
Mr Longuet justified this exercise in freelance diplomacy on the grounds
that he was entitled to act independently in those areas not covered by
'Community competence' - the jargon for jointly agreed EU policies. He
freely admitted, however, that he would be hard put to say exactly where the
boundaries of such policies fell.
What does seem clear, though, is that Paris is increasingly overcoming its
traditional mistrust of all things American and discovering common ground
with Washington. Mr Longuet made clear that, as well as being 'in perfect
agreement' on financial services liberalisation, the two sides shared
similar objectives in pressing for a 'workers' rights' clause in the Gatt.
They also seem to be employing the same public relations adviser. Obviously
shaken by widespread suspicions among developing countries that workers'
rights was merely a synonym for protectionism, they have decided to take
another tack.
Mr Longuet has fallen back on the ingenious argument that the whole issue is
really a way of enabling the French government to defend free trade
principles against unnamed populist pressures for protection. Mr Kantor,
meanwhile, is claiming that the US is simply waiting patiently for the Gatt
to put into effect a provision envisaged when establishment of the
organisation was first mooted almost 50 years ago.
However, he tactfully omitted to mention that the grand scheme was sunk when
the US Congress killed off plans for a powerful International Trade
Organisation.
* * *
Sir Leon, meanwhile, seems to be content to take a backseat in the PR battle
by allowing the US to do most of his briefing for him. As of lunchtime
yesterday, he had given no press conference and had none planned. His sole
contribution was a fleeting appearance at Mr Kantor's side.
Asked whether Mr Longuet's earlier endorsement of China's plans to join the
planned World Trade Organisation represented EU policy, Sir Leon blustered
about his statement to Gatt ministers earlier in the day - which never even
mentioned China by name.
Top US trade negotiators, by contrast, had already held one press briefing
by lunchtime yesterday and had called another for a few hours' later.
* * *
Catering to the communications needs of the roughly 3,000 delegates and
journalists at the Marrakesh conference has strained to the limit the
resources of ONPT, the Moroccan telephone monopoly. On the whole, its
employees have risen to the challenge with enthusiasm and good humour.
However, there has been the occasional technical glitch.
One recurring problem is that several delegations have had their lines cut
off without warning - allegedly while essential maintenance work is carried
out on switchboards. After service has been restored, some have found that
their numbers have been mysteriously switched for those of other
delegations. The diplomatic consequences can only be guessed at.
But none of this should trouble the office of the Moroccan information
ministry at the conference press centre, where a single official sits
surrounded by no fewer than 12 telephones. As they say, information is
power. . . .

FT  14 APR 94 / World Trade News: US concern on food safety rules - Uruguay
Round pact could undermine standards, report warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A report by US consumer and environmental organisations is recommending a
moratorium on challenges against food safety, health and environmental
measures brought under rules to be inherited from Gatt by its planned
successor, the World Trade Organisation. In 'Trading Away US Food Safety',
Mr Ralph Nader's Public Citizen and the Environmental Working Group charge
that rules agreed in the Uruguay Round jeopardise key federal and state
standards. They want a three-year moratorium to give a trade and environment
committee the opportunity to rewrite the new rules and to 'democratise' the
new Gatt dispute settlement procedure.
US consumer and environmental groups have long warned that, under the
Uruguay Round global trade pact, many US standards would be subject to
challenge. In response, trade negotiators tightened language in the text of
the Sanitary and Phytosanitary and Technical Barriers section of the new
trade pact and now insist that they have safeguarded any rules which are
scientifically based.
However, Mr Nader says the new pact could undermine bans on hormone treated
beef, restrictions on food irradiation, meat and poultry inspection, and
nutritional labelling on rules. 'Nothing is more likely to pull down our
present US consumer and environmental protections and derail future advances
than the proposed trade deal,' he said.
The trade pact uses the standards of the Rome-based Codex Alimentarius
Commission (Codex), a voluntary organisation strongly influenced by the
chemical and food industries, as the model for legitimate standards-setting
when relevant scientific evidence is insufficient. Many US standards are
stronger that Codex standards, although sometimes the reverse is true.
The report says there are 241 foods and substances in which Codex allows
carcinogens and the US does not. In 47 cases both the US and Codex allow
carcinogens, but the US tolerance is lower.
'While the use of an international standard is not mandated, it may give
rise to reasonable expectations that such standards will be used,' the
report says. 'Some countries want to mandate the use of Codex and other
international standards when there are no relevant domestic standards, while
other countries (including the US) have resisted such an absolute mandate.'
It cites trade cases which allegedly threaten US standards. In one, the EU
has identified as an unfair trade barrier a US ban on wine with residues of
the pesticide, procymidone. The US Environmental Protection Agency
established an interim rule allowing procymidone in wine, in response to
trade pressure, the report says.

FT  14 APR 94 / Clinton returns reporters' fire
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday said he was not about to shut down the
federal government so as to devote all his time to every minute Whitewater
detail.
Showing some irritation with the media, he told the Association of Newspaper
Editors meeting in Washington: 'I'm doing the best I can, while I do the job
I was hired by the American people to do. I have been as candid and
forthright as possible' in answering questions about financial dealings in
Arkansas.
He shot back at one questioner: 'Maybe you have total and complete
recollection of every question that might be asked of you at any moment of
things that happened to you 12, 13, 14 years ago. . . or maybe you think I
should have shut the whole federal government down and done nothing but
study these things for the last two months'.
Mr Clinton quoted approvingly remarks by Garrison Keillor at a media dinner
he had attended on Tuesday. The well-known humorist had scoffed: 'All I know
is what I read in the papers, so Whitewater is a mystery to me'.
In fact, the Whitewater story has gone almost underground in the last two
weeks. Right-wing publications have continued to froth over Mrs Hillary
Clinton's trading in commodities 15 years ago and Mr Clinton's alleged
sexual appetites. But the mainstream media has been more introspective, with
many columns and some news reports analysing press mistakes and
over-emphasis on Whitewater.
The Easter congressional recess, now over, also helped lower the temperature
as has the absence of any new damaging or substantive allegations. Hundreds
of pages of documents sold to the press by Mr James McDougal, former
Whitewater partner of the Clintons, have tended to prove it was no more than
a money-losing land investment, as the president has always claimed. Only
marginal interest has been excited by evidence that Mrs Clinton managed the
investment more closely than her husband.
The editors also came in for criticism yesterday from two previous Clinton
nominees for high office. Ms Lani Guinier, in line last summer to run the
Justice Department's civil rights division, complained she had been grossly
mislabelled as 'a quota queen' because few journalists 'were apparently
interested in the facts'. Retired Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who could have
been secretary of defence, called newspapers 'the only monopolies left in
the country'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Holders of certificates of deposit issued last year by the Curacao affiliate
of Banco Latino, the failed Venezuelan bank, are to hold a creditors'
meeting in Curacao tomorrow.
An official of ING Bank, the Dutch institution which managed one of two
issues, said about Dollars 50m (Pounds 34.2m) of certificates of deposit
were outstanding. Some Dollars 30m were issued in August or September last
year, which have matured but not been repaid. A further Dollars 20m were
issued in November but have yet to mature.
Banco Latino in Venezuela collapsed in January after a run on deposits. It
reopened on April 4 but only to service small depositors. The bank's
troubles heightened problems in the Venezuelan banking sector, and the
government was forced to step in to support a further five banks which could
otherwise have collapsed.
Bankers present in Guadalajara said the second issue was managed by Banco
Interunion, a subsidiary of the Dutch bank and Banco Latino operating in the
Caribbean island of Curacao. Some suggested the amount of outstanding
certificates of deposit in fact approached Dollars 70m, but that these were
the only known international offerings by an affiliate of Banco Latino.
The position of Banco Latino Curacao is complicated, according to Venezuelan
bankers, by the fact that it is not a direct subsidiary of the Venezuelan
bank but merely shares the same shareholders. It has been alleged that the
Curacao bank was used to dump bad or otherwise questionable loans.
It was also reported that Banco Latino in Venezuela owes about Dollars 5m to
the US Export-Import Bank and Dollars 100m to the US Commodity Credit
Corporation. Exim Bank, with about Dollars 3bn outstanding in Venezuela, is
said to be concerned not about the size of the loan but the precedent that
non-payment would set.

FT  14 APR 94 / Record on rights clouds Salvadorean election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN SALVADOR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It was not long ago that many Salvadoreans felt the only way to settle
opposing views was to shoot each other. In this light, they handled their
differences with relative amity in the first round of the general election
on March 20.
But evidence of widespread voting irregularities, unchecked by the Supreme
Electoral Tribunal, have raised questions about whether the vote has
advanced the peace process, brokered by the UN, which began when the
government and guerrillas signed accords in January 1992 to end a 12-year
civil war.
'I used to give them the benefit of the doubt, but there comes a time when
you have to say it is bad faith,' says Dr David Browning, official UK
observer, about the tribunal, which is controlled by the right-wing
governing Arena party.
Mr Armando Calderon Sol, Arena presidential candidate, who failed by about
10,000 votes to secure the majority of the first-round vote, is expected to
win the run-off on April 24 against Mr Ruben Zamora, who heads a left-wing
coalition that includes former guerrillas of the Farabundo Mart National
Liberation Front.
The FMLN won almost a quarter of the vote in the elections, and its
politicians have found a space to operate within a political system which
excluded the left and centre-left from participation for more than 60 years.
Some senior FMLN officials have been murdered over the last year but El
Salvador's right-wing political establishment and economic elite has begun
to show some signs of tolerance towards its opponents.
But critics say reconciliation is far from complete. Human rights abuses,
particularly against the left, are still frequent and many of the social
causes that led to the war have yet to be redressed. In rural areas about 75
per cent of demobilised combatants from both sides have not been granted
land, and re-integration programmes have failed to meet targets. There is
also a long way to go on reform of the corrupt judicial system.
Deployment of a new civilian-run police force to take the place of the
widely loathed police forces under military control - a central achievement
of the peace agreement - is behind schedule and has been starved of funding.
In violation of the accords, the Arena government has drafted into the new
force members of the discredited National Police, without vetting.
According to a report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm
of the US Congress, in February the Salvadorean government still needed
almost Dollars 700m (Pounds 474m) to fulfil its obligations under the peace
accords.
The diminishing international interest may result in a reduction in aid over
the next few years, after three years of considerable foreign assistance and
substantial loans from international financial institutions within the
framework of a stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
For the US, which poured Dollars 6bn of mostly military aid into El Salvador
during the war, the country is now less important. US aid was reduced by 60
per cent, from Dollars 230m in 1993 to Dollars 94m in 1994.
The future government, almost certainly to be headed by Mr Calderon Sol, may
show even less enthusiasm for fully implementing the peace accords than the
current one.
Mr Calderon Sol's commitment to the accords remains open to question. He
does not appear to head a defined current within the party, and it is
believed he will take the line of the party bosses. Some observers fear that
Arena leaders, whose party was founded in 1981, in part to counter attempts
to reduce the political influence and economic domination of a small elite,
has little interest in implementing the reforms contained in the accords.

FT  14 APR 94 / Hedge funds 'no threat' to US system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US financial regulators yesterday told Congress they needed no new powers to
deal with any potential risks posed to the financial system by hedge funds.
Hedge funds - private investment pools which are often aggressively managed
and are usually structured to avoid direct regulation - have been blamed by
various commentators for everything from the collapse of the European
exchange rate mechanism to the recent drop in US bond prices.
However, a panel of regulators yesterday told the House of Representatives
banking committee that these posed no significant threat to the banking
system or the securities markets, and their treatment should be no different
to that of other investors.
'Hedge funds do not pose a significant risk to the national banking system,'
said Mr Eugene Ludwig, comptroller of the currency, whose office monitors a
large portion of the US banking system.
'It is important to recognise that hedge funds are not fundamentally
different from other institutions,' added Mr John Laware, a governor of the
Federal Reserve Board, which also monitors some banks.
But Mr Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
said he was 'concerned about the risks that could be posed to our markets by
the activities of some of these large, very active and aggressive hedge
funds.'
He said he had asked some of the largest funds voluntarily to give the SEC
information about their market positions and trading strategies.
Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the banking committee, said he was
concerned that hedge funds mights 'amass enough financial clout to move
markets.'
But regulators said the influence of the hedge funds on market movements had
been exaggerated.
Mr George Soros, whose Quantum Fund is regarded as the doyen of hedge funds
and whose group manages more than Dollars 11bn, told the banking committee
that more public forms of institutionally managed money, such as mutual
funds, posed a bigger threat to market stability than hedge funds because
they are 'trend followers by definition', and thus more likely to exaggerate
market movements.
'As far as my hedge funds are concerned, you are looking in the wrong
place,' Mr Soros said.
One other Congressional concern about hedge funds is the risk they might
pose to the banks from which they borrow to leverage their trading
operations.
Mr Ludwig said, however, that only eight of the banks under his supervision
had any involvement with hedge funds, with exposures ranging from 0.09 per
cent to 0.91 per cent of capital; their combined exposure was only Dollars
1.04bn, almost all of it covered by collateral such as government bonds.
After a morning of hearings, it became sadly clear, however, that few of Mr
Gonzalez's colleagues on the committee had the slightest idea of what a
hedge fund might be, and instead group them with derivatives in a catch-all
category of vaguely menacing financial concepts.

FT  14 APR 94 / A rich vision of a responsible future: Stephen Fidler, at
the IADB annual meeting, assesses a new view of regional banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury's senior international official, Mr Lawrence Summers, mapped
out this week a central role for the regional development banks in a new
world order.
If he has the influence many believe he has in the administration of
President Bill Clinton, the potential consequences for the Inter-American
Development Bank and the other regional banks are significant. For the IADB,
these imply new opportunities and big risks, taking it into areas where it
has never ventured.
'Regional development banks are as important to the new world order as the
regional security organisations were to the old one. For, just as the
regional security organisations were directed to the central challenge of
combating communism, so the regional development banks are directed to the
central challenge of shared prosperity,' he told the IADB's annual meeting
at Guadalajara in Mexico.
The IADB was created in 1959 and, in its early years, was essentially a
provider of project finance to governments. Its deliberations came to be
marked by hostility between the US and Latin American governments. The
resultant mutual mistrust still has echoes in the bank today. During the
1980s, the bank was mobilised to provide more balance of payments support to
the region's debt-distressed governments, and was authorised to provide
supporting finance for debt rescheduling.
The IADB's eighth replenishment of capital was agreed this week. This takes
the bank's overall capital base past Dollars 100bn (Pounds 68.4bn), will let
it lend perhaps Dollars 7bn a year indefinitely and ends the need for the
four-yearly return to government shareholders for money. The co-operative
spirit of the negotiations suggested a contrast to the shareholder hostility
of the past.
But the complex agreement that backed the capital increase testifies that it
gives the bank a far more difficult task than building dams and providing
balance of payments support. The bank is undergoing internal
re-organisation, likely to include a decentralisation and the movement of
perhaps 10 per cent of its operational staff from Washington to Latin
America and the Caribbean. But it remains to be seen whether the IADB can
become an effective force for dealing with these new issues.
The bank's president, Mr Enrique Iglesias, is widely acknowledged as an
accomplished diplomat who has succeeded in shifting the IADB to the centre
of the region's developmental effort. His strength, though, is not in the
internal management of the bank. The responsibility for that will fall on
the shoulders of Ms Nancy Birdsall, his number two. By tradition, this post
is held by a US citizen.
As one European observer suggested, the capital increase agreement bears
more than a slight resemblance to the European social charter. Social
equity, poverty alleviation, improvement of the functioning of governments,
environmental responsibilities are all now part of its remit. 'There can be
no economic growth without a stable society,' the agreement concludes.
However, Mr Wolf Grabendorff, head of the Madrid-based Institute for
European-Latin American Relations, who has been following the meeting,
emphasised the difficulties of tackling these new social responsibilities.
Managing such programmes will be labour-intensive, very country-specific and
involving much work in the field. 'Everybody's talking about social issues
on a grand scale, but nobody's talking about how it's going to be
implemented,' he said.
As described by Mr Summers, the bank should be the means to extend the
Clinton administration's vision for the US to Latin America. Labour and
environmental considerations, the strengthening of democracy and judicial
systems, the tackling of corruption, the encouragement of strong labour
unions and legislation to protect workers' rights effectively all figured in
his wish list.
For the moment, at least, Latin America and the US are singing from the same
song sheet. The approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the
promised Summit of the Americas, for Miami in December, have fostered the
impression that the US is seeking to improve relations with the region.
Mr Summers's comments were greeted positively for the most part because
Latin governments also increasingly have similar priorities. Finance
ministers are conscious that their efforts at economic reform have left
important social problems untouched. Minister after minister emphasised at
the meeting the overriding importance of social objectives. As the Chilean
finance minister, Mr Eduardo Aninat, suggested, the region's governments
cannot rely on 'trickle-down' to resolve social tensions.
Yet there is also a recognition of the danger that these US concerns often
touch the sovereignty of Latin American countries, and that the interference
by the US in Latin American affairs, justified by the cold war, may be
followed by a period in which Washington is seen as trying to dictate the
social agenda of the region.
After all, previous attempts by the US to develop a partnership with its
southern neighbours so as to promote democracy - most notably President
Kennedy's Alliance for Progress - failed on the whole to achieve their
objectives.
The Clinton administration's emphasis on encouraging social objectives
abroad are eyed suspiciously. An indication of this was provided by the
Nafta negotiations and the US introduction of side agreements to cover
labour and environmental standards in Mexico. The US characterised these
accords as an important precedent for future trade agreements, but could not
completely dispel the impression that these were driven by its domestic
considerations.

The US gun lobby has suffered a political setback with the failure of its
determined attempt to unseat a veteran Californian state senator.
Mr David Roberti had been the target of the National Rifle Association
because he sponsored a 1989 law to ban the sale of assault rifles in the
state. But, on Tuesday, he easily won a recall election, the first against
any Californian legislator in 80 years. The recall failed by 59:41 per cent.
The NRA only endorsed the campaign against Mr Roberti last month, but then
moved into high gear. He received particularly staunch support from Mrs
Sarah Brady. The new federal law on gun control - the Brady law - is named
after her husband, Mr James Brady, who was shot and seriously wounded during
an assasination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, whose press secretary he
then was.
Even so, Mr Roberti will have to leave the Californian senate this year
under a new state law to limit the number of terms any elected
representative may serve.
He is running for state treasurer, however, and will have been lifted in
that contest by the Tuesday result.
In Texas on Tuesday, Mr Richard Fisher, a wealthy businessman and former
associate of Mr Ross Perot, the Texan billionaire who ran for the US
presidency in 1992, beat Mr Jim Mattox, former state attorney-general, in a
Democratic party primary election. It was to choose a candidate to run for
the US senate against the Republican incumbent, Mrs Kay Bailey Hutchison, in
November.
Mr Fisher's campaign, like that of Mr Perot, was largely self-financed. But
he will need more than deep pockets to beat Senator Hutchison, now
considered virtually unbeatable after corruption charges against her were
dropped this year.
Last year, she easily won the special election to fill the Senate seat
vacated by Mr Lloyd Bentsen when he became Treasury secretary.

FT  14 APR 94 / Top Peronist pulls out of assembly

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
One of the leading figures in Argentina's governing Peronist party has
announced she will not take her seat in an assembly convened to rewrite the
country's constitution.
Peronist leaders held Ms Matilde Menendez responsible for the party's
unexpected defeat in the city of Buenos Aires in the assembly elections on
Sunday. She was alleged to have been involved in a corruption scandal.
The elections were held to select 305 delegates to a constituent assembly
which would allow President Carlos Menem to run for a second presidential
term in 1995. The current constitution bans successive presidential terms.
Mr Menem's Peronists took 38.8 per cent of the national vote - more than any
other party - but lost the federal district of Buenos Aires, the national
capital, by a wide margin to the Frente Grande left-wing alliance.
Ms Menendez said late on Tuesday she would not participate in the assembly
but would concentrate on the 'clarification' of allegations of corruption at
PAMI, the government health scheme for the elderly which she runs.
The alliance had campaigned on an anti-corruption platform and it alleged
bribery at PAMI. However, Ms Menendez says she will not resign as its head.
Allegations of corruption have dogged Mr Menem's administration since it
took office in 1989 but legal investigations have rarely been conclusive.
But, on Tuesday, a federal judge acquitted Mr Menem's sister-in-law, Ms
Amira Yoma, of accusations of laundering drug money in 1990-91 while she was
Mr Menem's personal secretary.
Argentina's trade deficit widened by 329 per cent in January to Dollars
585.6m (Pounds 397m), the second biggest expansion of the deficit since
Argentina stabilised its economy in 1991. The country has run a trade
deficit almost every month since November 1991. The deficit of Dollars
3.68bn last year was 40 per cent higher than in 1992. Imports in January
rose by half to Dollars 1.53bn but exports rose only 5 per cent to Dollars
946.5m.

<TEXT>
The six biggest cigarette manufacturers in the US yesterday surprised the
tobacco industry by publishing the secret list of ingredients they add to
cigarettes to improve flavour, taste and aroma.
The list shows that, after tobacco, the primary ingredients of most US
cigarettes - comprising about 10 per cent of the total by weight - are
water, sugars, glycerin, propylene glycol, licorice, cocoa, and other
flavourings.
The manufacturers' decision to publish the list follows a broadcast last
week by US National Public Radio, claiming US cigarettes contained 13
ingredients that were unsafe because they were not in the US Food and Drug
Administration's list of approved food additives.
Earlier the US TV network ABC had aired a current affairs programme claiming
that Philip Morris, manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes, was adding extra
nicotine to its cigarettes to make them more addictive.
Yesterday RJ Reynolds Tobacco, part of the RJR Nabisco group, said an
independent scientific panel had established that the ingredients added to
cigarettes were virtually the same as those found in everyday foods and were
'not hazardous under conditions of use'.
Of the 13 ingredients identified by National Public Radio, five were not
used by any of the six leading US manufacturers.
The others were either not detectable in the finished product, approved by
the FDA in other forms, or occurred naturally in foodstuffs ranging from
coffee to kiwifruit and grapefruit juice.

Supermarkets in Alaska are struggling to keep the shelves stocked after a
nationwide trucking strike by the Teamsters' union cut off the flow of
merchandise by ship from the west coast, AP reports from Anchorage.
Teamsters in Alaska are not part of the strike by about 70,000 drivers, dock
workers and mechanics. But longshoremen have been honouring the union's
picket lines at three west coast ports used by Alaska shippers, including
Tacoma, Washington, the main port.
The Teamsters went on strike against 22 trucking companies on April 6 over a
push to use more part-time workers and more trains. Since then two trucking
companies have reached interim agreements, and a third has gone out of
business.
It is the Teamsters' first nationwide strike against the trucking industry
since 1979.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy saw solid growth and only modest upward pressure on inflation
in the first quarter, in spite of distortions caused by bad weather,
official figures indicated yesterday.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.4 per cent last month in
cash terms, and by 8.9 per cent in the year to March.
The monthly gain was less than expected in financial markets, prompting an
initial rally in bond prices. However, bond prices subsequently drifted
lower again because data for sales in previous months was revised up,
suggesting greater strength of consumption at the start of the year than
previously suspected.
Retail sales, excluding cars, were revised up by a total of 0.6 per cent in
January and February.
Allowing for the revisions, the figures indicate real consumer spending may
have grown at an annual rate of 4 per cent or more in the first quarter.
Some analysts believe the economy will benefit from 'catch-up' spending this
month - a rebound in sales of building materials last month did not fully
compensate for weather-related declines in January and February.
The consumer price index rose by 0.3 per cent last month and 2.5 per cent in
the year to March, roughly in line with market expectations. The 'core'
index, which excludes the volatile components of food and energy, rose by
0.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
Bond yields have risen steeply in recent weeks on fears that faster growth
will lead to higher inflation. However, few analysts are surprised by the
relatively subdued consumer price index. Nascent inflationary pressures
usually show in commodity and wholesale price indices before being passed on
to the consumer.

FT  14 APR 94 / Cuban power cuts top 10 hours a day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba's authorities have blamed lack of spare parts from former communist
bloc-built power plants for unusually long power cuts - sometimes exceeding
10 hours a day - in the capital, Reuter reports from Havana.
The power failures are an added strain on Cubans already battling severe
shortages of transport, many food items and basic consumer goods such as
soap and toothpaste.
The state news agency AIN quoted on Tuesday electricity board officials as
saying the problem lay with Soviet and Czech-built plants which accounted
for more than half the country's 3,132MW generating capacity.
Spare parts had not been received for these plants since 1990 and Cuba's
ability to keep up maintenance with the parts it had lasted only until May
last year, AIN said.
About 821MW-worth of generating capacity was affected by breakdowns, 570MW
by maintenance work and 372MW by general limitations on generating capacity,
the agency added.
However, new spare parts were being bought, which would enable the country
to carry out a maintenance programme and recuperate generating capacity.
The AIN report did not mention lack of fuel for Cuba's oil-powered
electricity plants as a reason for the difficulties.
Cuba has been facing a severe economic crisis, including chronic fuel
shortages, since the collapse of the communist bloc and its traditional aid
and trade links. It has grown used to regular power failures in the last few
years.
In recent months the power cuts in Havana were scheduled to last about four
to six hours a day.
But this rose to eight to 10 hours a day in the last two weeks, with cuts
sometimes running beyond schedule. In parts of Havana earlier this week
there was no power for 12 hours.
Last August there was an outbreak of vandalism in Havana apparently linked
to frustration over unusually long power cuts.

Supermarkets in Alaska are struggling to keep the shelves stocked after a
nationwide trucking strike by the Teamsters' union cut off the flow of
merchandise by ship from the west coast, AP reports from Anchorage.
The week-old strike had forced Safeway Stores to pay almost twice as much to
move merchandise by truck and air as it would by sea, Mr Richard Near,
Alaska district manager, said on Tuesday.
Safeway filled 37 trucks with goods in Seattle last Thursday and put them on
the rugged, two-lane Alaska Highway to Anchorage.
Teamsters in Alaska are not part of the strike by about 70,000 drivers, dock
workers and mechanics. But longshoremen have been honouring the union's
picket lines at three west coast ports used by Alaska shippers, including
Tacoma, Washington, the main port.
The Teamsters went on strike against 22 trucking companies on April 6 over a
push to use more part-time workers and more trains. Since then two trucking
companies have reached interim agreements, and a third has gone out of
business.
It is the Teamsters' first nationwide strike against the trucking industry
since 1979.
Governor Walter Hickel and Senator Frank Murkowski of Alaska asked the union
to let Sea-Land Freight Service, the big ocean freight link between Alaska
and the rest of the United States, load ships.
'We're stressing how dependent the state economy is on ocean transport,'
said Mr Jim McKenna, Alaska general manager for Sea-Land. 'There really is
no other realistic way to ship goods up here.'
But Mr Ron Carey, the Teamsters' president, suggested the politicians
contact the trucking companies involved in the dispute.
'We take no pleasure in a strike that causes economic disruption for other
businesses and the average citizen,' Mr Carey said.
'But this is a fight for the long-term interests of all working Americans.'

A gunman walked into a Japanese-owned fibre optics plant in the US yesterday
and opened fire, killing one person and wounding two others, AP reports from
Research Triangle park, North Carolina.
Authorities evacuated the Sumitomo Electric Fiber Optics plant and combed
buildings for a man identified by witnesses as a recently dismissed
employee.
Police in Durham said they had surrounded the unidentified suspect's home.
The 490-employee Sumitomo plant, which makes optical fibre cable and fiber
optics components, is among the cluster of research, manufacturing and
technical plants in the research park 10 miles west of Raleigh. The company
is a subsidiary of Sumitomo Electric of Japan.
'We looked out over the plant floor - we saw people just running at random.
And it was just a pop, pop, pop. We never did see the guy,' Mr Sid Gregory,
a Sumitomo employee, told a local television station.
Employees were evacuated from the plant but not allowed into the car park to
recover their vehicles, so shuttle buses took some to a nearby cafeteria and
relatives picked up others.
Medical staff confirmed that one person was dead. A man and woman underwent
surgery for multiple gunshot wounds and both were reported to be in serious
condition.
The shooting was reported shortly before 8am at the plant, the local
sheriff's department said.

FT  14 APR 94 / Serbs promise end to Gorazde onslaught
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SARAJEVO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first glimmer of a breakthrough between the United Nations and the
Bosnian Serbs appeared yesterday when Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special
envoy, claimed to have won a commitment from the Serbs to halt their
offensive in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde.
But in Sarajevo, there was more intense sniper fire than has been heard for
several weeks, and at least two rockets were fired, one landing not far from
the headquarters of the UN commander in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose.
This was described by a UN officer as 'a clear violation' of the 20km
exclusion zone for heavy weapons imposed by Nato in February.
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, said in Belgrade that
negotiations in Bosnia could only resume if sanctions against his country
were lifted.
The Serbian media meanwhile intensified its propaganda war against the UN
and humanitarian organisations, creating a tense climate for western
residents.
Despite his tough public stance, Mr Milosevic met Mr Yasushi Akashi, special
representative of the UN secretary-general, and General Bertrand de
Lapresle, head of UN forces in former Yugoslavia.
Fighting between Bosnian government and Bosnian Serb forces yesterday abated
in Gorazde following two Nato air strikes on Serb targets in the enclave.
Bosnian Serb forces stopped shelling the town - only firing sporadic bursts
from anti-aircraft guns on the outskirts, said Major Rob Annick, spokesman
for UN forces in Sarajevo.
Efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gorazde, restore the flow of humanitarian
aid through Serb-held territory, and get the peace process back on track,
were stepped up yesterday when Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, EU and
UN mediators, flew to the Bosnian capital.
The visit was unexpected as the Geneva conference chaired by Lord Owen and
Mr Stoltenberg has been largely sidelined in recent months by US and Russian
diplomacy.
The reason, however, is obvious enough. Since the UN requested air strikes
last Sunday and Monday against Bosnian Serb forces in Gorazde, the Serb
leaders have denounced the UN as no longer objective and cut off relations
with Unprofor (the UN protection force).
Although Mr Stoltenberg represents the UN, he is not directly connected with
Unprofor, and even before last weekend Serb leaders were urging a return to
the Geneva process, which they remember as more favourable to their war aims
than the more recent moves involving Nato and the US.
Significantly, Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg yesterday became the first
westerners allowed to enter Serb-held territory in Bosnia since the Nato air
strikes, when they travelled to Pale, to meet Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of
the self-proclaimed 'Serb republic'.
Previously, the Serbs had designated Mr Churkin as the only acceptable
mediator.
Lord Owen said after meeting Gen Rose, that he hoped to widen the issue from
the fate of Gorazde and get the peace process back on track.

FT  14 APR 94 / Pasok rivals jockey to succeed Papandreou
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
So many prominent Greek socialists have stressed the importance of party
unity ahead of today's conference of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement that ordinary delegates are arriving in Athens fearful that Pasok
unity might actually be under threat.
The tension has to do with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. He is 75 years
old and suffers from heart problems but in the six months since the
socialists' triumphant return to power, he has given no hint of who might
succeed him as party leader.
Though the leadership question will not be raised officially, according to
congress organisers, cracks are almost bound to appear in Pasok's facade of
consensus. Debate in the corridors will be sharp, with potential contenders
vying for support among the 2,000 delegates for a contest expected next
spring, at the latest.
That is when 88-year-old President Constantine Karamanlis, who is even more
frail than the prime minister, is due to step down. Though Mr Papandreou
professes reluctance to become head of state, a ceremonial post, his young
wife Dimitra, now becoming more active in politics, could persuade him to
take the job.
However, the party is so closely identified with Mr Papandreou, its founder,
that potential successors are anxious to avoid provoking a confrontation in
the mean-time.
The leading candidate, Mr Akis Tsochatzopoulos, the central committee
secretary, bases his claim on little more than unswerving loyalty to the
prime minister.
Two other frontrunners with sounder political credentials, the defence
minister Mr Gerasimos Arsenis and industry minister Mr Costas Simitis, are
both tainted by having criticised Mr Papandreou publicly in the past.
Yet without a clear signal of support from Mr Papandreou, none of the
half-dozen contenders can hope to rally the party's diverse factions,
ranging from purist marxists to 'populists', 'modernisers', and
'pro-Europeans'.
With two polls in the offing - European elections in June and local
government elections in October - the conference must repair divisions over
government policies on reducing the public sector deficit and introducing
fiscal reforms.
The finance ministry's latest bill, which attempts to broaden the tax base
and crack down on tax evasion, is already being modified to meet demands
from different interest groups. It will be more difficult to head off an
attack by delegates representing militant public sector trade unions, who
oppose the socialists' plans for partial privatisation of utilities.
Since its last congress in 1990, Pasok has managed to transform itself, with
a fair amount of success, from a radical movement based on marxist
principles to a social democrat party on the western European model.
Mr Papandreou's anti-American rhetoric and vociferous support for radical
regimes like Iraq and Libya, both calculated to annoy Greece's western
partners, have disappeared.
So has much other ideological baggage carted along the 'third road to
socialism,' which Mr Papandreou mapped out when he returned in 1974 from
exile following the collapse of the colonels' dictatorship and launched
Pasok.
Yet Mr Papandreou has been careful to balance improved ties with the US,
where he will make an official visit next week, with concessions towards the
old hardliners.
A new law stripping deposed King Constantine of his remaining property in
Greece - a palace on the island of Corfu and a forest near Mount Olympus -
as well as of his Greek passport, was passed by the Greek parliament on the
eve of the socialists' conference.

FT  14 APR 94 / Commission takes Greece to court over Macedonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece yesterday denounced a European Commission decision to begin legal
proceedings over its blockade of Macedonia, setting itself on what appeared
to be an embarrassing collision course with the Commission.
The Greek government, which currently holds the presidency of the European
Union, called the legal action 'extremely unfortunate, inappropriate and
contradictory'. It gave no indication that it would lift the blockade, which
was imposed after a dispute over Macedonia's flag and constitution.
The dispute could undermine attempts to build a tighter European foreign and
trade policy and potentially calls into question the authority of the
Commission's legal institutions.
Commission officials admitted that the case will test the ability of the
European Court to force Greece to comply with any decision if Athens insists
on playing by different political rules.
Yesterday's decision, broadly supported by the other 11 EU member states,
involves two separate legal actions. One action calls for an interim
injuction to lift the blockade, and could be decided within three weeks.
The other action, which will probably take 18 months to complete, is a
request for the European Court to make a full judgment about whether the
blockade infringes article 225 of the Maastricht treaty.
This article requires that member states should not impose unilateral
commercial sanctions except in cases of national security. The Commission
has rejected Greece's argument that Macedonia represents a national security
issue.
In theory, the Maastricht treaty gives the court the powers to fine a member
state for flouting a court ruling. In practice, though, this power has never
been used, and remains unclear in scope.
As one diplomat yesterday said: 'Greece has good domestic political reasons
for wanting the whole thing to drag on for as long as it can. . . For the
Commission, though, this means the embarrassment will grow.'

FT  14 APR 94 / Commission takes Greece to court over Macedonia
</HEADLINE>

The European Commission is to take Greece, current holder of the EU
presidency, to court to force it to lift its blockade of Macedonia.
But with Greece indicating that it will not back down, in spite of weeks of
diplomatic pressure, the real question now is how much authority the
European Court will be able to wield if Greece continues playing by
different political rules.
The Commission has applied to the European court for two separate legal
actions - the first, a full judgment about whether Greece's action infringes
the Maastricht treaty, is expected to take 18 months; the second, an interim
injunction to order Greece to lift the blockade, could be forthcoming in
three weeks.
Although the Commission has often taken member states to court for an
infringement of Community law, it has has rarely attempted an injunction of
this kind. And if, as seems likely, the court rules in the Commission's
favour, it is not clear what course the court could follow if Greece ignores
the injunction.
In theory, the Maastricht treaty gives the court power to fine a member
state for flouting a court ruling. In practice, legal experts point out this
power has never been used and say it remains unclear what its practical
scope would be.
In public, Commission officials say they hope that diplomatic pressure will
prevent a crisis. Mr Kiro Gligorov, the Macedonian president, said this week
he was willing to reopen negotiations on the sensitive subject of
Macedonia's flag and constitution and some diplomats hope the two sides may
be moving closer to a compromise. Meanwhile, Mr Christos Zaharakius,
secretary general of Greece's foreign ministry is due to meet Mr Cyrus
Vance, the United Nations envoy today.
Diplomats admit that the instability of Balkan politics leaves them doubtful
of any solution before the court ruling. As one said yesterday: 'Greece has
good domestic political reasons for wanting the whole thing to drag on for
as long as it can .. For the Commission, though, this means the
embarrassment will grow.'

FT  14 APR 94 / Sarajevo hangs between war and peace: Edward Mortimer and
Laura Silber on deprivations in the war-ravaged capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'What do I need a tram for? To ride around inside this prison camp? Nothing
is better here.'
'Gorazde? It's all the same to me. After what we've been through in the last
two years, you become selfish. You only worry about yourself.'
'Well, I suppose (the Nato air strike) is positive. They finally showed they
can do something. But it wasn't much, considering what's happened in the
last two years, and how we've suffered. None of us think it's the end.'
'No, I'm an optimist as far as Sarajevo is concerned. I think the Nato
ultimatum works. You see, we only take account of the news as far as it
affects us personally.'
Sarajevo, as the above comments gathered at random from its inhabitants
suggest, is a city hanging between peace and war. Most people still live on
meagre rations brought in by humanitarian agencies, which depend on an
airlift run by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. The airlift has been
suspended since the air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces in Gorazde
earlier this week - as it usually is at times of high tension. But the UNHCR
built up significant stocks of food during March, when flights were
uninterrupted, and now reckons to have supplies for at least 10 days.
To the visitor, Sarajevo displays an eerie calm. There is virtually no
traffic in the streets, except for the famous trams and the white vehicles -
some armoured - of the UN and Red Cross. A taxi charges DM50 (Pounds 20) for
the mile or so from the PTT building, where the UN has its headquarters, to
the Holiday Inn where the foreign press corps is holed up.
Life in the Holiday Inn is privileged by Sarajevo standards, but still far
from luxurious. Parts of the building, including what was once known as 'the
safe restaurant', have been closed because of shell damage. The rooms that
are still usable command, through cracked window panes or plastic sheeting,
a view of two burnt-out skyscrapers, once the headquarters of a state-owned
conglomerate, with a backdrop of red-roofed houses rising up towards the
heights from which, until February, the shells were fired.
Running water is available only in the daytime (from about 9am) and rarely
hot. Power cuts are frequent, but of late have been mercifully short. Meals,
served in the 'dangerous restaurant' (so-called because it is on the side
more exposed to Serb snipers), are filling, if hardly gastronomic, and can
be washed down with white wine from Mostar at Dollars 35 (Pounds 24) a
bottle.
The label shows Mostar's famous bridge, as it was before Croat artillery
destroyed it last October.
Telephone links survive only within the city, except for those privileged
few with access to satellite phones. Both Reuter and the BBC have installed
these in suites within the hotel, making other news media heavily dependent
on their goodwill.
Outside the hotel is a broad boulevard running east-west through the city.
Westward it leads to the PTT, the airport, and Serb barracks at Lukavica,
where until Monday those armed with suitable documents could cross into
Serb-held territory. VIPs like Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the
peace mediators, can still fly in and out, but for journalists this week it
once again became almost impossible either to reach Sarajevo or, if one is
already there, to leave. For the vast majority of Sarajevo residents, going
anywhere else remains a pipe dream.
To the east, it is a short walk from the Holiday Inn (if one braves the
snipers) to the city centre, with its twin seats of government: the
'presidency', which houses the battered but defiant state apparatus of the
republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina; and the 'residency', where the telegenic
head of 'BH Command', Gen Sir Michael Rose, holds court.
Every morning at 9.45 the press assembles in the PTT building for a briefing
from Gen Rose's spokesman, Maj Rob Annink. This hapless, if well-meaning,
Dutchman has been given the task of making a thoroughly abnormal situation
sound normal.
Since Monday the Serbs have been making life quite nasty for the UN. Between
30 and 50 UN military observers are now being held hostage, or 'under house
arrest', in Serb-held territory. One has disappeared altogether.
But this, Maj Annink insists, is 'an administrative matter' to be sorted out
by quiet diplomacy rather than threats.
There is just one snag: the Serbs have cut off relations with the UN, which
makes diplomacy rather difficult.

FT  14 APR 94 / Serbs promise end to Gorazde onslaught
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's chief negotiator in fomer Yugoslavia, said
yesterday he had won a promise from the Bosnian Serbs that they would not
resume their onslaught against the Moslem enclave of Gorazde.
The pledge, made by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, offered a
glimmer of hope that negotiations on the republic's future can now resume,
despite Serb fury over the recent air strikes by Nato.
However Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, maintained a hard-line
stance, saying that talks on Bosnia's future could not resume until
international sanctions against Serbia were lifted.
The West has been counting on Mr Milosevic, under intense pressure because
of the ruinous effect of sanctions on his country's economy, to use his
influence on his kinsmen in Bosnia to soften their stance.
In Bosnia, the Serbs continued to block the movement of United Nations
personnel, both civilian and military, and they renewed accusations that the
UN had sided with the Moslems by ordering air strikes last Sunday and
Monday.
However Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, said in New York last
night that despite the air strikes, the UN had not taken sides in Bosnia and
must not do so.
He appeared to acknowledge a danger that persistent recourse to air power
would put Nato in the position of a warring party, when he said:
'We must be alert to the consequences of air strikes, we must think through
where this activity is likely to lead and us, and prepared to manage our
future responses so that we get where we want to go.'
Mr Rifkind criticised the United States for failing to support the request
of General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, for extra
peace-keeping troops, and urged Washington to reconsider.
'We must not put ourselves in the situation where we lack the tools to carry
out the job,' Mr Rifkind said, calling the current US position 'difficult to
understand'. Mr Churkin, a deputy Russia foreign minister who helped to
mastermind last month's deal between the Croats and Moslems, is the now the
only international negotiator of any standing with whom the Serbs are
prepared to deal.
His renewed prominence suggest that for the second timethis year, Western
efforts to put pressure on the Serbs have perversely increased the
prominence of Russia, Serbia's traditional protector.
In Moscow, the foreign ministry called on all sides to desist from
provocative action around Gorazde, which was reported to be quiet yesterday
after two weeks of fighting which have claimed at least 200 lives.
Western officials said they believed the Serbs may have satisfied their
ambitions in Gorazde, having penetrated the town's southern outskirts and
captured Gradina mountain which overlooks the town.
The Serbs were now in a position of partial control over the town, similar
the position they occupied in Sarajevo.
However there is concern that even if the Serbs can be tempted back to the
negotiating table, the Moslems may resist peace talks unless the Serbs
withdraw.

FT  14 APR 94 / Economic Watch: Spanish unemployment declines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Spain's registered unemployed fell by nearly 15,000 to 2.76m or 17.92 per
cent of the workforce in March, the labour ministry said yesterday. This
fall compares with a rise of 57,725 in March 1993. 'This shows a change in
the employment trend, confirming increases in hiring and placements, higher
levels of occupation and a certain improvement in economic activity,' the
ministry said. The number of placements in March was up 26 per cent from
March 1993 at 489,130, which the ministry says is the highest monthly figure
registered since 1985. Apprenticeship and training contracts in the first
quarter of 1994 were up 114 per cent from a year earlier to 64,179.
German consumer prices rose 2 1/2 per cent on a seasonally-adjusted
year-on-year basis in the last three months stripping out a rise on oil
taxes from the start of this year, the Bundesbank reported yesterday.
The Netherlands' February year-on-year retail sales of non-food and durable
goods edged up by 0.2 per cent in real terms but were up 1.5 per cent in
nominal terms.
France's current account widened to show a seasonally adjusted surplus of
FFr16.08bn (Dollars 2.75bn) in January after a FFr15.68bn surplus in
December. Before seasonal adjustment, there was a FFr12.5bn surplus in
January and a FFr16.14bn surplus in December.

FT  14 APR 94 / Portugal privatisation programme starts to run out of steam:
Lisbon must widen the appeal of sell-offs after a shortfall in forecast
revenues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Measures to advance 'popular capitalism' in Portugal are driven by a
pragmatic need to rescue a flagging privatisation programme and ideological
moves to convert a nation of savers into investors.
Mr Eduardo Catroga, the finance minister sworn in after a cabinet reshuffle
in December, plans to alter the centre-right government's approach to
privatisation by offering small savers discounted shares in state-owned
companies.
He has shifted the emphasis of privatisation and departed from the tenets of
the programme, begun in 1989, which aimed to raise the maximum possible
revenue for the state. The minister, calling this detrimental to the
long-term success of denationalisation, has said it should be replaced by
more important objectives.
The new priority is to make privatised companies attractive enough to small
savers and to disperse the capital to a wide base of shareholders. This
would keep privatised companies in Portuguese hands, despite the weak
financial capacity of Portuguese business groups. It would also stimulate
the stock market, where privatisation operations have so far failed to
mobilise many small investors or significantly increase liquidity.
'The thinking behind the 'popular capitalism' proposals is more practical
than philosophical,' said Mr Alfredo de Sousa, economics professor and
president of a ratings company. 'The government needs to shift the country's
savings out of bank accounts into more risky investments in the economy. But
such measures face technical problems and are unlikely to be successful for
long.'
Mr Catroga plans to widen the appeal of privatisation operations following a
1993 shortfall in forecast revenues partly due to recession. Only Es70bn
(Pounds 270m) was raised against a predicted Es225bn. The government failed
to sell a bank, a cement producer and a steel company because the bids were
either too low or no offer was made.
The government hopes to earn Es200bn from the sale of state-owned companies
this year. But instead of focusing on the sale of indivisible blocks of
capital to companies and institutional investors, Mr Catroga plans to float
more shares on the stock market.
'He aims to convert the cautious Portuguese, sitting on their savings, into
small-time capitalists prepared to take bigger risks in the hope of bigger
rewards,' said a Lisbon stock market analyst. Potentially, huge funds could
be mobilised - Portuguese are among the biggest savers in Europe, hoarding
between 17 and 18 per cent of income.
Interest rates on deposit accounts, where most Portuguese savings are
placed, have been cut substantially over the past two years due to tougher
competition between banks and falling inflation. Some small savers have
moved tentatively into unit trust funds, where the gains have been much
bigger, but most remain wary of the stock market.
Over the next two years the government will try to encourage them to invest
in some of the biggest privatisation operations attempted in Portugal,
including sale of stakes in telecommunications and power utilities, cement,
banking and insurance. The government estimates privatised companies will
represent 50 per cent of stock market capitalisation by the end of 1994
compared with a current 37 per cent.
Mr Catroga's ability to offer shares at a discount will be determined by at
least two independent valuations as stipulated under the privatisation law.
'The legislation allows us to offer shares to small savers at the minimum
price evaluated,' he said, whereas the prices for companies, groups and
institutional investors would be closer to the maximum price fixed by the
valuers.
Analysts say the government would have to offer big tranches to smaller
savers to reinvigorate the bourse. Previously, business groups have paid
high prices for privatised companies in stock market flotations; and having
won control then showed they had no further interest in trading, offering
little hope of capital gains for small investors.
A hurdle facing the 'popular capitalism' proposals is that the stock market
is falling, making small investors reluctant to buy shares even at a
discount. Procedures to determine exactly who qualified for cheaper shares
could also be complex.
'The ultimate difficulty will be that, after a short time, big investors
will begin financing small savers to buy shares on their behalf and
undermine the whole scheme,' said Mr de Sousa.
The government believes mobilising small investors to participate in the
privatisation programme will also help keep companies under Portuguese
control, given that domestic businesses cannot match the financial capacity
of foreign competitors.
But Mr Catroga appears to have acknowledged that this is not sufficient
protection. He also proposes a variety of means, including 'golden shares'
carrying management veto rights, by which the state would be able to
maintain control of strategic companies.

The 32-nation Council of Europe has elected a Russian-speaking Swede to be
its new secretary general, at a time when the biggest political problem
facing Europe's premier human rights organisation is how to respond to
Russia's application to join. Mr Daniel Tarschys, a 50-year-old former
Swedish conservative MP, was elected on Tuesday, beating Mrs Catherine
Lalumiere, a French socialist who has been secretary general for the past
five years. Behind Mr Tarschys' success was said to be the belief that the
Council needed the Swede's Russian expertise in gauging how to respond to
the membership applications that have been filed by Russia, as well as
Belarus and the Ukraine.

Germany yesterday warned the Turkish government against military excesses in
its campaign against Kurdish separatists in south-eastern Turkey, days after
German arms shipments were stopped after parliamentarians said they were
being used against Kurds. 'The Kurdish question can only be solved
peacefully on the basis of an agreement between the Turkish government and
the Kurds,' Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, told the Bundestag. The
question of German arms shipments to Turkey, which were halted on Friday,
has topped the political agenda in recent days. A similar case, following
delivery of German tanks in April 1992, cost the then defence minister his
job. Mr Kinkel (pictured above, left, with Chancellor Helmut Kohl) said Mr
Hikmet Cetin, Turkish foreign minister, had repeatedly assured him that
German arms were not being used against the Kurds but only for defence of
Turkey's borders with Syria and Iraq.

<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial group, yesterday unveiled an
experimental hydrogen-powered electric van which runs on fuel cells,
converting chemicals directly into electricity without the need to burn
fossil fuels. Daimler-Benz is among several companies in Japan, the US and
elsewhere working on fuel cell technology for transport and power
generation. In the production of the van, Daimler-Benz co-operated with
Ballard Power Systems of Canada, which developed a fuel-cell bus operating
in Vancouver.
This technology utilises highly efficient electricity production without
noxious exhaust gasses and with less carbon dioxide than conventional
engines. The equipment is still too heavy and the cost too high for fuel
cells to enter commercial use yet. Mr Firoz Rasul, president of Ballard,
said it would take less than 10 years for the problems to be resolved,
adding that California's tough new emission laws would act as an important
spur to fuel cell technology.

FT  14 APR 94 / EU adopts works councils plan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 1,000 pan-European companies will have to set up elected works
councils under a proposal adopted by the European Commission yesterday. The
plan is to ensure that workers' representatives in companies employing more
than 1,000 people, and more than 100 in at least two member states, are
consulted and informed on cross-border business decisions which affect them.
EU labour and employment ministers will discuss the proposal next Tuesday,
after which it will get a fast-track first reading from a supportive
European Parliament. Ministerial approval is expected in June, with formal
adoption in October after a second parliament reading.
The UK, which has an opt-out from the Social Chapter of the Maastricht
treaty, will not have to put the directive on its national statute book.
However, British companies with continental plants will be affected, and the
Commission expects works councils to seep into the UK as multinationals
respond to union pressure for common consultation rules.

Russia's air transport minister yesterday announced plans for a 2 per cent
levy on airline revenues to fund tighter supervision of the country's
fragmented airline industry. The new controls follow last month's Airbus
crash in which children were believed to have been learning how to fly. The
controls would include the issue of regular proficiency certificates to
airline staff. The government has also approved a long delayed document
transforming Aeroflot-Russian International Airlines, the state-owned
national carrier, into a joint stock company, which means it can be
privatised. It is not clear whether the company will be able to resist staff
pressures for its break up into four staff-owned carriers. The Russian
airline industry, which has already broken up into dozens of mini-carriers,
needs consolidation to withstand international competition and its
credibility has been so damaged that the International Airline Passengers'
Association yesterday warned its members not to fly over any part of the
former Soviet Union.

FT  14 APR 94 / Italian alliance split over choice of speakers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Italy's victorious Freedom Alliance is deadlocked over choosing candidates
for the key positions of speaker in the chamber of deputies and in the
senate.
The disagreement underlines the serious differences that continue to dog the
formation of a new government.
A meeting to resolve the deadlock, due yesterday, was postponed at the last
moment without explanation. The postponement followed a meeting between
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the
man considered most likely to be asked to form the next government.
The choice of speakers for the two houses of parliament is the first step in
the opening of the new legislature. This will take place tomorrow and
precedes the formal consultations by the president on forming a new
government.
The most difficult choice concerns that of speaker for the Senate, where the
Freedom Alliance failed to win a majority of the 320 seats. The Alliance of
Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, the populist Northern League and the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, plus the rump of the former Christian
Democrat Party, the Christian Democrat Centre won 154 seats.
The League wants its own senator Mr Francesco Speroni. Mr Berlusconi has
been looking for someone capable of attracting some eight small party
senators to ensure an upper house majority. This has led to talk of Mr
Giovanni Spadolini, the outgoing Republica speaker and former premier, being
asked to stay on. But the League rejects this.
suggested its Mr Cesare Previti. But yesterday the MSI proposed its own
candidate, Mr Giulio Maceratini.
In the case of the chamber, the League has again been touting one of its
leading figures Mr Roberto Maroni. However, Mr Maroni seems more likely to
be earmarked for a senior cabinet position. This could leave the way open
for one of he veteran politicians who has changed sides to back Forza Italia
like the Liberal deputy Mr Alfredo Biondi.
These difficulties also reflect the intense bargaining over the composition
of the next government. Mr Berlusconi is under pressure to draw his
ministerial team from within the Freedom Alliance; but he has discovered in
recent days a paucity of ministerial talent. This has led him to look
elsewhere, including approaching some members of the Ciampi government such
as Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury minister.

FT  14 APR 94 / Polite differences in the rich country club: Martin Wolf and
David Buchan on a contest for the leadership, and future direction, of the
OECD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If knowledge is power, then the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development must be one of the most powerful institutions in the world.
Unlike the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, it has no money to
lend. Unlike the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade it oversees few
agreements and offers no formal mechanism for settlement of international
disputes. Instead, it provides its 24 industrial country members - a club of
the world's most powerful economies - with a neutral civil service, a
meeting place and a wide-ranging publication programme.
Into this quiet and even grey world has been introduced an equally polite,
though determined, political battle to become the organisation's secretary
general - and a related contest over its future role in a much-changed world
economy.
In what has often been dismissed as a talking shop, the OECD's secretary
general, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, suddenly finds himself faced with three rivals
for the post he has held for the past 10 years.
Challenging the French incumbent are Mr Donald Johnston, a former Canadian
minister who is strongly backed by the US, and two other European candidates
 -Lord Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Lorenz
Schomerus, a senior German economics ministry official. The race will be
decided at, or before, the OECD's ministerial meeting in June.
Tucked into one of the nicest parts of Paris, the OECD began life as the
overseer of the post-war Marshall Plan aid. But, with European recovery
assured, it acquired its present wider character in 1961. Again, in the
much-changed international economy of today, the question for Mr Paye and
his rivals is how the organisation should develop.
A decision to keep Mr Paye on would be a vote for continuity, as would
selection of Mr Schomerus. The German official is little known outside OECD
circles, where, significantly, he chairs the same steering OECD body, known
as 'the executive committee in special session', as Mr Paye did when he was
chosen 10 years ago.
Neither of the outside candidates is preaching drastic change. Mr Johnston
talks of the need for 'evolution, rather than revolution', while Lord Lawson
acknowledges that Mr Paye 'has done a very competent job'.
Both men stress the OECD's need to play a more global role. The difference
is that Mr Johnston believes this should be done through more dialogue with,
and study of, non-OECD parts of the world, while Lord Lawson believes the
OECD should be better at broadcasting around the world its message of 'the
promotion of economic development through economic liberalism'.
Mr Johnston's contention that it is time to break the European monopoly on
the OECD's top post - particularly now that the Europeans increasingly
handle their own economic affairs through the European Union - clearly
appeals to non-European members. Japan, Australia and New Zealand are
believed to be leaning in his direction. By contrast, the only public
backing that the three European candidates have is from their own
governments.
The other difference lies in campaign tactics. Mr Paye is relying on the
advantages of incumbency, Mr Schomerus has been busy in Marrakesh this week
representing Germany in the Gatt, while Lord Lawson is slightly raising the
low profile of his campaign by visiting Canberra this week and lunching with
with OECD ambassadors in Paris next week.
By contrast, Mr Johnston is doggedly carrying his lobbying to the capitals
of all 24 members, including Iceland. So far the public sign that any of
this campaigning might actually have a sharp edge came last month when he
was quoted in Paris as saying the OECD was 'too bureaucratic' and did not
respond to its members' needs. He had found 'a great sense of frustration'
among members.
This contrasts with the consensual procedure by which OECD chiefs
traditionally emerge. Each member has an equal veto on the final choice.
The OECD is not a large organisation. With a budget of some FFr1bn (Pounds
120m) and 1,900 employees (600 of whom are professionals, mostly
economists), it is severely stretched. Its well-known publications - such as
the Economic Outlook and the economic surveys of individual countries - are
a small, albeit high profile, part of what the OECD does. Concealed behind
them is a never-ending round of meetings among senior national officials,
serviced by the secretariat.
These meetings help governments learn from one another. Equally important,
they help them understand one another. Failures in economic prediction,
shared by most forecasters, have undermined confidence in the OECD's own
economic output. But the forecasting does not matter that much. Reports
still remain valuable to outsiders as sources of analysis and data.
They are also useful for insiders, not least finance ministers wanting to
wave something with credibility in the faces of recalcitrant national
colleagues.
Mexico will today be formally invited to join the OECD as its first new
member for more than 20 years. South Korea would like to become its first
member from the Asian mainland next year, while several central European
countries are preparing their candidacies.

FT  14 APR 94 / Russia investment tax worry
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Russian minister yesterday evaded western companies' worries that
they may have to pay an 18.7 per cent tax on investments in Russia at a time
when the country says it is desperate for foreign capital. Foreign
investment may be affected by the December presidential decree which taxed
loans in an attempt to fight Russian enterprises dodging VAT by making
tax-free payments in the form of fake 'loans'.
Mr Steve Hasson, tax partner at Price Waterhouse, said the new Russian move
could 'hit inter-company loans from western parent companies to a Russian
subsidiary, loans from the EBRD and the World Bank, as well as western
commercial bank loans.' Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister
responsible for the economy, hoped that President Boris Yeltsin's earlier
decree to protect existing foreign investment from mid-stream tax changes
would override the latest decree.

FT  14 APR 94 / Boost for Lloyd's Names from two key rulings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Loss-making Names on the Lloyd's of London insurance market yesterday scored
two separate court victories which could have widespread ramifications in
their search for compensation.
The House of Lords rejected an appeal from 71 members' agents who claimed
that they were not contractually liable for negligent underwriting by
Lloyd's syndicates. Members' agents allocate Names, the individuals whose
assets have traditionally supported the market, to syndicates.
Separately, a High Court judge made an unprecedented ruling that a members'
agent was liable for losses incurred by two Names.
The decision by the House of Lords clears the way for legal cases seeking
more than Pounds 1.2bn being brought by Names on the Gooda Walker and
Feltrim syndicates, which were among the highest loss-making syndicates on
the market. The Gooda Walker case is due to begin in the High Court on April
26.
'This is a key issue that affects all action groups,' said Mr Michael Deeny,
chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, representing names on the
syndicates. He said it affected almost all the litigation being brought by
over 30 Names' action groups involving losses of over Pounds 3bn.
Separately, in the High Court yesterday Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled that KMR
Services, a members' agent previously known as H G Poland, was liable for
losses incurred by two of the Names whose affairs it managed.
The Names had claimed they had requested to be placed on a conservative
portfolio of low-risk syndicates and had instead been allocated to high-risk
ones.
The decision in their favour may directly boost the case of other Names
seeking compensation against members' agents.
The ruling also contained a significant precedent because it granted a
highly unusual indemnity against future losses which will be incurred by the
two Names on their syndicates, in addition to compensation for the
liabilities they have already incurred.
Mr Tim Brentnall, a partner with Elborne Mitchell, which acted for KMR, said
his client was 'highly likely' to appeal against the ruling in favour of one
of the Names, and was 'considering' an appeal against the second Name.
Asked whether the finding against the members' agent suggested Lloyd's had
failed to regulate the market adequately, a spokesman said: 'It could be
that some people might interpret it as that.'

FT  14 APR 94 / Schneider crisis threatens jobs, Kohl warns banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday intervened in the financial crisis
surrounding Jurgen Schneider, one of Germany's biggest property groups,
warning creditor banks against rushing to force the company into bankruptcy.
Mr Kohl said banks should be mindful of their responsibility to jobs and
businesses which depend on the company's continued survival.
According to a briefing after yesterday's cabinet meeting in Bonn, Mr Kohl
and other ministers expressed concern about the Schneider group's troubles.
Mr Gunther Rexrodt, economics minister, is heading a task force to examine
ways of limiting the impact of Schneider's problems on the small business
sector.
The company was plunged into crisis following Friday's disappearance of Mr
Jurgen Schneider, the founder and chief executive. Schneider said yesterday
the 59-year-old entrepreneur's whereabouts were still unknown. Mr Kohl's
intervention preceded a meeting today of representatives of more than of 40
of the company's creditor banks. According to unconfirmed reports, the group
owes DM9bn (Pounds 3.5bn) - DM5bn to bankers and a further DM4bn to trade
creditors.
It is widely expected that the group, based at Konigstein near Frankfurt,
will file for bankruptcy, a step which Mr Kohl's remarks seem designed to
avert. Schneider employs more than 2,000 people throughout Germany, but many
thousand more jobs are at risk among the small businesses and craftsmen in
the construction and building supplies industries.
Mr Hinrich Lehmann-Grube, mayor of Leipzig, the eastern German city where
Schneider has a significant presence, said at least 3,000 jobs in the
Leipzig area depended on the troubled group. The IG Bau-Steine-Erde building
union said the true figure was 5,000.
Chambers of commerce throughout Germany are asking local companies to
register their exposure to Schneider. The economics ministry stressed it was
too early to calculate the exact consequences of the debacle as nobody -
including the bankers who meet today - appears to have an overview of the
group's assets and liabilities.
The politicians' early concern seems driven by the possible impact of job
losses on this year's crop of regional and national elections. An
unconfirmed report in the authoritative Borsen-Zeitung newspaper said that
about a dozen, exclusively German banks were owed more than DM100m each by
the company.
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, is thought to have the largest
exposure, with credits outstanding of DM1.3bn. Dresdner Bank, Germany's
second biggest bank, is thought to be owed about DM330m, while Hypo-Bank is
thought to be the next biggest creditor with a loan of DM270m. Deutsche
Hypo, a mortgage banking unit of Frankfurt-based BHF-Bank, said its exposure
to the financially troubled Schneider real estate group amounted to about
DM200m. 'The loans are first mortgages secured on completed and fully rented
out properties,' Deutsche Hypo said. It did not expect Schneider to default
on the loan.
Commentators compared the group's difficulties with those of
Metallgesellschaft, the Frankfurt-based mining metals and industrial group
which came to the brink of collapse earlier this year owing in excess of
DM9bn.

FT  14 APR 94 / US and EU reach deal to liberalise Dollars 200bn market

The US and European Union clinched a trade deal yesterday which will open up
to transatlantic competition a range of public sector contracts valued at
more than Dollars 200bn (Pounds 137bn) a year.
However, the agreement to liberalise public procurement markets excludes the
telecommunications sector and does not meet EU demands that the US remove
Buy American provisions which prevent foreign suppliers from bidding for a
range of state infrastructure programmes financed by the federal government.
Nonetheless, the deal on equipment and services contracts, reached two days
before the agreed Friday deadline for completing negotiation, averts the
threat of a breakdown in bilateral relations which would have soured the
atmosphere at this week's ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US special trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, the
European trade commissioner, hailed the agreement as an important step
forward. They hoped to extend its terms to other countries which have signed
the government procurement code of the Gatt.
The agreement, which takes effect at the start of 1996, will enable US and
European companies to compete freely for the first time in each other's
markets for government contracts below central or federal government level.
It also covers the supply of equipment and services for power generation and
supply.
Thirty-nine US states, including the five largest, have agreed to open their
markets to European bidders, as have the cities of Boston, Dallas,
Indianapolis, Chicago, San Antonio, Detroit and Nashville. US suppliers will
be allowed to bid for many state and local government contracts in the EU.
European officials said the biggest gain was the right to bid for contracts
for US rural electrification projects and to supply publicly-owned power
utilities in New York. Mr Kantor said the agreement would open to US
companies EU electrical utilities contracts worth Dollars 28bn a year.
However, the agreement excludes several categories of US states' procurement
covered by Buy American provisions because the Clinton administration was
unwilling to ask Congress to repeal the legislation. These are airport
improvement, mass-transit systems, highways and water treatment schemes.
Telecommunications was excepted because the US could not agree to EU demands
that the agreement cover privately-owned American telephone companies, and
because Washington was unable to persuade Brussels to do more to liberalise
procurement by European telecommunications monopolies.
The two sides will continue to apply in these areas partial trade sanctions
which they imposed on each other last year. However, they have agreed to
continue talks on opening up telecommunications procurement.
But US negotiators insisted that they would have free access to Germany's
telecommunications equipment market, under a 1954 bilateral treaty. This is
disputed by the Commission, which is challenging Germany's application of EU
law.

FT  14 APR 94 / Open policy shows Bank's differences with Clarke: Minutes of
top-level meetings reveal wrangle over interest rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'To cut interest rates now . . . would run a risk of higher inflation
and some loss of credibility. (I) strongly advise against '
 - Eddie George at the February meeting
'(I see) little risk of an increase in inflation. A  1/2 per cent
reduction would be justified but (I see) the advantage in a  1/4 per
cent cut '
 - Kenneth Clarke. Rates fell to 5.25% from 5.5%
The chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England have had differences
in recent months over interest rate cuts and their assessments of the pace
of economic recovery, the government confirmed yesterday.
The disclosures came as another layer of secrecy was removed from monetary
policy-making when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, published the minutes
of his monthly meetings with Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor, in
January, February and early March.
Mr Clarke also announced that minutes of later meetings would be released
about six weeks after they have taken place.
The decision marks a further step towards greater openness, initiated after
the debacle of Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in
September 1992.
It brings the UK broadly into line with US practice, where the minutes of
the federal open market committee are released after some delay.
Publication of the next set of UK minutes, covering the meeting of March 30,
has been set for May 18.
Although at the January meeting Mr George recommended a 'bias towards
easing' in monetary policy, the minutes show a consistent pattern of the
chancellor being more willing to consider interest rate cuts than Mr George.
Contrary to some of his public pronouncements, Mr Clarke appears less
confident of the strength of recovery in the run-up to this month's tax
increases while Mr George sees 'upside risks' of higher inflation.
The minutes disclose that the February meeting, when the two finally agreed
to cut base rates to 5.25 per cent from 5.5 per cent, ran over two days and
not one as originally thought.
At that meeting Mr George 'strongly advised against' a rate cut, fearing
that it would run the risk of higher inflation and some loss of credibility.
Mr Clarke 'thought an immediate  1/2 per cent reduction would be justified'
but 'saw advantage in a  1/4 per cent cut'. The chancellor concluded that
rates should be reduced  1/4 per cent after Mr George said he 'could agree
to  1/4 per cent but not to  1/2 per cent'.
Yesterday, Mr George said that publishing the minutes would enable the
public to gain a better appreciation of the nuances behind the decisions and
the nature of any divergences. They showed that differences were 'very
rarely black and white'.
Mr Clarke said he had been attracted to more transparency in monetary policy
for some time. Publishing the minutes after a lag was a sensible move that
would enhance the credibility of the government's commitment to sustained
low inflation.
Publication of the minutes was recently recommended by the cross-party
Commons Treasury and civil service committee.
The chancellor's decision was welcomed yesterday by politicians from all
sides of the house. However, some City commentators argued that the
demonstration of past differences could cause problems in the future.
'While in principle, one applauds the decision, one suspects that at some
stage they are going to rue it,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief economist of
Yamaichi International (Europe).
'The risk with this whole process is, if we do get the situation where the
Bank is pushing for a rate increase and the Treasury is resisting, sterling
is going to be vulnerable because of the market's dislike of political
interference.'
Mr Don Smith of Midland Global Markets said: 'This has the potential to be a
market-moving document in the future. It is encouraging that the choice has
been between a cut in rates and keeping rates steady.'

FT  13 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Long-running suggestions that Lasmo, the second largest of the UK oil
exploration and production stocks, was looking to raise in excess of Pounds
200m via a rights issue continued to circulate in the market but failed to
cause any damage to the Lasmo share price, which held at 129p.
Rumours yesterday were that a rights issue of two-for-seven at 100p a share
was in the wings. Rights offer talk has surrounded Lasmo since the group's
preliminary figures were announced at the end of last month. Oil analysts
said such a move was unlikely and that the oil sector still lacked
confidence despite the relative resilience of crude oil prices since the
last Opec agreement, which rolled over the previous output agreement for the
next two quarters.
The fall in profits at Tesco was broadly in line with expectations, the
shares strengthening following a mildly positive meeting with analysts.
Brokers remain divided, however, on the potential recovery for the sector.
With Tesco suggesting margin pressure easing and like-for-like sales
improving, some analysts believe that similar messages from other food
retailers indicate that the ravaged sector had turned the corner.
Mr Neil Curry at SG Warburg, who yesterday reiterated his buy recommendation
on Tesco, said: 'Today's results prove that the sector is coming back to
life.' He also raised his current year forecast to Pounds 555m, with a jump
to Pounds 602.5m for 1996. Others were not so positive, with Nomura
downgrading its profits estimates to Pounds 528m and Pounds 568m
respectively.
Analyst Mr Paul Smiddy said he believed Tesco shares would be dull in a
lacklustre sector. 'We need more evidence of steady like-for-like sales
growth,' he said. Tesco gained 3 at 218p with 10m traded. J. Sainsbury added
9 at 375p and Argyll a penny at 251p.
The banks with a major presence in the Far East continued to outperform the
other banking issues, with dealers citing the 260-point jump in the Hang
Seng index on Monday and the prospect of further strong rises in the near
term as being behind the big gains. HSBC raced up 25 to 805p and Standard
Chartered advanced 30 to 1104p.
Bank specialists said Standard shares had retreated around 50 per cent from
their peak of 1431p reached in February this year and would match any
immediate advance by the Hang Seng index. Some analysts were predicting that
the Hang Seng would breach the 10,000 level in the short term.
National Westminster continued its recent good performance that was prompted
mainly by a buy note issued by NatWest Securities. Yesterday's rise of 8 to
486p was said to have been triggered by a buy note from Morgan Stanley, the
US investment bank. NatWest's rise came at the expense of Barclays and
Lloyds, the latter losing 6 at 560p and the former 2 at 527p.
There was more keen interest in TSB shares, 5 higher at 225p following what
was said to have been aggressive buying interest from Swiss Bank.
Turnover in British Airways rose to 8.9m and the shares moved ahead 14 1/2
to 443 1/2 p following a recommendation from Smith New Court.
A weaker New York market prompted profit-taking in some of London's
internationally traded issues. Reuters Holdings fell 13 to 1956p in spite of
a well received annual meeting. Reed International lost 3 at 850p. BP eased
a penny to 373p despite a statement by Mr David Simon, the chief executive,
that oil prices should rise in the winter because of higher demand.
Engineering and aerospace company FR Group jumped 25 to 290p, with market
watchers cheered by the positive outlook from the company, which reported
figures in line with market forecasts. Analysts were also pleased by the 5
per cent increase in the dividend.
British Steel closed 3 1/2 ahead at 148 1/2 p after trade of 11m, with
Cazenove said to have recommended the stock. Glynwed International put on 6
1/2 at 364p after recommendations from Williams de Broe and NatWest
Securities.
A buy note from Strauss Turnbull inspired Unilever to a rise of 18 to 1046p.
A director of Hillsdown sold 500,000 ord-inary shares in the company at 179
1/2 p. The stock slipped 2 to 177p.
Among stores, Marks and Spencer added 2 1/2 at 421 1/2 p, with Hoare Govett
raising its dividend forecast and reiterating its positive stance. Laura
Ashley slid on news of the resignation of its chief executive. The shares
later rallied to end 4 off at 81p.
Thorn EMI gained 19 at 1144p, with a recomendation from UBS said to have
helped.
Upton &amp; Southern, the ambitious retailing group, was the third most heavily
traded stock in the market, with 16m shares dealt as the rump of the rights
issue was placed. The shares held at 34p.
David S. Smith, the paper, packaging and office supplies group, climbed 16
to 530p on appreciation of higher pulp prices. Credit Lyonnais Laing, which
has the company as its core holding in the sector, was said to have been
active.

FT  13 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed pressure on Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard hit pharmaceuticals company Glaxo was the principal casualty among
Footsie stocks as US investment bank Salomon Brothers International turned
the screw on the share price and discouraging news continued to overhang the
company.
Salomon's pharmaceuticals analyst Mr Peter Laing has prepared a
comprehensive analysis of the threat to Glaxo's top selling product, Zantac.
'I had thought Glaxo would start to pick up, but I now expect it to drift. I
do not think it is a panic sell but I have moved it, and the sector, to
underperform.' Some dealers, however, suggested that US investors were
merely standing on the sidelines having seen the American Depositary Receipt
holding slide from 27 per cent at its peak to 16.83 per cent as of April 6.
'That company must be wondering when the pain is going to stop. It is on a
1994 yield of 6 per cent and the shares still keep going down,' said a
trader. The shares fell 17 to 581p, a level not seen since last summer, on
heavy turnover of 5.4m.
Persistent bear tales overshadowed the company. There was talk, denied by
Glaxo, that bad news had leaked out of Monday's Novopharm appeal hearing,
and rumour of a price war when SmithKline Beecham's anti-ulcer product comes
off patent in May.

FT  13 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Interest rate optimism dented before
the close - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong first half to yesterday's trading session in the London stock
market ran out of steam well before the close when bond prices turned down
both in Germany and the UK. The FT-SE 100 Index gave back about two-thirds
of its early gain but the broader market remained very firm and trading
volume was the highest for several weeks. Hints that a large rights issue
was in the offing circulated at the close of trading.
Investors focused again on the chances of a cut in interest rates in Germany
when the Bundesbank meets tomorrow. Hopes were raised when the German
central bank confirmed that today's money market repo tender would again be
at a variable rate. Markets quickly reflected hopes that the repo rate would
fall again, opening the way for a reduction in the Bundesbank's key interest
rates.
But optimism cooled later as markets came to the conclusion that the
Bundesbank may lower the Lombard rate but is less likely to cut the more
significant discount rate until after the IMF meeting at the end of the
month, at which global interest rates are expected to be discussed.
Towards midsession, the Footsie was 31.1 ahead at 3,180.7, encouraged by
gains of around half a point at the long end of the gilt-edged market. The
principal hurdle of the day was cleared when the US producer price index for
March showed a gain of 0.2 per cent, in line with analysts' targets on both
sides of the Atlantic.
But London became less settled as German bonds softened and Wall Street
drifted easier to show a decline of 7.14 on the Dow Average in UK trading
hours. The gain on the FT-SE 100 Index was whittled away to give a final
reading of 3,159.1 for a net gain of 9.7.
Market pundits were pleased to see the market close above 3,150 on the
Footsie scale and also noted that the FT-SE Mid 250 Index had remained solid
to finish 28.8 ahead at 3,808.3. However, there was some disappointment at
the return to volatile trading in both equities and gilts.
Trading volume was boosted by a succession of deals in one of the market's
small and usually thinly traded stocks; nevertheless, the day's Seaq total
of 906.2m shares represented a 50 per cent increase from the previous
session. Monday's retail, or genuine customer, business in equities was
worth Pounds 1.35bn.
Higher trading volume in equities this week has featured the London market's
return to full-powered trading after a three-week period overshadowed by the
approach of the Easter weekend and the end of the UK tax year, both tending
to inhibit fund managers from taking up new investment positions.
Once again, the market had to make progress without much support from such
major sectors as pharmaceuticals and banks. Oil shares, which have sustained
an advance for several sessions, were on the sidelines yesterday, although
the exploration issues featured in the rights issue rumours at the close.
The stock market has now bounced back by around 2.4 per cent from the low
point of pre-Easter trading, when investment confidence became badly
unsettled by fears that the US Federal Reserve might be about to tighten
credit policy more harshly than European markets would be able to absorb.
Today brings the latest consumer price and retail sales statistics from the
US and could provide a further test for market sentiment.

FT  13 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes of a reduction in European interest rates boosted stock index futures,
helping the lead contract finish above an important support level, writes
Joel Kibazo.
The Liffe June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 3,173, with
buying activity following on from Monday's strong after-hours' trading.
Continued demand helped the contract advance to the day's high of 3,185 in
late morning.
Profit-taking saw the contract retreat from its peak to trade in a narrow
10-point range for the next few hours before the poor start in New York
brought renewed selling in the last hour.
June finished at 3,170, and cheered dealers who regard 3,164 as an important
support level. The close was at a premium to cash and just above its fair
value premium to cash of between 5 and 9 points. Turnover at the official
close was 9,954 lots. Volume in the Liffe Mid 250 June future was 93 lots as
it closed at 3,805.
There was a significant recovery in turnover in traded options, which saw
business of 47,125 lots. The index options accounted for most of the day's
total, with 17,452 contracts dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 11,168 in the
Euro FT-SE 100 option. Shell Transport was the most active stock option,
with 3,393 lots traded.

FT  13 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Motorola plunges as data fail
to lift Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Heavy selling of technology shares overshadowed good inflation news and
higher bond prices yesterday and the US stock market ended an uninspiring
session easier across the board, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.14 at 3,681.69,
having spent the entire day no more than a few points off Monday's close.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 declined 2.30 to 447.57, while the American Stock
Exchange composite shed 0.97 to 439.69 and the Nasdaq composite fell 8.89 to
739.22. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 258m shares.
The first leg of the eagerly awaited March inflation data produced no
surprises. The Labor Department reported that producer prices rose by 0.2
per cent last month, and that core producer prices, a measure which excludes
the volatile food and energy components, were also up 0.2 per cent.
Both sets of figures were in line with analysts' forecasts, and helped to
reassure investors that inflation is not rising sharply alongside the
rapidly growing economy.
The bond market reacted well, with the benchmark 30-year bond rising
slightly, lowering the yield to under 7.2 per cent.
The positive PPI raised hopes that the consumer prices index, due out today,
will also show no sign of resurgent inflation. The stock market, however,
was unable to hold on to its early gains achieved in the wake of the PPI
report. By mid-morning, the Dow, along with other indices, had slipped into
negative territory, where it remained, under pressure from sharply weaker
technology stocks, for the rest of the day.
The technology sector was hit by selling after Motorola produced
disappointing results late on Monday, and after the Semiconductor Industry
Association yesterday reported a flat reading on March sales.
Motorola plunged Dollars 12 1/8 to Dollars 94 7/8 in volume of 8.7m shares,
continuing a sell-off that had started in after-hours' trading on Monday.
Texas Instruments dropped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 73, Compaq Dollars 3 3/8
to Dollars 100 7/8 , Micron Technology Dollars 5 to Dollars 86 3/8 and
National Semiconductor Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 19 1/4 .
McDonnell Douglas rose Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 111 3/4 in anticipation that
the company would announce that it had won a Dollars 400m contract to launch
satellites for a mobile phone system.
International Paper slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 65 5/8 after the market
was unimpressed with its first-quarter earnings of Dollars 72m, which were
below analysts' forecasts.
On the Nasdaq market, big technology stocks mostly fell.
Canada
Toronto was slightly softer on weak base metal issues and a rocky
performance from real estate shares. The TSE 300 index finished a modest 7.6
off at 4,295.4, but rises and falls were almost evenly matched. Volume was
55.7m shares.
Mexico
Mexican equities reversed early losses to close higher, buoyed by rumours
that the government was about to announce a package of fiscal measures to
help Mexican companies. But a presidential spokeswoman said President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari had no such speech planned.
The IPC index, which on Monday closed at its lowest since last November,
ended 34.68 better at 2,243.16, a gain of 1.57 per cent. The index had
earlier fallen to 2,175.66 on expectations of higher domestic interest rates
and worries that first-quarter results, due to be announced in coming weeks,
would be disappointing.

FT  13 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Property loan worries affect
Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were bruised on the periphery, with Warsaw's stock exchange
authorities offering a hostage to fortune, and stable among the seniors
where only Frankfurt detached from a gentle uptrend, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT saw uninspiring results and worries over Deutsche Bank's exposure,
estimated by outside sources at between DM1bn to DM1.2bn, to the financial
difficulties of a Frankfurt property company. The Dax index ended 14.73
lower at 2,210.60.
Deutsche Bank fell DM17.50 to DM791.50 and, among companies reporting
results yesterday, AEG by DM4.30 to DM178.50 and Deutsche Babcock by DM10.50
to DM269.50. Turnover eased from DM9.6bn to DM9.5bn.
Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt acknowledged that the Deutsche
Bank scare was important in setting the tone of the day, but she added that
the market was due for some profit-taking after four days on the upgrade.
The property loans were mortgage backed, Ms Altmann noted, and unlikely to
affect Deutsche Bank, with a recent equity capitalisation of around DM38bn,
to any great extent. The weak corporate results, she said, were no surprise.
Among the winners, PWA rose DM9, or over 4 per cent to DM229.50, after 10
per cent paper pulp price increases in Sweden this week.
PARIS was little changed overall although there were some interesting
individual stories. The CAC-40 index added 3.27 to 2,148.55, just above the
session low.
Peugeot and Michelin both recorded intra-day highs before losing some of
their gains before the close. The carmaker, which reached a high of FFr913,
closed up FFr10 at FFr905, while the tyre manufacturer, which is due to
announce 1993 results today, added FFr11.70 to FFr273. Analysts are
forecasting that Michelin will announce losses of between FFr3bn to
FFr3.5bn.
UAP, which began pre-placement of shares ahead of privatisation, lost
FFr4.70 to FFr170.30. The government has said that it will announce the
issue price in the next few weeks.
MILAN's telematic electronic trading system ground to a halt, unable to cope
with a flood of orders from would-be small investors, who have taken over
the running from foreign institutions and Italian mutual funds in recent
sessions.
On Monday, the market was swamped with 110,000 orders, almost twice the
number that the telematic is designed to handle. Yesterday's trading was
reduced to two, brief pre-bourse sessions, which resulted in a 24.62 or 3.2
per cent rise in the Comit index to a seven and a half year high of 800.50,
as the system struggled to digest 37,000 orders lodged during the
pre-opening session, almost three times the usual level.
In London, Ferruzzi, traded on Seaq International, rose L280 or 13.9 per
cent to L2,290 following Monday's announcement of its complex rights issue.
Fiat rose L95 to L6,705.
ZURICH was hesitant as it waited for US data, but the SMI index picked up to
finish 3.8 higher at 2,887.8 on producer price inflation figures in line
with expectations.
Nestle rose SFr17 to SFr1,251 as selling pressure by London investors eased,
while Brown Boveri put on SFr26 to SFr1,238.
Rieter registered shares added SFr150 or 10 per cent to SFr1,650 as the
textile machinery company unveiled 1993 results. Schindler, the elevator and
rolling stock manufacturer put on SFr70 to SFr1,715 on its hopes for at
least maintained operating profits in 1993.
AMSTERDAM edged forward with some investors becoming wary of options expiry
on Friday. The AEX index put on 1.23 to 423.94.
Akzo rose Fl 4.50 to Fl 221.30 on foreign interest after Goldman Sachs
included it in its issue of call warrants on a basket of European chemical
stocks.
HELSINKI was led higher by demand for forestry shares after Monday's news of
planned pulp price increases. The Hex index added 29.8 or 1.6 per cent to
1,862.0. OSLO's all share index rose 12.09 or 1.9 per cent to 660.56, as
hopes rose for firmer oil prices.
WARSAW fell sharply as the stock exchange authorities suspended the 10 per
cent limit on price movements for the next three sessions. The WIG index
tumbled 1,257.98 or 10.5 per cent to 10,701.8, bringing accumulated falls
over the previous four weeks to some 40 per cent.

FT  13 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Singapore banks on safe and steady
reputation /- Finding a fundamentally strong market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore's stock market has a dull reputation in comparison with its more
volatile neighbouring bourses, with Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Manila and
Jakarta delivering far more adrenalin per share to adventurous traders.
But when other markets in south-east Asia become nervous, Singapore - safe
and reasonably steady - begins to look more attractive.
Overwhelmed by a record breaking bull run in late 1993 and early 1994,
south-east Asia's stock markets have been jolted back to earth in recent
weeks. In the second half of last year foreign funds, mainly from the US,
flooded into Singapore and other regional markets. A combination of rising
interest rates in the US and falling bond prices have caused a sizeable
chunk of those funds to be withdrawn recently.
Kuala Lumpur, which advanced nearly 100 per cent in 1993, has been helped by
a rebound in the past two days but has still fallen by about 20 per cent so
far this year. Singapore, which rose just under 60 per cent in 1993, has had
a softer landing, declining about 8 per cent since January 1.
This week there were signs of a recovery in Singapore as the market found
favour with foreign investors seeking a safe haven for their funds. Analysts
say a 3 per cent advance by the local Straits Times Industrial index on
Monday, followed by a 2.3 per cent gain yesterday to 2,233.66, was mainly
due to Japanese investors, worried about developments at home in the wake of
the resignation as prime minister of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, moving funds into
Singapore.
'Investors are less adventurous now,' says Mr Paul Schymyck, regional
economist at Smith Barney Shearson, HG Asia in Singapore. 'People are
becoming more realistic, less carried away by market euphoria. They are
looking at the fundamentals - and in Singapore the fundamentals still appear
very sound.'
The buoyant stock market, coupled with strong growth in the overall
financial services sector, helped to propel Singapore's economic growth to
9.9 per cent last year. A repeat performance is unlikely in 1994, although
the government is forecasting a still very respectable 6 to 8 per cent
growth rate.
Other countries in south-east Asia saw foreign investments, viewed as an
important barometer of overall economic confidence, drop sharply last year.
But inward investment into Singapore has continued to increase.
Companies continue to show strong earnings growth, with the four main banks,
among the republic's biggest listed companies, showing pre-tax profits up
between 40 and 50 per cent last year - much of it due to the buoyant stock
market activity. While that performance is unlikely to be repeated in 1994,
banks are now using their considerable resources to expand overseas and
strong earnings will come from increased regional loan business.
Singapore is sitting on a mountain of savings: it has foreign exchange
reserves of well above Dollars 40bn and funds in the central provident fund,
a compulsory savings scheme, are now SDollars 52bn (Dollars 34bn).
There was a local rush for shares in Singapore Telecom, the biggest listed
company, which was partially privatised last year. The ST float, which
valued the company at SDollars 70bn or about 80 per cent of the market
capitalisation of British Telecom, was evidence of how much liquidity there
was in the local market.
The government relaxed Central Provident Fund rules to allow Singaporeans to
use increasing amounts of the funds to buy ST and other shares. Most traders
feel that there is now too much liquidity chasing too few shares. There was
disappointment when the government, in its February budget, announced that
there would be no more big flotations of state companies for two years.
Frustrated investors show an increasing tendency to invest in other markets.
More than 50 per cent of the market's turnover is in Malaysian stocks,
traded over the counter.
Singaporeans are also looking further afield: the Bank of Thailand says that
they formed the biggest group of foreign investors in the Bangkok market in
1993, with the Singapore Investment Corp, the state investment agency,
leading the charge.
'Liquidity is never going to be a problem in Singapore,' says one local
broker. 'The difficult part is finding enough solid companies to invest in -
at a reasonable price.'

FT  13 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Kuala Lumpur leads
region with 5.3% gain

Political uncertainty continued to keep investors on the sidelines, and the
Nikkei 225 average ended 1.3 per cent down on arbitrage-related selling,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index fluctuated narrowly, losing 249.75 at 19,648.33 after a day's high
of 19,884.78 and low of 19,647.63, its eventual decline also reflecting
profit-taking by some overseas investors.
Volume totalled 265m shares, against Monday's 224m. Most domestic investors
remained inactive, watching the political struggle to decide a successor as
prime minister to Mr Morihiro Hosokawa.
Meanwhile, the yen gained ground on speculative selling of the dollar,
breaching the Y103 level for the first time since April 5.
'The situation seems more unstable than most people had expected,' said Mr
Jim Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. However, he added
that the only immediately negative factor affecting the economy was the
instability of the yen, and the squeeze on earnings at export-oriented
manufacturers.
But some analysts were concerned that business confidence might start to
wane if the political instability drags on. 'The situation is disheartening
for the business community at a time when companies are trying hard to get
their act together,' said an official at a consumer electronics company.
The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 13.33 to 1,600.72, while
the Nikkei 300 declined 3.04 to 293.33. Falls outpaced advances by 715 to
300, with 136 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on
1.01 at 1,313.95.
Some investors dabbled in small-lot shares but blue chips were hit by
profit-taking. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, dipped Y9 to
Y341 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y9,000 at Y892,000.
The rise in the yen hurt export-oriented high-technology issues, Hitachi
retreating Y11 to Y958 and Sony Y40 to Y5,920. But small-lot buying by
institutional investors supported some blue chip electricals, NEC rising Y20
to Y1,130 and Fujitsu Y10 to Y1,020.
Arbitrage selling weakened banks, Industrial Bank of Japan receding Y40 to
Y3,190 and Sumitomo Bank Y30 to Y2,220. Brokers were also lower, with Nomura
Securities falling Y50 to Y2,240.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 84.61 to 21,986.52 in volume of 12.6m
shares. Rohm, a leading semiconductor device maker, relinquished Y50 to
Y3,790 on profit-taking.
Roundup
Rebounds were seen in some regional markets as foreign demand revived. Mr
Peter Churchouse of Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong noted that Japanese funds
which had accumulated cash since the start of the year were finding some of
the Asian markets increasingly attractive, following declines of between 20
per cent to almost 30 per cent from their January peaks. Tokyo, conversely,
had risen by 30 per cent during the same period.
Bangkok and Jakarta were closed for public holidays.
KUALA LUMPUR jumped 5.3 per cent as foreign demand for blue chips sent the
composite index back through the 1,000 level. The index, which has fallen by
26 per cent since January 5, added 51.48 at 1,024.82, although brokers said
it was too early to tell whether the rise would be sustainable. Volume
surged to 199m shares from Monday's 86m.
HONG KONG climbed 2.8 per cent as foreign buying revived, the Hang Seng
index ending 261.32 up at 9,738.09. Turnover jumped to HKDollars 5.9bn from
the previous day's HKDollars 3.0bn.
Shares in Jardine group companies continued to rise after recent losses
stemming from the announcement of a delisting in Hong Kong. Jardine
Strategic gained HKDollars 1.70 at HKDollars 30.50 and Jardine Matheson
HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 56.50.
AUSTRALIA moved higher in late trading on strength in the futures market.
The All Ordinaries index was finally 19.1 ahead at 2,095.1 after touching
2,098.5. Turnover came to ADollars 542m.
The newly listed SGIO Insurance was the day's main story, finishing 19 cents
up from its issue price of ADollars 1.00, with some 20m shares changing
hands.
NEW ZEALAND was firmer, the NZSE-40 capital index putting on 28.18 at
2,151.87, helped by strong rises in Telecom, up 14 cents at NZDollars 5.18,
and Fletcher Challenge, 11 cents ahead at NZDollars 3.27.
KARACHI closed higher on new account buying in selected stocks of synthetics
and textiles. The KSE 100-share price index rose 7.73 to 2,470.84.
SEOUL failed to maintain its momentum as profits were taken after six
consecutive sessions of rises. The composite index dipped 13.60, or 1.5 per
cent, to 880.87.
BOMBAY rose on buying by foreign investors but mild profit-taking towards
the end pared gains, leaving the BSE 30-share index 50.38 up at 3,928.93.

FT  13 APR 94 / Markets Report: Sterling moves higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling had a better day on the foreign exchanges yesterday, helped by a
stronger dollar and a weaker D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith.
Continuing the recovery off a low of DM2.48 before Easter, the UK currency
finished nearly two pfennigs higher in London at DM2.5356, from DM2.517 on
Monday.
The dollar strengthened to DM1.7188 from DM1.708. In New York it ended at
DM1.7168. There was little response to the 0.2 per cent rise in the US
producer price index in March.
The weakness of the D-Mark stems from anticipation of a further reduction in
the repo rate this week, and market rumours about a possible cut in the
Lombard rate.
Elsewhere, UK money markets witnessed the unusual spectacle of a Pounds 400m
daily surplus. Normally the Bank of England exerts control over short-term
interest rates by engineering a market shortage. The last surplus was on
March 8 last year.
The sterling index closed at 80.1, from 79.7 on Monday. Analysts said the UK
currency's strength was more a reflection of what was happening with the
dollar/D-Mark than any change in outlook for the pound.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, commented: 'There
is nothing in terms of the UK economic scene that would suggest a reason for
buying sterling.' He said the D-Mark's weakness was overdone and sterling
strength will not continue.
Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, noted that sterling remained
below its 50-day moving average against the D-Mark, showing that it was
still fairly weak. The dollar, by comparison, has been above the 50-day
moving average against the D-Mark for about a week.
Mr MacKinnon said the market was hoping that a good retail price index
number on Friday might open the way for a 25 basis-point cut in interest
rates. This optimism was reflected for a while in the short sterling market,
with the June contract up, at one stage, by four basis points, before
falling back to close only one point ahead at 94.57.
The December future finished at 94.04, off recent lows but still discounting
short-term rates at 6 per cent at the end of the year. Mr MacKinnon said the
market was 'off its collective rocker' suggesting such high rates.
In the money markets, there was widespread surprise at the rarity of a daily
surplus. Analysts were at a loss to attribute it to any specific event, but
said it needed to be seen against the background of the daily shortage
recently averaging below Pounds 1bn.
Mr David Coleman, treasury adviser at CIBC, said the institution of a
twice-monthly repo appeared to have helped lower the daily shortage on an
ongoing basis. A likely seasonal factor affecting liquidity was tax payments
associated with the end of the fiscal year.
With overnight rates consistently soft recently, around 4 per cent,
three-month money has fallen below the 5.25 per cent base rate. Yesterday it
was offered at 5 3/16 per cent.
Mr Philip Shaw, group economist at Union Discount, stressed that the lower
rates were technically driven, rather than the outcome of any reassessment
of the outlook. 'I do not think it has reversed the market's nervousness
about the potential for rates rising this year,' said Mr Shaw.
Mr MacKinnon at Citibank said the message from the US March PPI report was
that there was no pressing need for an immediate tightening of credit
policy. He predicted that the Fed would wait until the meeting of the policy
making Federal Open Market Committee on May 17 before changing policy.
Today the market will be watching the release of the March CPI figure. BZW's
Mr Turner argues that a low inflation figure will help the dollar because it
will bolster the US bond market and have a spillover effect into the
currency. Others argue the contrary: that a high inflation number will be
dollar supportive because it will hasten the prospect of higher interest
rates.
The D-Mark was weaker against most European currencies amid expectations of
a further trimming of the repo rate and talk of a symbolic cut in the
Lombard rate when the Bundesbank council meets tomorrow.
Call money continued to soften and was quoted at 5.75/5.80 per cent from
5.75/5.85 per cent on Monday. The June Euromark future finished slightly
firmer at 94.59 from 94.56.
The German currency closed at FFr3.419 against the French franc from
FFr3.425 on Monday. The rise in the franc followed the release of a very
good inflation figure. French consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent in March
from February, for a year-on-year increase of 1.5 per cent. Mr Turner said
this figure gave the Bank of France room 'to cut interest rates more
aggressively without having a negative impact on the currency'.
The lira fell back on profit-taking from a recent post-election high of L945
against the D-Mark. It finished at L952.7 from L950.3.

FT  13 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: France settles for a draw in
fight over fish imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday got a little further in its efforts to get the EU to set up
a crisis regime for the European fishing industry and clamp down on fish
imports
Last month, Paris bludgeoned the European Commission into a two-month
extension until mid-May of minimum import prices for white fish and Atlantic
salmon by threatening to veto Norway's entry into the Union next year. But
after that signal victory, yesterday's encounter of EU fisheries ministers
was more like a score draw.
Seven member states supported France. But the UK, Germany, Holland and
Denmark  - major importers of fish for their processing industries  - formed
an alliance to block the French demands until they were well diluted.
France said that the 30 per cent fall in white-fish prices earlier this
year, which led to serious riots by Breton fishermen, was without precedent.
It wanted tighter health and veterinary controls on imports, which moreover
should only be landed at designated ports, and to subject incoming fish to
the minimum price regimes set by local fishermen's associations. It has
already been holding up fish imports, especially from Russia, the Ukraine,
Poland and the US, through zealous health inspections.
France was able to claim that it had won its demands when Germany lifted its
objections, leaving the British, Dutch and Danes to be outvoted. But the
price of Bonn's switch is that the new controls will apply only to fresh
fish, thereby excluding the majority of imported fish, which is brought in
for processing.
The new regime starts on May 15 and will be reviewed after two years, during
which regional fishermen's associations will be able to raise prices to a
maximum of 10 per cent over the EU reference price, provided the increase
applies to both EU and imported fish.
Moreover, France had to agree to higher tonnages of special quota fish for
the processing industry, imported under low tariffs of 0 to 6 per cent.
France had complained that 62 per cent of EU imports, and 86 per cent of
French imports, were being brought in under special tariff deals.
But the main battle over the structural crisis in Europe's fisheries has
been postponed to the next ministerial meeting here in June, by when the
Commission is to come up with recommendations.

FT  13 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU hopes for budget windfall
from fruit reform - The European Commission will be looking to save money as
it sets out to cut more controversial agricultural support regimes down to
size
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When producers' groups destroy more than 600,000 tonnes of fruit and
vegetables in a typical year as part of the Common Agricultural Policy,
European consumers are understandably enraged. Finding a more acceptable way
of stabilising these markets is one of the trickiest challenges facing the
European Union this year as itsets out to reform its controversial policy on
fruit and vegetables as well as its support regimes for wine and sugar.
These three sections of the CAP were left out of the 1992 MacSharry reforms,
which began the process of weaning European farmers off state aids. The
three programmes will receive similar treatment to the rest of European
agriculture this year as the Commission tries to trim the budget and
eliminate over-supply.
The fruit and vegetable regime has come in for much criticism for the highly
visible waste incurred  - 430,000 tonnes of peaches were trashed in 1992.
But fruit and vegetables along with sugar and wine are not as expensive to
bankroll as other parts of the CAP such as cereals and beef.
In fact, the three programmes under review make fairly modest demands on the
European taxpayer.
Sugar is the most expensive of the three, costing Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.57bn)
last year, but even this accounts for just 6 per cent of the farm budget,
while cereals support takes up 21 per cent. The sugar regime is also largely
self-financing since producer levies help pay for subsidising exports of
surplus sugar.
The continual strains on the farm budget, however, mean that the Commission
will be looking to save money by reform, or at least stop the costs of the
three programmes from getting any bigger. The cost of the wine regime has
almost doubled since 1990, to Ecu1.53bn, and the fruit and vegetables
support bill has gone up from Ecu1.25bn to Ecu 1.48bn.
In debating possible reforms, the EU's agriculture ministers face the
perennial dilemma about whether price support has encouraged
over-production.
The intervention system for fruit and vegetables, which allows producer
groups to withdraw produce from the market when the price falls to a certain
level and later to destroy most of it, has been widely criticised. Critics
say it distorts market signals and keeps inefficient growers in business,
leading to surpluses. Almost half of Greece's output of peaches, for
example, is regularly withdrawn from the market and dumped.
Farm ministers from all member countries agree that intervention must be
overhauled, but some are pushing for it to be extended to cover additional
products. It is unlikely that the system will be scrapped altogether, even
though this is being advocated by some growers and Britain's National
Farmers' Union.
Demands from southern countries are expected to keep intervention in place
as a safety net, but the Commission is considering ways of reducing its
influence. It could do this by lowering prices as has happened for beef or
even introducing a ceiling for the amount of produce growers can withdraw.
Farm ministers may also consider a 'grubbing up' scheme, which would offer
grants to producers for leaving the business. However, a previous scheme
which ran out last year, did little to eliminate persistent over-production
and the Commission is reluctant to introduce another one.
Wine reform could also focus on 'grubbing up', but it will be up to
individual member countries to run their own schemes. The Commission is
proposing the setting of required production levels for all member countries
and allowing them a transitional period to reach that level.
Member countries will be able to work out their own ways of cutting output,
which is likely to see winemakers channelling their efforts into boosting
quality.
Farm ministers are under less budgetary pressure to reform the sugar
programme as it helps to pay for itself and changes have already been put
off for 5 years. But the demands of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade deal for cuts in subsidised exports will force the EU to initiate
reforms this year.
Analysis of the Gatt requirements indicates that the EU must cut subsidised
exports of sugar by more than 10 per cent  - 340,000 tonnes out of annual
exports of close to 3m tonnes. Ministers can do this either by cutting
production quotas or making price cuts which reduce the amount of subsidy
needed for exports.
Indications are that the Commission will propose a small price cut of 2.5 to
3 per cent as quota cuts would be extremely unpopular.
However, the UK is likely to push for its share of the sugar production
quota to be increased as part of any reform. British Sugar, which processes
beet, has a quota to supply just over half of the UK market.
The UK's quota was cut in 1981 when it was not filling it, while other
countries still have production quotas far exceeding their own needs.
Belgium, for example can produce 180 per cent of its market requirements.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, is expected to push hard for
some quota revisions. But these will inevitably come at the expense of
trade-offs elsewhere. The UK government is pushing hard for reform of these
three areas in the hope of achieving cuts in the agriculture budget and it
will be unwilling to sacrifice success for more sugar.

FT  13 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Great potential seen for plant
power in power plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Governments and international agencies are urged to give more vigorous
financial support to production of electricity from plants in a report
published last night by the UK's Royal Institute of International Affairs.
The study says that plant material, or biomass, 'may be on the threshold of
a new breakthrough, as a fuel for advanced forms of electricity generation'.
According to the US Department of Energy, biomass power will be the most
important renewable energy option for the next 25 years. Projects
cultivating crops for electricity and developing power plants are under way
in Brazil, Scandinavia and parts of the European Union, as well as the US.
The greatest potential will come from 'integrated' development of the fuel,
using dedicated energy crops serving advanced-technology power stations,
says the study.
Financial and organisational support is emerging, 'but the potential of
integrated advanced biomass power appears to warrant much more substantial
promotional effort at the governmental and international level in the near
future in both industrial and developing countries'.
Fast-growing poplar, willow and conifer trees and miscanthus, or elephant
grass, are considered promising for electricity production in northern
Europe, while robinia, cynara and eucalyptus trees and sweet sorghum appear
to have more potential in warmer southern Europe. Sugar cane, along with
pine and eucalyptus, is suitable in the tropics and sub-tropics, although it
needs heavy irrigation which sweet sorghum does not.
Unlike coal, the energy from biomass makes no net contribution to the
greenhouse effect and as such offers an attractive alternative, says the
report, written by Mr Walt Patterson, a senior research fellow at the
Chatham House institute.
In the long run, biomass power will have the greatest impact in tropical and
sub-tropical countries where it grows fastest and where electricity demand
is increasing most rapidly. The World Energy Council has projected a
doubling in world electricity use to 23,000 terawatt-hours in 2020 from
11,600TWh in 1990.
But the study suggests that a more immediate boost to biomass power could
come from growing crops for electricity in industrial countries on land set
aside to cut overproduction.
'This use of cultivated land no longer required for food production would
ease the pressure on the agricultural sectors of major producer countries,
and make international agreement on food trade more readily achievable,' it
argues.
Estimates on the costs of biomass electricity compared with
conventionally-produced power are encouraging, the report says.
Demonstrating that it can be economically and environmentally sustainable in
the industrial world will foster its acceptance worldwide.

FT  13 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Spain and Portugal on fast
track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union fisheries ministers last night overrode Irish objections to
bringing Spain and Portugal fully into the Common Fisheries Policy by
January 1996, six years ahead of the date agreed in 1986 when the Iberian
countries became member states.
Bringing forward the date was the political price Spain extracted last month
for accepting EU entry terms for Norway. The 12 agreed then that Norway's
powerful fishing industry would be integrated into the CFP in 1996 -
assuming it joins the Union next year - and that the fisheries restrictions
on two existing member states could therefore no longer be justified.
Full entry into the CFP will give the large Iberian fleets access to waters
west of the UK and Ireland. Currently, Spain is allowed 150 vessels at any
one time, from a list of 300, in UK waters, but both Spain and Portugal are
kept out of the so-called Irish Box under a regime which runs until the end
of next year.
Last night's framework agreement requires that there be no increase in
fishing effort, which would further deplete shrinking fisheries stocks, as a
result of the increased access. 'The Spanish will not get more fish out of
this text,' one British official insisted.
Eleven member states were willing to leave details of the adjusted CFP to be
ironed out later, probably through a regime making all member states subject
to a licensing system setting vessels' days at sea in western waters.
But Ireland held up agreement by insisting on immediate commitments that a
strict licensing and control regime would replace the current Irish Box
arrangements.
The 11-1 deal agreed that all fisheries management will take full account of
the stocks and 'biological vulnerability' of each fishing area, holding out
to the Irish the possibility of a conservation zone like the UK's Shetland
Box.

FT  13 APR 94 / Government Bonds: US prices post gains after March inflation
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Longer-dated US Treasury prices posted modest gains yesterday after the
first set of March inflation data came in broadly in line with expectations
and the Federal Reserve conducted a 'coupon pass'.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/8 at 88
13/32 , yielding 7.198 per cent. The two-year note was only slightly firmer,
up  1/16 at 99 17/32 , to yield 5.361 per cent.
The eagerly-awaited March producer prices index produced no surprises. The
0.2 per cent increase was what most analysts had been forecasting. Core
producer prices  - which exclude the volatile food and energy components  -
were also up by 0.2 per cent.
Bond prices rose immediately after the figures were released on relief that
they contained no bad news, but the market was unable to sustain its initial
highs. Later in the morning, expectation of a 'coupon pass' by the Federal
Reserve  - when it buys securities in the market to permanently add reserves
to the banking system  - kept prices in positive territory.
Those expectations were met when the Fed aggressively acquired securities at
the intermediate and long end of the maturity range, which subsequently
boosted prices in those sectors of the market.
European government bond markets gave up early gains even though the US PPI
data was in line with expectations. The mood was cautious ahead of the
Bundesbank's council meeting tomorrow and the release of UK inflation data
on Friday, and most dealers were seen to be reluctant to take out large
positions ahead of these events.
UK gilts traded in a one-point range and analysts expect the market to
remain stuck in this range until Friday's numbers. The June contract on the
long gilt future went as high as 108 25/32 but eased to 107 15/16 in the
late afternoon, down  5/32 points on the day. The ceiling for the contract
is widely seen to be 109.
Dealers were also looking ahead to Friday's auction announcement by the Bank
of England. Mr Ifty Islam, fixed-income analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the
market expected the Bank to raise Pounds 2bn to Pounds 2 1/2 bn by
re-opening the 7 3/4 per cent issue due 2006 or the 6 1/4 per cent issue due
2010.
Some analysts said the recent under-performance of Irish gilts in relation
to UK gilts had prompted foreigners to move back into the Irish market. The
yield on 10-year Irish gilts is now 10 basis points below UK gilts, against
30 basis points two weeks ago.
A weaker D-Mark and nerves ahead of the Bundesbank meeting eroded the early
gains made in the German government bond market. The June contract on the
bund future on Liffe eased 0.08 points in the late afternoon to 97.23 after
a high of 97.70.
Dealers were still hopeful that the Bundesbank meeting would yield something
positive for the market, either in the form of a cut in the Lombard rate or
confirmation of its recent policy of nudging repo rates lower.
Persistent worries about the political situation in France kept the pressure
on French government bonds and dealers reported that the yield spread over
bunds widened to 34 basis points but tightened in to 30 basis points in the
late afternoon.
The French notional bond future on the Matif eased 0.18 points to 123.64 in
late trading.
Continued optimism that Italy would soon have a government underpinned
Italian government bonds and brought the yields on 10-year paper to within 8
basis points of their Spanish counterparts.
The market was also supported by comments by the Bank of Italy governor, Mr
Antonio Fazio, that the lower yields at Monday's Treasury bill auctions
signalled a resumption in the downward trend in Italian interest rates.
The June contract of the Italian government bond future on Liffe stood 0.02
points higher at 114.48 in the late afternoon, off the day's high of 115.10.
Spanish government bonds outperformed other European markets but also lost
steam towards the close. The market is looking to today's Bank of Spain repo
tender, which could result in lower rates. Spanish inflation and
unemployment figures are also due this week.
The Spanish bond future went as high as 101.05 before easing to 100.58 in
the late afternoon, for a gain of 0.18 points on the day.

FT  13 APR 94 / International Bonds: EBRD reopens Ecu sector with benchmark
global offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development issued its first global
Ecu bond yesterday, taking advantage of an advantageous funding opportunity
and investor demand for Ecu.
The bank issued Ecu500m of 6 per cent five-year bonds via joint leads Banque
Paribas and Goldman Sachs International.
After a difficult period for the Ecu market, 'we tried to reopen the market
by providing paper with a current coupon and in large size with a global
format,' said Mr Louis de Montpellier, head of funding at the EBRD. He added
that the deal provided an opportunity to launch a large benchmark issue
while achieving good floating-rate costs after the swap.
Although most dealers welcomed the name, timing and maturity of the deal,
they felt its pricing was too tight. At issue, the bonds yielded 6 basis
points below the French government's Ecu BTAN. 'BTAN flat would have
generated more interest - it's been a slow seller,' said a trader.
But the lead managers, who between them took close to Ecu400m of the issue,
reported healthy demand. 'We're seeing investors cautiously returning to the
market,' said one official, adding that large Ecu bond redemptions and
interest-payments have boosted demand for fresh supply.
The Eurodollar market, which has lain dormant for weeks, came back to life
with a Dollars 400m three-year bond issue for American Telephone and
Telegraph.
Uncertainty over the direction of US interest rates has kept issuers and
investors sidelined for weeks, but those worries have calmed in recent days
and some investors are seen to be more willing to test the waters.
'Last week, we saw a fair amount of money going into the short end and we
decided to look for a good-quality name with a short maturity to reopen the
market,' said a syndicate official at lead manager CS First Boston.
According to another trader, AT&amp;T is a popular retail name. 'Although it's
double-A rated, it trades like triple-A paper,' he said. The 6 1/4 per cent
coupon was a further attraction for retail investors.
At their 99.79 fixed re-offer price the bonds yielded 25 basis points above
the US Treasury note. Aided by a firmer Treasuries market, they closed at
99.83 bid while the spread remained steady.
Bayerische Vereinsbank Overseas Finance was the first non-supranational to
tap the Greek drachma market, issuing Dr10bn of 15 1/2 per cent three-year
Eurobonds. Lead manager Bayerische Vereinsbank reported good demand from
institutional and retail investors attracted by the high coupon.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz made its first foray into the Eurolira market,
issuing L200bn of 8 1/4 per cent four-year bonds. Although the sector has
seen steady issuance recently, lead manager IMI Bank reported demand from
investors betting on falling Italian interest rates and currency
appreciation. The bonds ended at 99.85 bid, just inside fees.
Depfa, the German mortgage bank, issued DM1bn of five-year floating-rate
notes paying three-month Libor flat. Others poised to tap the D-Mark market,
including L-Bank, the World Bank and Belgium, remained in the wings,
presumably awaiting tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting.

The Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), Germany's futures and options exchange,
plans to publish a volatility index, which will measure implied volatility
in the Dax (German stock) index options market.
The index 'will make the complexities of price calculation in the derivative
markets even more transparent,' according to the exchange.
The new index will show, for example, that DTB market participants expect a
200-point rise or fall in the index within the next four months. Option
prices are based on market participants' estimation of assumed future
volatility.

FT  13 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Mexico to go ahead with
Telmex issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Mexican government is planning to go ahead with an important
privatisation offering in the international markets, in spite of recent
turbulence in the country's financial markets.
Mr Guillermo Ortiz, deputy finance minister, said that an offering of about
Dollars 500m in convertible bonds covering the government's remaining stake
in Telmex, the national telephone company, could be offered 'soon'.
He said that the turmoil in Mexico's markets that followed the recent rise
in US bond yields and the assassination last month of ruling party
presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio appeared to be coming to an
end.
He added that over the last four days capital outflows have slowed
significantly and central bank foreign exchange reserves are close to the
level at the end of last year, when they stood at more than Dollars 24bn.
Financial analysts believe reserves peaked at just over Dollars 30bn in
February.
The government has, however, decided to postpone a planned Dollars 1.5bn to
Dollars 2bn offering of its remaining equity in Bancomer, the country's
second largest bank, and more than Dollars 500m of bonds backed by revenues
from a state-owned toll road. 'We are not desperate for money,' Mr Ortiz
said.
The Telmex offering is being managed by Merrill Lynch. As a convertible bond
issue, offering regular interest payments if the share price does not rise,
it should be easier to place in a falling market than a straight share
issue. Mexico's stock market has lost nearly a quarter of its value since
the high in early February, although Telmex shares have held up better than
the average.
Mr Ortiz said the government would not seek to revive Mexico's stagnant
economy through an increase in public spending, arguing that the impact of a
loosening of fiscal policy would in any case be felt after August's
elections. The government therefore intends to run, as planned, a balanced
budget this year.
Mr Ortiz added that he believed that interest rates were close to or at
their peak. Short-term interest rates on government paper rose to 14.31 per
cent last week.

France Telecom, the French state-owned telecommunications operator yesterday
announced that it would take an equity stake in General Magic, the US
communications software developer forming an international alliance of
companies to offer products and services for personal messaging and
information retrieval.
The French group is the first European telecommunications company to join
the international technology development partnership. Other members include
Apple Computer, AT&amp;T and Motorola of the US, Sony, Matsushita, NTT, Fujitsu,
and Toshiba of Japan and Philips of the Netherlands. Philips is understood
to have played a significant role in drawing France Telecom into the group.
France Telecom declined to specify the amount it would invest. Like other
partners, however, it is understood to have taken a minority stake and to
have obtained licences to General Magic's software technology.

Alcan result

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alcan Aluminium of Canada posted a loss in its first quarter, in spite of
strengths in fabricated products in North America and Canada.
Weak prices and heavier losses at its Japanese associate were the main
reasons for the loss, but 'if recent increases in metal prices are
sustained, we should see gradual improvement in our results,' said Mr
Jacques Bougie, president.
Alcan's consolidated net loss for the March quarter was USDollars 25m, or 13
cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 20m, or 11 cents, a year earlier.
The 1994 period included an Dollars 11m after-tax restructuring charge,
offset by an Dollars 11m special gain. The 1993 period included Dollars 6m
restructuring charges.
Sales and other revenues rose 3 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn. Sales and
operating expenses rose slightly, while administration, research and
interest costs were lower.
More cost reductions were planned, said Mr Bougie. Several businesses not
meeting strategic priorities have been put up for sale.
Spot ingot prices have risen nearly 20 per cent this year to around 60 cents
a pound, from the late 1993 lows of about 49 cents, following international
agreement on production cutbacks.
Including processing of customer-owned metal, shipments of fabricated
products were up sharply at 442,000 tonnes.
Canadian operations returned to profit, but Brazil continued difficult.
Europe showed signs of recovery with the UK, Germany and Switzerland
profitable. Pacific operations were affected by the Japanese losses.

Dassault Aviation, the French maker of military and business jets, yesterday
announced consolidated net profit down to FFr311.2m (Dollars 53.4m) last
year from FFr329.6m in 1992, on turnover down to FFr13.2bn from FFr16.3bn.
Dassault said the relatively small drop in its profit showed the benefits of
recent restructuring, including job lay-offs, that had been made in
anticipation of a general decline in military and civil orders.
The group, which is 49.9 per cent owned by the Dassault family and 46 per
cent state-owned, with the remainder in public hands, has increased its
dividend to FFr7 from FFr6, in line with its forecast that business will
pick up in the near future.

FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Daimler recovers after cost cuts
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial concern, is on the road to
recovery after a record DM1.8bn (Pounds 720m) net loss last year, according
to its chairman Mr Edzard Reuter.
Reporting an operating deficit of DM3.3bn after restructuring costs of
DM3.5bn, he said the turning point was reached in the last quarter of 1993.
The positive trend established then, with a DM442m operating profit, had
continued.
As the costs of restructuring  - including the loss of a further 18,000 jobs
this year  - had already been provided for, Mr Reuter confidently forecast a
positive operating result for 1994.
A satisfactory trend in overall group profits would be restored in 1995, he
said in the annual report published yesterday. By then, the company planned
to restore the loss-making Deutsche Aerospace and AEG Electrical engineering
subsidiaries at least to break-even. Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz cars will
remain the main source of profits.
Group sales rose 23 per cent to DM13bn in the first two months of this year,
while turnover at the automotive division increased 32 per cent to DM9.5bn
 -some 73 per cent of the total.
Mr Reuter said car production would rise to 570,000 units this year from
480,000 in 1993. Sales were expected to increase to more than 570,000, from
508,000.
In Germany, where the overall market rose 1 per cent in the first quarter,
Mercedes registrations jumped 38 per cent. But the European operations of
the loss-making commercial vehicles business remained quite worrying, he
said.
Figures prepared according to the US accounting standards adopted after
Daimler's listing on the New York Stock Exchange showed Mercedes, which
absorbed DM1.7bn in restructuring costs, made an operating loss of DM1.3bn
last year. AEG and Deutsche Aerospace each lost almost DM1bn, while the
Debis Services arm improved from DM276m to DM366m at the operating level.
According to Mr Reuter, the group's recovery would stem from its new-found
strength after restructuring, not on what he called naive hopes of economic
recovery.
The unexpectedly sharp cut in the 1993 dividend from DM13 to D8, announced
last week, was a temporary setback, he added.

Accor, the French travel group which is fighting the UK's Forte for control
of the Meridien luxury hotel chain, yesterday announced a 23 per cent fall
in net profits, to FFr615m (Dollars 105.1m) last year from FFr802m in 1992.
The group has lodged a bid with Meridien's owner, Air France, in the hope of
merging the business with its Sofitel luxury hotels.
Accor was badly affected last year by intense competition in the European
travel business, particularly in the French market.
Accor, which had previously issued a profits warning for 1993, also had to
service the remainder of the debt amassed in its 1991 takeover of
Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel company.
In spite of the fall in net profits, the board proposed holding the dividend
at FFr18 in 1993, the same as in 1992.

FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Semiconductor shares in the US
fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US semiconductor shares fell sharply on Wall Street as investors reacted to
a lack of growth in a leading indicator of sales trends in the industry and
disappointing first-quarter results from Motorola.
Motorola's share price dropped after the group reported first-quarter
results below analysts' expectations, despite a 46 per cent increase in net
profits.
After dropping by Dollars 6 3/4 , to Dollars 99 1/4 in after-hours trading
on Monday, Motorola declined further yesterday to trade at Dollars 95 3/8
late in the session after hitting a three-month low of Dollars 93 7/8.
Shares of other semiconductor manufacturers also dipped sharply, with Texas
Instruments down Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 74 1/8 , Intel down Dollars 3 3/16
to Dollars 66, Advanced Micro Devices down Dollars 2 to Dollars 25 5/8 and
Micron Technology down Dollars 5 1/8 to Dollars 86 1/4 in late trading.
The sell-off was triggered by disappointment in the monthly industry
orders-sales ratio figure, which was issued after the market closed on
Monday.
For March, the ratio of the value of orders taken versus the value of goods
sold was 1.13. This was flat with a revised figure for February and
represents a high point since last May. However, industry analysts had
anticipated an increase in the book to bill ratio to about 1.16 or above,
following an upward trend from the preliminary February figure of 1.15.
Mr Doug Andrey, statistical analyst at the Semiconductor Industry
Association, which publishes the data, noted that semiconductor orders
continue to grow faster than shipments.
Investors, however, saw the latest book to bill ratio as a negative
indicator for US semiconductor manufacturers. Similarly, the market focused
on slow growth in Motorola's orders for pagers and related communications
equipment, despite the company's overall strong results.
First-quarter net income rose to Dollars 298m , or Dollars 1.03 per share,
from Dollars 204m, or 72 cents per share in the same period last year. Sales
rose by 29 per cent to Dollars 4.69bn from Dollars 3.63bn.

Mining

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian steel and natural resources group,
has agreed to sell certain mining and exploration interests in the Kimberley
region of Western Australia to Western Metals. The assets for sale include a
58 per cent interest in the Cadjebut mine.
Western Metals is a privately-owned company, in which Ausgold holds a 13 per
cent stake. Ausgold, which asked for its shares to be suspended yesterday,
said it had made an offer to acquire the remaining 87 per cent of Western
Metals. It said it planned to raise ADollars 30m (USDollars 21.7m), via an
underwritten public share offering, to fund the Cadjebut deal and the
development of other assets included in the BHP transaction.
The interests involved include BHP's stake in the Cadjebut zinc/lead mine,
which was developed in 1987 and has about another 18 months of life. Total
production at Cadjebut last year was 102,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and
29,000 tonnes of lead concentrate.
Also included in the package are undeveloped ore bodies at Blendevale,
Twelve Mile Bore and Kapok, and interests in a number of joint ventures in
the region. Ausgold said it hoped 'to bring on stream the development of the
next ore body, Twelve Mile Bore, before the existing reserves at Cadjebut
are depleted'.
BHP, which did not disclose the sale price, said the assets involved in the
transaction no longer 'fitted our profile'.
BHP's partner in the Cadjebut mine, with the remaining 42 per cent interest,
is Shell Australia. The interest forms part of Shell's Australian metals
portfolio, which it has talked of floating.

Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank, the two main creditor banks of

debt-laden papermaker to help it in its five-year restructuring plan,
agencies report from Tokyo.
Daishowa Paper, which is Japan's third-largest papermaker, announced last
month that it was aiming to reduce its debts to Y270bn (Dollars 2.6bn) by
March 1999, from about Y434bn now.
The company, which was established in 1938 by the Saito family, said it has
been hit hard after aggressive expansion in the 1980s and the subsequent
economic slump.
Last month, a delay in plans to sell assets forced Daishowa to downgrade its

Bank of New York, the north-eastern banking group reportedly currently
contemplating a merger with its regional rival Fleet Financial, yesterday
unveiled first quarter profits of Dollars 178m, up from Dollars 134m a year
earlier.
The results translated into fully-diluted earnings per share of a record
Dollars 1.75, up from Dollars 1.30 a share in the same quarter of 1993.
The bank reported that net interest income increased four per cent to
Dollars 396m in the quarter, thanks to wider interest rate spreads, and
increasing loan demand.
Bank of New York also said that its credit card business was strong during
the quarter, as was fee income business, particularly from securities
processing, syndications and factoring. Income from foreign exchange and
other trading, however, fell during the period.
The results cheered investors on Wall Street, who bid up Bank of New York's
shares Dollars 2 to Dollars 55 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Japan's Marubeni Corp and two main creditor banks of Daishowa Paper have
sent a group of experts to the debt-laden papermaker to help it in its
five-year restructuring plan, agencies report from Tokyo.
The banks are Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank. Marubeni owns 5.1 per
cent of Daishowa.
Daishowa, Japan's third-largest papermaker announced last month it aimed to
cut debts to Y270bn (Dollars 2.6bn) by March 1999, from some Y434bn now.
Daishowa Paper, established in 1938 by the Saito family, has been hit hard
after aggressive expansion in the 1980s and the subsequent economic slump.
The Saito family now owns an estimated 30 per cent of the company, and one
family member has said it plans to reduce this to 15 per cent.
'It is inevitable for Daishowa to sell shares owned by the Saito family to
other shareholders to reduce the influence of the family on its management,'
said Mr Morinobu Kobayashi, analyst at Yamaichi Institute of Research.
The company was dealt a heavy blow last November when Mr Ryoei Saito, then
honorary chairman and former president, was arrested on suspicion of bribery
related to land development projects.
In February, Daishowa chose Mr Shogo Nakano as president, making him the
first person outside the family to head the company.
Last month, a delay in plans to sell assets forced Daishowa to downgrade its
business forecast for 1993-94. It now sees a net loss of Y28.2bn against
earlier forecasts of a Y3bn net loss. In 1992-93, it posted a net profit of
Y305m.

FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Exceptional costs mask better
sales at Engen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Engen, the South African energy company, reported a decline in net profits
to R228m (Dollars 63.2m) in the six months to February, from R257m for the
corresponding period last year.
The fall was almost entirely due to the R17m exceptional cost to cover
retrenchments, and to a one-off inventory loss of R37m for the decline in
the oil price. The interim dividend was maintained at 55 cents.
The added costs masked a slight improvement in operating income, to R282m
compared with R257m last year. The retrenchments, which will reduce the
company's total workforce by around 500, will be absorbed in full over the
current financial year. The costs are likely to come to R60m.
Turnover rose to R4.03bn from R3.56bn, while borrowings were up to R512m
from R218m. This reflected increased capital expenditure on the company's
R800m Phase II upgrade project, which will give Engen the capability to
process cheaper crudes while lifting output 22 per cent.
Mr Rob Angel, chief executive, said gearing would continue to rise, from its
current 16 per cent to around 26 per cent next year, because of the
expansion.
The bulk of turnover came from domestic sales of petrol to the South African
market. These rose from 14.7m barrels to 15.2m barrels. The biggest area of
growth was in exports, which soared 133 per cent, from 1.8m barrels last
year to 4.2m barrels, and covered sales to more than 20 countries, most of
them in Africa.
Mr Angel said he hoped to see continued growth in the African market, and
noted that Engen was well-placed to raise its presence on the continent.

George Weston Foods, the Australian biscuit and dairy products group, has
held its interim dividend at 9.5 cents a share after a marginal rise in
earnings during the six months to January.
The company, which is controlled by Associated British Foods, lifted
earnings to ADollars 25.8m (USDollars 18.7m) from ADollars 25.7m on a 4.8
per cent rise in revenues, to ADollars 526m from ADollars 502.5m.
Directors indicated results had been held back by costs associated with a
contamination scare during the half in one of the company's pie products.
They said price discounting and soft demand in other food areas, especially
bread, also subdued trading.
Tax provision took ADollars 11.6m, against ADollars 16.1m previously, and
depreciation ADollars 17.5m, compared with ADollars 16.5m. Interest expense
was negligible, at ADollars 181,000 against ADollars 275,000.

<TEXT>
Broken Hill Proprietary, the large Australian steel and natural resources
group, has agreed to sell certain mining and exploration interests in the
Kimberley region of Western Australia to Western Metals. The assets for sale
include a 58 per cent interest in the Cadjebut mine.
Western Metals is a privately-owned company, in which Ausgold holds a 13 per
cent stake. Ausgold, which asked for its shares to be suspended yesterday,
said it had made an offer to acquire the remaining 87 per cent of Western
Metals. It said it planned to raise ADollars 30m (USDollars 21.7m), via an
underwritten public share offering, to fund the Cadjebut deal and the
development of other assets included in the BHP transaction.
The interests involved include BHP's stake in the Cadjebut zinc/lead mine,
which was developed in 1987 and has about another 18 months of life. Total
production at Cadjebut last year was 102,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate and
29,000 tonnes of lead concentrate.
Also included in the package are undeveloped ore bodies at Blendevale,
Twelve Mile Bore and Kapok, and interests in a number of joint ventures in
the region. Ausgold said it hoped 'to bring on stream the development of the
next ore body, 12 Mile Bore, before the existing reserves at Cadjebut are
depleted'.
BHP, which did not disclose the sale price, said the assets involved in the
transaction no longer 'fitted our profile'.
BHP's partner in the Cadjebut mine, with the remaining 42 per cent interest,
is Shell Australia. The interest forms part of Shell's Australian metals
portfolio, which the oil company has talked of floating on the stock market.
CRA, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced it had agreed a
'farm-in' deal with Carpenter Pacific Resources (CPR), under which the
latter can earn a 49 per cent interest in CRA's Hidden Valley gold project
near Wau, in Papua New Guinea, for K35m (USDollars 36.9m).

<TEXT>
Union Carbide and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing are to contribute towards
the proposed Dollars 4bn global settlement of breast implant litigation
agreed by other US companies in March.
The settlement between makers of silicone implants and plaintiffs claiming
illnesses resulting from implant leaks should provide funds to settle
litigation worldwide over the next 30 years. It also provides a partial
ceiling on individual companies' liabilities.
The main corporate participants in the settlement, which is still subject to
fairness hearings and legal challenges, are Dow Corning (a joint venture
between Dow Chemical and Corning), Bristol-Myers Squibb and Baxter
International.
Union Carbide, the chemicals group, did not manufacture the implants but it
supplied generic bulk silicone materials to the implant industry. It said
its contribution to the settlement would be Dollars 138m over the next few
years.
The company said it had previously taken pre-tax charges totalling Dollars
35m for litigation, and the settlement would not require any charges in its
first or second quarters. After probable insurance recoveries, the effect on
future earnings should be negligible, it said.
3M, the diversified maker of medical products and adhesives, did make the
implants but had previously held out against joining the industry-wide
settlement. Subject to its directors' approval, it has now agreed to join
with a contribution of Dollars 325m.
The company said that, after this and other charges relating to breast
implant litigation and after probable insurance recoveries, it expected to
report a pre-tax charge of Dollars 35m in the first quarter, or Dollars 22m
after tax.

price of equivalent products from Sun Microsystems and International
Business Machines.
'Digital is breaking several performance and cost barriers,' said Mr William
Strecker, vice-president of engineering. 'We are bridging the worlds of
large-system features and small-system advantages to put the power to manage
complex tasks within the reach of enterprise departments and small

The Digital 2100 server is the first in a family of Alpha Risc-based
departmental servers. Prices start at Dollars 18,900 for a single processor
unit.

FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Bonds volatility hits Bear
Stearns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bear Stearns, the Wall Street securities house, has revealed trading losses
in recent weeks because of extreme volatility in financial markets.
The announcement of the losses, described as 'moderate', did not surprise
industry analysts. Heavy declines in bond prices over the past few weeks
were expected to have hit earnings of Wall Street firms which own and trade
large portfolios of government securities.
Mr James Cayne, Bear Stearns' chief executive, said: 'This is not the first
time we have suffered losses, and it will not be the last.' Big trading
houses are always vulnerable to losses if securities prices change rapidly.
However, those losses can just as quickly be recouped if market conditions
turn back in their favour.
The recent unpredictability of global financial markets, however, coupled
with the rise in US interest rates and declines in domestic stock and bond
prices since February, should mark a turning point in Wall Street's earnings
cycle. After three years of steadily escalating profitability, income growth
is expected to slow in 1994.
Bear Stearns' third-quarter earnings, also released this week, indicated
that the peak in the securities industry's cycle has probably passed. The
firm reported third-quarter profits of Dollars 115.5m, slightly higher than
a year earlier but well down on the previous quarter, when profits reached a
record Dollars 134.8m.
Separately, Bear Stearns announced that Mr Wayne Angell, who recently
stepped down after eight years as a member of the Federal Reserve Board,
will be joining the firm as chief economist and senior managing director.
The hiring of Mr Angell is a coup. His experience and knowledge of the Fed
will prove beneficial to Bear Stearns, which is one of the most active
traders in the US market for fixed-income securities.
During his high-profile tenure at the Fed, Mr Angell developed a reputation
as an inflation 'hawk', who believed the central bank's overriding priority
as the guardian of US monetary policy was to defeat inflation.

Creditor banks of Italy's troubled industrial group, Ferruzzi Finanziaria
(Ferfin), could control 68.9 per cent of the food-to-chemicals company if
they fully take up a complex L1,339bn (Dollars 825m) rights issue, Reuter
reports from Rome.
Ferfin said the stake could end up being owned by the some 50 banks that
make up the consortium guaranteeing the complex four-tranche issue. The
banks now own some 48.7 per cent of Ferfin.
Serafino Ferruzzi, the family holding company that sits above Ferfin and
once controlled what was Italy's second-largest private business, will see
its stake fall to 12 per cent from 19.8 per cent. It has waived its rights
to the new shares.
The capital increase, approved by shareholders last November, involves four
separate operations calling for the issue of a total of 580m shares at
prices ranging from L1,000 to L4,000.
Proceeds will be used to cut Ferfin debts by L706.2bn and those of its
Gruppo Alca (Trading) unit by L633bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A strong boost from its highly successful coverage of the Winter Olympics
helped CBS, the US broadcasting group, report a 28 per cent increase in net
income to Dollars 69.3m from Dollars 54.2m in its first quarter.
The market had anticipated the results and the shares edged down Dollars 4
1/4 to Dollars 289 1/4 as investors took profits.
During the Olympics, the CBS Television Network had two weeks of the highest
ratings it has yet recorded.
Largely as a result of this event, net sales for the group surged by 42 per
cent to Dollars 1.25bn from the comparable quarter's Dollars 878.7m. CBS
said that if the effect of the Olympics was excluded, sales would have been
about 6 per cent ahead.
Earnings per share rose by 21 per cent to Dollars 4.23 from Dollars 3.50
last time.
The CBS Television Stations division was the biggest beneficiary of the
Olympics coverage, with sales and profits ahead very strongly. In addition,
CBS said, the improving economy had brought a substantial strengthening in
demand for local advertising.
Local and spot radio sales also benefited from more robust business
conditions, and CBS Radio reported better operating results led by improved
sales and earnings at the AM group of stations.
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive, said the group's operating
results continued to show steady improvement, reflecting the combined effect
of a strong programming schedule, strengthened demand for advertising and
active cost control.

<TEXT>
Increased advertising revenues helped Gannett, the US media group that
publishes the newspaper USA Today, produce a 19 per cent increase in net
income to Dollars 78.7m in the first quarter.
The company's interests include 83 newspapers, nine television stations and
11 radio stations. It is also the largest outdoor advertising company in the
US.
Turnover was 4 per cent higher than in the same quarter last year at Dollars
876.6m, as economic growth fuelled stronger advertising demand in most parts
of the group.
An increase in costs of just 1 per cent helped lift earnings per share to 54
cents from 46 cents last time. The dividend was increased to 33 cents a
share from 32 cents.
Gannett said an 11 per cent increase in revenues from classified advertising
contributed significantly to newspaper revenue gains, with recruitment
advertising rising each month.
Newspaper advertising revenues increased by 6 per cent overall, helping
produce a 9 per cent gain in newspaper profits to Dollars 142.7m.
At USA Today, which saw its first profitable year in 1993, advertising
revenues were unchanged from the comparable quarter's record level, but paid
advertising pages fell to 931 from 970.
Broadcasting profits, buoyed by Winter Olympics advertising on Gannett's two
CBS-affiliated television stations, jumped to Dollars 21.2m from Dollars 9m.
Earnings were also lifted by the recent sale of four radio stations and the
company's television station in Boston.
Outdoor advertising revenues fell 2 per cent and losses worsened to Dollars
4.7m from Dollars 4.1m.

International Paper, the diversified US paper, packaging, and wood products
company, reported first-quarter earnings of Dollars 72m, or 58 cents a
share, up from Dollars 64m, or 52 cents, in the same period last year. Sales
were unchanged from the first quarter of 1993, at Dollars 3.4bn.
Most of the earnings improvement came from the company's forest products
division, where firm prices helped boost sales to Dollars 425m, from Dollars
400m a year ago.
However, the strength in the forestry area was offset by sales declines in
International Paper's biggest division, printing papers. Printing paper
sales fell to Dollars 955m in the quarter, from Dollars 1bn last year.
The company's packaging revenues were flat, while income from distribution
and specialty products improved. Mr John Georges, chairman, said that while
packaging volume improved, a decline in bleached board pricing more than
overshadowed the beneficial effects of higher containerboard prices.
'Printing papers volume and pricing were disappointing, although losses were
less than a year ago,' Mr Georges said. 'European and export markets began
to show signs of recovery, aided by higher pulp prices.' However, he said
the severe winter weather in much of the US had hit many of International
Paper's domestic businesses.

Quebecor, North American-based international publishing, printing and forest
products group, is buying Arcata, the second biggest book producer in the
US, for USDollars 200m.
The move fits Quebecor's recent acquisition of two US companies specialising
in CD-Rom technology.
Quebecor Printing, majority controlled by Quebecor and the Peladeau family,
a year ago bought Arcata's commercial printing plants for almost Dollars
100m and took an option on its six book-production plants with expiry in
1996.
Mr Charles Cavell, president of Quebecor Printing, said the company had
exercised this option early as Arcata's book business was doing 'extremely
well' and would offset the commercial printing cycle.
Quebecor Printing gets six plants in Tennessee, Pennsylvania and West
Virginia which employ 3,500 and had 1993 sales of Dollars 317m.
They will bring Quebecor Printing's annual revenue to more than Dollars 2bn.
The company is the largest US commercial printer after R. R. Donnelly. It
also operates in Mexico and France and recently entered a joint venture in
India.

Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) took its corporate refocusing programme a
step further yesterday when it announced the sale of Diners Club Nordic, a
credit and charge card operation, to Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank, Sweden's
leading commercial bank.
SAS said the transaction would produce a capital gain of between SKr100m
(Dollars 12.84m) and SKr200m and reduce its balance sheet by SKr2.2bn. Exact
terms were not disclosed.
Diners Club Nordic has 395,000 cardholders in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and
Finland. The operation, bought by SAS in 1986, recorded pre-tax profits of
SKr49m last year, up from SKr30m a year earlier. Operating revenue climbed
18 per cent to SKr517m. The unit's book value at the year-end was around
SKr160m.
SAS wants to concentrate on core air transport operations after four years
of losses and a failed pan-European merger with three other airlines.
The strategy has led to the sale of its stake in LanChile, the Chilean
airline, and an aircraft sale and leaseback deal. Further moves are planned,
including the disposal of SAS Leisure Group, Scandinavia's leading tour
operator, and SAS Service Partner.
SE-Banken said it wanted to strengthen its position in the credit and card
charge market.

Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment supplier, has
won its largest contract in Latin America with an agreement to install a
USDollars 350m digital phone network in Colombia.
The contract takes the form of a revenue-sharing agreement with Empresa
Nacional de Telecommunicacions, Colombia's state telephone utility, and
Vestcor Partners, a Miami-based investment bank, which put together the
financing structure.
Under the agreement, Northern Telecom will be paid for its equipment from
revenues generated from the network over the next nine years.
The contract includes 205,000 digital phone lines in 10 regions of Colombia,
as well as transmission equipment and microwave systems. Northern Telecom
will operate the system.
Northern Telecom said the company also expected to win contracts for
cellular phone equipment in Colombia within the next few weeks.
Last month, a consortium comprising Northern Telecom's sister company, Bell
Canada International, as well as Northern Telecom and the Bogota city phone
company, was granted a cellular phone franchise in the eastern region of
Colombia, including Bogota.
Northern Telecom will provide switching and cellular equipment for the
Dollars 400m project.
Several European suppliers have recently won contracts to install telephone
equipment in other parts of Colombia in line with a recent liberalisation of
the procurement process.

market

<TEXT>
Motorola's share price tumbled after the electronics and semiconductor group
reported first-quarter results that failed to live up to Wall Street
expectations despite a 46 per cent increase in net profits.
Its share price dropped by Dollars 6.75 to Dollars 99.25 in after-hours
trading on Monday and yesterday the stock was trading at Dollars 94.50 in
mid-session.
First-quarter net income rose to Dollars 298m, or Dollars 1.03 a share,
compared with Dollars 204m, or 72 cents, in the same period last year. Sales
rose 29 per cent to Dollars 4.69bn from Dollars 3.63bn.
However, the pace of growth in net income represented a slowdown from last
year's increase of more than 100 per cent. Analysts said they had hoped to
see the company outperform their projections of around Dollars 1.04 a share
with higher earnings growth in the semiconductor and communications
equipment markets.
A leading supplier of cellular telephones and transmission equipment,
Motorola said sales in that sector rose 57 per cent to Dollars 1.67bn, while
orders were up 62 per cent.
During the quarter the company resolved a dispute in Japan over market
access, reaching an agreement with Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp (IDO) to begin
expanding the service area for the Motorola cellular telephone system in the
Tokyo and Nagoya areas.
The communication products sector, which includes pagers and the two-way
radios used by taxi fleet vehicles, had sales growth of 20 per cent, to
Dollars 1.24bn, but orders grew just 1 per cent.
The company said the lower than expected order growth was partly due to
excess inventories among distributors in China. Sales of pagers to the
Chinese market exploded last year, apparently in advance of user demand.
Sales of semiconductor products, another large segment, grew 26 per cent to
Dollars 1.61bn, with orders up 15 per cent.
The government and systems technology group, which includes Motorola's share
of the Iridium satellite communications venture, reported revenues of
Dollars 138m, up 10 per cent.
Overall, Motorola said net margin on sales was 6.4 per cent, up from 5.6 per
cent in the first quarter of last year.

FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Fannie Mae posts 25th record
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday reported a
15 per cent increase in first-quarter profits to Dollars 510.5m.
It was the 25th consecutive quarter of record profits for the company, which
provides financing for US mortgage lenders.
Fannie Mae said it was able to post another record quarter in spite of
rising interest rates - which typically dampen demand for mortgages -
because of a strategy that is designed to minimise the effect of interest
rate movements on the company's earnings. Essentially, the strategy involves
balancing Fannie Mae's assets and liabilities so that there is very little
interest rate exposure.
The impact of rising interest rates was clearly seen in Fannie Mae's net
interest margin (the difference between the interest the company earns on
mortgage loans and the interest it pays to borrow money), which narrowed
from 143 basis points a year ago to 126 basis points.
Although its interest margin declined, Fannie Mae's net interest income
still rose 10 per cent to Dollars 664.4m, as its mortgage portfolio
increased to Dollars 197bn. A year earlier, the portfolio was worth Dollars
159bn.
The company's strong first quarter was also helped by a sharp drop in
extraordinary after-tax losses from the early retirement of debt to Dollars
8.3m, and by a 17 per cent increase in mortgage-backed securities guaranty
fees to Dollars 269.7m and a 57 per cent jump to Dollars 35.5m in fees
earned from the sale of Remics (real estate mortgage investment conduits).
Fannie Mae's acquisition of foreclosed single-family properties rose 14 per
cent to 3,122, while write-offs climbed from Dollars 30.5m to Dollars 53m,
primarily because of those related to the January earthquake in southern
California.

Weyerhaeuser results
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Weyerhaeuser, the US forest products company, yesterday reported
first-quarter earnings of Dollars 127m, or 62 cents a share, slightly down
from earnings before special charges of Dollars 133m, or 65 cents, in the
first quarter of 1993.
But operating earnings rose to Dollars 295m, or Dollars 1.44 a share, from
Dollars 276m, or Dollars 1.36, in the same quarter last year.
Sales were flat during the period at Dollars 2.4bn, compared with Dollars
2.3bn.
Operating results were slightly better than Wall Street expected, and
prompted some analysts to lift full-year earnings projections for the
company above Dollars 3 per share.
Most of the operating improvement came from the timberlands and wood
products division, which earned Dollars 283m in the quarter, against Dollars
226m a year ago. Weyerhaeuser benefited from rising prices for wood products
in the wake of environmental restrictions that have limited logging on
public lands in the US.
Mr Mark Rogers, analyst with Prudential Securities, said 'Weyerhaeuser is
unique because it has so much of its own timber.'
The sharp rise in timber and wood products earnings masked continuing
weakness in the pulp and paper segment. The division's earnings fell to
Dollars 5m in the first quarter, from Dollars 35m a year ago.
However, Weyerhaeuser said recent price improvements in market pulp and
containerboard packaging helped the division reverse a loss from the 1993
fourth quarter.
Property and financial services operations earned Dollars 7m in the first
quarter, down from Dollars 15m in the 1993 period.
Mr John Creighton, president, said: 'Our ability to achieve these results,
in spite of significant weather interruptions and the Los Angeles
earthquake, reflects improving operating efficiencies we have realised with
the implementation of our business improvement plans.'

Babcock

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Babcock, the German engineering and plant construction group,
suffered a loss in the first half of its 1993-94 fiscal year which began
last October 1, AP-DJ reports from Oberhausen.
It gave no figures but said results were better than the previous year.
Mr Heyo Schmiedeknecht, chairman, made clear yesterday the company wanted to
resume payment of its common dividend, last paid for fiscal 1988, after
having resumed payment of a DM3 preferred dividend for fiscal 1993 after a
two-year hiatus.
But even more important, he said, was to continue the company's programme of
streamlining, 'cost what it will, without regard to earnings cosmetics'.
Babcock has said it intended to pay a dividend only if the group's pre-tax
profit reached DM120m (Dollars 70.1m).
'There is better than a 50 per cent chance' of a dividend being paid, Mr
Schmiedeknecht said. 'Off-hand, I would say there is a 60 per cent chance.'
Babcock's projection for group pre-tax profit in the current fiscal year is
DM80m to DM120m, after pre-tax earnings of DM62m in fiscal 1993.
Although Babcock's pre-tax and net profit figures fell steeply in fiscal
1993, the drop was largely attributable to extraordinary factors.
All of the group's divisions were now operating in the black, Mr
Schmiedeknecht said.

deal next week

<TEXT>
The Euro Disney banks expect by the end of next week to have finalised their
FFr13bn (Dollars 2.2bn) rescue package to salvage the troubled leisure
group.
All but four of the 61 international banks in the Euro Disney loan
syndicates have agreed to the first stage of the restructuring process - an
18-month interest holiday.
The banks that have agreed represent 96 per cent of Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn
net debt.
A senior banker involved with the negotiations said it was hoped that the
remaining four banks, which include three Japanese institutions and Canada's
Bank of Nova Scotia, would accept within the next few days.
'It's already a done deal,' the banker said. 'But we still hope to achieve a
unanimous agreement.'
The next stage of the process involves endorsing the entire FFr13bn
restructuring, including a FFr6bn rights issue and a number of asset
transactions, and organising underwriting for the rights issue.
A number of banks are understood to have already in principle accepted the
restructuring and to have volunteered to participate in the rights issue.
Walt Disney, the US entertainment company that owns 49 per cent of Euro
Disney, is committed to taking up its full entitlement, leaving the banks to
underwrite the remaining FFr3.06bn worth of shares.
Caisse des Depots, the state-controlled French financial institution that is
Euro Disney's biggest lender, has promised to underwrite FFr790m of the
issue. Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, joint heads of the
banks' steering committee, have pledged FFr300m and FFr200m respectively.
'We've already received assurances for underwriting FFr1.29bn, or 42 per
cent of the issue,' said the banker, 'and we're confident that we'll be able
to cover the rest.'

stand-by credit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Olivetti, the Italian computer group headed by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, has
negotiated a stand-by credit of Dollars 280m with eight Italian and
international banks, the company announced yesterday.
Since last Thursday, Italian and French companies in which Mr De Benedetti's
family has an interest have announced a string of share and convertible bond
issues.
The five-year stand-by credit brings to more than Dollars 1.1bn the amount
of potential funding which will be available to companies in the De
Benedetti stable, assuming shareholders approve the plans for share and bond
issues.
Olivetti said yesterday that the credit, arranged for the group's
Luxembourg-registered subsidiary Olivetti International, would allow the
company to spread its medium to long-term debt over a longer period,
strengthening the overall financial structure.
The group claimed that this was one of the biggest credit lines arranged by
a private Italian company in more than a year.
The Italian group may need access to extra funds to pay for its one-third
share of the L3,000bn (Dollars 1.8bn) investment in a new mobile telephone
network in Italy.
Olivetti heads the Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium which won the licence
for the GSM network last month. The computer company last week announced
plans to underpin this investment with a convertible bond issue, which could
raise between L500bn and L600bn.
The five-year stand-by credit line was arranged by JP Morgan Securities.
Eight other banks will participate with Dollars 35m each.
Olivetti will pay interest of Libor plus 0.625 per cent for the first two
years, and Libor plus 0.75 per cent for the final three.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest French insurance group
which is poised for privatisation, hopes to increase net profits by around
30 per cent in each of the next three years, according to Mr Jacques
Friedmann, chairman.
Mr Friedmann said yesterday UAP intended to at least equal its 1993
performance - when net profits rose by 32 per cent to FFr1.42bn (Dollars
243m) from FFr1.08bn in 1992 - in the mid-1990s. However, he made his
forecast just before Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, announced
it was downgrading UAP's rating to A1 from A1 plus.
S&amp;P, which has also downgraded the ratings of Axa and Assurances Generales
de France, said it was concerned about the deterioration in operating
profits at the large French insurers, and about uncertain recovery
prospects.
The French insurers have for the past two years been under pressure due to
competitive market conditions and heavy provisions on property interests.
UAP has also been burdened by the problems of the loss-making Banque Worms.
Mr Friedmann said he planned to inject an additional FFr1bn into the bank,
and hoped it would return to profit in 1996.
In spite of these difficulties, the government is pressing ahead with the
sale of its 50 per cent stake in UAP, valued at more than FFr25bn.

<TEXT>
Vard, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, is to dispose of its ferry
business for NKr1.1bn (Dollars 149m) in a move which will help reduce the
debt of the holding company, estimated at Dollars 185m.
The group also expects to win shareholders' backing at an extraordinary
general meeting today to replace the board with members nominated by the
existing board.
Mr Einar Kloster, chairman of the management committee of Philips
Electronics' lighting division and a member of Philips' group management
committee, is expected to be confirmed as new chairman, replacing Mr Terje
Mikalsen who will retain a board seat.
The group has been seeking ways to reduce its debt following an expensive
debt restructuring package for its Kloster Cruise unit secured last May. A
group of institutional investors took up Dollars 300m of senior, secured
notes with a 13 per cent coupon.
Vard yesterday reached agreement in principle with Skagerak, a Norwegian
company formed by a syndicate of primarily Norwegian institutional investors
to acquire the Larvik Line and Scandi Line.
The syndicate has agreed to supply Skagerak with NKr475m in equity and will
seek to raise an additional NKr725m to consummate the deal.
About 20 per cent of the shares in Skagerak will be made available in a
public offering in June, giving existing Vard shareholders preference rights
of purchase. Skagerak will also seek a listing on the Oslo bourse.
The deal will bring to Skagerak three ferries, terminals and the rights to
operate the routes between Larvik in Norway and Frederikshavn in Denmark,
and between Sandefjord in Norway and Stroemstad in Sweden, as well as other
assets and rights related to the operations.
It is contingent on Skagerak securing financing, a due diligence process
lasting until May 2, and the agreement with management in the ferry
operation of acceptable terms and conditions of appointment.
Vard had earlier failed to agree terms to sell the ferry unit to a group of
investors led by Mr Trygve Hegnar, a member of the board who is also behind
the call for today's EGM.

<TEXT>
Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned Dutch telecommunications and
postal group which is preparing for a bourse flotation later this year,
yesterday announced a sharp rise in its 1993 dividend, bringing its payout
level into line with other publicly-quoted telecoms operators.
KPN said its dividend to the Dutch state is to be lifted to 50 per cent of
1993 net profit, a significant increase from the rate of around 40 per cent
which it has paid to the government throughout recent years.
The company, whose partial flotation will probably take place in late May or
early June, had been widely expected to raise its payout rate after
privatisation, increasing its attraction as a yield-orientated utility stock
to investors.
KPN also reported yesterday that its 1993 net profit rose by 7.9 per cent to
Fl 1.8bn (Dollars 945m) from Fl 1.66bn in 1992, meeting the company's
forecast that results would at least match the average 5 per cent rate of
profit growth seen in recent years. Its dividend in cash will be raised to
Fl 898m, or 50 per cent of net profit, from Fl 666m the year before.
Mr Cees Griffioen, finance director, said the sharp increase in the dividend
reflected the fact that KPN had now succeeded in boosting group equity to 50
per cent of total liabilities, compared with around 30 per cent in the late
1980s. But he said the 50 per cent payout rate should be seen as 'a new
basis which we are seeking for the future'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For anyone who dreamed that a private television licence in the wealthy
German market would be a licence to print money, the demise of Vox
television should provide a salutary awakening.
The Cologne-based infotainment station, launched with great fanfare just 14
months ago as the thinking German viewer's TV ('Television for university
graduates,' according to one close observer), went into liquidation on April
1. It is limping off the air over the coming weeks with only the faintest
hope of rescue.
For the mighty Bertelsmann group, Germany's largest multimedia empire and
second only to Time Warner on the world stage, the failure of Vox is a blow
to its pride, rather than its bank balance. The group had a stake of 24.9
per cent, alongside comparable shareholders including the Suddeutscher
Verlag, publisher of Munich's leading newspaper, and WestLB, the bank. .
Mr Mark Wossner, Bertelsmann's chief executive, who estimates probable total
losses for the six shareholders at around DM400m (Dollars 234m), describes
them as leaving no more than 'a relatively small skidmark' in the group's
annual DM1.5bn profits. It is the fact of having made a mistake, in a
company with a reputation for careful and conservative planning, which
hurts.
One question is whether the demise of Vox will herald a further shake-out in
Germany's overcrowded television market. Another is whether it calls into
question the long-term future of private television in a market tightly
regulated by the close interest of the German political establishment in all
16 federal states.
Most observers believe the answer to the first question may well be yes, but
to the second, no.
Bertelsmann is certainly adamant that its own heavy investment in the
sector, through its Ufa television and film subsidiary, remains well
justified. It is the largest shareholder, with 38.9 per cent, in RTL, the
single most successful private television station, which last year overtook
both ARD and ZDF, the two public broadcasters, to become Germany's most
popular channel.
It also has 37.5 per cent of Premiere, Germany's first pay-TV channel, and
7.8 per cent of RTL-2, the most successful new generation downmarket private
station.
Mr Manfred Lahnstein, president of Bertelsmann's electronic media division,
admits that 'after 10 years of private television in Germany, there is only
one station which has earned back its initial investment: that is RTL.
Everybody else is losing money.'
He says that any new private station must expect to lose money for at least
six years, because of high start-up costs. But investors have still piled
into the nine private broadcasters (including Vox) because of the perceived
long-term potential. 'These last 10 years have changed the world
completely,' Mr Lahnstein says. 'The public broadcasters will continue to
lose market share. In five years they will be much less important.
'Advertising through television is a very attractive proposal for the
advertising industry, and the proportion in Germany is still quite low. The
advertisers need opportunities to advertise.' He estimates that by the end
of the decade, gross advertising revenues could reach DM13bn, compared with
DM7.5bn to DM8bn today. The trouble is that the plethora of new stations has
led to drastic rate cutting and squeezed everybody's margins.
The other major investor in German private television, Mr Leo Kirch's group,
is exploiting another asset, its library of old Hollywood films. Even if the
TV stations in which it has a stake may not be making money, the film
leasing business is highly profitable.
If the big investors are well aware of the inevitability of losing money for
a lengthy start-up phase, the question remains why Vox has been forced to
close.
Most analysts believe the reasons for failure lie in flawed original
concept, disagreement among the shareholders, and the tight regulations
preventing any one group from controlling too many stations.
'They misjudged the market,' says Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram,
international media analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. 'There is not
enough advertising in Germany to support ill-defined entertainment
channels.'
An insider is more blunt. 'They dreamed up the idea in 1990, at the height
of the euphoria over German unification, the excitement of the Gulf war and
the break-up of the Soviet Union. There was an extraordinary desire for
news. They assumed it would always be like that.'
Instead of 6 per cent of the television audience Bertelsmann said it needed
to break even, it could only manage 0.7 per cent after three months, and
barely 2 per cent after a big shift away from news to entertainment last
summer.
It was the decision of the Suddeutscher Verlag to pull out which marked the
beginning of the end. 'They simply got cold feet about the extent of the
losses,' the insider said.
Mr Wossner and Mr Lahnstein searched desperately for another shareholder,
without success. Bertelsmann itself is prevented by the television licensing
regulations from increasing its stake above 24.9 per cent, because of its
RTL and other shareholdings.
'We may not, cannot and will not take over Vox up to 100 per cent,' Mr
Lahnstein said. He admitted that for the time being, advertisement-financed
television in Germany may have reached its limits.
But Bertelsmann has recently launched two strategic projects: a joint
venture with Deutsche Telekom and Leo Kirch called Media Service, to act as
distributor for the expected new generation of pay-TV channels; and a
co-operation deal with Canal Plus to market pay-TV Europe-wide. That is
clearly where the group believes the future of private television lies.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Year of change at Hemingway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hemingway Properties under-went significant change in 1993. Although the
pre-tax loss was only cut from Pounds 855,000 to Pounds 837,000, net assets
per share improved from 26.1p to 31.1p.
Having started the year with 90 per cent of its portfolio represented by
London offices, it ended with 40 per cent industrial and 29 per cent retail
and a wider geographical spread.
The group made two purchases totalling Pounds 65.2m, funded by issues of
shares, loan stock and debentures, and sold an interest in a London property
for Pounds 21.8m. It also sold two of its acquired properties to show a
surplus of Pounds 490,000.
Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman, said that rental income in the present
year 'should comfortably exceed interest payable and administrative
expenses'.
Gross rental income was Pounds 4.82m (Pounds 4.19m). Losses per share were
1.07p (1.57p).

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Bostrom to Pounds
2.03m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profits at Bostrom more than doubled last year as the vehicle components and
specialist engineering group enjoyed contributions from recent acquisitions
and first-time gains by its seating joint venture.
The Northampton-based company saw pre-tax profits jump from Pounds 919,000
to Pounds 2.03m following a 46 per cent increase in turnover from Pounds
34.3m to Pounds 50m, including Pounds 7.94m from acquisitions, in the year
to December 31.
The improvement was underpinned by full year contributions from three
recently-acquired subsidiaries - domin-ated by AJW Holdings - which lifted
operating profits in the pressings division to Pounds 721,000 (Pounds
196,000).
Their contribution offset a flat performance in the vehicle seating division
and continued, though reduced, losses in specialist engineering.
Mr Colin Howell, managing director, said the unchanged Pounds 1.89m profit
in the seating business would have increased had it not been for Pounds
200,000 of legal costs in the US, where it ceased distributor operations,
and increased research and development spending.
Losses in the engineering division were reduced from Pounds 525,000 to
Pounds 182,000 as it benefited from restructuring and reorganisation in
1992.
Predicting a better performance this year from all three divisions, Mr
Howell cited the turnround at Bertrand Faure Automotive, the car seat joint
venture, where rising demand from Jaguar transformed a Pounds 99,000 loss
into a Pounds 296,000 profit, as evidence of the group's healthy prospects.
The earnings rise - from 9p to 11.4p - was held back by a Pounds 245,000 tax
charge (Pounds 334,000 credit), although the 1993 rate was just 12 per cent
helped by using tax losses.
The proposed final dividend is held at 2.5p for an unchanged total of 6p.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: UK new issue activity rises 35%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New issue activity in the UK jumped by 35 per cent in the first quarter of
1994, with a total of Pounds 6.35bn raised by companies, according to
figures compiled by IFR Securities Data.
Initial public offerings accounted for 39 per cent of the amount raised,
with 39 floats raising Pounds 2.46bn. The IPO figures include the Pounds
413m flotation of House of Fraser, the department store group, and the
Pounds 463m public offer of shares in Beazer Homes, the UK's fourth largest
housebuilder, floated by Hanson.
'If present trends continue, 1994 will surely surpass 1993. With continued
low levels of inflation and interest rates, institutions will be looking for
the higher yields which new issues often return,' said Mr John Walter of
IFR.
Rights issues raised Pounds 2.26bn, or 36 per cent of the total volume in
the first quarter, with large issues announced by Allied-Lyons, the food and
drinks group, and by GKN, the engineering and industrial services group.
'Rights issues, which dominated the landscape in 1993, have become less
popular,' Mr Walter pointed out.
SG Warburg remained at the top of the underwriting league table with volume
of more than Pounds 1.2bn.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Dolphin Packaging leaps 63%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dolphin Packaging, which supplies its products mainly to the food industry,
consolidated its advance at the interim stage with a strong second half, and
reported a 63 per cent improvement for the 1993 year.
On turnover up by Pounds 610,000 to Pounds 26.3m, pre-tax profits rose by
almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.46m.
Mr Moger Woolley, chairman, said the advance had been achieved despite
continued price pressures and product changes in all the group's markets,
and while turnover had risen by only 2.5 per cent, volume and tonnage had
increased by some 10 per cent.
The group continued to generate cash, Mr Woolley said, with the net figure
rising by Pounds 378,000 to Pounds 2.38m at the year end.
A same-again final dividend of 2.8p is proposed to maintain the total at
4.5p.
The dividend is covered 1.7 times by earnings per share up by 48 per cent to
7.72p (5.22p).

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: FR share boost on dividend rise - Profits
fall 11% to Pounds 21m but prospects described as 'encouraging'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in FR Group rose 25p to 290p yesterday after the manufacturer of
in-flight refuelling equipment surprised the market with a 7.6 per cent
div-idend increase despite falling profits.
Mr Gordon Page, chief executive, said that encouraging prospects and a
number of firm orders had persuaded the company to increase its final
dividend to 5.1p (4.74p) - making 7.56p (7.2p) for the year ended December
31 - even though pre-tax profits fell by 11 per cent, from Pounds 23.6m to
Pounds 21m.
He blamed the downturn on problems at three subsidiaries affected by
shrinking sales and production difficulties.
Of the subsidiaries, Flight Refuelling, the largest company in the group,
was hit by procurement delays which forced the company to embark on a
wide-ranging restructuring, involving a 30 per cent cut in the workforce to
820.
In the Netherlands, the company closed part of its Markhorst business as
demand dried up for ammunition containers.
In the US, the entire senior management of Stanley Aviation, the engine
equipment supplier, was replaced following prolonged technical problems on
orders for McDonnell Douglas.
Together, these subsidiaries contributed to falling turnover on continuing
operations, although new acquisitions lifted total sales to Pounds 185.4m
(Pounds 182.8m).
Earnings per share fell from a restated 21.74p to 18.23p, and losses
overseas led to an increase in the overall tax charge to 35 per cent.
Nevertheless, Mr Page said an increased dividend was justified by recent
orders and improved efficiency following the restructuring of subsidiary
operations.
Those prospects were enhanced yesterday by the announcement of three
contracts involving a Dollars 12m (Pounds 8.2m) order from McDonnell Douglas
for refuelling equipment; a Pounds 4m component deal with Westland
Helicopters; and a Pounds 12m order from Saab for aircraft environmental
control systems.
COMMENT
Few suppliers of aerospace or defence equipment are crowing about prospects,
but FR at least has grounds to be optimistic. It has weathered one of the
industry's worst recessions and has now begun to pick up contracts - albeit
deferred ones - to shore up this year's profits. With orders worth Pounds
300m under its belt, it can now turn its attention to the disposal of
Markhorst and complete the renegotiations of Stanley Aviation's complex
contract with the US Air Force. It has also brought three new aerospace
subsidiaries under its wing which should help profits increase this year to
about Pounds 24.5m. On a forward multiple of 12.3, the shares appear
attractive, although constraints on civil and military spending could yet
delay take-off.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Float to value Brewin Dolphin at Pounds 40m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brewin Dolphin, one of the UK's oldest and largest private client
stockbroking groups, is to be floated on the London Stock Exchange this
summer. The company will be valued at up to Pounds 40m.
This follows the Pounds 7m purchase of Bell Lawrie White, Scotland's largest
broker, from TSB in April 1993, a move which almost doubled its client base.
The proceeds from the flotation will be used to pay off its Pounds 4.5m of
long-term bank debt and Pounds 1.1m of preference shares.
Mr John Hall, managing director, said there was no evidence of specialist
private client brokerages being squeezed out from between the larger
institutionally-orientated houses and the execution-only operators.
Brewin Dolphin has seen a steady increase of new clients and funds, and it
remained profitable throughout the volatile market conditions of the
late-1980s.
The company, which employs 420 people, made record pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.5m last year  - before a Pounds 300,000 exceptional loss related to the
cancellation of Taurus, the Stock Exchange's failed electronic settlement
system.
With a full-year contribution from Bell Lawrie, and the pay-down of its
debt, 1994 would be expected to show a marked improvement.
Brewin Dolphin maintains portfolios for 32,000 private clients and trustees,
and controls Pounds 4.5bn of funds, of which Pounds 900m are held on a
discretionary basis. It also owns Stocktrade, which offers an execution-only
broking service to TSB branches and a number of Scottish banks.
It is 85 per cent owned by its directors and employees, who launched a
management buy-out from its parent, Scandinavian Bank, in April 1992.
Baronsmead and 3i Group are also shareholders. It is believed the buy-out
valued the group at about Pounds 4m, which suggests substantial rewards for
the backers.
Mr Hall said that the vast majority of employee shareholders would retain
their stakes in the company. The outside institutional shareholders have
also indicated that they would not sell out, he said.
There have been few other flotations of private client brokerages, but Greig
Middleton, one of Brewin Dolphin's main competitors, was purchased recently
by King &amp; Shaxson, the discount house.
Greig Middleton, which has Pounds 2bn of funds under management, achieved
pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.9m in the year to July 1993, and was purchased
for Pounds 18.5m.
The Brewin Dolphin flotation is being sponsored by Charterhouse Bank.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Allied Radio in Pounds 1.55m rights and
restructure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Radio, broadcaster to Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire, yesterday gave
details of the Pounds 1.55m rights issue and capital restructure
foreshadowed last week.
It also reported results for the year to end-September showing turnover of
Pounds 3.75m (Pounds 4.55m), including continuing operations static at
Pounds 3m, while losses at the pre-tax level were Pounds 1.9m (Pounds
1.72m). Losses per share were 4.1p (3.4p).
The rights issue is of 33.3m new 0.5p shares at 6p on the basis of 3.61 new
shares for every 10 existing 25p ordinary held and 2.872 new shares for
every Pounds 1 nominal of outstanding loan stock.
It is planned to exchange each Pounds 1 of outstanding loan stock for 10 new
ordinaries with the cancellation of interest on the loan stock from October
1 1993.
The existing 25p ordinary shares are to be converted into one new 0.5p
ordinary and 49 deferred of 0.5p. The deferred will be cancelled and the
balance, together with the share premium account, will be used to write off
the deficit on the p and l account, and the existing goodwill  - Pounds 7.2m
and Pounds 8.5m respectively at end-September.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Dewhirst 48% ahead to Pounds 9.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dewhirst shares jumped 9p to 114p yesterday as the Marks and Spencer
clothing supplier announced better-than-expected annual profits and rewarded
shareholders with a 45 per cent increase in the dividend.
Mr Tim Dewhirst, chairman, praised the achievements made over the year to
January 14, which saw a 48 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
9.6m on sales 18 per cent higher at Pounds 214.1m. 'If anyone had submitted
a budget with these numbers to me I would have thought they were naive,' he
said.
The final dividend, which had been cut substantially in 1991, is being
raised from 0.68p to 1.05p for a total of 1.45p (1p).
Margins improved from 3.9 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Mr Dewhirst was
confident that the operating margin would increase again this year.
Almost three years ago, Dewhirst set out on a programme of reorganisation
aimed at bringing margins to 7 per cent within five years. The company was
well on target, Mr Dewhirst said.
Sales to M&amp;S, which takes about 85 per cent of Dewhirst's turnover,
increased by more than 25 per cent during the year. Sales of ladies wear
rose by 42 per cent, men's wear by 21 per cent and children's clothes by 12
per cent.
The children's wear business had incurred losses last year, but was expected
to breakeven in 1994 after a wide-ranging restructuring.
Mr Dewhirst said the company remained committed to being focused on
supplying M&amp;S. It would seek to grow organically by extending the range of
products within M&amp;S stores.
Total clothing profits rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 7.95m pre-taxon sales
ahead from Pounds 157.2m to Pounds 188.1m.
The toiletries division more than doubled profits from Pounds 702,000 to
Pounds 1.71m on sales up 6 per cent to Pounds 26m. Margins were helped by a
more selective approach to customers.
COMMENT
Dewhirst appears to be reaping the benefits of a new management. While many
praised the work on margins it would have been suicide for Dewhirst to have
done otherwise. The real achievement has been in increasing volumes.
Dewhirst has gobbled up market share through improving its product range and
efficiency. The main restructuring is now out of the way and 7 per cent
margins may well be achieved before the self-imposed deadline. Forecasts are
for Pounds 13.2m pre-tax, putting the shares on a still-attractive p/e of
16.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: DRS coming to market with expected Pounds
40m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRS, the scanning equipment manufacturer, is coming to market through a
placing with institutional investors.
The placing is likely to value the Milton Keynes-based group, which has
grown quickly in the last three years, at about Pounds 40m and raise between
Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m of new money.
Mr Malcolm Brighton, managing director who founded DRS 25 years ago, said
the proceeds would be used mainly to further expand overseas sales and fund
new product developments.
'We want to do in other countries and other sectors what we have done in the
UK,' he said.
The company supplies the fast-growing market for scanners which can capture
hand-written data, such as ticks on multiple-choice forms, for processing by
computers.
DRS began as a computer bureau in-putting computer data on behalf of
customers. More recently the group developed specialist optical mark reading
and optical character reading equipment.
The group now manufactures OMR and OCR hardware and develops software to
link these devices to personal computers and main frames. It also designs
and prints forms for customers collecting large amounts of data, such as
education authorities and the British Market Research Bureau, and operates a
bureau service for analysing the results.
Sales and profits have grown rapidly since the group began its own
manufacturing operations at the end of the 1980s. Last year pre-tax profits
increased from Pounds 1.69m to Pounds 2.96m on turnover ahead by 48 per cent
to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 7.81m) fuelled by expanding sales to education and
health establishments in particular. The group has no debt.
DRS exports to about 15 countries, but would like to expand into other
markets, including the US. It is also considering expansion into other image
processing markets.
The markets for its services and equipment have been growing rapidly as
organisations in both the private and public sectors increase the amount of
data and information they collect but are struggling to cut time and costs
from the data processing chain.
About 30 per cent of the enlarged capital is expected to be placed with
institutional investors. The executive directors, who currently hold about
72 per cent of the shares, will still hold a majority stake after flotation.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Redrow forecasts record outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Redrow, the latest of several housebuilders to pursue a stock market
flotation, yesterday forecast it would make record pre-tax profits of Pounds
21m for the year ended June 30.
This would represent a 52 per cent rise on the Pounds 13.8m achieved in the
previous 12 months.
The figures exclude profits and losses on sale of discontinued businesses,
which would reduce the forecast figure for the current year to Pounds 18.9m.
The forecast, included in a pathfinder prospectus published yesterday,
assumes a notional tax charge of only 9 per cent. This follows the
acquisition last year of Costain's former housebuilding operations in
south-east England which included substantial tax losses.
After all deductions the continuing businesses should be left with profits
of Pounds 19.1m, directors stated.
The company, which claims to be the UK's biggest private housebuilder, is
expected to be valued at about Pounds 350m under the flotation plans, which
include a placing and offer for sale of up to 35 per cent of new shares to
be issued.
About Pounds 50m of new shares are likely to be issued while Mr Steve
Morgan, Redrow's founder, is expected to raise a further Pounds 100m by
selling part of his 98 per cent stake.
The directors said they expected about 2,000 homes to have been built by the
end of June. The average price of a Redrow home during the first six months
of the year was Pounds 86,000 at an operating margin of 12.8 per cent.
Redrow owns 6,700 housing plots at an average cost of Pounds 11,400, or 13.3
per cent of the average sale price. Net debt of Pounds 25m compares with
shareholders' funds of Pounds 68m.
Publication of the final prospectus and pricing details is due on April 28.
Applications should be made by noon on May 9 with dealings due to commence
on May 17.
BZW is sponsoring the issue. Brokers are Cazenove.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Link with Suter brings Danbury back to life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Danbury, the property group which went into receivership just three years
after its USM placing in 1989, is to become the property management arm of
Suter following an injection of properties from the industrial conglomerate.
The announcement comes less than a week after Suter announced a recommended
offer for James Wilkes, the Sheffield-based engineering group.
Danbury - to be renamed Wedderburn Securities - will be 26 per cent-owned by
Suter and plans to manage the conglomerate's vacant and under-utilised
properties.
Mr Jon Pither, deputy chairman of Suter, said his company had up to Pounds
10m in vacant land and properties, which could be sold to Danbury at a later
stage. He added that Suter would be a long-term investor and that he was to
become non-executive chairman.
Danbury's share quote was cancelled last September after its banks had
decided not to forward any more loans to keep it afloat, amid sinking
property prices.
Under a Company Voluntary Arrangement, it is to be freed from all previous
debt obligations by paying Pounds 158,000 to creditors, which were owed a
total of Pounds 10.3m.
It is to place out 5.09m shares and launch an open offer for the same number
at 15p a share. Danbury is paying Pounds 1.5m for Suter's sheltered housing
interests, and a further Pounds 320,000 for an option on a 32 acre site at
Braintree, Essex. It would cost a further Pounds 2.56m to take up the
option. Suter will receive Pounds 700,000 in cash and 7.27m shares.
Mr Stephen Sibley, Danbury's managing director, has acted as consultant for
Suter's planned development of a superstore on a 10 acre site adjoining the
Braintree land.
Danbury will have net assets of only Pounds 2.3m following the transaction.
Trading in the shares is expected to resume on May 9 under Stock Exchange
Rule 535 (2).

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Ferrum expands as losses fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ferrum Holdings, the lossmaking engineering group, yesterday said it was
acquiring Chalcon Group, a Midlands plating business, as part of a
wide-ranging restructuring and expansion plan.
The company is funding the all-paper transaction by issuing 7.55m shares
worth Pounds 3.4m, and has invited Mr Mike Akers, chairman of Chalcon, to
take over as chief executive of the enlarged group.
It is also raising Pounds 5m via a rights issue involving 11.1m new shares
at 45p each, which after consolidation would be offered to shareholders on a
1-for-5 basis.
Mr Garry Frier, Ferrum's current chief executive, has agreed to stand down
and is expected to receive Pounds 150,000 compensation. He leaves behind him
a company which cut its 1993 losses from Pounds 3.64m to Pounds 2.8m on
reduced turnover of Pounds 36.1m (Pounds 38.5m).
Losses per share came out at 8.22p (12.24p).
Mr Simon Miller, chairman, said: 'The future of the enlarged group will be
increasingly directed towards quality engineering businesses in niche
markets.'

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;W to cut staff in Pounds 20m cost saving
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless, the international telecommunications group, is hoping to
save Pounds 20m a year by cutting the size of its London headquarters.
The headcount in corporate departments will be reduced from 130 to 80 and
there will be unspecified cuts among the 300 London-based staff who manage
the group's overseas operations.
The move reflects the decision by Mr James Ross, chief executive, to change
the group from a traditional centralised structure to an 'international
alliance' of companies.
In a letter to London-based employees Mr Ross said: 'The regional businesses
and offices will be refocused to move the group closer to the customer, to
deploy their skills across company and national boundaries and to develop
new business opportunities.'
The work of central service departments will be moved into the businesses or
outsourced.
The cuts in the London-based regional staff have not yet been finalised but
employees will be informed by the end of the month.
A large part of the projected savings will be generated by reducing the
number of London offices the group occupies, though it will be retaining its
refurbished headquarters in Theobald's Road.
The company declined to say which central services would be affected but
cuts are likely to involve departments such as personnel, pensions, and
accounting.
It is thought that posts will be cut up to, but not including, C&amp;W's top
dozen managers.
The letter to employees says that a 'substantial' number of those staff
affected will be offered other posts within the group but stresses that
plans are at too early a stage to allow estimates of redundancies to be
made.
C&amp;W has 12,000 staff in the UK, out of a worldwide workforce of 40,000, of
which 10,000 are employed by Mercury Communications.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Yule Catto shares ahead despite earnings
setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yule Catto, the chemicals and building products group, saw its shares jump
24p to 299p yesterday despite recording its first fall in earnings per share
since 1980.
Pre-tax profits for 1993 fell from Pounds 22.2m to Pounds 18.2m but the
underlying performance was better than analysts had expected and the company
made optimistic comments about the current year.
Lord Catto, chairman, said prospects for the building product companies,
mainly in continental Europe, were encouraging though it was too early to
determine whether a sustained recovery was under way.
Referring to the group as a whole he said: 'The current year has started
well with operating results ahead of our internal targets and the
corresponding period of 1993.'
Last year's figures were marred by the closure of the Dutch building facades
company, acquired for Pounds 3m in 1987. Excluding the Pounds 2.28m
provision for costs of closure and a Pounds 1.42m goodwill write-off,
operating profits were little changed at Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 24.3m).
The 1993 operating figure included Pounds 1.84m from speciality chemicals
acquisitions, which, after financing costs and minorities, made a small
contribution to earnings.
Earnings per share fell from 16p to 11.6p, partly reflecting the effects of
the rights issue. A proposed final dividend of 3.65p makes a total for the
year of 6.25p (5.9p).
The speciality chemicals business, a leading supplier of natural and
synthetic rubber, turned in record profits of Pounds 21.1m, up Pounds 2.3m,
thanks to the acquisitions and 'good performances across the board'.
The building products companies, which are linked mainly to commercial
construction and maintenance in continental Europe, saw profits fall by
Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 5m; but that was after charging higher redundancy
costs which analysts estimated at Pounds 1m.
COMMENT
These figures may have spoilt Yule Catto's record but behind the Dutch
facade the figures were still better than expected with some encouraging
pointers for the current year. The chemicals companies are continuing to
perform well and with rationalisation of the building products side now
largely behind it profits should recover this year. Boosted by the rights
issue cash profits could reach Pounds 30m, which puts the shares on a
forward multiple of about 16, an undeserved discount to the sector.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Ross Group, the consumer products and technical services company, is
acquiring an initial 25 per cent stake in Accom Industrial, a wire,
telephone accessory cable and power supply manufacturer based in Guangdong,
southern China.
Ross also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.64m for 1993 after a
restructuring charge of Pounds 3.5m, compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds
4.44m the previous year. Turnover rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 60.9m.
Losses of 1.13p per share compared with earnings per share of 2.45p in 1992.
A reduced final dividend of 0.2p makes a total of 0.4p (0.45p).
Accom has 300 employees and net assets of about HKDollars 30m (Pounds 2.6m)
and is expected to make after-tax profits at least HKDollars 12.5m this year
and next. It is 68 per cent owned by Tomei, one of Hong Kong's leading
consumer electronics manufactures.
Tomei sold two small Hong Kong companies to Ross last autumn for Pounds 4m.
It will hold some 14 per cent of Ross following the deal.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Scottish TV rises 21% to Pounds 13m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Television hopes to avoid the takeover wars in ITV. It has no
intention of trying to acquire Grampian Television, its Scottish neighbour,
and will in turn resist being taken over itself.
The declaration of independence came yesterday from Mr Bill Brown, its
chairman, and Mr Gus Macdonald, managing director, as they announced a 21
per cent increase to Pounds 13m in pre-tax profits in the year to
end-December 1993.
There has long been speculation that Scottish might move against
Aberdeen-based Grampian, but Mr Macdonald said yesterday it made no sense
'to risk a civil war in Scotland' simply to add Grampian's 1 per cent of ITV
advertising revenue to Scottish Television's 5 per cent.
The two executives suggested, however, that they might be interested in
talking to a potential minority investor who could open doors
internationally for Scottish or give the company a stake in cable or
satellite television.
'We would look very closely at a proposition of that kind, but we are not
out looking for that kind of liaison,' said Mr Brown, who added that the
company's main ambition was to increase its programme making.
The increase in profits, which Mr Brown called 'a sparkling performance',
came from turnover on continuing operations marginally down on 1992 - Pounds
125m compared with Pounds 126m.
Earnings per share rose by 29 per cent to 21.29p (16.54p) and the proposed
final dividend is 10.2539p, making 12.4102p (9.9281p) for the year.
Profits were boosted by continued cost cutting and savings from previous
redundancies - staff numbers have fallen from 800 to 350 in the past five
years - and increased sales of programmes to the ITV network. Scottish has
just won another 13 episodes of the relaunch of the drama series, Dr Finlay.
In its first year as a separate subsidiary the company's network programme
arm, Scottish Television Enterprises, increased sales by 60 per cent from
Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 35.2m.
The shares fell 22p to 482p, mainly because a number of analysts were
forecasting higher profit figures. Some may not have taken into account the
Pounds 6m spent on 300 hours of local programmes.
The company's outplacement agency, Pauline Hyde &amp; Associates, managed only
Pounds 104,000 profit on turnover of Pounds 12.1m and in the medium term the
company will be sold or floated.
Scottish believes that GMTV, the breakfast station in which it has a 20 per
cent stake, is now heading for breakeven this year.

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank tops Pounds 7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A steady improvement in domestic demand over the past six months and a 35
per cent increase in overseas sales helped Walker Greenbank, the fabrics and
wallcoverings group, report higher full-year profits yesterday.
Pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 increased by 7.7 per cent to
Pounds 7.08m, from a restated Pounds 6.57m the previous year when profits
were flattered by one-off items resulting in a net gain of Pounds 953,000.
Pre-tax profits on a continuing basis increased by 17 per cent.
Earnings per share slipped to 5.1p (5.3p) reflecting a higher tax charge of
Pounds 2.13m (Pounds 1.63m) and increased dividend payments of Pounds 3.28m
(Pounds 2.94m). However, earnings per share on a continuing basis increased
by 14 per cent from 4.49p to 5.1p.
The final dividend is raised to 2.1p (1.9p) making a total for the year of
3.3p (3.1p).
Turnover grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 62m (Pounds 56.2m), including Pounds
2.18m from acquisitions. Overseas sales contributed Pounds 16.1m (Pounds
12m) and now represent 26 per cent of total turnover, up from just 5 per
cent four years ago. Sales of core fabrics and wallcoverings improved 19 per
cent to Pounds 59.9m (Pounds 50.2m).
Operating profits before exceptionals increased 19.5 per cent to Pounds
7.34m, against Pounds 6.14m the previous year when the figure was depressed
by the Pounds 381,000 losses at Bloom Signs, since sold. The underlying
improvement in operating profits reflected advances in both the commercial
and consumer divisions.
Interest costs fell to Pounds 258,000 (Pounds 520,000) and the group ended
the period with net debt of Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 2.9m), equivalent to
gearing of 2.4 per cent.

urnround in the UK helped Lopex, the advertising and marketing services
company, achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 502,000 for the 1993 year,
against losses of Pounds 372,000 in the previous 12 months, restated for FRS
3.
The result was struck after a Pounds 327,000 deficit on the disposal of
Alliance, the lossmaking London advertising agency.
Turnover increased by 2 per cent to Pounds 142.4m.
The company is returning to the dividend list for the first time since 1990

FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Blockleys gains 19% to Pounds 419,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ckleys, the Telford-based pavior and brick maker, lifted 1993 pre-tax
profits by 19 per cent, from Pounds 352,000 to Pounds 419,000.
Although operating profits were lower at Pounds 1.27m (Pounds 1.6m), the
pre-tax result was helped by a Pounds 46,000 surplus on the sale of property
and reduced interest and similar charges of Pounds 899,000 (Pounds 1.24m).
Turnover fell slightly to Pounds 9.22m (Pounds 9.3m) although for the first
time in four years there was in increase in sales volume.
Earnings per share rose to 1.04p (0.73p) and a maintained final dividend of
0.5p is proposed for an unchanged 1p total.

FT  13 APR 94 / Procter may sue over swaps losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, yesterday raised the
possibility that it will take legal action against Bankers Trust over losses
it incurred on interest rate swaps contracts designed by the banking group.
P&amp;G said it has been forced to take an after-tax charge of Dollars 102m
(Pounds 69m) in the first quarter to cover the losses.
The company said that although it has long been using derivatives
instruments to cut the cost of borrowing and manage exposure to interest
rate and foreign exchange, the losses were incurred on two highly leveraged
swaps contracts that were inconsistent with company policy on the use of
derivatives.
P&amp;G said it lost money on the swaps because of the recent sharp rise in
interest rates. Mr Edwin Artzt, P&amp;G chairman and chief executive, said:
'Unlike the other swaps the company has historically used, it turned out
that the two leveraged swaps in question were based on highly complex
formulas that multiplied the effect of interest rate increases. Derivatives
like these are dangerous and we were badly burned. We won't let this happen
again.'
Mr Artzt said that P&amp;G was 'seriously considering our legal options relative
to Bankers Trust'. The company, however, would not discuss whether it was
considering filing a lawsuit.
Bankers Trust said that while it had entered into a number of derivatives
transactions with P&amp;G, some of which were profitable, when market interest
rates began to affect the company's position adversely on some of the
contracts, the bank 'strongly and formally recommended that Procter &amp; Gamble
limit its risks by unwinding all or part of the transactions'. However,
Bankers Trust said senior officials at P&amp;G rejected its recommendations.
The two contracts that soured were designed to allow P&amp;G to swap fixed rate
loans for floating rate loans, and assumed that US and German rates would
stay low. P&amp;G would not comment on whether any of its executives had been
disciplined for buying swaps from Bankers Trust that breached company
policy, but admitted that some officers had become involved in transactions
they did not fully understand.
The group said its first quarter earnings, to be released later this month,
will show a gain of about 15 per cent, in spite of the swaps-related charge.

FT  13 APR 94 / Midland arm loses senior executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Global Markets, the treasury and capital markets arm of HSBC
Holdings which played a large part in quadrupling Midland Bank's profits to
Pounds 844m last year, has been hit by the resignation of four senior
executives.
The resignations include those of Mr David Gelber, chief operating officer,
and Mr Vib Baxi, head of money market trading, who is thought to have earned
large sums for the bank through proprietary trading in last year's bull
markets.
Mr Baxi was expected to be one of the City's top bonus earners for 1993, but
in December he was moved from the post of head of global money markets. This
meant he lost control of proprietary trading for the bank, and was instead
given charge of the less prestigious investment book.
The move is believed to have contributed to tension over his bonus, which is
believed to have been among the largest paid by Midland to a trader.
The resignations of the two other executives - Mr Gerry Reynolds, who took
over from Mr Baxi as head of money markets, and Mr Michael Burton, head of
foreign exchange sales - are not thought to be directly connected with Mr
Baxi's.
Mr Gelber resigned about six weeks ago, and the other three men resigned at
Easter. Midland paid its bonuses for 1993 in February, and it is common for
other banks to try to recruit traders after such payments.
Neither Mr Baxi nor Mr Gelber are thought to have started other jobs yet. Mr
Burton has been recruited to a London job with Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank, while Mr Reynolds is believed to have opted to change
career.
Mr Baxi declined to comment on his resignation yesterday. Mr Gelber, Mr
Burton and Mr Reynolds could not be contacted, while Mr Guy Heald, head of
Midland Global Markets, would not comment.
Midland Bank said it regretted the departures, but the success of its
treasury operation, which employs about 450 people, meant that its trading
executives were a natural target for other banks.
Midland Global Markets acts as the combined treasury for Midland and
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the two largest subsidiaries of
HSBC Holdings.

FT  13 APR 94 / Virgin-Delta link follows trend to cope with global forces
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The partnership between Virgin Atlantic and Delta Air Lines announced
yesterday is the latest in a series of alliances between European and US
carriers. Airline liberalisation and the internationalisation of the
industry have intensified competition and forced airlines to seek alliances
to increase their global reach, as well as cutting costs by co-ordinating
services and facilities.
For European carriers, a US partner provides access to the world's biggest
domestic airline market, while a European partner offers US carriers entry
into the newly liberalised single European aviation market.
Some airlines, such as British Airways, have sought to cement alliances by
acquiring equity stakes; others, such as American Airlines, prefer
commercial alliances.

FT  13 APR 94 / Maxmin to leave Laura Ashley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laura Ashley is to part ways with its outspoken chief executive, Mr Jim
Maxmin, the American recruited in 1991 to revive the flagging fortunes of
the quintessentially British fashion retailer.
The company announced yesterday that Mr Maxmin would resign in May. It said
his departure followed a disagreement over investment levels. The shares
shed 4p to close at 81p.
Many in the City credited Mr Maxmin with putting the brand-led company back
on track, after plunging into the red in 1990, through rebuilding morale and
deals such as a distribution arrangement with Federal Express. However, his
style did not sit well with others.
One analyst said Mr Maxmin was 'full of business school jargon, a typical
marketing man'.
Some suggested that his strengths lay in strategic planning. 'He was a
concept man,' said another analyst. 'But I was never really sure about the
attention to detail.' This view was reinforced last September when the group
warned profits would be Pounds 7m lower than expectations due to losses in
the US.
The company refused to comment further on Mr Maxmin's departure, but it is
believed the dispute had been simmering for some time. Some analysts thought
Mr Maxmin had wanted to invest heavily in brand marketing. 'They need to
build their profits before they can embark on such a programme,' said one
analyst. Laura Ashley said pre-tax profits, to be announced on Thursday,
would be in line with expectations of about Pounds 3m, against Pounds 1.8m.
Mr Maxmin was on a two-year rolling contract with annual remuneration of
Pounds 310,000.

FT  13 APR 94 / Tesco reassures after fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco, the UK's second biggest supermarket chain, reported a large fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 558m to Pounds 435.5m, but reassured the City
with news that underlying profits were level in spite of intense price
competition.
The shares gained 3p to 218p after Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman, said gross
profit margins had been forced down significantly in the year to February
26, but had shown a 'pleasing improvement' since the year-end.
There had been a 'step change' in gross margins in the grocery industry, he
said, with superstore groups forced to cut prices in the face of competition
from the discounters, slow consumer spending growth and increasing
saturation of the grocery market.
But he did not believe this would develop into an all-out price war or
'downward spiral' of margins.
Tesco's headline profit was depressed by a one-off Pounds 92.9m loss on
property disposals, and Pounds 68.5m depreciation charges following Tesco's
decision to depreciate buildings and land premiums.
Disregarding the one-off loss and applying the new accounting policies to
last year's figures, underlying profits rose slightly from Pounds 527.3m to
Pounds 528.4m. Group turnover increased from Pounds 8.13bn to Pounds 9.25bn.
Sir Ian said Tesco had stemmed the flow of customers switching to the new
generation of cut-price discounters, such as Germany's Aldi and Denmark's
Netto, through the introduction of its 100 Tesco Value lines. These
low-price products now accounted for 3 per cent of turnover.
At the same time, the group had offered price promotions, while improving
product range, store presentation and customer service. 'The competition is
not going to get any easier,' said Sir Ian. 'But it's not all about price.
It is about quality, service and convenience as well.'
Gross margins fell 0.8 percentage points during the year. But like-for-like
sales (excluding store openings and closures) increased 3.3 per cent, with
inflation accounting for 2 percentage points, plus a 1.3 point volume gain.
Total UK sales increased 10.3 per cent.
Profits were boosted by a Pounds 8.2m contribution from Catteau, the French
supermarket chain acquired last year, on sales of Pounds 280.2m.
Fully-diluted earnings fell from 19.78p to 15.06p a share. A final dividend
of 5.3p lifts the total from 7.1p to 7.75p.

FT  13 APR 94 / The Wall Street bears prepare to have a picnic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First blow up your bubble and enjoy it, then work out how to deflate it
without creating an explosion. Prepare to worry. The Japanese have been
grappling with this for several years now, the US Federal Reserve only for a
few months. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has some awkward choices:
either he can raise short-term interest rates sharply, on the grounds that
the bad news had best be got out of the way, and anyway it is now
anticipated; or he can leave rates alone for a few months, hoping that the
markets will settle down.
The middle way is to keep edging up by a quarter-point every now and then,
hoping to keep the politicians quiet and with luck allowing an orderly
adjustment in securities prices.
Bonds have already tumbled, but US equities have remained quite resilient.
After all, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is only off about 2 per cent in
1994 so far (though down 7 per cent from its peak four days before Mr
Greenspan first tightened on February 4) and it is less than a month since
prices on Nasdaq were hitting all-time highs. But now some of the North
American stock market sheets are getting very edgy: there is a growth scare.
The stock market is in dangerous territory according to The Bank Credit
Analyst, and a sharp correction lies ahead; Grant's is eagerly if
equivocally anticipating 'what may or may not prove to be an unforgettable
bear market'.
Meanwhile the casual radio and TV listener is baffled by news reports that
the stock market is weak because the US economy is proving to be
unexpectedly buoyant. But what about the benefits for equities of rising
profits and surging output? The market has obviously gone crazy again.
Well, not quite. Mr Gordon Pepper, one-time star guru of the London
gilt-edged market and now a professor at the City University, next week
publishes his long-awaited monetarist theory of asset prices*. In it he
shows that overall equity market price movements are largely explained in
the short to medium term by changes in bond interest rates. Only over
periods upwards of four years do the corporate sector fundamentals, such as
dividend growth, exert a dominant influence.
Meanwhile, he emphasises, many securities transactions are motivated not by
any change in the economic or corporate fundamentals but by the need to
raise or invest cash. He could have devised no better example than the
margin squeeze which has forced a collapse in global bonds.
Many nervous eyes are now on the US mutual funds sector. Over the past two
or three years US private investors have accepted a large new exposure to
risk as they have shifted out of savings deposits into stock and bond funds
at the combined rate of often more than Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.6bn) a
month. The particular feature of 1993 was a sharp rise in the purchases of
mutual funds investing in overseas equities.
As recently as February this year a near-record Dollars 14bn was still
pouring into stock funds, but bond fund inflows had collapsed. It will be
bad enough for equity markets around the world if the money now simply stops
coming in, after the first negative quarter for the average mutual fund
price for two years. We are a long way from any serious net selling, but it
is worrying that there is Dollars 700bn in equities in potentially loosely
held mutual funds. It was bad enough in 1987 when stock funds were worth
only Dollars 200bn.
This brings us back to Mr Greenspan's dilemma. He would surely like to take
short-term dollar rates back to 5 per cent, because low rates have now
achieved their tasks of recapitalising the banking system and reviving the
economy. But a move intended to be economically stabilising could
destabilise the financial asset markets because there have been such huge
shifts by investors seeking higher returns.
The anti-meltdown techniques used in Japan - such as leaning on public
sector funds to buy equities, and slashing interest rates - are not open to
the Americans. In fact, if the US economy continues to surge, short-term
interest rates as high as 6 or 7 per cent might be justifiable next year.
However, higher taxes may slow the economy, and masterly timing might
cushion the blow of interest rate rises. Let's hope so, and worry a little
less.

FT  13 APR 94 / Daimler recovers after cost cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<DATELINE>
   STUTTGART
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial concern, is on the road to
recovery after a record DM1.8bn (Pounds 720m) net loss last year, according
to its chairman Mr Edzard Reuter.
Reporting an operating deficit of DM3.3bn after restructuring costs of
DM3.5bn, he said the turning point was reached in the last quarter of 1993.
The positive trend established then, with a DM442m operating profit, had
continued.
As the costs of restructuring - including the loss of a further 18,000 jobs
this year - had already been provided for, Mr Reuter confidently forecast a
positive operating result for 1994.
A satisfactory trend in overall group profits would be restored in 1995, he
said in the annual report published yesterday. By then, the company planned
to restore the loss-making Deutsche Aerospace and AEG Electrical engineering
subsidiaries at least to break-even. Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz cars will
remain the main source of profits.
Group sales rose 23 per cent to DM13bn in the first two months of this year,
while turnover at the automotive division increased 32 per cent to DM9.5bn -
some 73 per cent of the total.
Mr Reuter said car production would rise to 570,000 units this year from
480,000 in 1993. Sales were expected to increase to more than 570,000, from
508,000.
In Germany, where the overall market rose 1 per cent in the first quarter,
Mercedes registrations jumped 38 per cent. But the European operations of
the loss-making commercial vehicles business remained quite worrying, he
said.
Figures prepared according to the US accounting standards adopted after
Daimler's listing on the New York Stock Exchange showed Mercedes, which
absorbed DM1.7bn in restructuring costs, made an operating loss of DM1.3bn
last year. AEG and Deutsche Aerospace each lost almost DM1bn, while the
Debis Services arm improved from DM276m to DM366m at the operating level.
According to Mr Reuter, the group's recovery would stem from its new-found
strength after restructuring, not on what he called naive hopes of economic
recovery.
The unexpectedly sharp cut in the 1993 dividend from DM13 to D8, announced
last week, was a temporary setback, he added.

FT  13 APR 94 / Wrigley gives pledge on displays after rival complains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wrigley, the US company which supplies nearly 90 per cent of the UK's
chewing gum, has given an assurance that it will not remove competitors'
display stands from shops without written permission from the retailer
concerned.
The assurance was given to the Office of Fair Trading, which was
investigating a complaint from Warner-Lambert, the US drugs and consumer
products group, which is the only other significant chewing gum supplier in
the UK.
Warner-Lambert claimed that retailers had been complaining since 1988 that
Wrigley's sales representatives had sometimes removed Warner-Lambert display
stands or shifted them to a dark corner of the shop.
'This was a situation the retailers didn't enjoy. It was not being done with
their agreement,' said Miss Caroline Horrill, UK marketing director of
Warner-Lambert Confectionery, whose brands include Dentyne, Stimorol and
Clorets.
Miss Horrill said most of the complaints about the market leader had come
from small shops. Warner-Lambert had not experienced difficulties displaying
its products in large retail outlets. 'With major retailers, one has a more
disciplined environment,' she said.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday that in
view of Wrigley's undertaking, he had decided not to mount a formal
investigation of the chewing gum market.
Sir Bryan said Wrigley  - supplier of Juicy Fruit, Doublemint and Spearmint
gum  - had also undertaken not to discriminate in favour of retailers who
did not stock competitors' products. He said that Wrigley had agreed within
one month to bring these assurances to the attention of any of its employees
who dealt with retailers.
Sir Bryan added: 'I shall be keeping this market under review and should not
hesitate to consider more formal action should matters come to my attention
that suggest further action to be appropriate.'
However, Wrigley said the assurances merely reaffirmed the company's
existing trading policy. Mr Philip Hamilton, managing director, said: 'It
has been and remains the Wrigley company's policy not to offer inducements
to remove or to exclude competitors' displays or products from retail
outlets.'

FT  13 APR 94 / Fraud office calls off Gooda Walker probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office has called off its investigation into the Gooda
Walker syndicates, the biggest loss-makers on the Lloyd's of London
insurance market.
The action marks the end of the only current criminal investigations
connected with Lloyd's and shifts the onus on any disciplinary action to the
insurance market's own regulatory system.
The news was greeted with muted disappointment yesterday by Gooda Walker
Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally backed the insurance
market, who stand liable for underwriting losses on the syndicates during
the 1980s totalling nearly Pounds 1bn.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said: 'I think
it's regrettable that there will be no prosecutions. We believe there was a
cover up at Gooda Walker and it should have come before the courts.'
However, he stressed that a criminal case would have brought no compensation
to the loss-making Names, and that legal action launched by the group was
proceeding. The case is due to begin in the High Court on April 26. Gooda
Names are pursuing 71 members' agents, who looked after their interests on
the market, for more than Pounds 600m.
The police investigation began last July after Mr Ken Randall, a director of
GW Run Off, the insurance agency now managing the Gooda Walker syndicates,
sent a detailed report in April to the SFO as well as Lloyd's and individual
Names on the four syndicates.
The report raised concerns over the way in which some reinsurance policies
were accounted for, how 'time and distance' policies might have distorted
the syndicates' results and suggested that transactions between the Gooda
syndicates might not have been at arm's length.
Time and distance policies are reinsurance policies allowing syndicates to
manage reserves against 'long-tail' claims, which come many years after the
start of policies.
The SFO wrote recently to Mr Randall saying it had decided not to pursue
action and said yesterday: 'We can confirm that the SFO investigation into
certain matters referred by the directors of Gooda Walker Run Off has now
ceased.
'No criminal proceedings have commenced. The director is aware that a
parallel inquiry is being conducted by the legal department of Lloyd's with
which the SFO is co-operating closely.'
The SFO is believed to have passed considerable information gathered during
its inquiry on to Lloyd's.

FT  13 APR 94 / Tax officials told to be more sensitive in dealing with
public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax officials should be more sensitive in their dealings with the public and
make more effort to understand taxpayers' views, according to the head of
the independent tax watchdog.
Releasing the first set of figures since her office began work last July, Ms
Elizabeth Filkin, the Revenue adjudicator, said she had upheld nearly
two-thirds of completed cases brought by disgruntled taxpayers against the
Inland Revenue.
Of the 104 cases concluded so far, 64 have been settled wholly or partly in
favour of the taxpayer, 36 in favour of the Revenue and four were withdrawn
by the complainants.
The most common causes for complaints were delays in obtaining tax refunds,
the conduct of Revenue investigations and excessive haste in attempting to
collect tax arrears  - often without using sufficient discretion.
Ms Filkin said: 'Sometimes the Revenue has been aggressive and shown little
imagination in realising what it is like to be a taxpayer. It doesn't take
into account the fright it causes to small businesses.'
She called for greater training, more 'customer focus' and the need for tax
officials to 'put yourselves more into other people's shoes'.
She said inspectors had sometimes made too many assumptions about taxpayers'
understanding of the tax system, and wrote antagonistic letters in
'officialese' when they did not themselves understand the tax position.
However, Ms Filkin stressed that she was pleased with the way the Revenue
had co-operated with her office and followed the findings she had made.
She added that problems were inevitable in an organisation as large as the
Revenue, which she called 'the largest business in the country'.
Since the adjudicator's office began operations nine months ago it has
received 1,519 complaints about the Revenue, of which 1,006 were resolved
without a full investigation.
The adjudicator's office was created as part of the Revenue's attempts under
the Citizen's Charter to improve services. It is funded by the Revenue but
Ms Filkin is not part of the department's management structure.
Ms Filkin said the complaints received were generally more complicated than
she had initially anticipated, and that 73 per cent had been made by people
with incomes below Pounds 15,000.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jim Maxmin has always looked vaguely ill at ease in Laura Ashley. So his
departure from the chief executive's slot is perhaps unsurprising. Some of
the company's operational problems have been sorted out in the last three
years. Others, most notably in the US, have not. Several of the more serious
wounds were self-inflicted. Yet his departure, accompanied only by a brief
statement, is unsatisfactory. The appointment of Mr Hugh Blakeway Webb as
executive chairman looks like a victory for the old guard, who have let
shareholders down before. Convincing explanations will be needed at
tomorrow's results presentation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The great television takeover frenzy pumped up the sector's shares like
balloons. Now the question is whether the surviving contractors will slowly
deflate or pop, given that the big bids are over. A 4 per cent fall in
Scottish Television's shares after yesterday's disappointing results
suggests the latter may happen. Ulster Television fell by a similar amount
in sympathy. Yet there were some particular factors at work at Scottish. The
company may have done well to retain its franchise with a cheekily low bid.
But the hidden costs of victory are emerging as its strong regional
commitment meant it spent Pounds 6m on Gaelic programmes.
Nevertheless, the other smaller television companies can hardly justify
their racy ratings solely on earnings prospects. Cable and satellite
operators will nibble away at advertising growth. Yet earnings are not the
only important variable. There may well be further consolidation among the
smaller contractors. Flextech's investment in HTV shows that television
assets are also highly prized by other media companies. The government's
review of the cross-media ownership rules may provoke a further wave of
speculative interest. That limits the downside risk to shares in
television's Celtic fringe.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Daimler-Benz's confident tone and stress on investment yesterday was a world
away from the pose an Anglo-Saxon manufacturer would strike in a similarly
sticky spot. Whether Daimler's confidence will prove justified is, however,
an open question. The company has some things going for it: an under-used
asset base offers opportunities to improve margins and raise cash from
disposals. Hard times encourage union flexibility. General Motors, Ford and
BMW have proved that it is possible to make cars in Germany at a profit.
Yet the challenges remain great. Daimler starts its overhaul of the
cost-plus manufacturing facilities, working methods and attitudes from a
long way behind the competition. The company has yet to accept that people
may not automatically pay more for a three-pointed star on their bonnets.
Its expensive diversification has been disastrous. Daimler is now struggling
with the huge investment and working capital demands of both the aerospace
and automotive industries. Shareholders will want to see positive progress
as well as fancy talk before stumping up any rights issue cash later in the
year.

FT  13 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Tesco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an old retailing saw that shopkeepers must be good listeners.
Unfortunately, Tesco appeared to lose its hearing a few years ago. There
are, however, some encouraging signs that its chastened management is now
proving more attentive. Same store sales rose 3.3 per cent last year as
Tesco sharpened its prices and broadened its product range. Its value lines
have proved an effective counter to the discount threat. And Tesco is
developing a promising new type of high street metro store that will
doubtless win the approval of the evergreen environment secretary.
Against that background, the recent bounce in Tesco's shares relative to the
sector is understandable. Investors, expecting the very worst when industry
margins were tumbling last year, are relieved that the outcome is only poor.
Tesco's promise of turning cash positive in 1995 and raising dividends
thereafter adds to its appeal.
Little of this allays the worries about the industry's future. The recent
recovery of gross margins may suggest the grocery chains are now achieving a
more controlled decline than a headlong fall. But Tesco remains on a
fearsome treadmill, spending Pounds 779m on capital expenditure last year to
produce minimal earnings growth. Superstore capacity is still being added at
an eye-popping rate, discounters are proliferating, and price inflation is
forecast to fall to just 1 per cent this year. Tesco may be running faster
than its rivals, but the sector is still limping.

FT  13 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Virgin territory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Virgin Atlantic's alliance with Delta Air Lines is a fine example of a
commercial solution to a regulatory problem. Buying a portion of Virgin's
seats on transatlantic routes gives Delta access to Heathrow without having
to wait for landing slots to be made available. In theory, there is nothing
to stop such block purchasing agreements being extended to the point at
which smaller European airlines become, in effect, suppliers of seats to big
US carriers. In practice, though, governments would be reluctant to see a
coach and horses driven through their regulations.
Still, joint ticketing arrangements and limited block purchasing are useful
expedients for both sides. Virgin is guaranteed around Pounds 100m of
additional revenue and can extend its frequent flyer programme, a useful
weapon in the battle for business class customers. Since Virgin and Delta do
not compete directly on any route - unlike Lufthansa and United Airlines,
which signed a similar agreement last year - the two parties look like
comfortable bedfellows. Yet if Delta gets its own Heathrow landing slots,
the conflicts of interest would be great. Without cross shareholdings it
will be easy for either side to walk away. The alliance might, however,
sneak market share away from British Airways, or United and American
Airlines which already fly into Heathrow. But while underlying traffic
growth remains strong that may not cause much turbulence. The 3 per cent
rise in BA's shares yesterday suggests the stock market realises as much.

FT  13 APR 94 / Leading Article: Defence mergers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cuts in military budgets have put defence contractors under strain around
the world. On each side of the Atlantic, arms-makers are choosing different
paths to seek compensation for falling orders. In Europe, companies are
increasingly joining forces in collaborative international arrangements, as
in the prospective Anglo-French-Italian frigate project or the joint venture
in missiles being discussed between British Aerospace and Matra. In the far
larger US market, reorganisation is taking place through mergers and
disposals. The latest example was Northrop's takeover of rival aerospace
company Grumman, agreed last week.
The moves outlined yesterday, under which the US government may ease some
defence mergers by taking a softer line on anti-trust considerations, show
how the Pentagon hopes to steer the restructuring process. While spending a
lot less on weapons, the US has a crucial interest in maintaining the
industrial and technological capabilities that underpin its status as the
world's sole superpower.
The defence industry has been lobbying hard for explicit changes in
anti-trust rules, a step the government rules out. The Federal Trade
Commission in 1992 turned down a prospective acquisition by the Alliant
ammunition group, which would have given it a virtual monopoly of the tank
ordnance business.
With annual US arms procurement spending down by 60 per cent in real terms
from 1985 levels, the administration is watching defence consolidation with
mixed feelings. On the one hand, the Pentagon has the chance of putting
equipment purchases on to a more rational basis, where decisions are driven
by need rather than political pressures. On the other, the sector's
shrinking base presents a long-term challenge. A shortage of competing
suppliers can impede the drive for better value for money. In extreme cases,
the government can be forced to take uneconomic industrial policy decisions
to maintain sources of domestic supply.
Already, in purchases of tanks and nuclear submarines, the US is now
dependent on a single supplier. The Pentagon apparently believes that only
two-thirds of necessary consolidation has so far taken place. Northrop's
acquisition of Grumman indicates how takeovers can improve industry
structures, since the company will now be in a better position to compete
with the three main combat aircraft-makers  - McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed
and Boeing.
The trend towards more mergers seems likely to continue as the procurement
budget shrinks. European partners should use the opportunity of new thinking
in Washington to press for greater US-European tie-ups. If the US wants to
improve the structure of its defence industry, then European companies
seeking entry to the American market should be allowed to play a fuller role
in the process.

FT  13 APR 94 / Leading Article: Lancer's lot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The possibility that Lancer Boss, the last UK-owned maker of fork-lift
trucks, may pass into foreign hands will no doubt prompt the usual
hand-wringing in Britain over the disappearance of indigenous manufacturing
capacity. Yet a transfer of ownership overseas would in this case amount to
little more than repatriation. At the date of the last published balance
sheet, less than a fifth of Lancer Boss's Pounds 192m turnover was generated
in the UK. Of the 70 per cent or so that came from continental Europe, a
majority was from Steinbock Boss, the third-largest German lift truck
manufacturer which was acquired by Lancer Boss in 1983. The foreign tail has
clearly been wagging the British bulldog.
More interesting than the ownership question is the reason for the failure
to turn a domestic industrial success story into a durable international
operation. The fork-lift truck industry is, after all, a post-war
phenomenon. It has been more open than traditional areas of engineering to
new entrepreneurial entrants. Companies like Lancer Boss and Lansing
Bagnall, which was earlier taken over by the biggest German lift truckmaker
Linde, performed well in the earlier stages of the industry life cycle but
failed to establish themselves as robust independent entities in a period
when global capacity was being rationalised.
The strength of German mechanical engineering, the size of its domestic
market and the stability of the German economy are no doubt part of the
explanation for British  - along with French and Italian  - ineffectiveness.
Equally striking is that Lancer Boss, in order to make the transition to a
powerful internationally-based manufacturer, felt obliged to take a huge
risk by buying a troubled German company much bigger than itself. Against
the background of a less stable British economic environment it was
transforming the scale of its operations and magnifying the potential
financial consequences of any managerial weakness.
The risks were heightened by banking arrangements which appear to have left
maximum room for misunderstanding in a financial crisis. A national approach
to receivership in a pan-European group is a formula for preventing the full
value of the business being realised, given that the subsidiaries in Britain
and Germany were fairly closely integrated. Yet in a single market where
countries compete over the relative flexibility of closure arrangements to
attract inward investment, the politics of Euro-receivership look hopeless.
The story should nonetheless be seen in context. If stability in Germany is
a boon to mechanical engineers, Britain derives comparative advantage from
precisely the opposite phenomenon. Its overwhelming success in international
financial services stems partly from the need to deal with growing financial
instability. And that, of course, is a source of constant hand-wringing in
Germany.

FT  13 APR 94 / Leading Article: Mediation in Natal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If South African politicians had any doubts about the cost of the country's
constitutional crisis, these must by now have been dispelled. In the early
hours of Saturday morning a peace summit collapsed. When trading began on
Monday, the financial rand, the country's investment currency, followed
suit. If this message, coupled with the rising death toll in Natal, does not
concentrate minds, then the team of international negotiators which arrived
in Johannesburg yesterday has embarked on a hopeless mission.
As it is, there is no quick fix, for the odds are heavily stacked against
Lord Carrington, the former British foreign secretary, Mr Henry Kissinger,
ex-US secretary of state, and their colleagues.
It is a month since the initiative was first mooted by South Africa's main
leaders. In that time positions have, if anything, hardened. Friday's summit
showed that Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of the Inkatha Freedom
party, remains determined to boycott the April 26-28 election. The Zulu
king, Goodwill Zwelithini, reasserted his claim for Zulu sovereignty in
Natal. President FW de Klerk can do little more than stand in the wings, for
power slips daily from his grasp.
The ANC is more determined than ever that the poll should go ahead. The ANC
is probably right. The option of postponement may have existed a month ago,
but it has now gone. Delay would create too much uncertainty, straining the
stability of an already fragile administration.
With positions entrenched and little time left, the negotiators' task
appears impossible. The constitutional question at stake is fundamental to
South Africa's future, involving the relationship between central government
and the country's nine provincial assemblies. But the mediators' journey
need not be in vain. For the first time since the negotiating process began,
outside intervention has been sought. The world has a responsibility to
respond constructively.
At this stage, it may well be that all the mediators can do is to take stock
and assess whether South Africa's leaders have truly made their best efforts
to resolve the crisis. If they judge not, the mediators would be doing a
service if they said so, bluntly and publicly. They might also warn that,
although elections may go ahead, the problem of Natal will not go away. The
crackdown on the province expected imminently can at best only be a
palliative. Without a political solution it could well exacerbate the
conflict in the longer term. Nor is it likely that Chief Buthelezi, required
by law to surrender his position of chief minister of kwaZulu after election
day, will go quietly.
Whether as mediators in a deepening civil conflict, or trying to resolve a
constitutional impasse, the good offices of outsiders will be surely
required. The first visit of Lord Carrington and Mr Kissinger may be a short
one, but sooner or later, South Africa's politicians will probably have to
invite them back.

And now, for the business executive who has everything except style: the IBM
bedroom. Who gets these ideas? More, who thinks they are worth a press
release? This one is dated April 12 so it's probably not an April Fool's
joke.
Apparently, IBM's UK personal computer outfit has 'teamed up with American
hotelier and restaurateur Bob Payton to create an IBM-themed bedroom at his
luxury country hotel, Stapleford Park, in Leicestershire'. Each of the
hotel's bedrooms has been decked out according to the whim of a
'quintessentially English' company; as of course is IBM.
It gets worse. 'In keeping with the innovative and youthful image of the IBM
PC company, the bedroom will cleverly incorporate a pictorial interpretation
of the IBM logo into the door . . .'
To incite you to rush straight out, presumably. Who says IBM has lost focus?

Having teamed up with Delta Air Lines, what will Virgin's Richard Branson do
for his next publicity coup?
The bearded entrepreneur, whose BA call sign is the 'grinning pullover', is
desperate to go supersonic and has been in secret talks with impoverished
Air France to borrow three of its Concordes.
The chance of Branson Concordes in Virgin livery competing head-on with the
marketing flagship of British Airways' fleet on the London to New York route
would cause apoplexy at BA's Speedbird House, particularly as Branson talks
happily of BA's Concorde seating being too cramped.
Bernard Attali, Air France's former chairman, was 'extremely keen', says
Branson. But talks have stalled since Attali lost his job last autumn. 'Once
we've got the Delta deal done, we hope to pop over to Paris and have a
little talk with Air France,' says Branson mischievously.

FT  13 APR 94 / Observer: Hark to Angell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wayne Angell, a 63-year-old farmer and academic from Meade County, Kansas,
is hardly the most obvious choice for Bear Stearns as its senior economist,
even if he has eight years' experience as a Federal Reserve governor. Wall
Street economists are, like it or not, first and foremost salesmen  -
relatively youthful ones at that. Nor do Bear Stearns' gathering strengths
in emerging markets exactly cry out for an agricultural egghead.
Despite his dour mien, one of the slightly surprising things about Angell,
however, is his apparent love of the limelight and his not inconsiderable
talent for self-promotion. He is, moreover, supremely confident in his
wackily hawkish views about using commodity prices to target monetary
policy.
He should fit in. 'Larry (Kudlow, his predecessor at Bear Stearns) was
watching what I was doing so carefully that he was kind of my marketing
agent,' Angell observes. Having survived on the Fed's annual pittance of
Dollars 123,100, his landing at one of the best payers on the Street makes
sound financial sense of course.
And at least this looks like a real job  - contrast the grand but
nebulous-sounding involvement of former New York Fed president Gerry
Corrigan in 'special projects' at Goldman Sachs. It also sounds a good deal
more serious an occupation than that of former Fed vice-chairman Manley
Johnson who peddles all that insider stuff from his perch at Washington
DC-based consultants Smick Johnson.

Peyton has spotted the fact that the government bill to privatise British

This is not a joke. Ireland's parliament, the Dail, is thinking of
constructing an underground tunnel between the Leinster House parliament
building and Kildare House, where MPs have their offices.
The 40-yard tunnel would cost about Pounds 200,000. The idea for it came up
at a meeting of the Dail's committee on procedures and privileges, where
some members  - fed up with running a well-established gauntlet of picketing
protestors  - proposed the tunnel as a neat solution.
Things haven't yet come to that sort of pass at the mother of all
parliaments, Westminster. John Major is still prepared to risk the
twice-weekly, 90-second ride from Downing Street to the Commons in the back
of his bullet-proof Daimler.
His problem is the frenzied tunneling going on around him by erstwhile
supporters seeking an escape. That was a joke.

FT  13 APR 94 / One way to tread water: A scheme to develop a problem site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In mid-April, an eight-lane swimming pool will be opened at Spitalfields,
the former fruit and vegetable market on the fringes of the City of London.
A few months later, the site will get a second new facility: an opera house.
This is rather strange, because the owner of the 13-acre site was hoping to
transform it into a big office, shopping and housing complex. It was
diverted by the recession - but, in the process, it has shown that a
thriving industry exists in what might be called 'interim use' development.
The owner, the Spitalfields Development Group, is a consortium consisting of
two construction companies, Costain and BICC, and London &amp; Edinburgh Trust,
a Swedish-owned property company. It acquired a 150-year lease on the site
in 1987, intending to turn it into an extension of the 1980s City
development at nearby Broadgate. It spent Pounds 24m moving the vegetable
market to new premises in Leytonstone, east London. But before it could
begin work on the site, the recession struck, and what had been billed as
Europe's largest inner-city project ground to a halt.
The consortium, hit by heavy losses, decided it had to do something rather
than watch the property decay on its hands. At least it possessed the market
building - an attractive Victorian structure with potential. The consortium
asked its architect, Benjamin Thompson and Associates, to draft plans to
turn it into a temporary shopping arcade, and invited outside companies to
tender for the work.
The UK 'interim use' industry consists of a group of small companies which
specialise in managing problem sites. The best known is Urban Space
Management, which began more than 20 years ago with Camden Lock, a once
derelict north London canalside site, now a successful urban market.
Urban Space Management won the contract and in 1991 set up a joint company,
Spitalfields Space Management (SSM), with the consortium. Together they
contributed a total of Pounds 300,000. The money came with a five-year lease
on the site, extendable to 2000.
Mr Alan Masterton of Spitalfields Development Group says the aim was
threefold: to attract City workers into the site, to mend fences with the
local community after the loss of the market jobs, and to earn a bit of
cash.
Three years later, Spitalfields has dozens of shops, seven restaurants and
several indoor sports areas for soccer and tennis. At weekends it houses the
country's largest organic food market. The Pounds 200,000 swimming pool is
nearing completion in a hole originally intended to be the basement of a new
office block. When the opera house, seating 540, is completed, it will be
London's first new one for 200 years. Of the 140,000 sq ft available to SSM,
fewer than 2,000 remain unlet.
This is the sort of result that gladdens urban planners' hearts. But is it
commercial, and could it be replicated elsewhere?
The project is not commercial in the sense that it reflects the full costs.
SDG has contributed the site effectively free of charge, and its members
have taken big write-offs on their original investment: over Pounds 75m
between the three of them.
But while SSM got its main asset cheap, it operates as a normal
profit-seeking enterprise. There are three aspects to its business strategy.
The first is to cut costs ruthlessly. Eric Reynolds, the director, views any
price tag as only the starting point. 'Cost is a cast of mind,' he says.
'People have an idea of how much they expect something to cost, and they'll
accept anything near that.'
The first quotation the company received for the swimming pool, for example,
was Pounds 750,000. But it cut that by nearly three-quarters by driving hard
bargains and picking cheap suppliers. The swimming pool's clear plastic roof
was found in Israel. Similarly with the opera house; this is currently
budgeted at Pounds 500,000, though the price is 'not yet fully driven down',
says Reynolds. Prince Charles sponsored a personal seat for Pounds 900, and
other private sponsors are being sought.
The second step is to draw on grants where possible. Reynolds persuaded City
Challenge - a state-funded urban renewal initiative - to provide Pounds
195,000 towards the pool, because there were 14 schools within a mile which
would benefit from it, as well as a large Bangladeshi community living
nearby. 'The interim uses satisfy both business and leisure needs,' says
Lesley Klein, chief executive of Bethnal Green City Challenge. 'What we have
here is a commercial operation able to offer low costs.'
The third step is to make the development user-friendly by attracting
stallholders and craftsmen, and nurturing the street culture, as at Camden
Lock.
Reynolds stresses that his company aims to make a profit, though it also
performs a social role: for example, his company's efforts have restored 400
jobs to a site which lost 2,000. 'What we're doing here doesn't make a
return on what the land is worth. But it's better than shutting the whole
thing up.'
But being temporary, the plans have to be made with a view to the site's
ultimate use. SDG has been advised demand for office space will probably be
strong enough to restart development work by 1996-97, though it has agreed
to extend Urban Space Management's contract to 2000. Then, the swimming pool
will have to be filled in, or moved. The opera house is being built where it
can be accommodated in the long-term plan.

FT  13 APR 94 / A country torn this way and that: Ukraine's elections have
heightened political tensions and threaten prospects for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The democratic voice of Ukraine, as in Russia last December, has spoken the
mind of a people unable to trust what has been advertised as reform. They
seek refuge in old (communist) and even older (nationalist) certainties, or
myths which promise deliverance of one kind or another.
Unlike in Russia, however, Ukraine's 52m people have experienced at best
partial reform. Inflation has reached as high as 90 per cent, but prices
have not been liberalised. The state can no longer support its enterprises
and farms, but there is little privatisation. It could be said the greatest
reform of all - that of creating an independent state in place of a Soviet
republic - has succeeded, but even that is partial, contested and insecure.
In all the crucial aspects of its citizens' life and wellbeing, Ukraine has
gone towards the edge, but drawn back, not once but many times. Thus the
considerable pain which people have suffered and still suffer has been less
a result of reform than of a lack of reform. The pain of a real
transformation is yet to come.
The danger which the new parliament seems certain to bring is of a
legislature and an executive unable to negotiate the impasse. It is the
danger of a country drifting into a combination of government paralysis and
economic decline, where the need grows for extreme solutions and thus for
extreme politicians and groups to introduce and administer them. This has
not yet happened and may not, but Sunday's elections heighten the
possibility.
Mr Yuri Yekhanourov, the deputy economics minister and one of the
government's few (frustrated) reformers, says of the people's condition of
life that 'it may not be dangerous, but it is very, very hard. I have been
to farms where the workers have received no pay since October  - because the
state has taken their produce and paid nothing for it. In the shops, I saw
notebooks with column after column of figures where the families' debts are
just totalled up, day after day.'
The figures he has for the drop in overall output are startlingly bad. In
January, it was down by 34.1 per cent compared with the same month last
year; in February, 38.9 per cent; in March (unpublished figures), 42.6 per
cent. The hugely improved figures for inflation - January 12.6 per cent,
February 12.2 per cent, March 5.7 per cent - show why. A tight credit
squeeze introduced in December has worked its way through the system to
puncture hyperinflation. But since the end of February, the policy has been
reversed, and the government has agreed an emission of 50,000bn karbovanets
(half last year's gross national product) in the first quarter, though
central bank delays have meant not all of that has been released. Next
month, inflation will start a probably violent upward spiral once more.
Privatisation has begun, but only as a 'trial' limited to 150 enterprises.
Roughly 70 per cent of each will go to the workers, who must buy their
shares with vouchers and cannot then trade them. The vouchers, to be printed
in the US, are not even issued, because no minister will take the
controversial step of endorsing them. A state-of-the-art electronic stock
exchange has been provided by the French government, on which just two
stocks trade for half an hour a week.
Mr Yekhanourov takes some heart from the election of the main figures of
economic reform - these include the economics minister Mr Roman Shpek, Mr
Volodomyr Lanovoi and Mr Victor Penzenik, two former deputy prime ministers,
and a few others. But, he says, 'there will be no majority in parliament for
reform'.
Nor, says Mr Nikolai Mikhailchenko, the main aide to President Leonid
Kravchuk, is there likely to be a consensus for constitutional reform. The
president's preferred constitution is one confirming him as commander in
chief of the armed forces and security establishment, and permitting him to
conduct foreign policy, propose the prime minister to parliament and guide
the government's work. But Mr Ivan Plyushch, the outgoing speaker in
parliament and probably the most powerful figure in the new one, has already
put down a marker that he will press for a parliamentary system with a
figurehead president.
'The new parliament will present a very tough problem,' says Mr
Mikhailchenko. 'It's not so much divided left and right, with a defined
centre. There are extremes, with a mass of deputies who will go this way and
that. And you won't be able to tell how.'
For the nationalists, who see themselves as the force which did most to keep
alive and then recreate Ukrainian statehood, the elections have been a
bitter disappointment. They are essentially confined to their west Ukrainian
redoubts (the less heavily populated part of the country) and to some
districts in Kiev.
Mr Vyacheslav Chornovil, the former dissident and leader of the main
nationalist grouping Rukh, gave a typically verbose press conference on
Monday which dismissed any compromise allowing Russian to be a state
language with Ukrainian or contemplating an economic union with Russia. He
is more pragmatic away from his supporters - but can move very little away
from his platform pronouncements without losing part of his support to the
more extreme nationalists. At any event, the victorious Communists and
Socialists will see little reason to accommodate him.
This latter grouping, more than a third of the parliament so far announced
and likely to attract many from the independent 'swamp', sees itself as
riding the wave. Mr Leonid Hrach, the Communist leader in the Crimean
region, has already hailed the Ukrainians as having returned to both
communism and Russia. For him and for many of the left, the way forward is
the way back to the Soviet Union, or at least economic integration with
Russia and the other former Soviet states. Russia, which will at Friday's
gathering of the heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States propose
just such a grouping, is keen to pull Ukraine back more firmly into its
orbit, even if much less willing to pay its debts and support its stagnant
enterprises.
The two states have a whole field of tensions between them. The
Russian-dominated Crimea is steadily increasing what Kiev sees as its
'provocations' as it senses Kiev's already flabby power weaken further. The
peninsula's president, Mr Yuri Meshkov, yesterday named his own internal
affairs minister and KGB chief (both, of course, Russians), thus flouting
Ukrainian law. Mr Mikhailchenko says: 'The solution is simple: Crimea must
obey the law.' But he knows it will not be obeyed and that the presence of
Mr Meshkov as a president recognised by Kiev already establishes an illegal
precedent.
Also dangerous is the dispute over the Black Sea fleet - where a Russian
seizure of equipment and retaliatory Ukrainian arrests over the weekend
brought a high-level Russian delegation scuttling to Kiev to attempt again
to deal with the fleet's ownership. It locates tension among men under arms
who, whatever their former good relations, are increasingly provoking each
other, with the approval, even the urging, of their respective governments.
The last accord, between Presidents Kravchuk and Boris Yeltsin of Russia, at
Massandra last year, is interpreted differently by each side, the Russians
insisting it means that the fleet reverts to them in return for cancelled
debt, the Ukrainians that it was a mere protocol calling for further work
which has proved unfruitful. The US defence secretary William Perry said in
Kiev recently that he would be ready to act as a mediator. Says Mr
Mikhailchenko: 'We would be ready to go along with that but the Russians
never would.'
Ukraine now reels, but there is no figure capable of steadying it. It has -
Mr Yekhanourov sees this as a fundamental problem - no 'natural' ruling
class. A tragic century, during which Russians, Soviets and Nazis
decapitated the best in the society (and murdered much of the society as a
whole) has left a pervasive passivity, in which a creditable desire for
agreement tends to become a constant descent to lower and lower common
denominators. It has produced no outstanding economic reformer, no tough
leader, no indisputably moral touchstone. 'We will need,' says Mr
Yekhanourov, 'a generation or two before we produce a new leadership class.'
In the meantime, pressures mount in the void where leadership should be.

FT  13 APR 94 / No champagne until after take-off: Air France's rescue
package has won staff approval. But, the hard work lies ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<TEXT>
When Mr Christian Blanc took control of Air France last October, the chips
appeared to be stacked heavily against him. A violent strike in protest at a
restructuring package had brought the airline to its knees, prompting a
humiliating climbdown by the government of Mr Edouard Balladur and forcing
the resignation of the previous chairman, Mr Bernard Attali.
Six months on, Mr Blanc is turning the odds in his favour. A referendum on
his package of reforms, completed on Monday, showed that more than 80 per
cent of the company's staff endorse his plans to cut 5,000 of Air France's
40,000 jobs, freeze salaries and increase working hours. It is a victory,
but only a first step in the daunting process of reform.
The vote followed an exhaustive campaign of consultation. Mr Blanc held
hundreds of meetings with staff and union representatives to drive home his
message that Air France must reform to survive. It also reflected the plight
of the state-owned carrier. Losses last year are estimated at FFr7.5bn
(Dollars 1.28bn) while total debts stand at about FFr38bn. 'Many of the
staff believe this may be the last chance for Air France,' said an official
of Force Ouvriere, the airline's largest union.
The result will strengthen Mr Blanc's hand as he seeks to push through the
reforms he believes are necessary for the survival of Air France. But the
implications spread beyond the fate of the airline.
The successful outcome of the referendum suggests that it may be possible to
implement reform in France, after a series of government climbdowns in the
face of protests had suggested otherwise. Mr Blanc's triumph could also
encourage other state-owned companies to appeal directly to employees in an
attempt to overcome union opposition. Concerned by the prospect, the
opposition Socialist party yesterday warned of the risks involved in
weakening union intermediaries.
On the part of the government, the relief is clear. Last October's turmoil
at Air France set the precedent for government concessions to fishermen
protesting against cheap imports and, more damagingly, to students demanding
the scrapping of a new law which undercut the minimum wage for young
apprentices. Rejection of the rescue plan at Air France, which Mr Blanc said
would prompt his resignation, could have pushed the company into bankruptcy
and presented Mr Balladur with the most serious problem of his
administration.
Mr Bernard Bosson, transport minister, said he was 'delighted by the
decision'. He described it as an endorsement of the Balladur method of
seeking reforms through consensus and praised Mr Blanc's strategy of
negotiations with staff and their representatives.
Not surprisingly, the verdict of Air France's staff prompted less
celebration among trade unions. The communist Confederation Generale du
Travail, condemned the referendum and its result. 'This is not the solution
to Air France's problems,' said one official.
Some union groups expressed satisfaction with the result. Force Ouvriere
which, unlike the CGT, signed the rescue package, declared the result of the
referendum a victory for itself as well as for Air France. 'Exceptional
situations require exceptional methods,' said Mr Marc Blondel, the union's
general secretary.
For all of the airline's unions, however, the referendum suggests that they
have become the followers rather than the leaders of the workforce they
represent. Last October, they were caught wrong-footed by the depth of
opposition to Mr Attali's plan. 'We were surprised by the strength of
feeling,' admits Mr Francois Cabrera of the CFDT, the third biggest union.
Mr Blanc exploited this situation through the use of a referendum, the
biggest ever held in a French company. By appealing directly to the
workforce the chairman has outflanked the eight of the airline's 14 unions
which refused to sign the restructuring package. He has also cleared the way
for a government capital injection of FFr20bn over the next three years. Mr
Balladur had made staff acceptance of the recovery package a condition for
releasing state aid.
Celebrations at Air France and the government, and obituaries for Mr Blanc's
union opponents, may, however, prove premature. If Mr Blanc has won a
battle, he is still a long way from winning the war. He must now negotiate
with employees and union representatives about how to implement his
restructuring package and attain his goal of a 30 per cent increase in
productivity by the end of 1997. Union resistance cannot be discounted. CFDT
yesterday warned Mr Blanc against believing he would now have a 'state of
grace'.
The subsidies promised by the French government must also be cleared by the
European Commission. More broadly, the question remains whether Mr Blanc's
proposed remedies are sufficient to turn it around. 'We have the hardest
part still to do,' said Mr Blanc, after announcing the referendum result.
The next hurdle for Mr Blanc's rescue plan lies in Brussels. The European
Commission is already investigating a FFr1.5bn capital increase for Air
France, which was raised through a bond issue taken up last year by the
Caisse des Depots, the state-owned financial institution. This sum pales
beside the amount currently proposed.
Air France's rivals are expected to mount a campaign against the new
injection of state aid. But most observers believe it will ultimately be
approved, even if it requires concessions such as increased access to the
French market for foreign carriers. 'I can't see Brussels refusing the
capital,' says Mr Bertrand d'Yvoire, president of Consultair, the
Paris-based aviation consultancy.
This view was supported yesterday following talks in Paris between Mr Abel
Matutes, European transport commissioner, and Mr Balladur. After the
meeting, Mr Matutes said he was optimistic that agreement could be reached,
but he linked approval of the package to liberalisation of the French
market.
The capital injection is a necessary but not a sufficient condition of
recovery. Mr Blanc now has to implement his plan and fill in the blanks of
the framework agreement approved in the referendum. Some specific proposals
have already been advanced. The airline's fleet, for example, is to be
reduced from 166 to 149 aircraft over the next five years. Assets, including
the Meridien hotel chain, are to be sold to raise cash and strengthen the
balance sheet. But other elements of the plan, such as the job cuts, have
yet to be clearly defined.
Many industry observers believe the measures should also be extended. 'The
plan is a good first step, but it will have to go further,' said Mr
d'Yvoire.
Mr Blanc is aware of the need for fundamental reform. He has outlined plans
to divide the group into separate profit centres to increase accountability.
He has also said he will move to eliminate inefficiencies in the operation
of the company's fleet. The airline's services to Hong Kong, for example,
use three different types of aircraft, requiring long staff stopovers on the
island.
The problem for Mr Blanc is that time is against him. Air France's main
rivals long ago realised the need to increase efficiency and are unlikely to
stand still in the run-up to the liberalisation of the European airline
market. At the same time, Mr Blanc must be careful not to alienate his staff
by forcing the pace of reform.
The Air France chairman can take some encouragement from signs of
improvement in the airline market. The company's load factor  - the ratio of
passengers to seats  - also rose to 72 per cent in the first quarter this
year, from 63 per cent in the same period in 1993. 'The trend will ease the
pressure, but he certainly can't count on that alone for recovery,' said an
industry observer.
Mr Blanc is unlikely to. After his success in the referendum he is already
preparing for the next round of negotiations with staff and union
representatives. Monday's victory makes his task easier, but it will be a
long time before he can open the champagne to drink with his cigar.

FT  13 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU key to Ukraine's independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr VIACHESLAV SKRYGHIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We wholeheartedly support Ian Davidson's call ('Russia policy is
vital', March 30) for a comprehensive and definitive policy on the part of
the European Union towards extending its sphere of influence eastwards.
While Davidson acknowledges, but excludes, territories of the former Soviet
Union in his argument for expanding EU influence in central and eastern
Europe, we in Ukraine foresee the impact such influence might have on our
own development and we encourage its growth.
Ukraine, currently seeking to define its political identity, has been
straddling a course between east and west. While we cannot deny that
Russia's influence will predominate for some time, those of us who encourage
a western orientation to Ukraine's future understand that extending EU
influence to our borders will help propel Ukraine toward true independence
from its eastern neighbour.
Therefore, EU expansion to the east will help balance possible Russian
aggression in Ukraine's political and economic development and Ukrainian
acquiescence to its powerful force.
We understand the geopolitical difficulties and complexities currently faced
by both the EU and the US in formulating a policy towards Russia and its
former republics which meets western interests without antagonising a still
powerful political giant.
Nevertheless, we cannot help but believe that the integration of the Soviet
Union's former satellites into the EU is the first step towards ensuring
Ukraine's independent future.

FT  13 APR 94 / Rethink in the west: Recession is not to blame for all the
strains on democratic institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public speculation over the future of UK Prime Minister John Major has
become so obsessive that politics in Britain seems to have been reduced to
the single question: can he stay or must he go?
The trouble is that this preoccupation with the person of Mr Major distracts
attention from bigger issues. The proverbial visitor from Mars may perhaps
conclude that he is to blame for all the woes of the British Conservative
party. But there may be systemic causes which are not peculiar to the UK,
and which will not be cured by the replacement of the Conservative party
leader. The personal shortcomings of the UK prime minister need no further
demonstration; but they are surely not the whole of the story.
Throughout the western world, democratic governments are under stress if not
actually under siege. Look at what happened to the Liberal Democratic party
in Japan, or to the Conservative party in Canada; look at what happened to
the entire political system in Italy; look at the results of December's
elections in Russia. And everywhere there is widespread popular alienation
and disillusionment with the institutions of government.
There is no mistaking the anxiety this is causing the political classes of
Europe. Last week UK and German politicians, civil servants and academics
held their annual Konigswinter conference. Their chosen title, Democracy on
Trial, was in part an allusion to the tribulations of Russia and eastern
Europe: democracy in those countries is on trial because it is unfamiliar.
But the earnest debaters from Germany and Britain were also concerned with
the stresses on democracy in western Europe: social alienation, crime,
racism, xenophobia and the perceived failure of political parties and public
institutions.
There is a ready-made explanation for these troubles which is always trotted
out: European countries have been going through, and many are still in, the
worst recession in recent memory; the result is high unemployment; so no
wonder governments are unpopular.
The unstated implication of this is that present problems are mainly
cyclical: growth will return as it always has; unemployment will go down
again; and governments will recover their popularity. This is monumental
Mikawberism.
Current unemployment surely owes as much to massive restructuring as to
deficient demand, and we have no reason to assume this process will come to
rest on a new plateau of stable growth and secure employment any time soon.
On the contrary, it seems more probable that we have entered a new global
industrial revolution. This means a far-reaching process of economic
transformation, with dislocations to our social structures which may be just
as severe as those of the first industrial revolution.
If so, our democratic institutions are going to be severely challenged. When
the Russians emerged from the deep freeze of authoritarianism, western
governments told them firmly that free market reforms and democracy must go
together, and instantly. Comfortable liberals applauded this double
prescription; but no one should have been surprised that both bits of it
have started badly.
As a matter of fact, the lesson of European history tells a different story.
The first industrial revolution, with all its attendant social miseries,
preceded full democracy in Britain by about 100 years. If the sequence of
events had been the other way round, the electorate might have had a word to
say about the social effects of the industrial revolution.
Now the wheel has come full circle. For the past 50 years, the heart of the
social compact has been that governments, on both sides of the political
divide, would deliver prosperity and jobs. Today, governments no longer dare
claim to be able to deliver these things. Instead they have a new message,
which remains discreetly subliminal: 'This is not our problem; this is a
matter which we simply must leave to the markets.' Unfortunately, the
corrosive effect of the free market is so powerful that it dissolves the
social compact.
Opposition parties are just as mute on this central issue as the
governments. In the UK, Mr John Smith's Labour party keeps such a low
profile that it is hard to imagine what his policies would be. In Germany,
the top priority of Mr Rudolf Scharping's Social Democratic party seems to
be to reassure the world that it is almost the same as the ruling CDU of Mr
Helmut Kohl. In France, the Gaullists swept to power on a tide of hope that
they must be able to do better for the economy than the Socialists. But a
year later those hopes are sinking, while the discredited Socialists are
still trying to think of something to say.
In other words, the new industrial revolution may involve a rewriting of the
agenda of government in western democracies. The global economy may mean
that national prosperity slips out of the grasp of national governments; so
what will political parties promise instead? Law and order, and repression
of unemployed criminal classes? Exclusion of foreigners and xenophobia?
Nationalist populism? Regional separatism? Patronage for their clients?
What is happening in Italy suggests that the answer to all these questions
is yes. But perhaps the liberal ideologues, who knew exactly what the
Russians ought to do, should turn their certainty to western problems. Let
them devise a party platform for a programme of national government in a
western country beset by the new industrial revolution; and while they are
about it, let them devise an alternative platform for a different programme
of government, since parliamentary democracy requires an opposition as well
as a government.

FT  13 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: New technology for Channel 5 not in
viewers' interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN HOWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The letter by Richard Norman of the British Radio and Electronic
Equipment Manufacturers Association (April 8) said that manufacturers do not
want Channel 5, which could be on air next year, to use 'existing
technology'. He proposes a new digital technology which is not yet available
and which cannot be received on existing TV sets. This is not surprising,
since his members gain if viewers have to buy new sets. But it is not in the
viewers' interests.
He gives no evidence as to why the existing technology in every TV set,
video, etc, is no good. He just says that it has been overtaken by other
technology. It has not. Everyone's analogue TV set should last a long time.
His approach smacks of interventionism of a high order, with an echo of the
European Union's failed attempt to impose the Mac standards, which BREMA
backed, on satellite broadcasters. Modern communications policy should not
be based on the manufacturers' desire to make things.
Mr Norman is highly optimistic about digital broadcasting. But I doubt
anyone will be broadcasting digital TV terrestrially in 'three to five
years'. Anyway, it would take many years for digital to reach the kind of
coverage that Channel 5 will have from day one.
He says digital technology will bring 'six to eight channels'. Fine. Anybody
who wants six to eight channels now, or indeed 16 to 18, can get them from
the Astra satellite.
Channel 5 offers extra choice on existing TV sets. I am sorry to disappoint
the manufacturers, but that is what the viewer prefers.

FT  13 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Suggested route a competitive
cul-de-sac for cable operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr E P O MERCER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I rather think the route suggested in your leader 'Superhighways for
Britain' (April 7) will lead to the UK going up a competitive cul-de-sac
rather than to the establishment of choice of open roads for the consumer.
As the director general of telecommunications has clearly decided, the
future benefit of the consumer lies in having a choice of a local loop
competitor. The way to achieve this is through competition and that will not
be encouraged to grow sufficiently to be of impact soon enough, or at all,
if one begins now to rock the regulatory boat by letting BT carry
entertainment.
There are a number of public offerings under preparation which will, if they
are successful, generate considerable equity funds for the building by cable
operators of alternative local loop infrastructure in the UK.
The considerable investment already encouraged into UK cable has partly been
the function of a stable regulatory regime since 1991. Meddle with that
certainty now and you risk losing the speed with which competition will be
able to take root by making the outcome of the proposed offerings more
uncertain.
There is quite a lot BT can do before the planned 1988 review on its
carrying broadcasting. From the beginning of this month it can apply for
cable franchises in its own right, and there is a large part of the UK not
yet franchised. In any event, video-on-demand does not need the same kind of
broadcasting licence as a cable operator - at least according to the
Independent Television Commission. Certainly, home banking, shopping or
business services do not require an entertainment services licence, so what
is preventing BT developing its networks in urban areas if it thinks there
is a market for those?
There is no evidence at all that the present policies will lead to the
subsidisation by BT of new entrants; rather the opposite. New entrants may
end up subsidising BT through the access deficit contribution system.
As, increasingly, the new entrants go on to put fibre in the ground in the
UK, Mr Heseltine need not worry about Britain losing its competitive edge -
he should be more concerned about the competition being strangled at birth
than of BT losing the odd appendage.

FT  13 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Simplistic polemic is no answer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Dunkley's article, 'Nature, nurture and nastiness' (April
9/10), is symptomatic of a distressing journalistic tendency, increasingly
in evidence even in quality newspapers such as yours, to engage in sophism
under the misapprehension that it makes good copy.
Nobody, be they 'expert' or simply possessed of an ordinary degree of common
sense, would argue that video nasties cause violent crime, which is entirely
the thrust of Mr Dunkley's argument.
The opinion offered by Professor Elizabeth Newson and her cohort of
'experts' (and undoubtedly shared by many of those lesser mortals possessed
of the common sense just referred to) is that there is probably a link
between the two.
An article that attempted to change this opinion by use of reasoned
argument, backed up by cogent supporting research, would be both interesting
and informative, as well as adding to the quality of debate on what is an
important point. To read a simplistic polemic that takes as its starting
point an entirely false premise does not have these (or any other) benefits.

FT  13 APR 94 / Arts: Libraries go up for grabs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Would you like to run a library? If the idea appeals, Brent, the north
London council, would be delighted to hear from you. Over the next few weeks
it is advertising for bookish entrepreneurs to take over two of its
libraries, Preston and Kingsbury.
It is one of the first concrete consequences of the government's
determination to put the running of libraries out to competitive tender.
Brent has embraced the idea with enthusiasm and will give the winner of the
contract around Pounds 200,000 a year to cover the wages of the dozen or so
library staff, who come with the package, and for acquiring stock.
The idea is that the new owner, who will have five years to exploit the
libraries, will energise the operation, drawing in new customers and
increasing their approval. He, or she, will have to offer a free book
service, but there is money to be made from renting out CDs and videos, or
exploiting the premises to set up a book shop, cafe, or art gallery.
Frank Quigg, director of Arts and Libraries in Brent, is a great enthusiast
for letting in market forces, and the 12 libraries in the borough have
already been turned into independent fiefdoms, with managers, the new name
for librarians, in control of the budgets. According to Quigg this has
increased customer numbers by 25 per cent and reduced annual running costs
from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 6m, mainly through shedding 70 administrative
posts at the Town Hall.
It has also improved the service. The main Willesden Green Library, for
example, opened on Sundays in the run up to the summer exams, and other
libraries offer story-telling sessions aimed at one parent families. But
until now the libraries have remained under ultimate Brent control. Over the
next year or so all the libraries will be put out to tender, usually in
groupings of two.
The problem is that no commercial operators have run a local library service
before. Quigg is making a play for book shops, for management consultancy
groups, for retired librarians, for leisure companies, for anyone.
He admits that there is little profit to be made from Preston and Kingsbury
Libraries at the moment, but Kingsbury is scheduled to relocate into a new
leisure complex, complete with swimming pool, restaurant and retail outlets,
which should boost its current 79,000 clients considerably. And, most
interesting of all to prospective investors, the government is committed to
making compulsory competitive tendering a way of life. These two north Brent
branch libraries could be the pilot study for a great new market leader, UK
Libraries Ltd, operating throughout the land.
Quigg also admits that the most obvious winner of the first public
competition will be the existing staff of the two libraries, who are putting
together proposals. They have chosen to operate as an autonomous company
while staying as council employees. But if Waterstones, or First Leisure, or
Price Waterhouse shows an interest Brent might be tempted. After all, it is
the bid which is both feasible and economical that will win the contract.
There will be worries that any new management at the libraries will play
down its mandatory role, issuing books for free, in favour of money making
propositions. The council's determination to regulate its tenant may not be
as great as its desire for the experiment to succeed.
A much bigger concern is that compulsory competitive tendering in the
library service is a wheeze of the current government, which has selected
sympathetic councils to try it out, but it is much opposed by the Labour
Party. On May 5 Brent goes to the polls, but Quigg believes that if Labour
does take control it will let the pilot scheme go ahead. Re-establishing
strong central control over the libraries would be costly and unpopular.
So at the moment anyone can play with the idea of running a library; just
send suggestions to Brent.

FT  13 APR 94 / Arts: A beautiful baritone - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nathan Berg wields, at the moment, a remarkably beautiful baritone voice. I
put it that way not because he faces some imminent risk, but because this
Canadian singer - from Saskatchewan, like Jon Vickers - is only 25 years
old. Like all the most promising voices these days, Berg's has been trained
up (at Banff, Aspen, Versailles and the Guildhall School) to a precociously
serious level of interpretation. Unlike most, he still boasts a richly
'natural' timbre: vital, warm-blooded, affecting and stirring.
There is no telling where well-schooled vocal art takes over from the
born-lucky instrument. Equally, however, there is no knowing whether the
youthful bloom will mature into another kind of appeal or just fade away,
leaving a duller ring behind. Think of Olaf Baer . . .] 'At the moment',
then, Berg's singing should give intense pleasure to any (Western) lover of
the human voice.
The glory of his true baritone lies now in his middle voice, plangent and
splendidly direct, with a solid, satisfying complement toward the bass end.
Remarks overheard during the interval at the Wigmore Hall on Monday
suggested that he is really a bass-baritone. Not so: the tessitura of real
bass-baritone stuff lies rather below Berg's most vibrant range.
Nevertheless, his top notes do not open easily yet - though in soft
head-voice he produced lovely sounds, seamlessly matched to his virile
mid-register.
He chose an eminently serious programme: familiar Brahms, lusty Richard
Strauss and Mahler's Ruckert Lieder, but also Wolf's dark Michelangelo
songs, Schoeck and Jacques Ibert, and some unfavoured Duparc. Though his
German and his French were irreproachable, fluent beyond mere phonetics, the
sense of each song's burden remained a bit general; we wanted more phrases
lit up immediately and spontaneously.
Berg likes generous room to expand in, where swifter concision might strike
better sparks in him. He needed a less subservient accompanist than Julius
Drake - excellent in Ibert, but otherwise too languid for his singer's good,
and tediously indulgent with epilogues - to chivvy him along. Nothing
concentrates an interpreter's mind like having to make his effects register
in a limited space.

FT  13 APR 94 / Arts: 'Rope' regains its reputation - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Patrick Hamilton (1904-62) wrote Rope in 1929, a psychological thriller
braided into social comedy, taut and tense at the close. Hitchcock's bad
1948 film damaged the play, but not so Keith Baxter's excellent revival, now
at Wyndhams Theatre after opening at the Chichester Festival last year.
From the crashing discords and complete darkness, the play makes compulsive
viewing. Stage time and theatre time are identical. Hamilton gives us two
and half hours in the life of two Oxford undergraduates, Brandon and
Granillo, who have just murdered their friend Ronald. The opening - three
naked men, one dead - gives way to a wonderful scene in total darkness, the
actors detected only by their glowing cigarettes. It has the nerviness of
Macbeth, post-Duncan, and the scariness of Psycho, pre-shower.
The murder is a crime of vanity. Brandon and Granillo hide the body in a
chest, throw a tablecloth over it, and invite the victim's father, aunt and
assorted friends to dinner: 'You sit at the head.' But Rupert, a louche
free-thinking poet, begins to suspect. Before Brandon and Granillo can make
off to Oxford with the body, Rupert confronts them, and wrings a confession.
Will the free thinker enjoy the thrill of a healthy crime, too? Will he blow
the whistle?
Hamilton's writing is everywhere poised, the stage directions punctilious:
'He responds vaguely, as one who has only half understood'. But he also
makes psychological sense of the 'foul, lewd and infamous jest', like a good
Jacobean horror. The play moves the thriller genre into drama, but does so
by avoiding the whodunit mystery formula, because the murderers are
flaunting their crime. Here, every word comes out of the dramatic situation
on stage.
The direction (Keith Baxter) serves the purpose exactly. Each time new
information arrives, the situation and therefore the characters change.
Simon Higlett's set, skewed and twisted, keeps the intimacy of the original
three-sided production at Chichester; at the Wyndhams, real life comes and
goes through the door at the back of the stage, making the rest of the
theatre into a big conspiracy. The subtle lighting (Bill Bray) changes only
when the actors change it. The acting of the three principals keeps to the
changing subtleties of Hamilton's plot. They maintain a delicate triangle of
power, passion and guilt. Tristan Gemmill as Brandon finds bluster and
assertiveness in the character, while the surlier Granillo (James Buller)
drinks his way into a crisis of nerve.
Anthony Head as Rupert is all fancy and frolic, a cynical creature already
world-weary and bored, but witty enough to know it. On the ten commandments:
'Of course I honour my parents. I send them a telegram of congratulations
each year on my birthday.' The murderers will hang on his word. His is
decadence forced into moral standards by a specific case. Head has this
character pinned down: fiddling, twitching, clumsy at dinner but deft in
conversation.
Around him the rest of the cast twitter through the dinner party and leave
when they should. Richard Warwick as the victim's father adds gravitas while
Dawn Keeler as his aunt removes it. In all, a fine ensemble performance, and
a reminder that Hamilton's reputation - he wrote Gaslight and Hangover
Square - should hang on more than Rope.
At the Wyndhams Theatre

FT  13 APR 94 / Arts: Final act for the man of drama - Television
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Once upon a time David Mercer could have been a contender for the title of
'Best Television Dramatist' but he died before we could ever be sure of what
his best might be. Today the only person who could compete with Dennis
Potter for the title is Edgar Reitz, creator of Heimat, yet his strength
lies in narrative and historical span. Reitz's work is literal and
ultra-realistic. Potter stands alone and supreme as the man who has mastered
television and shown it to be a medium which can challenge print, theatre
and cinema in the exploration not only of the human condition but of the
mind. I consider The Singing Detective to be the greatest piece of original
fiction ever created for television: Proustian in its detail, astonishing in
its originality, superbly entertaining.
Last week Potter came before us in the most extraordinary television
programme - an 85 minute edition of Without Walls on Channel 4 - to say that
he is dying of cancer, expects to be dead within weeks, but is surviving on
a diet of liquid vitamins, morphine and cigarettes. He is racing the clock
and the angel of death to complete two television dramas, one for the BBC,
the other for Channel 4, one about cryogenics, the other about virtual
reality, which he sees as closely connected and which he hopes will each be
shown on the originating channel and then repeated on the other. The awful,
and in a way wonderful, thing about this unique interview (Melvyn Bragg at
his best) was that, despite moments of strain, Potter looked better and even
sounded happier than he has seemed for years. Is there really no hope that
he might survive? He has been embattled so many times and overcome so much
that we look to him for the sort of miracles that have been at the centre of
much of his work.
Friday nights now bring two modern American animated cartoon series to
British television: Beavis And Butt-Head is screened at 11.35 on Channel 4
and The Ren And Stimpy Show at 12.40 on BBC2. Midnight is not usually
considered cartoon time, but both these series have been criticised for
their violence and their potentially bad influence on children. Of course
cartoons have always attracted such strictures: Betty Boop (b. 1915) was too
sexy, Tom and Jerry (b. 1937) too violent. What really sets these new
American offerings aside from their predecessors is that they are utterly
charmless. Last Friday's Ren And Stimpy was a pointless story about selling
rubber nipples. The funniest line in 30 minutes was 'The Lord loves a
hanging, that's why he gave us necks'. Beavis And Butt-Head are American
teenage boys who ogle the female talent on the pop video network MTV (much
of which fills up the time in the cartoon) going 'Whooorrr] Loogadat]' every
time there is a glimpse of breast or thigh. The funniest thing about it is
the pretence that this might, somehow, be seen as social satire. Neither
series has a trace of talent. You would need to be a very backward teenager
to be amused by either.
The demand for 'good news' programmes is wrong headed. We could certainly do
with more positive items within the existing news programmes, but the idea
of bulletins announcing how many houses did not burn down yesterday is a
dead loss. If your real aim is the feel-good factor then what you need is
more programmes like The Young Musician Of The Year. The final on Sunday
provided three hours of inspiration and sheer pleasure. The young talent on
display was astounding - not only among the soloists but from the members of
the National Youth Orchestra who played for nearly three hours without ever
sounding like a 'youth' orchestra. The right competitor won, Natalie Clein's
performance of the Elgar Cello Concerto owing nothing to the so often
overwhelming presence of the shade of Jacqueline du Pre. Somehow you knew
that as they left the concert hall these teenagers would not be tearing
aerials off cars and throwing cans of lager at one another. Three cheers for
the BBC.
Getting comedians Hale and Pace to star in a police detective series is a
bit like getting Esther Rantzen to give the commentary on the Grand
National: no doubt she could take a stab at it, but why bother when Peter
O'Sullevan is so good, and Rantzen is so much better at what she already
does? Having said which, Hale and Pace are not the worst things about A
Pinch Of Snuff. This silly and unconvincing story about blue movie makers in
Harrogate has been produced by people who seem to believe in one of the most
famous of the modern urban myths: 'snuff movies'. The assertion is that in
some violent films the victims really are killed for the sake of the
cameras, though nobody has ever actually identified one, of course. Here the
idea is not a genuine death but - wait for it - a genuine broken jaw (hence
a pinch of snuff, presumably). It sounds so ludicrous that those who did not
watch it may suspect this is really just another comedy vehicle for Hale and
Pace. Would that it were.
Those who used to doubt whether women could ever succeed as comedians must
surely have had their minds changed in the last 10 years. The roll call has
grown and grown: Maureen Lipman, Victoria Wood, Dawn French, Jennifer
Saunders, Josie Lawrence, Ruby Wax. However, while all these women are
outspoken and several are on the large side, it is not enough just to be fat
and loud-mouthed - you also have to be funny. This is a subtlety that seems
not to have filtered through to Jo Brand or those who keep on putting her on
television. Someone should have taken her gently aside after the opening
episode of Through The Cake Hole and explained that while she, in her
condition, may be reduced to near hysteria by the presence of the word
'cake' in Pontefract cakes, cow cake and Kendal Mint Cake, the rest of us
find the bare recital of such a catalogue remarkably unfunny.
The current BARB figures show the BBC with just a 40 per cent share of the
week's viewing. You have to go back to January 1985 to find a figure lower
than that (39.5) and in those days the BBC had neither EastEnders nor
Neighbours which, today, give them their top seven programmes for the week.
ITV and Channel 4 take a 52.7 share and 'Other Viewing', meaning cable and
satellite, achieves 7.3 for the second week running, a figure bettered only
once: 7.4 in August last year. The BBC is still worth the licence fee three
times over, but it is as well to keep an eye on such matters.

When people write 'I'm not a prude but ..' I mentally excise the negative
and change 'but' to 'and'. When BBC2 launches a series called The Net (8.00)
and co-presenter Susan Rae claims 'It's certainly not just for computer
buffs' similar instincts emerge. We are told this will be a magazine
programme roaming the information super-highway, reporting on the vital part
computers play in our lives.
Dispatches continues the investigation into Russian red mercury which it
began last year. Now they are saying that Russian scientists have used the
substance not only to build a smaller and more efficient nuclear warhead but
also to make a miniature neutron bomb which uses fusion and is therefore not
subject to the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (9.00 C4).
You have probably heard of the Birdman Of Alcatraz whose story is told in
the 1962 movie, repeated at 11.45 (BBC1). But what about the Fishman Of
Saughton Gaol? QED reports on Alex Torbet who was sentenced to life in 1979
for murder and, while serving his time, has become an expert on fish
breeding (9.30 BBC1).

FT  13 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: A freight train out of control
 -Without radical reform of Superfund legislation in the US, the prospects
for insurers are bleak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pollution and asbestos claims could become a 'black hole' for the US
insurance industry unless big changes are made to the 'Superfund' laws, AM
Best, the US insurance and analysis and rating agency, warns.
But a new report* estimates that insurance companies will need to reserve
Dollars 260bn (Pounds 180bn) in additional funds to meet their exposure to
environmental and asbestos claims over the next 15 to 20 years.
To finance that bill, the insurance industry would need to set aside Dollars
132bn now (the present-day value of future payments before allowing for
interest earnings), an amount equal to nearly three-quarters of its
shareholders' funds - compared with some Dollars 12.5bn in reserves and an
estimated Dollars 20bn paid out in claims so far.
'It is hard to overstate the potential extent of the environmental and
asbestos liability problem for the insurance industry,' says the report's
author, John Snyder, a senior vice president at Best.
If most US court decisions go in favour of insurers, the amount needed to be
set aside for the future could fall to Dollars 55bn, Best says. Equally,
however, if court cases go against the industry, total reserves would need
to rise to Dollars 623bn.
'Environmental liability, both Superfund liability and all other hazardous
waste liability, represents the single largest threat to the property and
casualty insurance industry's financial health for the next several
decades,' Snyder adds.
The amounts involved represent an increase on frequently cited figures
prepared by Tillinghast, the actuarial and consultancy group, in 1990.
Tillinghast estimated net liabilities for the insurance industry of between
Dollars 37bn and Dollars 426bn over a similar time period.
Best says that while 'enough consensus has developed in Washington on how to
reform Superfund', under which the US federal government can order industry
to clean up some 36,000 identified polluted sites, the report assumes that
reforms are likely to be insufficient to help insurers.
Proposals unveiled by the Clinton administration in February envisage
extensive amendment of the Superfund regime. They centre on a reduction of
legal expenses - which account for about one-third of all Superfund-related
costs - but do not propose any change to the 'polluter pays' principle nor
any modification of the principle of retroactive liability. The US Congress
is hearing submissions on the issue, including alternative proposals put
forward by an alliance linking sectors of the insurance and chemical
industries.
Snyder does not rule out the prospect of reform but says that it 'is not out
of the question that nothing will happen' and that the Superfund legislation
will be reauthorised later this year.
Without fundamental reform, however, the report makes clear that the
prospects for insurers are bleak. 'This is a freight train bearing down the
tracks out of control. As time goes on it will become a bigger and bigger
problem, threatening industry solvency,' it says.
By the middle of last year, only about 1,270 of the most polluted sites had
been placed on a 'national priority list'. Of these only 149 - or 11.7 per
cent - had been cleaned up by September 1992. The cost of cleaning up each
site is - on average - Dollars 31m.
According to Best, the EPA indicates that the number of priority sites will
grow to 2,100 by 2000, although several independent observers believe the
list could balloon to 10,000 or more over the next several decades.
'Just the clean-up cost of these sites could skyrocket to Dollars 50bn or
Dollars 750bn, depending on the ultimate number of the sites to be cleaned
and the stringency of the clean-up,' says the report.
These estimates do not include the costs of litigation and other
transactions, 'the potentially enormous costs of bodily injury and property
damage lawsuits and natural-resource damage claims'.
The companies most vulnerable are those that underwrote comprehensive
general liability (CGL) policies - which insure against legal awards to
third parties - from the 1950s to the 1980s.
US courts have frequently ruled that companies ordered to clean up can claim
on their CGL policies. US insurers introduced exclusion clauses on these
policies in 1973, restricting coverage to 'sudden and accidental' pollution.
This was intended to remove coverage for gradual pollution caused, for
example, by leakages. In 1985, the companies withdrew coverage for all
pollution from CGL policies.
The report also paints a gloomy picture of the insurance industry's exposure
to asbestos-related claims. It says that only 50 per cent of the total
claims linked to asbestos - claims paid to victims of asbestosis,
mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases - have so far emerged.
With new claims from workers suffering from asbestos-related diseases being
filed at the rate of 50 to 60 a day, the agency estimates that insurers may
ultimately need to add an extra Dollars 20bn to reserves, bringing the cost
of asbestos liability, past and future, to Dollars 40bn.
In response to both sets of exposures, insurers have steadily increased the
amounts paid into their reserves since 1990. The sum of Dollars 2.2bn was
added during 1990, Dollars 2.6bn in 1991 and Dollars 3.6bn in 1992. The
amount increased to Dollars 4.3bn in 1993, partially because of the
introduction of new accounting rules which made it more difficult for most
companies that actively underwrote CGL policies during the 1960s, 1970s, and
1980s to report zero liability for environmental claims in their annual
accounts.
Best refuses to specify which insurers are most exposed, arguing that
'determination requires greater analysis and discussions with company
managements'.
The agency insists on the need for extensive reform. 'This problem has
escalated beyond anyone's wildest expectations. It just can't be tinkered
with and fine-tuned,' says Snyder.

FT  13 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: Plan of gentle persuasion -
Worldwide wast / France prefers the voluntary route to pollution control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France has set itself ambitious goals for dealing with industrial and
household waste, but in many cases hopes to meet them by voluntary means.
The rising cost of waste treatment, however, raises the possibility that the
government may have to use more compulsion.
For instance, perhaps because it attracts more tourists than any other
country in the world, France aims to stop, by 2002, using landfills to bury
anything except 'ultimate' waste that has already been reduced to a minimum
by some previous treatment. In theory, this will mean the closure of more
than 6,000 landfills.
The reality may be different, however. The country's 95 'departments' are
first supposed to draw up plans to eliminate household waste, while France's
22 regional authorities are due to do the same for industrial waste. But
they are not exactly rushing to assume these tasks, for which they will have
to bear most of the financial burden.
The environment ministry puts the cost of investing in alternatives to
traditional landfills at FFr40bn (Pounds 4.7bn) with about a tenth of this
being met from a FFr20 levy on each tonne of buried waste. But others
believe the eventual investment will be more than FFr100bn, requiring at
least a big increase in the levy on waste-producing companies.
Apart from some 400m tonnes of easily-disposable or re-useable waste from
the country's big farm and food sector, France produces:
Household waste amounting to 20m tonnes a year. Only 8 per cent is now
treated by composting (difficult because the organic waste needs to sifted
out from the rest), while an increasing proportion (41 per cent) is burnt.
At present, the rest ends up in landfills.
Some 6m tonnes of household waste comes from packaging. The government has
said that by 2003, some 75 per cent of packaging material should be
recovered and recycled, but in sharp contrast to Germany it has left this
largely to business initiative. Led by BSN, the food group, several thousand
companies have formed a group called Eco-Emballages. Member companies are
allowed to place a green dot on their products to inform consumers that the
products will be recycled, and they pay a small levy on each product sold to
help make this recycling possible.
But so far Eco-Emballages' operation is small-scale, spending some FFr180m
over three years to finance 37 pilot projects in collecting and sorting
packaging waste. 'We did not want to follow the Germans in immediately
ordering the recovery of all packaging waste, and then not knowing what to
do with it all and having to ship it to other countries,' says Christian
Desachy, the environment ministry's director on waste.
In another voluntary move, France's environment and aid ministers launched a
campaign to encourage the French, who tend to get far too many pills from
over-prescribing doctors, to return to their local chemists unused
medicines. Their containers will be recycled by the drug industry, while
their contents will go to the third world.
Industrial waste of some 147m tonnes a year. Some 7m tonnes is considered
hazardous, requiring special treatment. On average, about half is dealt with
by manufacturers themselves. But some companies do more. Elf-Atochem, the
chemical wing of the Elf-Aquitaine oil group, treats 90 per cent of its
industrial waste, while Rhone-Poulenc treats 78 per cent of its own waste
and believes it can reach the 90 per cent level, too.
According to Alexandre Colin of the French chemical industry federation,
companies in this sector have been spending 15-20 per cent of their total
investment, and 3-4 per cent of operating costs, on reducing environmental
damage and industrial waste. Such calculations may be harder to make in the
future, says an executive for Rhone-Poulenc. By spending FFr1bn a year on
the environment, 'we at Rhone-Poulenc have done most of what we needed to do
to correct the problems of the past'. Most progress will come through
upstream investment in cleaner technology, 'and therefore environmental
investment will be harder to distinguish from ordinary investment'.
Out of waste has come jobs. FNADE, the main French federation of waste
specialist companies, has some 200 members employing 22,000 people. Some are
offshoots of the big construction and water treatment companies. Together,
they treat some 630,000 tonnes a year of industrial waste imported from
clients mainly in Germany, but also Belgium, the Netherlands and
Switzerland. However, France still sends some 3,000 tonnes a year of
untreatable potassium cyanide and arsenides residues for burial in German
salt mines.
'We have a good savoir-faire on waste, and it would be better to export this
than to import the waste itself,' says Desachy. However, as Claude Perrin,
deputy head of FNADE, points out, this is easier said than done, with France
still relying on superior incinerator technology from Germany and
Switzerland.
Next week: Hungary.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Keith Bright, 62, non-executive chairman of Electrocomponents, the
electronic, electrical and mechanical distribution group, is retiring from
the company  - but not from active business life  - after the next annual
general meeting, in July. His replacement in that post is Roy Cotterill, 58,
who spent some 25 years with GEC and is currently chairman of Vocalis.
Sir Keith, the former chairman and chief executive of LRT who resigned
following the critical report in the wake of the King's Cross fire, has also
been chairman of Brent Walker for the past 14 months. He has spent eight
years on the board of Electrocomponents, the past five as chairman on a
fixed, five-year contract, the expiry of which coincides with his
retirement. He says that his intention was always to do no more than five
years, which he regards as a 'decent stint' as the chairman of a company.
'The company had gone very wrong and my job when I came here was to change
the strategy and get things right. It had diversified into such things as
computer peripherals and lighting, away from its core businesses. I am
leaving now that things are in much better shape,' says Sir Keith.
In his time with GEC, Cotterill's posts included running the company's Far
East operations from Australia. He is also deputy chairman of Division Group
and a director of Longwall International.

FT  13 APR 94 / People: Soar - consequences of demotion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Soar has resigned as a director of Blenheim Group, the exhibitions
organiser whose share price has almost halved over the past year, five
months after he was demoted from chief executive.
Soar has been widely blamed for the collapse of Blenheim's reputation in the
City and many observers believed his final exit was only a matter of time.
'He has been in the departure lounge since last year,' said one City
analyst. It is understood that several of Blenheim's senior managers pressed
for him to go. One close observer of the company says Soar was keen to stay
on and is bitter at the way he has been treated: 'He feels that he has been
blamed for something that was not his fault.'
In November, Soar was replaced as managing director by Staffan Svenby and
demoted to the new post of director of planning and strategy.
The company's statement yesterday thanked Soar for his 'major contribution'
and wished him 'every success in the future'.
Soar was brought into Blenheim in 1990 by Neville Buch, the company's
chairman and co-founder, who was a personal friend. After a glittering
career at publishers Marshall Cavendish  - he was managing director by the
age of 25 and also found time to write books on football  - Soar had set up
his own publishing venture but was then looking for 'a new challenge'.
'It soon became clear it was a mistake,' says one observer. 'Phil turned out
to be much more at home with his computer models than as a hands-on
manager.'
These models proved Soar's undoing when they failed to predict the impact of
recession on Blenheim's important American and French operations. Analysts,
who based their forecasts on Soar's optimism, blamed him when they were
forced to slash their predictions last year.
It is thought that Soar, 46, will get Pounds 300,000 to cover the rest of
his one-year contract but will receive no further compensation.
Blenheim announced a number of other moves including the promotion of Steve
Monnington, company secretary, to director with responsibility for
developing the group's new markets in Italy and East Asia. Peter Begg, legal
director, takes over as company secretary and David Pegler becomes managing
director of Blenheim's UK business, replacing Michael Fletcher, who is
returning to the financial services industry.

FT  13 APR 94 / People: Finn takes place in Yardley saga
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yardley Lentheric, the privately-owned UK perfume and cosmetics company, has
recruited a Unilever veteran as managing director. Richard Finn was until
January head of Chesebrough Ponds of the US, a Unilever subsidiary producing
skin creams and other personal products. A Unilever man of over 30 years'
standing, he has worked in the UK, the US, France, India and Nigeria.
Finn's appointment raises a question about the direction Yardley is taking.
Although it operates internationally, Yardley is essentially a UK company,
based in Basildon in Essex. Its history is chequered: owned by the tobacco
giant BAT until 1984, it was then bought by the drugs group Beecham. In
1990, it was handed on to the US venture capitalists Wasserstein Perella.
In the same year, Wasserstein Perella bought Maybelline, a somewhat larger
US personal products company. In 1992 it floated Maybelline on the US stock
market, retaining a controlling stake. Some nine months ago, plans were
announced for Maybelline to acquire Yardley. According to Yardley, nothing
has yet been decided, though the plans remain in hand.
Where Finn will fit into the new arrangement is not yet clear. In the
meantime, Yardley chairman Randall Weisenburger  - who has been standing in
as interim managing director since last September  - says sales in 1993 were
12 per cent up on the year before.

<TEXT>
Your partner has just got a job in Hamburg and you are wondering whether you
can find work there too. You are fed up working as an architect in Rotherham
and someone suggests to you that you should practise your trade for a couple
of years in Barcelona. What do you do?
The European Commission, with its grandiose plans for monetary and political
union, has often been accused of failing the European citizen at more basic
things such as enabling freer movement of labour. From this month things
might improve.
The free movement unit, inside the Commission, has just established a
database on job vacancies in all 12 member states combined with information
about living and working conditions.
Something called Eures (the European employment services) has existed for
some years exchanging information on job vacancies between national
employment services in rather a haphazard way.
Now the service will be much more comprehensive and will be supported by a
group of 250 Euro-advisers. It will also now be possible to go on a list of
job-seekers if you are looking for work in a specific region.
Despite the gradual removal of obstacles to mobility within the EU  - most
recently the principle of mutual recognition of qualifications has been
accepted  - it is still easier in theory than in practice.
The number of EU citizens working in another EU country is only 2.5m  - 1.5
per cent of the working population  - and has been falling in recent years
as poorer countries have become richer and attracted back their former
immigrant workers.
Eures is hoping that more professional people will start to use the new
expanded service. Hitherto the greatest demand in Europe for British
employees has been for skilled manual workers, mainly in construction.

FT  13 APR 94 / Management: Does nationality really matter? - Christopher
Lorenz begins a series on ownership by looking at how several former Plessey
companies are prospering as part of Siemens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yachting enthusiasts who flock to the Isle of Wight this year will notice a
strange new structure sticking into the sky above the famous harbour town of
Cowes.
At a quick glance, it looks like a factory chimney. But perceptive visitors
will guess correctly from its silver-grey colour that it has something to do
with high technology. It is far more than that: a symbol of the rebirth of a
British company under German ownership  - the antithesis of what some people
fear could happen to the Rover car group under its new parent, BMW.
The 100ft tower is a new type of radar test facility, the first of its kind
in the world, built by what used to be part of Plessey, one of the UK's
leading electronics groups. The Cowes operation was one of several Plessey
units that were bought outright by Siemens in 1989 after Plessey was broken
up jointly  - and controversially  - by the German company and GEC,
Plessey's main domestic rival. The businesses now have joint sales of Pounds
350m, and almost 5,000 employees, more than half of whom work in research
and development.
Roger Barnes, an old Plessey hand who is director of the Cowes site  - which
forms part of the largest ex-Plessey company, now called Siemens Plessey
Electronic Systems  - has no doubts about what would have happened if the
German group had not bought the operation. 'It would have been awful,' he
says. 'One has to question whether we'd still be in business.'
His reasoning is simple: the new German parent is showing a commitment to
the former Plessey businesses, and a readiness to invest long-term, that was
all too lacking under British ownership. Siemens certainly is committed:
Electronic Systems has run a loss since 1990, although it will be back in
the black this year.
In the main, Siemens has handled the aftermath of the takeover with great
care. There have been some strains over its much more structured and
deliberate approach to management, and over various other Anglo-German
cultural differences. But, with a few exceptions, the ex-Plessey executives
are full of praise for the way their new colleagues and masters in Munich
have behaved towards them.
That behaviour has been conditioned by several things, including the lack of
virtually any overlap between Siemens' operations and those of Plessey. But
another factor has been the Germans' genuine surprise at the high level of
engineering skill which they found in Plessey. Jurgen Gehrels, the chief
executive of Siemens UK, attributes the success of several of the businesses
since the takeover to 'the ingenuity of the people, and their pragmatism'.
This combination, plus the relatively low cost of engineers in Britain  -
little more than half the German level  - has also prompted Siemens to shift
some contract research work from Germany to one of the units.
But it is the gulf between short-termism and long-term thinking that, to the
managers involved, is the single most important lesson of the takeover.
Clive Dolan, head of the whole electronic systems company, is just as
damning about his former employer as Barnes. 'What Plessey did most of the
time was respond to the City of London's need for quarterly profit
increases,' he says. 'The British electronics industry hasn't done well
globally because they've had their eyes on the wrong ball. Sensible
long-term plans were disrupted constantly by short-term considerations.'
The new Pounds 1.5m radar test tower at Cowes  - considered vital by Siemens
for all sorts of reasons  - was first proposed in Plessey days as long ago
as 1980. It was rejected, says the engineering executive at Cowes, Bob
Barton, because it could not meet Plessey's normal criterion of a two-year
payback; instead, five years was thought likely under British accounting
conventions. Under Siemens' more cautious approach, it is now expected to
take at least seven years.
'Siemens recognises that if you're serious about a market, you go into it
properly  - to win, not just to turn up at the game,' says Barnes.
The test tower is one of three key investment projects on the Cowes site
alone which owe their existence to the change in ownership.
The second is a Pounds 5m design engineering centre, which was approved just
after the takeover and finished in 1991. Under Plessey, 'we'd tried again
and again to get approval,' says Barnes. The company refused, so more and
more engineers had to be squashed into portakabins  - which Siemens
considers 'is not the way to motivate people to do good work,' as Gehrels
puts it.
To Plessey's traditional fear that such an investment might have bankrupted
the Cowes unit if orders fell off, Barnes says Siemens' reply would be 'if
you've got that sort of worry and might let the business go bust, then you
shouldn't be in it in the first place'.
The third Cowes project, which is nearing completion, is a Pounds 5m outlay
on computerised design and engineering equipment over five years. This has
given each of Cowes' 250 engineers their own computer-aided design or
engineering station; under Plessey, each machine had to be shared between
eight of them.
It is not only on capital investment that Plessey's spending was inadequate.
'Some of the businesses had not seen a penny of the company's own R&amp;D money
for years  - it only spent government funds,' says Gehrels. The rate of
internally-funded R&amp;D has been doubled since the Siemens takeover, and will
reach 15 per cent of this year's Pounds 116m total R&amp;D expenditure, itself a
third up on 1989.
Apart from Barnes' air defence business  - which has grown in spite of
government spending cuts  - the most obvious beneficiary of Siemens'
commitment to technology has been a unit which develops and makes air
traffic control and management (ATM) systems.
Run directly by Dolan until his promotion last year, the order intake of its
UK operations alone has soared from under Pounds 15m in 1989 to Pounds 131m
in 1993, taking the unit 'from nowhere to number two in Europe', according
to Dolan. That has required about Pounds 30m of investment since 1991.
'This wouldn't have happened under Plessey  - or GEC,' he stresses (he is
fiercely critical of GEC's performance in world market terms). Neither
company, he argues, would have had the commitment to building a global
market position, including the willingness to price accordingly and carry
losses for a time. Like the electronic systems company as a whole, the cost
of ATM's expansion has been a (planned) loss.
'Plessey talked about being a global player, but was amateurish,' says
Dolan. 'It was doing things on a shoestring, without any realistic
expectation that they would work.' By contrast, he says Siemens 'is a very
adult company  - very sensible and cerebral'.
Dolan's early success with the unit led Siemens in 1991 to designate his
south London base, rather than a German location, as the global headquarters
for its ATM business. In one sense, this was an obvious step, since about 80
per cent of its total ATM revenues of Pounds 180m come from the UK unit  -
including heavy exports  - with the German end very much the junior partner.
But the move was nevertheless significant for a group which still ran almost
all its business units from Germany.
An expansive man, Barnes revels in the fact that 'the degree of autonomy we
have, within approved parameters, is vastly bigger than before  - the
Germans are more fastidious, but also more trusting'.
All the same, he says takeovers are 'difficult when you've been fiercely
independent for decades'. There is some sensitivity  - tinged with
admiration  - at Cowes about Siemens' insistence on involvement in the
detail of even things such as local building decisions; Barnes says Siemens
has detailed expansion plans for each site around the world for the next 20
years or more.
Especially frustrating, says Richard Wyatt, Dolan's manufacturing director,
was Cowes' loss of a planned investment  - a Pounds 200,000 machine  - to a
Siemens factory in Belgium because he and his colleagues had not yet been
familiarised with the parent company's tough policy on duplicate
investments. 'We didn't know how to debate our corner  - we didn't sell it
properly as a core investment for us,' Wyatt says.
There were also early strains when Siemens insisted on using its usual
German consultancy on a British cost-reduction project. Language problems
and other difficulties produced a set of faulty recommendations. Now, things
are different: on a current productivity exercise, Siemens has not insisted
on uniformity, and Wyatt and his colleagues have selected a consultancy
themselves.
Such strains would have been lessened, says Barnes, if Siemens had moved
more quickly to get him, Dolan and all their colleagues over to Germany for
an 'inter-cultural training' course with their opposite numbers. 'It would
have avoided a lot of difficulties  - ways of approaching things that were
180 degrees apart,' he says.
In the event, such a course was held a full three years after the takeover,
in late 1992. It certainly broke the remaining ice. Dolan recalls that it
showed the British thought the Germans were honest but intolerant, while the
Germans thought the British were intolerant and not overtly honest: they
said one thing, but meant something else.
Anyone familiar with Anglo-German differences will recognise these as
standard stereotypes  - but accurate ones. Yet that recognition is of no
practical help to two companies striving hard to work together  - even if,
as with Siemens, German executives are tolerant enough to break into their
colleagues' language whenever the need arises. To Dolan's embarrassment,
this still happens even when there is just one Briton in the room with 20
Germans. Wyatt admits that 'not enough of us have found time to do a total
immersion course. We need to  - it's critical'.
Dolan, who already speaks goodish German, is taking further lessons. 'One
observes that all Siemens' main board directors are German,' he observes
wryly.
The second article in the series will appear next Wednesday.

FT  13 APR 94 / Recruitment: Carnage of chiefs in Tecs battle is leading to
new tactics - A fledgling sector is demanding skills that are rare in the
present climate of public and private polarisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norman Stoller, chairman of a successful, rapidly growing company, admits he
made a mistake last year in the selection of a new chief executive for the
training and enterprise council of which he is the non-executive chairman.
'We chose the wrong man,' says Stoller, whose employer-led Tec, in Oldham,
Lancashire, will next month begin advertising the post again.
Oldham Tec is not alone, however, in having trouble recruiting the chief
executives who provide the day-to-day management of Tecs, which are
responsible for administering budgets of more than Pounds 2bn a year
delivering government funded training and fostering enterprise in their
localities.
Figures disclosed this week by the Department of Employment show that since
April 1990, when the first Tecs were set-up by the department, 35 of the
original 82 chief executives have left their posts.
It is an extraordinarily high level of turnover, probably unmatched by any
sector. Some have been sacked by their boards, others have left by mutual
consent. A substantial number, about 20, who were on secondment from the
civil service have returned to the Department of Employment.
In some cases, appointment of successors has been controversial. At Kent
Tec, for example, the local county council pulled out of talks on merging
its economic development unit with the Tec because its candidate was
unsuccessful for the chief executive's job.
Commentators on Tecs might conclude that the part-time volunteers who form
Tec boards  - mostly senior executives  - have exercised poor judgment in
their selection processes of the individuals who many believe are critical
to the success of any Tec. Can they do any better in the future?
In time, as they are able to give greater consideration to the sort of
management style they want, is the conclusion of the rash of management and
recruitment consultants who are currently working with Tecs.
For the job of chief executive of a Tec, as with a number of jobs that are
emerging in bodies such as NHS Hospital Trusts, has no role model. These new
jobs, which are growing in number and which have been specifically targeted
by a host of recruitment agencies and newspaper advertisements, require both
the commercial skills of the private sector and knowledge and sensitivity as
to how the public sector works.
Because they are spending public money, recruits must also expect opprobrium
if they demand a luxury car and a high salary. Yet, at the same time they
will be asked to demonstrate excellent interpersonal skills.
Mr David Howells, an independent management consultant, who has worked
extensively with Tecs, says: 'The specification is truly demanding. Tec
boards need to recruit the Archangel Gabriel, or one of his key henchman, to
do the job. There are a number of people who are truly effective, but their
numbers are limited.'
An advertisement placed this week for such a Pounds 55,000 a year post at
Hertfordshire Tec says 'ideally, candidates will combine sound management
experience in industry and commerce, together with public sector experience,
which includes dealing with government departments and agencies'.
It is a mixture that is rarely found in the private sector, except perhaps
the defence industry, from which some of the most successful chief
executives have been drawn.
An advertisement for an NHS hospital trust would place similar emphasis on
not only a keen understanding of the NHS but also the financial disciplines
and skills of the private sector.
Such discipline is still generally lacking according to a government report
published this week. It said that many hospital and community trusts were
failing to meet government financial targets. Managers had to make a number
of changes, including tighter financial reporting regimes, as well as making
information about their activities more generally available.
NHS trusts have not yet had the fall-out rate of senior managers experienced
by Tecs, but this may only be a matter of time as boards, made up
predominantly from the private sector, become more demanding. At present
most manager posts go to career NHS staff, mainly because the NHS is so
'horrendously complicated', according to Mr Alan Bedford, manager of the
South Downs Health NHS Trust.
However, according to Bill Philips, head of public sector practice at NBS,
recruitment consultants, the NHS trusts will need to give more consideration
to how they recruit in the future. 'The NHS is unlikely to generate as many
senior managers with the requisite skills as it needs,' he says. 'Therefore
it needs to bring in talent from outside. It is how it is done that needs to
be considered carefully.'
So what is to be done? Boards of Tecs argue that progress in their
appointments of senior staff will be made as the role of the chief executive
becomes clearer, and they become more adept at drawing up job
specifications.
Stoller's first appointment at Oldham Tec in April 1990 was a civil servant.
In line with many other Tecs, he was constrained in his recruitment
processes. 'Tecs should first consider appointing the training agency
manager,' the government had said when it established Tecs. If they decided
not to do so, the appointment became limited; the salary could be covered by
public funds only up to the average of the relevant civil service grade.
Stoller, however, does not regret the appointment. He says he knows some
Tecs which initially appointed chief executives from the private sector only
to be disappointed. Some civil servants developed the necessary qualities to
run a Tec, others did not. Likewise, some private sector people struggled to
understand the system.
'In order to get the Tec running we had to understand government rules,' he
says. 'But, people who have started a business from scratch know that it
takes one kind of person to get a ball roll and that is not necessarily the
same person who will get it rolling faster. There are so many things we are
involved in now, including income generation, that the job needs a different
type of person.'
While the newly defined post is being openly advertised, there is an
internal candidate. This is a route that recruitment and management
consultants say may need to be taken more frequently.
'Talent may have to be identified and groomed internally,' says Mr Paul
Hutt, Hay Management, which has worked with more than 30 Tecs in developing
effective management models.
It is a strategy that some NHS trusts are also adopting, bringing in
individuals from the private sector at finance director and similar levels,
so that they can be acclimatised to the newer climate before internal
promotion.
Perhaps this form of entry into the profession should be considered by the
growing number of managers who have been shed by the private sector and are
considering jobs in this fledgling sector where there will continue to be a
growth in opportunities. The traditional view that are either public sector
or private sector jobs is being challenged and there are now a growing
number of jobs that are neither one thing nor the other.

A legal secretary with Baker and Mackenzie, a City law firm, has been
awarded about Pounds 40,000 in compensation and damages after suffering
repetitive strain injury at work.
The case brought by Ms Adelle Smith in the Mayor's and City of London County
Court is one of the first settled in court since the High Court rejected a
claim by a Reuters journalist in October. Judge John Prosser said then that
RSI had 'no place in the medical books'.

The plans to achieve higher standards in the sale of personal pensions to
people transferring out of or leaving an occupational pension scheme do not
get to the heart of mis-selling, the Society of Pension Consultants has
warned.
The society, which represents advisers on setting up both employer and
personal pension schemes, calls for an investigation into the role of
commission payments in pension transfers and opt-outs. It also argues that
the measures put forward by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's
chief watchdog, should include further work on calculating transfer values.
Employer-sponsored schemes should also provide information on as uniform a
basis as possible.
The society has sent its recommendations to the two committees of MPs
addressing the sale of personal pensions.

<TEXT>
Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life assurance industry,
has fined one of its members - Manulife - Pounds 65,000 after rule breaches
associated with an individual company representative, Alison Smith writes.
Manulife must also pay Lautro's costs of Pounds 35,000, and has undertaken
to ensure that any customer adversely affected will be compensated.
The disciplinary action related to the company's failure to make enough
checks on someone who worked for it as a representative for about 18 months
from January 1991.
The fine is considerably lower than some that Lautro has levied recently,
notably the Pounds 225,000 imposed on Aegon life assurance company and the
Pounds 180,000 on Legal &amp; General.

FT  13 APR 94 / Tories to field more candidates in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish Conservative party has increased by nearly 30 per cent the
number of candidates it is fielding in next month's elections to regional
councils, despite the fact that the councils are to disappear in two years
with the reform of local government.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said at the launch of the party's campaign
yesterday that the party expected to win seats 'all over Scotland'.
The Conservatives control none of the nine regional and three island
councils, and stand at an all time low of 13 per cent in the opinion polls
for Scotland, compared with the 26 per cent they won in the 1992 general
election.
Mr Lang said: 'History is littered with dead opinion polls. I am very
confident the opinion polls are wrong, and we shall prove them wrong when
the time comes.'
The Tories are fielding about 350 candidates, about 100 more than in the
last regional elections in 1990. In that poll, they took 19 per cent of the
vote and won 52 of the 445 seats in the regions.
The more candidates a party fields, the higher its share of the vote is
likely to be, since the presence of a candidate enables party supporters to
vote for their party instead of voting for another party or staying at home.
A bill now in its committee stage in parliament will abolish the regions and
the 53 district councils in 1996 and will create about 30 single-tier
councils.
Elections to the new councils will be held next May, but the new councillors
will not take up office until 1996.
Tory regional election candidates will have to defend the plan to remove
control of water and sewerage from councils and create three state-owned
water authorities. Last month a referendum in Strathclyde region produced an
overwhelming majority against local authorities losing control of water.
Yesterday Mr Lang said there would be a 'considerable number' of elected
councillors on the boards of the new authorities. But he would not specify
what proportion they would comprise.
The Tory manifesto insists: 'The government is not privatising Scotland's
water and sewerage services by the back door, the front door, or any other
route. The new water authorities will remain in the public sector.'

FT  13 APR 94 / Party is criticised over local tax comparisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An independent economic think-tank yesterday joined the row between Labour
and the Conservatives about local taxation, saying that Labour's comparison
of council tax bills was misleading.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that Labour's calculations, which
compare average tax bills under different councils, were less fair than
government figures. It said they confused the rate of tax charged to each
taxpayer and the value of the property on which the tax was based.
Government figures, based on the charge paid by taxpayers in a particular
tax band, provided a fairer comparison across councils, it said.
Mr Stephen Smith, deputy director of the institute said: 'Labour's figures
are misleading. The average bill may be higher not because of higher charges
but because the average house is worth more.
'Labour councils are often in areas with low value property, which means
that as long as they are spending at the standard rate set by the government
they will receive grants to enable them to meet their spending requirements
without having to raise taxes.
'The average bill therefore often tells you more about the value of property
in an area and the size of the central government grant an authority is
receiving than about the tax burden it is imposing.'
He said the government's method of comparing rates for a particular tax band
provided a more reasonable reflection of taxation behaviour by local
governments.
He added that average tax bill comparisons become worthwhile when
authorities begin to spend above the standard rate, because then they must
start raising taxes to meet spending requirements.

FT  13 APR 94 / Labour treats poll as referendum on PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday resolved to project next month's local elections
as a referendum on Mr John Major's leadership as it revealed its campaign
strategy for the May 5 poll.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, said its abrasive attack on a
'disastrous prime minister' would be combined with a strong defence of
Labour's record in local government.
But Mrs Beckett and other senior party figures left little doubt that the
opposition is relying on a national backlash against Mr Major's record since
the 1992 general election to undermine the Tory vote.
Accusing the government of deliberate deception about tax increases and Mr
Major of 'making a mockery' of the office of prime minister, Mrs Beckett
said the typical family would pay an extra Pounds 500 a year in tax this
year to pay for his economic mismanagement.
The decision to focus on Mr Major personally came amid fierce exchanges
about relative council tax charges in Labour and Conservative-controlled
authorities.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, accused the government
of blatantly rigging the grant system for councils to favour Tory-controlled
authorities. He defended his claim that average council tax levels across
all local authorities were a reliable guide to relative efficiency. On that
basis the tax in Labour-controlled authorities was Pounds 40 less than in
Conservative councils.
The Conservatives, who want to fight the elections on the record of
individual local authorities, attacked the 'rotten record' of many
Labour-controlled councils
Mr David Curry, the local government minister, accused the opposition party
of 'wasted expenditure, political posturing and perverted priorities' as he
published a detailed dossier on the financial record of Labour-run
authorities.
Mr Major remains the Conservative leader most likely to lead the party to
victory at the next general election, according to an opinion poll by ICM in
today's Guardian newspaper.
A majority of the ICM sample said they were less likely to vote Conservative
if Mr Major was replaced by Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr
Michael Portillo, Mrs Virginia Bottomley or Mr Douglas Hurd.
The poll put the Conservatives on 26 per cent of the vote, up from 24 per
cent a month ago, but well behind Labour on 48 per cent, from 49 per cent.
Liberal Democrat support remained steady at 22 per cent.

FT  13 APR 94 / MP dies in motorway crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bob Cryer, the 59-year-old Labour MP for Bradford South, was killed in a
car crash on the M1 yesterday on his way to London for the opening day of
the summer session of parliament.
Police said Mr Cryer's Rover overturned on the southbound carriageway near
the exit for Watford, Hertfordshire. No other vehicles were involved. Mr
Cryer's wife Ann, who was in the car, was slightly hurt.
A by-election is likely to be held in the early summer. It brings the number
of pending by-elections to six, five of which are in Labour-held seats.
Mr Cryer had a majority of 4,902 over the Conservatives at the 1992 general
election, with the Liberal Democrats a poor third. The seat would normally
be regarded as marginal, but the government's unpopularity makes a
Conservative by-election victory unlikely.
The accident robs the Commons of a fiery and assiduous leftwinger who was an
expert on procedure and the scrutiny of secondary legislation such as
parliamentary orders.
He was a leading member of the Campaign group of hard-left Labour MPs, a
committed supporter of nationalisation and socialist economic policy, and an
implacable opponent of Labour's modernisers.
Mr Cryer entered parliament in 1974 as MP for Keighley, but was defeated in
the Conservative election victory in 1983. He served for two years as a
junior industry minister under Mr Eric (now Lord) Varley, but resigned in
1978.
He sat as Labour member of the European parliament for Sheffield for five
years from 1984.
Mr Cryer also leaves a son and a daughter.

FT  13 APR 94 / NHS condemned over Pounds 180m staff absence costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor human resource management is costing the National Health Service Pounds
180m a year in unnecessary sickness absence, the Audit Commission says in a
report published today.
The commission, a local government and health service watchdog, says bad
organisation and management in health service trusts is creating wide
discrepancies in their performance.
More than 90 per cent of NHS hospitals and community health organisations
are now organised as independent self-governing trusts.
Some trusts are up to 50 per cent more efficient in treating patients than
others, the report says. Much of the variation stems from the way services
are organised and managed.
The report identifies bad staff communications, inadequate training and lack
of performance appraisal as causes of high sickness absence and staff
turnover.
A survey of staff in 10 hospitals found that more than half did not feel
well informed about what the trust was doing.
Training initiatives are lagging behind changes in the health service, and
many trusts do not use performance appraisal to tell staff how they are
progressing.
Trust boards must do more to establish a strategic direction and monitor
their performance against targets, said Mr Andrew Foster, Audit Commission
controller.
He said: 'It is clear from this report that there is much to be done if
trusts are to make full use of the potential freedoms they have been given.
Boards need to focus on strategic direction, accountability and monitoring
performance.'
Welcoming the report, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, urged trusts
to seize the opportunities offered by their managerial independence.
'The commission is right to point to the variations in performance between
different trusts and the potential that exists to improve standards
everywhere to the level of the best,' she said.
Mrs Bottomley urged trust chairmen and chief executives to improve staff
communication to create teamwork, involvement and ownership.
'Where this is working well, there have been substantial benefits for
patients,' she added.

FT  13 APR 94 / Opposition demands water chief 's dismissal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour MPs called last night for the resignation of Mr Ian Byatt,
director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, after allegations
that he had appointed friends and business contacts to the industry's
customer protection groups.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, and 40 other Labour
MPs signed a Commons motion calling for Mr Byatt's dismissal and an
independent inquiry into the industry's treatment of customers.
The call followed claims made yesterday by the Yorkshire Post newspaper
about connections between Mr Byatt and some of the chairmen of the 10
regional Ofwat customer service committees which represent customer
interests.
Mr Byatt is likely to face questions on these alleged links today when he
appears before the Commons environment committee. The committee is also set
to ask whether customers are paying too much for water and whether
environmental standards are high enough.
According to the Yorkshire Post, those appointed as customer committee
chairmen included a school friend of Mr Byatt, a former non-executive
director of John Laing, the construction company which has contracts with
water companies, and the wife of a former close colleague at the Treasury.
Ofwat said that these personal details were accurate, but dismissed as
'pretty scurrilous' the allegation that the appointments were due to the
personal connections with Mr Byatt. 'Nobody has behaved improperly and Mr
Byatt has no intention of resigning,' it said.
The potential conflict of interest in the case of the John Laing director
was carefully considered at the time of his appointment, Ofwat said. It said
its recommended appointments are vetted by the environment and trade and
industry secretaries.
The National Consumer Council called yesterday for the committees to be
independent of Ofwat. 'We like the way that the Gas Consumer Council is
independent of Ofgas (the gas regulator),' it said.
Yesterday's claims come two months after Ofwat's decision not to reappoint
Ms Diana Scott as chairman of the Yorkshire committee.
Ms Helen Jackson, Labour MP for Sheffield Hillsborough, said last night:
'There is widespread anger in the region about this. She was very outspoken
on customers' behalf, but she was not in line with Mr Byatt's personal
opinions, particularly on metering.'
Ofwat has backed an increase in the use of household water meters, but
Labour says large families with low incomes will see bills rise.

FT  13 APR 94 / Political Notebook: Ashdown returns from the shadows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats are contemplating a return to the political limelight.
After languishing in the shadows after the fleeting by-election triumphs of
last year, the party is looking forward to a burst of electoral success.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, gripped by depression at the end of 1993, is bubbling with
enthusiasm. The local and European elections and the Eastleigh by-election
offer the best moment since the early 1980s for the third force in British
politics.
In May, the party could win hundreds of additional council seats, taking its
nationwide total to around 5,000 seats - five times as many as it held in
1979.
It should trounce the Conservatives in Eastleigh. The by-election arithmetic
is complicated by a relatively high Labour vote. But the Liberal Democrats
need a swing of only 11.5 per cent against the Conservatives to seize the
constituency. In Christchurch they achieved three times that.
Then there are the European elections. Even the more cautious believe the
Liberal Democrats will win at least three seats in the Strasbourg
parliament. The optimists are thinking in terms of up to a dozen. They see
an opportunity to break out of the south-west and drive the Conservatives
from places such as Dorset, Hampshire and Berkshire.
So the summer will see Mr Ashdown promising once again to break the
two-party mould of British politics - but wondering in private how long it
will take for his party to slip back into the electoral shadows.
Another mid-term electoral triumph - and there are plenty of precedents -
will not answer the doubts that still sap the self-confidence of the
national leadership. The Liberal Democrats have emerged stronger than many
predicted from the ashes of the old SDP-Liberal Alliance. But the party
remains deeply ambivalent as to why it is here.
At grass-roots level, there is a large faction that says it must have no
truck with Labour in seeking to depose the Conservatives. Occasional deals
to run local authorities are not to provide the blueprint for a national
pact. If it takes another 50 years for the Liberal Democrats to replace
Labour as the alternative party of government, so be it.
For the party leadership that is a deeply depressing prospect. Like most
Westminster politicians they want real power. They see the only route as via
a strong performance in the general election followed by an accommodation
with Labour.
The evidence is on their side. For all the occasional by-election triumphs,
the Liberal Democrat vote has declined in direct proportion to the revival
in Labour support.
In the 1983 general election, the then Alliance got 27 per cent of the vote.
In 1987, the Liberals won 23 per cent. In 1982, the remodelled Liberal
Democrats were down to 18 per cent. The mould has not even been cracked.
Dewy-eyed activists insist this time it will be different. The Conservatives
have never been so unpopular, the Liberal Democrats have never been so
deeply entrenched in local government. Labour has still to prove it can be
more than a party of north England and Britain's Celtic fringes.
Mr Ashdown knows otherwise. The polls show that the protesting Tory voters
who have deserted in droves to his party have done so without any great
enthusiasm.
Most have no real idea of what it stands for. Apart from Mr Ashdown's stance
on Bosnia, the electorate is uncertain about his party's policies. A
much-trumpeted emphasis on better state education as the bridge between
individual opportunity and community politics will not fill the gap.
On the economy the party presents an untidy mish-mash of 1980s free-marketry
and traditional Liberal interventionism. It has failed to convince voters
that its flagship policy of electoral reform is rooted in principle rather
than self-interest.
In private moments, senior party figures will admit that only a spell in
government can provide the necessary infusion of pragmatism: and the only
way to get there is through a deal with Labour. None are ready to own up to
such heresy in public. Nor will Mr John Smith acknowledge that the Labour
party might yet prove unable to win on its own.
But leading figures in both parties are keeping open their private channels
of communication. A strong electoral performance by the Liberal Democrats
this summer would strengthen its bargaining position. There are already
influential figures in the shadow cabinet who believe an anti-Tory pact must
remain an option.
It may all come to nought. But Mr Ashdown knows the future for his party
lies not in breaking the mould but in reshaping it.

FT  13 APR 94 / Patten questions degree standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality control of university degrees must be tightened, Mr John Patten, the
education secretary, said yesterday.
Speaking to the annual conference of the Higher Education Funding Council
for England, the quango responsible for distributing funds to English
universities, Mr Patten said: 'I have heard suggestions, assertions and
allegations that examiners have been less demanding recently.'
He said the universities' own quality council, which is self-regulating,
'ought now to place more emphasis on broad comparability in the standards of
degrees offered by different institutions'.
Mr Patten refused to rule out linking future quality audits to government
funding, and announced new restrictions on creating universities.
Colleges of higher education seeking university status must now achieve a
track record of at least two or three years in providing degrees validated
by a university, and publish a long-term strategic plan, before they can
receive university status.
Mr Patten also suggested changing the funding councils' quality assessments
to split university departments into five grades, rather than three as at
present.
Professor Neil Buxton, vice-chancellor of Hertfordshire university, asked Mr
Patten to intervene with Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, over the
local government review. This plans to replace county councils - which
distribute grants for individual students to universities - with smaller
unitary authorities.
Prof Buxton said: 'When we move to a whole network of unitary councils our
job collecting awards and grants is likely to be much more difficult.'
Mr Patten said he was in talks with Mr Gummer over reforms to the student
grant system, which would be enacted once the unitary councils are created.
These could involve removing both mandatory awards and possibly
discretionary awards from local authorities, some of which Mr Patten said
had been 'delinquent' in cutting discretionary awards.

<TEXT>
Leading players in UK motorsport are forming a trade association to promote
the sector, which has established an important role in the world motor
racing industry, Kevin Done writes.
The British motorsport industry has an annual turnover of more than Pounds
1bn, of which exports account for more than 40 per cent, and provides about
50,000 jobs.
Many of the leading Formula One teams are based in the UK. Britain is an
important source of engines and cars for the IndyCar series in the US.
Founder members of the Motorsport Industry Association include Cosworth
Engineering, Dunlop Motorsport, Race Car Engineering, the Jim Russell Racing
Drivers School, Premier Fuel Systems and Andersen Consulting, a sponsor of
Nigel Mansell's Newman Haas team in the IndyCar series.
The association said its main objectives included promotion of export
opportunities in conjunction with the Department of Trade and Industry, and
promotion of motorsport in marketing by British and European industry.
It also intends to introduce an industry code of practice to encourage a
'more responsible approach to business activity'.

FT  13 APR 94 / BBC sales opened to competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC has decided that international sales of its programmes will be
opened to market testing.
Independent programme distributors will be able to pitch for the job of
selling BBC programmes abroad, a role currently carried out by BBC
Enterprises, the corporation's commercial arm.
Mr John Thomas, managing director of BBC Enterprises, said the amount of
market testing would be limited but would occur across a representative
range of programmes.
Details are still being worked out but it is likely that BBC Enterprises
will continue to distribute programmes in which it has invested.
In the 1992-93 financial year, BBC Enterprises ploughed Pounds 60m back into
programme making from its activities, which include publishing and video
sales as well as programme distribution. Mr Thomas believes that, in spite
of facing competition, BBC Enterprises will turn out be 'the distributor and
exploiter of first choice'.
The market-testing policy emerged as the BBC published a document setting
out its commitment to 'fair and open competition in commercial markets'. The
corporation has been criticised by ITV and other rivals for using programmes
paid for by the BBC licence fee or the government grants that fund BBC World
Service to launch commercial services abroad.
The new BBC code drawn up by Mr Robin Foster, the corporation's chief
adviser on commercial policy, has three main features:
Clear criteria for all BBC commercial activities.
Fair competition in all markets.
No risk to the licence payer.
Under the fair competition policy, the BBC says all its commercial
activities will compete fairly and not have privileged access to public
funds.
Transactions between the BBC and commercial ventures will be conducted
through contracts or service agreements.
The policy means BBC World Service Television will face progressively higher
charges for items received from the main BBC.
At the moment WSTV, which is extending its service globally, pays a marginal
extra cost for material obtained from the BBC.
'We will see what the service can afford to pay,' said Mr Thomas who added
that he did not want to force WSTV out of business.

British Coal last night withdrew plans to cut hundreds of pit jobs because
of 'speculation' about the number of miners to be made redundant.
The corporation had warned union leaders at a meeting near Mansfield,
Nottinghamshire, that up to 800 jobs could go at four pits over the next
year. Pits at Harworth near Worksop, Thoresby near Mansfield, Bilsthorpe
near Newark, all in Nottinghamshire, and Daw Mill in Warwickshire were
likely to be hit, union officials were told.

FT  13 APR 94 / Race link reported in Bar training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racial discrimination in the selection of trainees at the Bar is a big
disincentive to ethnic minority students and partly responsible for their
high failure rate in its finals course, according to a report published
yesterday, Robert Rice writes.
An inquiry into allegations of racial discrimination at the Bar's law school
found no evidence of direct or indirect discrimination against ethnic
minority students, but said there was 'a significant link' between those who
found traineeships and success in the Bar's final exams.
The inquiry, chaired by Dame Jocelyn Barrow, concluded that discrimination
by barristers' chambers in selecting trainees was partly to blame for the
racial disparity in success and failure rates in the exam.
The inquiry was set up last year by the Bar Council to discover why ethnic
minority students taking the Bar's finals exam in 1992 had a failure rate
nearly three times that of white students.
In the 1991-92 academic year, 44.7 per cent of ethnic minority students
failed the exam, compared with only 16 per cent of white students.

FT  13 APR 94 / Merseyside hit by regatta costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At least Pounds 695,000 of public funds has been spent so far as subsidies
for the visit in 1992 of the Columbus Grand Regatta tall ships to Merseyside
and an associated operatic concert. The conert was attended by King Juan
Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain as patrons.
A critical report by the National Audit Office published today blames poor
management, lack of financial controls, and over-optimism.
The events led to only marginal inward investment.
They were supposed to break even. Most of the blame falls on Merseyside
Development Corporation, the government agency in charge of economic
regeneration of the area, which led support for both events under its
chairman Sir Desmond Pitcher, former chief executive of Littlewoods, now
chairman of North West Water.
The NAO says the corporation and its local authority partners failed to
recognise financial risks from the outset.
Both events had to be rescued by public funds. Advance ticket sales failed
to materialise and contractors working on the concert threatened to leave
work incomplete if they were not paid immediately.
The visit by the regatta - secured after a successful Tall Ships Race to the
Liverpool International Garden Festival in the summer of 1984 - was meant to
attract potential inward investors.
The concert was meant to complement it culturally. The corporation let the
concert to the single tenderer - Carroll Promotions, a company with no
relevant experience formed for Pounds 2 by Mr Brendan Carroll, a public
relations consultant.
Latest figures show the regatta's costs of Pounds 962,000 had exceeded
income by Pounds 426,000 last December. The concert's losses are still
unknown because the company is in liquidation. The corporation's costs are
estimated at Pounds 419,000.
The corporation commissioned a report by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountacy
firm, on the events which concluded that several million visitors had spent
a total of Pounds 17.6m.

FT  13 APR 94 / Banks' long haul in mortgages: How the high street clearers
are creeping up in the home-loans market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High street banks are so dominant in British personal banking that it comes
as something of a shock that in mortgage lending the market share of even
the largest of them is relatively small.
'Probably more of our current account customers have mortgages with Halifax
building society (the UK's largest) than have mortgages with us,' is a
common view among the big four clearing banks.
Only Abbey National, now a bank but formerly a building society, can
challenge or overtake the Halifax market share.
Banks have been offering mortgages for about 10 years, but judging by their
market share their approach has changed sharply in the past two years -
after the worst of the recession and the steep falls in house prices.
Excluding Abbey National, banks' market share of net mortgage advances in
1990 was 6 per cent, and in 1991 fell to 4 per cent. Yet in 1992 it was up
sharply at just over 20 per cent, and last year climbed to almost 40 per
cent.
The main cause of this increase is the popularity of banks' fixed-rate
mortgages, which represented at least 60 per cent of the big four clearing
banks' net mortgage lending last year.
Some banks, notably National Westminster, TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland,
have recently offered particularly competitive fixed rates, according to Ms
Olive Thompson, residential mortgage editor at Moneyfacts, a monthly
publication which monitors mortgage and savings rates.
However, banks in general have tended to be slower to develop the range of
discounts currently being offered by many building societies.
Ms Anne Gunther, controller of NatWest home loans, characterises their
approach as offering 'competitive but not absolutely cut-throat products'.
Even if the heyday of fixed-rate mortgages has passed, with rates beginning
to increase, banks insist that from now on they intend to stay in the market
more consistently.
They see the taking out of a mortgage loan as an important chance to cement
loyalty in a transaction that attracts less customer resistance than some
other financial services, such as life assurance.
'If you score well on something as meaningful as buying a home, then you can
talk to the customer on a wider range of issues,' according to Mr Garry
Skelton, Barclays head of mortgages.
It is also a time of general financial review and hence an opportunity to
cross-sell products such as personal loans, house and contents insurance,
and life cover.
'On average, you would find a Lloyds Bank mortgage customer would have five
products with the bank, while a current-account customer normally has less
than three,' says Mr Dennis Holt, general manager of personal banking at
Lloyds.
The new aggression in mortgage lending makes sense for the banks' balance
sheets. According to rules drawn up by a committee of international banking
supervisors, known as the Basle rules, residential mortgages are weighted at
only half the risk of commercial lending. Every Pounds 1bn of mortgage
loans, for example, need be backed by only half the capital that the same
amount of commercial lending would require.
Nor, at present, does the emphasis on mortgage lending mean any diversion
from developing commercial lending, since demand there is so weak.
Maintaining or increasing banks' mortgage market share will be a long haul,
however. As Mr Geoff Ellerton, Midland general manager of business
development, points out, building societies have been offering mortgages for
more than 100 years, and probably most bank current-account customers with
mortgages took them out before banks were in the market.
As all the banks recognise, they still need to do more to promote themselves
as the 'natural choice' for customers seeking mortgages. With building
societies already having regained some market share in the past few months,
the mortgage customer may never be more in demand.

FT  13 APR 94 / Irish PM hints at bypassing Ulster parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments may be prepared to go over the heads of
Northern Ireland's political parties to draw up new political arrangements
and structures affecting the province, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime
minister, claimed yesterday.
Remarks intended to drive home London and Dublin's determination to maintain
the momentum of the peace process may cause consternation among unionists.
Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament that the governments were pressing
ahead with drafting a new 'framework document' as the focus for renewed
talks in the province 'as and when the parties are ready to resume'.
But he emphasised the two governments agreed that 'no party', whether
unionist or republican, would be allowed to block progress towards a
political solution. Asked if this meant the two governments might 'go over
the heads' of the province's parties in their efforts to seek a settlement,
Mr Reynolds acknowledged: 'It may well arrive at that situation, although it
would be preferable to have the agreement of the parties.'
The Northern Ireland Office last night had no comment on Mr Reynold's
remarks, although it emphasised that the British government remained adamant
there could be no imposed solutions. The entire basis of the Downing Street
declaration, they stressed, was the desire to achieve agreement on Ulster's
future. Current bilateral talks with the parties would progress on that
basis.
The Anglo-Irish framework document will seek to flesh out the Downing Street
declaration by detailing the new north-south structures and institutions
envisaged in the document and, according to Mr Reynolds yesterday, will also
try to deal with 'other issues'.
Unionist leaders will be concerned that this may signify that Dublin intends
to have a say in the framing of new constitutional arrangements for Northern
Ireland.
Mr Reynolds did not expect the unionists to come to the table before the
elections to the European parliament this June, but he hoped that progress
could be made during the summer. A 'deep and yawning gap' between the
British government and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, would also
'have eventually to be bridged' he added.

FT  13 APR 94 / Tougher law urged for corporate manslaughter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reform of the manslaughter laws to make it easier to prosecute companies for
acts of gross negligence resulting in death is called for today by the Law
Commission.
The government's law reform body says the failure in 1991 of the case
against P&amp;O European Ferries following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster
highlights the difficulties of holding companies responsible for gross
negligence.
The prosecution failed in spite of the findings of a judicial inquiry that
there had been a failure of management and that, from top to bottom, the
company was 'infected with the disease of sloppiness'.
The commission says it has long been the law that a company can be
prosecuted for manslaughter where it can be 'identified' with the acts or
omissions of one of its controlling officers.
But in order to convict a company of manslaughter it was necessary first to
prove one of its controlling officers guilty of manslaughter.
This might be impossible in a case where death was caused precisely because
nobody in the company was thinking clearly about the safety aspects of the
company's operations, the commission says.
The P&amp;O case failed because the prosecution was unable to show that any of
the company's senior personnel had realised the way the ship was operated
created an obvious and serious risk that it would put to sea with its bow
doors open.
There have only been three prosecutions for corporate manslaughter - in
1927, 1965 and most recently following the Zeebrugge disaster in 1991. None
has resulted in conviction.
The commission says this is a 'very unsatisfactory position' and the law
should be changed.
In a wider report on involuntary manslaughter, it recommends that a company
should be held liable for manslaughter in two sets of circumstances:
Where the company ought reasonably to have been aware of a significant risk
that its conduct could result in death or serious injury.
Where the company's conduct fell seriously below what could reasonably have
been demanded of it in preventing the risk from occurring or from resulting
in the prohibited harm.

face of intensifying competition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Nineteen of the largest 20 building societies accounted for almost all of
societies' share of mortgage lending last year. However, building societies'
share of new lending dropped sharply, according to research by stockbrokers
UBS.
UBS's study shows that the 19 building societies between them won 56 per
cent share of the UK mortgage market last year.
Separate figures produced by UBS show that all societies accounted for 58
per cent of net mortgage advances.
The position has changed sharply compared with 1992. Then the 19 societies
covered in the UBS study accounted for 63 per cent of net mortgage advances,
with the remainder of societies responsible for a further 13 per cent.
Building societies' share of new lending last year fell steeply to 56 per
cent from the previous year's 76 per cent in the face of intensifying
competition from the banks.
The UBS research does not cover any smaller societies. Nationwide, the UK's
second largest society, is excluded from the figures because its 1993
results have not yet been released.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS, said one of the
causes of the fall in market share was the restriction on the amount
societies can raise on the wholesale money markets where funds are cheaper
at the moment. This has inhibited their ability to compete in fixed-rate
mortgages.
The research finds there was average growth of 53 per cent in pre-tax
profits for the 19 societies, with an increase in return on assets from 0.76
per cent to 0.93 per cent.
'While this growth may seem excessive, the absolute levels of profits
compared with the size of their balance sheets remains lower than the
average attained over the last decade,' it says.
Costs rose on average by 5.3 per cent, while the average cost/income ratio
stood at 45.1 per cent.
There were sharp falls in bad debt provisions in all but three societies,
the average drop being 18 per cent.
UBS expresses confidence that for the second year running the total bad
debts for all UK building societies - about 80 - will be less than those of
Barclay's Bank.
The UBS study also ranks the 19 societies covered against five financial
measures. Bristol &amp; West, the 10th largest society, featured among the worst
three in terms of growth in pre-tax profits, pre-tax profits/mean assets and
cost/income ratio.
North of England, the 20th largest society, also was among the worst three
in three categories: growth in pre-tax profits, growth in provisions for bad
and doubtful debts, and cost/income ratio.

FT  13 APR 94 / Insolvency proposals attacked by firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading professional bodies yesterday attacked the government's proposed
insolvency reforms as highly damaging to British business.
In a series of submissions just made public, accountancy firms and
practitioner bodies criticised far-reaching suggestions in a Department of
Trade and Industry paper.
The consultative document, issued last October and on which the deadline for
comments has just passed, called for US-style protection for companies from
their creditors.
Its most radical suggestions were that companies should be notified if their
bankers intended to appoint a receiver, and that the directors would be able
to apply for a moratorium protecting them from creditors for 28 days after
which the period could be further extended.
The Society for the Practitioners of Insolvency, the largest trade body,
said yesterday far more modest reform was all that was necessary. It
recommended that the directors' call for a moratorium should be granted only
if it were approved by a licensed insolvency practitioner.
Mr Mark Homan, outgoing president of the society and head of insolvency at
accountants Price Waterhouse, said: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' He
dismissed as 'lightweight' some of the proposals suggesting that
receivership needed radical reform.
The comments reflected recent criticism from the banks, which said a
dilution of their rights would threaten their ability to lend money to
businesses.
They are in stark contrast to the initial comments last year which welcomed
the proposals, at a time when there were calls for action to protect small
companies from collapse.
Mr Nigel Hamilton of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, which has also made a
submission to the DTI, said in reference to giving extra powers to protect
directors: 'Without proper safeguards this could easily be some sort of
fraudsters' charter.'
The firm said insolvency procedures should be designed to protect the
underlying business. The recommendations wrongly focused instead on
preserving the existing corporate shell or company with its incumbent
directors.

FT  13 APR 94 / Official responsible for BT sell-off calls for break-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A break-up of British Telecommunications and radical reform of the structure
of telecommunications regulation is needed to improve telecoms services in
the UK, says a former senior government official responsible for the
privatisation of BT in 1984.
Mr Ian Ellison, who as a Department of Trade and Industry civil servant was
responsible for the passage of the 1984 Telecommunications Act which
privatised BT, said prices remained too high and competition too weak.
At an FT-sponsored conference, he said: 'Telecoms charges here are
significantly higher than in France, Benelux and Scandinavia. Competition,
privatisation and price controls have not driven down prices to the same
extent as in other non-privatised jurisdictions.'
Mr Ellison, now an independent consultant, said the 1984 act had been
necessary to get privatisation under way, but should have been overhauled
when the duopoly between BT and Mercury Communications was abolished in
1991.
Mr Bruce Bond, director of BT's national business communications division,
told the conference that competition had played a vital role in improving
BT's performance.
'In areas where people choose to compete with us, they do quite well,' he
said, noting that BT now carried a minority of traffic from the City of
London.

Britain's biggest city-centre camera surveillance scheme will be operating
in Glasgow within six months. More than 30 streets in the city will be
scanned by 32 closed-circuit cameras under the Pounds 550,000 scheme,
part-funded by business, which follows the success of others in Birmingham
and Airdie, Lanarkshire.
Organisers claim that cutting crime and wooing visitors may increase city
centre business by up to Pounds 40m a year.

FT  13 APR 94 / Building industry hiring rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The construction industry is hiring twice as many permanent staff as it did
during the corresponding period last year, says a survey commissioned by the
Chartered Institute of Building, Andrew Taylor writes.
The survey, conducted by Montrose Technical Recruitment, provides further
evidence of a broad-based recovery in one of the industries worst affected
by the recession.
Montrose, which claims to be the largest recruitment consultancy
specialising in the construction industry, said: 'We have experienced a
substantial increase in requirements from construction employers with a 44
per cent increase in registered job vacancies compared with the first three
months of last year.
'The number of people we have placed with construction companies is almost
double that of the corresponding period in 1993.'
The consultancy said the industry had lost a large number of highly skilled
professionals during the recession. As a result it was finding it difficult
to identify enough high-calibre candidates in key areas.
'Housing professionals in particular are in short supply,' Montrose said.
The survey followed the publication on Monday of the most optimistic
forecast for construction output since 1989.
The National Council of Building Material Producers, representing companies
with a combined annual turnover of more than Pounds 30bn, predicted that the
value of UK construction output, measured in constant 1990 prices, would
rise by 2 per cent this year.

FT  13 APR 94 / Discrimination seen in Bar training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racial discrimination in the selection of trainees at the Bar is a big
disincentive to ethnic minority students and partly responsible for their
high failure rate in its finals course, according to a report published
yesterday.
An inquiry into allegations of racial discrimination at the Bar's law school
found no evidence of direct or indirect discrimination against ethnic
minority students, but said there was 'a significant link' between those who
found traineeships and success in the Bar's final exams.
The inquiry, chaired by Dame Jocelyn Barrow, concluded that discrimination
by barristers' chambers in selecting trainees was partly to blame for the
racial disparity in success and failure rates in the exam.
The inquiry was set up last year by the Bar Council to discover why ethnic
minority students taking the Bar's finals exam in 1992 had a failure rate
nearly three times that of white students.
In the 1991-92 academic year, 44.7 per cent of ethnic minority students
failed the exam, compared with only 16 per cent of white students. The pass
rate of ethnic minority candidates improved to 70 per cent in 1992-93, but
still compared badly with the 88 per cent pass rate of white students.
The Bar Council said it was 'concerned' at the inquiry's conclusions and
would examine the recommendations carefully. But the Association of Women
Barristers said there was now an urgent need to standardise the timing of
selection of trainees.
Many black students arrived at the Bar's law school only to find chambers
had already selected trainees for the following year and had no vacancies
left, it said.
More than 70 per cent of white students secured a traineeship compared with
48 per cent of ethnic minority students in 1992/93.
Discrimination by chambers was not the only cause identified by the inquiry
for the poor pass rate of ethnic minority students. The report says lower
prior academic achievement and the failure of the Bar's school to meet the
social and cultural needs of ethnic minority students were also to blame.
It recommends reforms including clearer pass and fail criteria, external
examiners, double marking, and the appointment of an equal opportunities
officer for the Bar's school.

FT  13 APR 94 / Third of Tecs part with chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than one third of training and enterprise council chief executives have
resigned or been sacked since Tecs were established four years ago,
according to figures disclosed by the Department of Employment yesterday.
The first Tecs were established in April 1990 to administer
government-funded training and to foster enterprise. Of 82 chief executives
recruited during the past four years, 35 have quit. Some 20 of these were
seconded civil servants, while 15 came from a variety of backgrounds,
including the private sector.
Civil servants, many of whom had worked in the Department of Employment's
Training Agency, which handed over responsibility to Tecs, accounted for 46
of the original chief executives.
The Tecs had been asked to give the Training Agency's civil servants first
consideration when appointing chief executives. After three years with a
Tec, the civil servants had an option to return to the Department of
Employment.
The department denies that the high turnover indicates a failure in the
recruitment policy of the Tecs' boards, composed mainly of private-sector
senior executives. 'There was not a model for these new jobs,' the
department said. 'They require people who understand both the commercial and
public sectors and the interface between them.'
A Tec chief executive can command a salary of between Pounds 35,000 and
Pounds 55,000 plus benefits.
In a recent study of Tecs, Mr Bob Bennett of the London School of Economics
said that Tecs were heavily dependent on the personal effectiveness of their
chief executive.

FT  13 APR 94 / Receivers audited failed company's subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm from which partners are acting as
receivers to Lancer Boss, the fork lift-truck manufacturer, is also auditor
to one of the group's subsidiaries.
The appointment could be perceived as giving rise to a conflict of interest,
although the firm said it had received its professional body's blessing for
the action.
Mr Allan Griffiths and Mr Scott Barnes of Grant Thornton were appointed last
Friday as administrative receivers to Lancer Boss Group, the UK holding
company, after insolvency procedures were triggered by the withdrawal of
banking facilities to Steinbock Boss, its German subsidiary.
Accounts lodged with Companies House show that Grant Thornton is auditor to
Toddington Manor Farms, whose ultimate parent company is Lancer Boss Group.
Mr Griffiths said yesterday that the audit appointment had been discovered
'at the last minute'. To have appointed another firm would have meant delay.
Anticipating that the conflict 'might blow up' as a result of the
appointment, he had cleared it with the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales. He said he was happy, adding that the subsidiary's
turnover of Pounds 200,000 was minor compared to the whole group.
Speaking about the principle of a receiver acting on a group when the firm
audits a subsidiary, Mr Jack Maurice, head of the professional ethics
department at the institute, said: 'It potentially raises an issue which a
firm could be asked to justify.' Professional insolvency ethical guidelines
state there may be - or may appear to be - a conflict of interest for a
receiver if there is already a 'material professional relationship' with the
client.
A material relationship includes existing audit work for the client company
during the past three years, or the audit by the firm of entities controlled
by the client.
According to the accounts, Grant Thornton's Bedford office charged Pounds
2,000 for the audit of the business, which made a loss of Pounds 25,000 in
the year to March 31 1992 on a turnover of Pounds 210,000.

FT  13 APR 94 / Germans close in on Lancer Boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck producer at the centre of the row
over the Lancer Boss receivership, said yesterday it wanted to buy both the
British and German parts of its smaller Bedfordshire-based rival.
In a statement clarifying the company's position, Jungheinrich said it was
reiterating its interest in the British part of the Lancer Boss Group and
would shortly hold discussions with Grant Thornton, the UK receivers.
The latest twist in the saga puts the German company in a strong position to
buy the last big UK-owned producer of lift trucks.
It could also defuse the row over the alleged 'stitch-up' of Lancer Boss by
German banks, as the rump of the UK group would be preserved. Jungheinrich
has already made contact with the administrator of Steinbock Boss, from
which German banks withdrew their support last week, prompting the UK
receivership.
Mr Klaus Schenk, managing director of Manchester-based Jungheinrich (GB),
said it was 'very much likely' that manufacturing at Lancer Boss's Leighton
Buzzard sites would be preserved if it bought Lancer Boss. He said the
German company had been negotiating a takeover of the entire Lancer Boss
group for months. But the German banking group for Steinbock Boss lost
patience with the slow progress of negotiations, he said, and withdrew
banking facilities from the German unit.
Mr Schenk would not say why the negotiations became bogged down, but
observers believe Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, joint-owner and former chairman
of the UK company, may have been holding out for too high a price.
Mr Schenk admitted that Jungheinrich's statement on Monday, in which it
referred only to negotiations over the future of Steinbock Boss, may have
created 'slightly the wrong impression'. In fact, he said, Jungheinrich only
considered a bid for Steinbock Boss alone after the Moosburg-based company
was put into administration on Friday.
Jungheinrich will restart negotiations over the UK side of Lancer Boss
shortly, and Mr Allan Griffiths - the Grant Thornton partner who with his
colleague Mr Scott Barnes is administrative receiver for Lancer Boss in the
UK - was in contact with the Hamburg company last night.
Jungheinrich will effectively be conducting twin negotiations with the
German administrator and the UK receivers. Such an arrangement could prove
attractive for Grant Thornton, as Mr Griffiths said on Monday that Lancer
Boss was worth more if the UK and German sides were sold together, and is
hoping to co-operate with the German administrator to achieve this.

FT  13 APR 94 / Cross-channel drink trade tops Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cross-channel shoppers brought home beer, wine and spirits worth about
Pounds 1.036bn in UK high street prices last year, a report by Whitbread,
the brewer, said yesterday.
The report says the Treasury lost Pounds 470m in duties and value added tax
through cross-channel personal imports of alcoholic drinks, almost double
the amount foregone in 1992.
Almost 30 per cent of all beer purchases were bought in bulk and brought
into the UK by van. Whitbread estimates that this practice has created a
bootlegging trade representing Pounds 22m in profit last year.
Legal beer imports of 1.25m barrels are equivalent to the total beer sales
of 4,500 pubs, or 15.3 per cent of the take-home beer market.
Whitbread believes that 60 per cent of cross-channel beer imports substitute
for UK pub and club sales and 40 per cent of European purchases substitute
for the take-home market.
In addition to losses on beer, the purchase of 83.7 litres of wine and
spirits by cross-channel shoppers - excluding air travellers - amounted to a
retail loss of Pounds 677m.
The popular perception that cross-channel shopping is a south-east
phenomenon is contradicted by Whitbread's statistics, which show that 45 per
cent of cross-channel consumers come from outside London and the south-east.
The central region of England accounts for Pounds 200m in retail losses and
the Yorkshire and north-east region brought home Pounds 100m worth of beer.
On top of retail losses in alcoholic drinks, the Tobacco Manufacturers'
Association estimated that cross-channel shopping for duty-paid tobacco cost
the Treasury about Pounds 100m in 1993.
Last year only 37 per cent of channel passengers bought beer in continental
Europe but the industry fears that figure will increase unless the UK
reduces its duties on alcohol.

FT  13 APR 94 / Bank sues over 'stolen' used notes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The husband of an employee of the Bank of England's note destruction depot
tried to invest Pounds 100,000 in used notes in a mutual insurance society,
a court heard yesterday.
The Bank of England yesterday sued three families who, according to counsel,
lived the 'life of Riley' on up to Pounds 600,000 allegedly stolen from the
depot in Essex.
Police took an interest after Mr Peter Gibson went to invest Pounds 100,000
with the Reliance Mutual Insurance Society in Ilford early in 1992, Mr
Anthony Boswood QC, for the Bank, said.
The manager, Mr Anthony Day, and his assistant were amazed when he emptied
the cash in bundles of Pounds 20 and Pounds 50 notes out of a carrier bag on
to his desk, he added.
Mr Boswood said former employees Mrs Christine Gibson, Mr Kenneth Longman
and Mr Michael Nairne took part in the systematic theft of cash, mostly in
Pounds 20 and Pounds 50 notes. He told Judge Rudd at the High Court that Mrs
Gibson would smuggle the notes out in her clothing.
Cages containing the notes to be destroyed were accessed by two padlocks -
one white and one black. Mrs Gibson had a key which opened all black
padlocks and she sometimes managed to ensure the other padlock was also
black, though disguised as white, enabling her to open both of them.
Mr Longman was involved in two chance thefts from the cages which netted him
at least Pounds 150,000, said Mr Boswood.
The bank is suing Mr and Mrs Gibson, Mr Longman and his wife Janet, and Mr
Nairne and his wife Sharon, all of Loughton, Essex.
The bank's action against another employee, Mr Kevin Winwright, of Writtle,
near Chelmsford, Essex, has been settled. He has served an 18-month sentence
for stealing Pounds 170,000 in notes.
The hearing was adjourned until today.

FT  13 APR 94 / World Trade News: Kantor puts trade dispute ball in Japan's
court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said yesterday it would be
'dangerous' to set deadlines for Japan to comply with US demands that it
open its markets further.
He also said Washington was not considering using Super 301 trade sanctions
against the European Union if the two sides failed in a last-ditch attempt
to reach an agreement by Friday to liberalise their public procurement
markets.
Speaking before a meeting in Marrakesh on Friday with Mr Tsutomu Hata, the
Japanese foreign minister, Mr Kantor said: 'As Japan has said many times,
the ball is in its court. It would be very difficult for the US to
articulate a time schedule. I hope to glean some clue from Mr Hata.'
Mr Kantor said that though he expected a productive discussion on a range of
international trade issues, he did not know whether it would be possible to
make progress in settling trade disputes between the two countries.
Though he dismissed deadlines for action as dangerous, he said the
recently-renewed Super 301 would come into effect at the end of this month,
and that the administration had until September 30 to name countries which
could be targets for unilateral trade sanctions.
Mr Hata's arrival at the four-day ministerial conference of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Marrakesh has been delayed because of the
political crisis in Japan.
Meanwhile, US and EU officials were planning to negotiate through the night
on public procurement after Mr Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, the European
trade commissioner, failed to make a decisive breakthrough in talks lasting
more than an hour yesterday. 'At this stage, it is just impossible to say if
we will reach an agreement or not,' Sir Leon said.
The Clinton administration insists that an agreement must be reached by
Friday so that it can be submitted to Congress under the US 'fast-track'
procedure, which provides for rapid legislative approval.
Success in the talks would enable US and European suppliers to compete more
freely in each others' markets for contracts worth an estimated Dollars
200bn a year. However, each sides accuses the other of not having made
sufficient concessions.
Brussels is pressing Washington to do more to liberalise procurement by
individual states, while the US wants the EU to provide more generous access
to markets for telecommunications and power supply equipment.
The European Commission fears that if no agreement is reached by Friday, the
US may impose sanctions against it under Super 301. However, Mr Kantor
denied yesterday that such action was planned and dismissed suggestions that
he might set a 'numerical target' for US sales of equipment to EU public
bodies.

FT  13 APR 94 / World Trade News: Bananas cause hitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union ministers were called into emergency session last night to
head off an internal dispute over the EU's banana import regime which
threatened to hold up signing of the Uruguay Round world trade deal on
Friday.
Germany, backed by the Netherlands, expressed fears that signing the trade
accord could compromise its appeal against the banana regime now before the
European Court of Justice.
The European Commission says that Germany's fears are groundless.
The new EU scheme, introduced last July, imposes European-wide quotas for
cheap Latin American banana imports while more expensive bananas from
African and Caribbean countries enter duty-free.
These quotas, enforced by punitive tariffs over the permitted level, are
inscribed in the EU's Uruguay Round tariff schedule.
Ministers yesterday moved towards a compromise which would involve a formal
declaration that Germany's legal rights were not affected by the Uruguay
Round signing. However, with one minister fewer than the quorum of seven,
the meeting adjourned without a decision. Another council of ministers will
be held tomorrow.
In another last-minute hitch Portugal is objecting to any compromise being
made by the EU in negotiations this week with India and Pakistan over
textiles. Portugal is opposed to any further concessions by the EU but the
Commission argues that it needs additional flexibility to win the extra
market access in these countries it is seeking.
Meanwhile, another dispute was averted when member governments won a battle
with the Commission over the way in which the EU should sign the round.
The Commission had suggested that it and the 12 ministers should sign all at
once. However, the ministers have insisted that they sign in the
alphabetical order in which their country's names appear in the list of Gatt
members.

FT  13 APR 94 / World Trade News: Plea for Lome countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union was yesterday urged to rethink its trade policies towards
African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in the Lome convention to help them
cope with losses under the Gatt agreement.
Mr Orlando Marville, chairman of the ACP committee of ambassadors to the EU,
told a conference in London that world trade liberalisation was projected to
cut the value of tropical exports from the 70 ACP countries to the EU by
8-16 per cent.
This was because preferential trading arrangements between the EU and Lome
countries would be eroded by the opening of the European market to
competitors, he told the conference on Gatt and developing countries,
organised by the Catholic Institute for International Relations.
While tropical products represented 44 per cent of overall ACP exports to
the EU, some countries stood to lose particularly because of their
dependence on a single commodity.
Tobacco, for example, accounted for 55 per cent of Malawi's exports, while
Mauritius was 50 per cent dependent on sugar receipts from the EU.
Moreover, the fall in export subsidies under the Gatt deal would push up
prices of cereals, dairy products and meat, which would hit net importers
among the ACP countries.
'The EU shouldn't put up its hands and say 'There's nothing more we can
do',' said Mr Marville. 'The EU can help. The Lome convention has great
potential which has never been exploited.'
The mid-term review of the fourth Lome convention is due to start next
month. Mr Marville urged a transfer of know-how from the EU to help ACP
countries diversify and add value to commodities by processing and marketing
them.

FT  13 APR 94 / World Trade News: Benefits of free trade deal are felt
already - Marrakesh Diary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The beauty of free trade, as Adam Smith argued two centuries ago, is that it
makes everybody better off. But rarely has anyone reaped the benefits
quicker than the city of Marrakesh, for which the Uruguay Round trade accord
is proving a splendid gravy train.
Not only have the 3,000 attendants at this week's ministerial conference of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade filled hotels and restaurants to
capacity; in preparation for their arrival, the city has been given a giant
spring-clean, at an estimated cost of Dh60m Pounds 4.3m.
The previously faded glories of the 1,000-year-old imperial capital have
been revived with a fresh coat of paint on every wall that the VIPs are
likely to see, while pot-holed roads have been re-surfaced to billiard table
smoothness. The country's first cellular telephone network has been rushed
into service, while top hotels have installed videophones - an innovation in
Morocco - which enable users to see each other while they talk.
But perhaps the biggest wonder of all is the overnight disappearance of the
hordes of beggars, pickpockets and assorted conmen who habitually prey on
unsuspecting tourists. After years of fruitless debate by the city fathers
on how to deal with this problem, the central government has solved it at a
stroke by rounding up several thousand of the usual suspects and shipping
them off to a distant army camp for the duration.
Drivers of the city's fleet of horse-drawn carriages have also been
instructed to refrain from their frequent practice of over-charging
customers and now accept the official fare, albeit grudgingly. However, the
spirit of profiteering is not dead. The newsagent in the Atlas Asni Hotel,
home of the press centre, is cheerfully demanding Dh50 for day-old copies of
the FT with a cover price of Dh15.
                             *      *      *
The question most frequently asked here is why Marrakesh was chosen for the
conference in the first place. Mr Arthur Dunkel, the previous Gatt
director-general, claims some of the credit. He first floated the idea of an
African venue for the Uruguay Round signing while on a visit to Morocco in
1990. King Hassan - described by Mr Dunkel as a visionary leader - jumped at
the idea.
The king apparently believes that the long-term political benefits of
playing host will be even bigger than the short-term economic boost to
Marrakesh. As well as demonstrating the country's commitment to economic
reform and openness to the outside world, the event is clearly intended to
cement links with the west. With troubles deepening in neighbouring Algeria,
Morocco may well need all the foreign friends it can get in the next few
years.
                             *      *      *
The biggest friend of all is the US, which Morocco was the first country to
recognise after the American war of independence. Washington is displaying
its belated gratitude by sending Vice-President Al Gore on a lightning trip
to Marrakesh this week.
Though the visit is due to last only seven hours, its logistics have been
creating headaches for high-powered American diplomats more used to haggling
over tariffs and quotas. First, they have to greet the vice-presidential
motorcade, being shipped in by a huge C-5A transport aircraft. Then there is
Mr Gore's ample retinue, due to arrive with him on Air Force Two tomorrow.
Fortunately, there is already a skilled advance man on the ground in the
shape of Mr Marc Ginsberg, US ambassador to Morocco. A Clinton campaign
groupie and foreign policy wonk, Mr Ginsberg speaks not only good French but
also Arabic, learned as a child while his architect father was working in
the Middle East.
                             *      *      *
Japan's advance work has, typically, been even more diligent. More than a
month ago it dispatched a top diplomat on a fact-finding mission to
Marrakesh. As he explained with some glee, his main task was to locate and
then try out all the nearby golf courses. Seasoned trade policy experts
suspect it is really a cunning ruse to enable Japanese delegates to avoid
another broadside from Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, by staging
a tactical retreat to the fairway. Now that Japan's political crisis has
delayed until Thursday the arrival of Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister,
in Marrakesh, the contingency plan may not be needed after all.
                             *      *      *
Another delegation looking a shade leaderless is Britain's. Neither Mr
Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, nor Mr Richard Needham,
trade minister, thought it worth coming to Marrakesh. Instead, the
assignment has been left to Mr Tim Sainsbury, number three at the Department
of Trade and Industry, whose job is not to do with trade but with industry.
A bit odd considering all the fuss Mr John Major, the prime minister, made
about the Uruguay Round being the transcendent economic event of last year.
But perhaps just as well given Mr Heseltine's well-advertised disdain for
trade policy matters. Whitehall insiders describe as 'embarrassing' his few
bilateral encounters with top US trade negotiators, who were far better
briefed on the details.
                             *      *      *
If anyone has done better than Marrakesh out of the conference it is France,
which has called on old colonial links to win some handy contracts for
equipment. 'The French have really cleaned up on this whole event,' says a
senior diplomat who has been closely involved in organising the meeting.
One of the less successful results is the press room, where journalists are
required to pay for telephone calls using French-supplied 'smart cards'.
These can only be bought with cash and are consumed in vast quantities on
international calls. They also have a nasty habit of running out during the
computer transmissions which most print journalists use to send stories
these days. . . .

'winners' claim

<TEXT>
Aid agencies yesterday challenged the robust assertion by Mr Peter
Sutherland, Gatt director-general, on Monday that all countries would gain
from the Uruguay Round trade accords.
Mr Peter Madden, of London-based Christian Aid, said there was agreement by
economists that there would be losers, at least in the short term, while the
long-term benefits were uncertain. African and Caribbean countries stand to
be worst affected.
Christian Aid is calling for additional assistance to compensate those made
worse off, by way of debt relief, aid to take advantage of market
opportunities, and the granting of new trade preferences.
Ministers in Marrakesh for this week's signing of the Uruguay Round deal are
due to approve a decision calling for extra help for poor net food-importing
countries, who may face higher food bills as western export subsidies are
reduced. But Mr Madden said this did not go far enough.
A World Bank/OECD study published last year put the losses for sub-Saharan
Africa at Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.78bn) annually after 10 years, while
internal World Bank estimates suggest transitional costs could persist for
15 years. Other studies also indicate that many of the world's poorest
nations stand to gain little or lose out from the round.
Christian Aid identifies the losers as falling into four categories: net
food importers; countries now benefiting from trade preferences, notably
under the Lome Convention with the European Union; commodity exporters; and
those too underdeveloped to take advantage of new trading opportunities.
Gatt economists take a more optimistic line, arguing that the estimates do
not take account of benefits from improved trade rules or the extra
investment they could stimulate by underpinning economic reform and trade
liberalisation programmes.
In a speech to African finance ministers last month, Mr Jesus Seade, Gatt
deputy director-general, said there would be no 'food price shock'. Prices
for some products were estimated to rise by about 5 per cent over six years.
as a result of the Uruguay Round accords.
This was likely to stimulate domestic production in importing countries.

FT  13 APR 94 / World Trade News: France backs China to join new world trade
body - The final Gatt meeting in Marrakesh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
France yesterday threw its weight behind China's application to join the
planned World Trade Organisation, but said Beijing would have to comply with
any standards on workers' rights and labour conditions agreed by the new
body. Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, also said his
government's controversial demand for a 'social clause' in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was intended to prevent an outbreak of
protectionism in Europe, not to promote one.
Mr Longuet, who recently returned from an official visit to China, said his
government favoured the country's membership of the WTO, successor to Gatt.
However, he said: 'If one is in the Gatt, one accepts the disciplines. One
cannot make a special case for China. When one mentions a social clause and
China's WTO entry, it is with the idea of the most basic principles.'
China's application to join the WTO when it is set up early next year is
expected to be discussed at length at a four-day conference of Gatt
ministers from more than 120 countries which began in Marrakesh yesterday.
The issue has already been raised in bilateral talks here involving Mr Peter
Sutherland, Gatt director-general, and will be a high priority at a meeting
tomorrow of the 'Quad' powers - the US, EU, Japan and Canada.
Mr Longuet, who was speaking after a meeting with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, said they had agreed that labour standards, completion of
negotiations on liberalising trade in financial services and widening an
agreement on aircraft subsidies should be the WTO's top priorities.
He said France and the US were in full agreement on the liberalisation of
financial services.
Mr Longuet appeared to have obtained little clarification from Mr Kantor
about whether the US expects to maintain its Section Super-301 provision -
allowing Washington to impose trade sanctions - after the Uruguay Round
takes effect next year.
The French minister hoped that would become clearer when the round was
presented to Congress for approval.
He expected that international negotiations on restricting civil aircraft
subsidies would resume next month in the Paris-based Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development. The negotiations aim to extend to
other industrialised countries an agreement reached last year by the EU and
the US.
Mr Longuet insisted that France's demands for a Gatt 'social clause' - which
have divided the EU and been criticised by developing countries - were not
'a scarecrow or a protectionist measure'. He also did not want labour
standards to be imposed on Gatt members.
His government was seeking a debate on the question so that it could respond
to a 'protectionist and populist trend' which questioned the benefits of
free trade. 'If we do not reply, there will be a risk of a protectionist
reaction,' he said.

<TEXT>
US frustration in trying to enter Japan's markets for its high-technology
products, from cellular phones to cars, has confirmed suspicions that
whatever the merits of the products themselves, the Japanese prefer to buy
Japanese.
But when it comes to a somewhat less high-tech product, American brands have
increasingly won the heart of Japanese consumers.
After years of being shunned as drab and of poor quality, American clothes
are back in style in trendy Tokyo streets.
Last year the value of US apparel imports surged 55 per cent to Dollars
729.5m (Pounds 499.6m) from Dollars 472m in 1992, according to the Japan
Textile Import Union. Compared with five years ago, their value has risen
fivefold.
The popularity of US-made clothes has been helped by Japan's recession,
which has encouraged a taste for cheaper products that offer value for
money. For Japanese consumers accustomed to Dollars 100 price tags on
T-shirts at prestige-conscious department stores and boutiques, a US-made
version at one-fifth the price is a tempting alternative.
But at the same time the growing appetite for American fashion reflects a
spreading change in lifestyles and values that is affecting Japanese buying
patterns.
'Since the burst of Japan's economic bubble, there has been a growing trend
to return to basics,' says Mr Kazutoshi Yokota, editor-in-chief of Ryukoh
Tsushin fashion magazine.
Amid the sobering atmosphere of the country's economic downturn, consumers
turned away from the flashy styles that appealed to their nouveau riche
frame of mind and began endorsing basic, casual, even grungey clothes.
One beneficiary of Japan's renewed interest in American styles, has been LL
Bean, the US company that specialises in outdoor wear.
In the period from March, 1993 to February of this year, LL Bean's two shops
in Tokyo made sales of about Y2.4bn (Pounds 15.8m), double their original
forecast. The company, which is opening another outlet in September, expects
sales to rise to about Y3.5bn this year.
To its surprise LL Bean found that its clothes appeal not only to people in
their 30s and 40s, as it initially expected, but to all age groups from
teenagers up to those in their 70s.
Mr Yokota says US designers who are becoming popular in Japan learnt a
valuable lesson when the US recession forced them to move production
overseas, cut costs and offer quality designs at affordable prices. As a
result, their cost performance is among the highest in the world, he says.

The US has mapped out a marked shift in its approach to economic reform in
Latin America, laying increased emphasis on government action.
Mr Lawrence Summers, Treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
told the Inter-American Development Bank annual meeting in Guadalajara
yesterday that the central challenge for the region in the next decade was
making government a constructive force. 'Markets alone, without government
action, cannot bring the shared prosperity that we crave,' he said.
This was 'the core idea that animates Bill Clinton's presidency' and 'should
be the top of any agenda for Latin America and the Caribbean today.'
The Bush administration's approach emphasised market-oriented reform, laying
little emphasis on the role of the government. Mr Summers said there had
been important progress towards disinflation, deregulation, divestiture of
government enterprises and reducing debt, but now work had to be done to
create effective government.
He emphasised the importance of strong enforcement of legitimate laws and
supported the IADB's new efforts to promote judicial reform.
Again reflecting the Clinton administration's domestic concerns, Mr Summers
also called on the IADB to help restructure labour laws 'to ensure stronger,
more independent labour unions,' to protect workers' rights, including
minimum standards for health and safety, and to rewrite and enforce
environmental protection laws.
Mr Summers later told journalists that the new emphasis 'does not represent
any abandonment of our commitment to the private sector or to the key role
the private sector has to play as the engine of growth'.
He described regional development banks, such as the IADB, as 'as important
to the new world order as the regional security organisations were to the
old one'.

FT  13 APR 94 / Merger stance upsets defence industry in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Pentagon review of the application of anti-trust law to mergers in the
shrinking US defence industry is disappointing companies in the sector.
Although the report calls on the Justice Department and the Federal Trade
Commission to take the Pentagon's views into account when they assess the
anti-trust implications of a proposed defence industry merger, it stops
short of recommending changes to existing laws or regulations, and rejects
exempting the defence industry from anti-trust rules.
The US defence industry has been shrinking steadily as the Pentagon's
procurement budget has fallen from its peaks in the early 1980s. Top
officials such as Mr William Perry, defence secretary, and Mr John Deutch,
his deputy, say they expect a further one-third contraction over the next
five years.
But some companies complain that the consolidation of their industry needs
has been held up by the inappropriate application of anti-trust rules to the
sector.
Industry executives were particularly concerned when the Federal Trade
Commission in 1992 blocked the acquisition of Olin Corp's ammunition
division by Alliant Techsystems, on the grounds that the merger would create
a monopoly supplier of 120mm shells used in the Abrams tank and of 30mm
lightweight ammunition used in the Apache helicopter.
Some defence industry analysts say the Pentagon could very well have swayed
the FTC, but did not in fact argue very strongly in favour of the
Olin-Alliant merger.
Critics of the FTC's intervention say, nevertheless, that it ran against the
reality that in many military fields there is now only room for a single
supplier, and that the Pentagon - itself a monopsony or single buyer - is
well able to defend itself against price-gouging.
Anti-trust officials argue, however, that they have shown considerable
flexibility in assessing defence mergers and have, in fact, objected to only
1 per cent of such deals over the last decade.
Big mergers such as Northrop's Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.5bn) recent agreement
to buy Grumman or Martin Marietta's takeover last year of the General
Electric aerospace division have not drawn anti-trust objections.

FT  13 APR 94 / Latin America counts cost of infrastructure neglect:
Implications of Inter-American Development Bank's changed approach to
lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government officials took a small step this week towards addressing a big
problem: financing Latin America's huge infrastructure needs.
Yet that step - a mandate for the Inter-American Development Bank to lend up
to 5 per cent of its capital to private borrowers without government
guarantee - has emphasised the size of the problem rather than offered any
expectation of a rapid solution.
The run-down of Latin America's infrastructure came during the 1980s as
governments squeezed spending, and now represents a severe obstacle to
growth. According to World Bank estimates, fulfilling demand for
infrastructure capital in Latin America will require more than Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 778m) a week. Of the annual requirement of Dollars 60bn, Dollars
24bn is needed for power projects, Dollars 12bn for water and sewerage
systems, Dollars 10bn for telecommunications and Dollars 14bn for transport.
After a wave of privatisation, much of the region's infrastructure is in the
hands of the private sector and continued budget stringency severely limits
governments' ability to build infrastructure alone. Yet the World Bank
itself cannot lend without government guarantee and the IADB's new mandate
only implies direct lending capacity of Dollars 350m a year. 'It's a drop in
the bucket,' agreed Ms Nancy Birdsall, the bank's executive vice-president.
Even lending at this level was controversial among some of the IADB's
government shareholders, who feared losses on such lending might put the
bank's top credit rating at risk. Their concerns were accommodated by the
strict limits on the bank's lending: it is limited to a maximum of either
Dollars 75m or a quarter of the total cost of a project, whichever is the
smaller. The rest will have to be raised either from private markets,
commercial banks or from government development banks such as Mexico's
Banobras.
The worries were driven by the IADB's experience in the past with direct
lending to the private sector. The bank lost most of what it lent direct to
the private sector in the 1960s (it totalled Dollars 70m) and the bank's
private sector financing arm, the Inter-American Investment Corporation is
viewed by some shareholders as being a failure.
The IIC's future will be decided at a meeting of its board in June, but
those familiar with the US government's position say Washington sees it as
lacking in vision, performing poorly and being inefficient, and would like
to see it privatised. The institution, with assets of Dollars 365m, lost
Dollars 7.4m last year.
Ms Birdsall claims the IIC's 1960s losses were too long ago to be relevant,
and that the organisation has been plagued by high administration costs -
its small projects often require as much administration as much larger ones
 -rather than losses on loans.
The IADB would also probably make more use of its guarantee authority -
providing warranties for the non-commercial risk associated with projects -
and provide contingency guarantees, she said. For example, it would offer to
extend loan maturities beyond that which would normally be acceptable to the
private market.
The World Bank is also looking at the infrastructure question. Mr Javed
Burki, the bank's new vice-president for the region, said a new initiative
would be launched by the bank in the region later in the year.
It would focus on four issues:
Aiming to establish a partnership between public and private sector finance.
Encouraging development of the region's domestic capital markets so funds
for infrastructure could be raised locally.
Trying to ensure projects were not developed in isolation but with
governments playing a role in establishing an overall framework.
Looking at infrastructure development in a regional context so as to
ameliorate the growing pains of economic integration.
Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank, the US commercial bank with
the biggest involvement in Latin America, said he expected 'organisations
such as the World Bank and IADB to involve themselves more with commercial
banks in co-financings of infrastructure'. In doing so, they would be able
to encourage private lending of four to five times the sum they themselves
committed, he said.
Government export credit agencies may also play a larger role. Mr Kenneth
Brody, head of the US Export-Import Bank, said in Guadalajara last week:
'Until now, Ex-Im would be classified together with many of the other credit
agencies as relatively passive in the financing of projects. . . Now, in
place of being passive, we are going to be aggressive; instead of being a
follower, we are going to be a leader.'
There is also, some financiers believe, an important role for domestic
development banks. However, history again provides depressing reading. Most
multilateral lending to the private sector in the past has been channeled
through development banks, which in many countries were corrupt, inefficient
and, eventually, bankrupt.
The new development banks should, at least in theory, operate differently.
Mr Jacques Rogozinski, head of Mexico's Banobras, which has assets of some
Dollars 7bn, says he has no intention of lending for projects where the
money is not going to be repaid.
Where projects required a government subsidy, those subsidies should be
transparent. Private sector finance would be important in freeing government
funds for other areas where private finance was less viable, he said.
Private finance thus remains essential to squaring the infrastructure
circle. While some bankers emphasise that the securities markets can play an
important role along with banks in infrastructure finance, most experts in
the field remain pessimistic that anywhere near the kind of funds needed can
be generated. 'If you're asking whether the Dollars 60bn is going to be
found, I don't think it will be found,' Mr Rogozinski said.

FT  13 APR 94 / Los Angeles freeway reopened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world's busiest freeway, which collapsed in two places during an
earthquake in January, reopened on Monday night, marking the biggest success
yet in Los Angeles' massive disaster-recovery effort, Reuter reports from
Los Angeles.
For the first time since the 6.8-magnitude quake struck, traffic moved
across the full length of the Santa Monica Freeway, the city's main
east-west artery.
The reopening was originally planned for early yesterday - in time for
morning commuters - but crews finished their work with time to spare and
officials raced to the scene for a brief ceremony in time to make the
late-night newscasts.
Smiling proudly for the cameras, Governor Pete Wilson, US Transportation
Secretary Federico Pena and Mayor Richard Riordan removed a half-dozen
plastic orange cones from the roadway and the first cars passed seconds
later.
The closure of the freeway, which normally carries 300,000 motorists each
day across a 15-mile stretch between downtown Los Angeles and coastal Santa
Monica, had been a stark reminder of this year's seismic upheaval, which
killed 60 people, snapped freeway overpasses and made more than 20,000 homes
uninhabitable. Losses have been estimated at up to Dollars 20m (Pounds
13.6m), making it the second most costly natural disaster in US history
after Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
Work on mending the Santa Monica Freeway, also known as Interstate-10, began
on February 5. It reopened 73 days ahead of schedule, earning the
construction company CC Myers a bonus of Dollars 200,000 a day saved, or
Dollars 14.8m.
But even with the Santa Monica Freeway back to normal after Dollars
30m-worth of reconstruction, drivers may still have reason to worry. The Los
Angeles Times reported yesterday that in its haste to reopen the freeway,
the California Department of Transportation let two replacement bridges be
built with seismic weaknesses that must be corrected to prevent significant
damage in a future quake.
Commuters' headaches are not over yet. Repairs under way on the Golden State
Freeway and other main roads are expected to take months to complete.

<TEXT>
Guatemala's President Ramiro de Leon announced late on Monday the country's
powerful military would take charge of internal security in an effort to
combat violence and growing unrest, Reuter reports from Guatemala City.
'The army. . . will act with all its energy but within legal limits against
groups who have been committing acts of violence and creating a climate of
instability,' said Mr de Leon in a televised speech.
Mr de Leon called the national police force 'incapable' of ensuring order
but added the army's participation in his new security plan would not lead
to the militarisation of Guatemala. 'The government will maintain its
legalistic policies.'
Guatemala has been in a state of crisis for the past month with a series of
attacks on foreigners, assassinations and kidnappings, and Mr de Leon has
been under pressure to deliver tough solutions to combat unrest.
The president of the country's highest legal body, Mr Epaminondas Gonzalez,
61, was assassinated by gunmen outside his Guatemala City home 10 days ago.
Hysteria that foreigners might be stealing local children and selling their
organs for transplants has provoked three attacks on American tourists in
the past month.
An American journalist, Ms June Weinstock, from Fairbanks, Alaska is still
in a coma after an assault by peasants who beat her when she tried to
photograph a child in northern Guatemala.
Mr de Leon, once Guatemala's top human rights official and an outspoken
critic of the country's armed forces, was elected president in June last
year to replace former president Jorge Serrano, who was ousted after a
failed bid for dictatorial powers.

US producer prices for finished goods rose 0.2 per cent last month,
indicating that inflationary pressures at the wholesale level remain fairly
subdued, the Labour Department reported yesterday.
The increase excluding the volatile components of food and energy was also
0.2 per cent, in line with analysts' projections.
However, price indices for goods at an earlier stage of production were less
subdued, reflecting recent increases in commodity prices. The producer price
index for crude materials rose 2.8 per cent last month, following a 1.3 per
cent decline in February. Increases in the crude materials index tend to lag
increases in finished goods prices.
For the year to March prices for finished and crude goods were up 0.2 per
cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.

FT  13 APR 94 / Mitchell turns down Supreme Court offer
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senator George Mitchell of Maine yesterday withdrew his name from
consideration for the vacancy on the US Supreme Court on the grounds that he
could best serve President Bill Clinton by leading the Congressional effort
to pass healthcare reform.
The Democratic majority leader, the initial favourite to succeed the
retiring Justice Harry Blackmun, said Congress had 'a rare opportunity' to
pass 'comprehensive, meaningful healthcare reform and I don't want to do
anything to detract from that'.
Mr Mitchell, who has already announced his intention to leave Congress at
the end of the year, made up his mind on Monday afternoon and later met Mr
Clinton in the White House.
'He told me that he wanted to appoint me to the court,' Mr Mitchell said,
'but that he was concerned as I was about the prospect that the nomination
would affect my ability to serve as majority leader for the rest of the
session.' The president, he added, had 'reluctantly accepted' his arguments
for turning the Court appointment down.
The White House had been actively exploring ways in which the Senator might
be nominated, but still remain in Congress by delaying either a confirmation
vote or his swearing in as a justice until the end of the session.
Mr Mitchell may yet end up on the Court, possibly as Chief Justice. It is
widely assumed that Mr William Rehnquist, the conservative incumbent, will
stay on the bench until the 1996 election, not wishing to hand Mr Clinton
another opportunity to shape the Court. But should Mr Clinton or another
Democrat be returned, his retirement would be expected, with Mr Mitchell a
logical replacement.
The president has no shortage of alternatives for the Court. Leading
candidates are known to include Judge Jose Cabranes of Connecticut, who
could become the Court's first Hispanic member, Mr Drew Days, the solicitor
general and prominent black jurist, and two women, Judges Amalya Kearse and
Judith Kaye, both of New York.
Mr Mitchell's decision to say in Congress and fight for healthcare reform
underlines the high stakes of this pivotal item on the president's agenda.
Both the president and Mrs Hillary Clinton spent most of last week on the
road lobbying for their legislation.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The quest for a new Japanese prime minister took a fresh turn yesterday when
Mr Yohei Kono, president of the opposition Liberal Democratic party,
yesterday put himself up for the job.
His move was intended to prevent a split in the LDP, still the largest party
in the Japanese parliament, by calling the bluff of Mr Michio Watanabe, a
powerful LDP faction leader, who had been threatening to form his own party
and join the right wing of the ruling coalition.
Such a defection by Mr Watanabe would have reduced the LDP's strength in the
parliament, and Mr Kono's move put pressure on him to show his loyalty to
the party or declare his hand. Later, an aide of Mr Watanabe was quoted on
television as saying that he had decided not to press his challenge.
The LDP jockeying developed as members of Japan's chaotic seven-party
coalition tried to heal their own divisions following the power struggle
unleashed by last week's resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime
minister.
Leaders of the three right-wing coalition parties, representing a majority
of the alliance, again boycotted talks to discuss the leadership called by
the left wing, leaving them no closer to agreeing a candidate to replace Mr
Hosokawa.
But both sides made conciliatory statements afterwards, indicating that they
still want to try for an accord, rather than risk an early general election.
Japanese political analysts speculated that the coalition now had no option
but to try to work together again. The past few days have shown that neither
the left nor right wing can woo enough LDP defectors to achieve a majority.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, deputy prime minister and front-runner
for the succession, said he thought the alliance partners could overcome
their differences. Mr Hata is backed by the coalition's right wing.
There was an 'emotional wrangle' but the coalition framework had not yet
fallen apart, he claimed. Mr Hata was planning to depart today for the
ministerial meeting in Morocco of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, a possible sign that the coalition is closer to agreement.
Now was the time to 'cool off', said Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, head of Komeito,
the right-wing clean government party.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, leader of the New Harbinger party, which tends to the
left, said coalition members should 'try to overcome their differences and
make a new start'.
No members of the left wing, including the Social Democratic party, the
largest coalition member, have tried to veto Mr Hata as a candidate.
The row is over how to contain, to the left wing's satisfaction, the
influence of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist and joint
leader of Mr Hata's Japan Renewal party, who dominated the Hosokawa
administration.

FT  13 APR 94 / Finance minister warns on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, Japan's finance minister, yesterday warned that the
country's recession had not bottomed out, challenging the mild optimism
shown recently by the central bank and many private-sector economists.
The current political upheavals might dampen public confidence at a
'delicate stage' in the economic cycle, said Mr Fujii, commenting on the
latest monthly report by the government's Economic Planning Agency.
Personal spending showed a slight recovery last month, and housing starts
continued to climb, according to the EPA's report. However, industrial
production, representing nearly a third of Japan's gross domestic product,
was 'lacklustre' despite progress in reducing stocks of unsold goods. Output
has been falling for nearly 2 1/2 years. Company earnings, in their fourth
year of decline, remain weak, said the agency.
Ms Manae Kubota, EPA director general, was slightly less gloomy about her
agency's report than Mr Fujii. 'If there is not a big stumble, the economy
is headed in a good direction,' she said, citing as one risk a delay in
public works investment caused by the present political chaos.
This contrasts with the view of Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of
Japan, and shared by many private sector economists, that the recession is
near the trough and that the conditions for recovery are in place. The
consensus forecast is for a very gentle upturn, to 0.3 per cent growth in
gross domestic product this year, after last year's 0.1 per cent rise in
GDP.
Capital investment by industry continues to fall, suggest the latest weak
orders for machinery. The private sector spent 8.9 per cent less on
industrial machinery in February than the same month in the previous year,
and 7.3 per cent down from January.

FT  13 APR 94 / Asia set in economic fast lane: Recession in west unlikely
to dampen eastern boom, says bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor

<TEXT>
Asia's economic boom is set to continue over the next two years although
China remains at risk from overheating and India needs to enact further
far-reaching reforms, the Asian Development Bank said yesterday.
The annual Asian Development Outlook published by the Manila-based
institution forecast robust growth for Asia even though recovery in the
industrialised world, the market for many Asian exports, was expected to be
slow.
Growth was expected to be strong in all the main east and south-east Asian
economies outside Japan. Even the Philippines, the laggard of recent years,
is forecast to accelerate substantially. South Asia is also likely to see
healthy though unspectacular expansion.
Overall, Asia's developing countries are expected to grow 7.2 per cent in
each of 1994 and 1995 - compared with the bank's estimate for world growth
of 1.8 per cent this year and 3 per cent in 1995. Last year the figures were
7.4 per cent for Asia and 0.6 per cent for the world.
China, which has seen 13 per cent growth in each of the past two years, is
forecast to slow to 10 per cent this year and 9 per cent in 1995. But the
ADB warned: 'For the next two years, money supply and bank credit should be
tightly controlled to help prevent economic overheating.' Failure to prevent
overheating could seriously undermine financial sector reforms now under
way, it said.
The ADB saw potential for rapid growth in India, which has also undertaken
sweeping economic reform. However, it called for faster progress on tax and
subsidies, restructuring of the public sector and policy on closure of
lossmaking companies.
'The prospects for the Indian economy will depend on its success in
accomplishing a range of far-reaching and politically sensitive changes,' it
said.
The bank forecast a resurgence of growth in South Korea and Taiwan and
sustained rapid expansion in south-east Asia.
However, the bank noted that poverty remained a serious problem in many
Asian countries.
It also warned that Aids was a growing threat to the region, with India and
Thailand each feared likely to have 1m people infected with the HIV virus by
the end of the century.

FT  13 APR 94 / Korean monks still in dispute
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South Korean government said yesterday that it would not intervene to
settle a violent dispute affecting the country's main Buddhist sect.
Hundreds of riot police occupied the temple headquarters of the Chogye order
for a second day to prevent a new bout of fighting between conservative and
reformist monks.
Clashes at the temple in central Seoul on Sunday night left 38 people
injured and resulted in the arrest of 140 monks after the reformers tried to
storm the order's administration building.
The affair has placed the government of President Kim Young Sam in an
awkward position because of allegations that the conservative Chogye order
leadership diverted Dollars 1m (Pounds 600m) in religious donations to help
finance Mr Kim's 1992 presidential election campaign.
The government also fears alienating the Chogye order, which wields
considerable influence among voters. 'We're frankly surprised that what
appeared to be a relatively minor dispute has escalated so quickly,' said
one presidential aide.
The reformist monks are trying to turn the issue into an anti-government
campaign, claiming that the use of the riot police represented official
support for the Rev Suh Eui Hyun, the order's conservative administrative
head. The dispute stems from the reformist monks' opposition to Rev Suh's
re-election last week for a third consecutive term.
The government said the riot police were deployed to end the violence and
they would be withdrawn from the Chogye temple if the two factions agreed to
a truce. The opposition Democratic party has also criticised the government
for 'its one-sided support of Rev Suh's conservative forces'.

The Japanese government yesterday endorsed a product liability bill,
offering consumers improved protection against defective products. The move
follows nearly 20 years of debate.
Ms Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, hailed
the bill as marking 'a big turning point' for consumers and 'the biggest
reform effort for upgrading people's livelihood' under the current cabinet.
However, the bill has been criticised by lawyers and consumer groups as
inadequate.
Under the bill companies are only liable for 10 years after the products are
sold.
Companies are also exempted if they can show that the defect could not have
been foreseen even with up-to-date technology at the time of sale.
The bill, which is being introduced in parliament, could be implemented by
the middle of 1995.

FT  13 APR 94 / Oil market's eastern promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World consumption of energy in 2010 will be about 50 per cent higher than in
1991 because of strong economic growth in China and elsewhere in Asia,
according to a report published yesterday.
The study of world energy trends by the International Energy Agency and the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimated that growth
in energy demand outside the OECD area of industrialised countries would
increase by an average of 4 per cent a year to 2010. That compares with
overall worldwide growth of 2.1 per cent.
The report says an estimated 70 per cent increase in world gross domestic
product in the period will be the main cause of rising energy demand.
In the OECD energy demand would rise 28 per cent, but oil consumption would
increase only 18 per cent because industry and power generators are
switching to other fuels. Even so, dependence on imported oil, mainly from
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, would increase from 58
per cent in 1991 to 70 per cent in 2010 with a long-term decline in OECD oil
output.
Oil demand in the rest of the world would rise by 3.8 per cent a year, or by
about 1m barrels a day per year. By 2010 it could reach 38m b/d, some 20m
b/d more than in 1991. The report says the big Opec oil producers in the
Middle East and Venezuela would have to double their production over the
next 16 years to meet the projected demand.
Consumption of natural gas, widely seen as the most environmentally
acceptable of the fossil fuels, will grow by 2.1 per cent a year in the OECD
and by 5.6 per cent elsewhere. World coal demand is forecast to grow by 2.1
per cent a year, with China accounting for much of the rise.
The report warns that the projected growth in worldwide energy demand
implies a 50 per cent increase in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010.
Emissions in non-OECD countries would double.
Electricity is seen as the fastest-growing form of final energy demand, with
average per capita consumption expected to double in the non-OECD area. In
Asia that would mean a jump in power generation capacity to 285 gigawatts in
2010 from less than 100 gigawatts in 1990.

FT  13 APR 94 / Mediation hopes help financial rand recover

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The financial rand, South Africa's investment currency, yesterday staged a
partial recovery from Monday's record lows, as the arrival of international
mediators raised hopes of a solution to the fighting in Natal province ahead
of all-race elections in two weeks.
The financial rand closed in London at R5.3350 to the dollar, its rise of
30.85 cents on the day recouping half of Monday's loss. However, the
commercial rand, the main trading currency, continued to weaken, dipping
1.28 cents to R3.6053.
Distracted over concerns about the currency, markets had little initial
reaction to news from the African National Congress that its economic plan
for the first post-apartheid government, the Reconstruction and Development
Programme (RDP), would cost R39bn over five years. It was the first time the
ANC had put a price tag to its programme, but officials immediately sought
to allay fears about the cost by claiming that the programme would be funded
without raising taxes or foreign borrowing.
On releasing the seventh and 'final' draft of the RDP programme, Mr Trevor
Manuel, ANC economics head, said the RDP could be funded by the redirection
of government funds away from areas like defence to needs such as housing.
Meanwhile Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, was hopeful of solving the
country's constitutional dispute, as seven international mediators  -
including Lord Carrington, former British foreign secretary, and Mr Henry
Kissinger, former US secretary of state  - arrived in South Africa.

</DATELINE>

Israel and the PLO yesterday resolved two key security issues blocking the
long-delayed implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and
West Bank town of Jericho, but left many more problems outstanding for talks
which resume on Sunday.
Both sides said in Cairo they had made substantial progress in recent days
and had agreed the terms for a 9,000-strong Palestinian police force and a
timetable for the release of 5,000 Palestinian prisoners.
On the economic track of negotiations Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance
minister, said in Paris he had reached agreement with the PLO on most
sectors of economic relations between Israel and the future self-governed
areas and expected to end talks next week.
Violence flared again, however, in the occupied West Bank where Israelis
shot dead two Palestinians, including a pregnant woman, during clashes with
stone throwers. In Ramallah Israeli soldiers imposed a curfew and attacked a
Palestinian house with rockets before bulldozing it.
Under yesterday's agreements in Cairo, the first contingent of 6,000
Palestinian policemen will be deployed immediately after the two sides sign
a comprehensive self-rule accord. Each will be armed with an automatic
weapon.
The two sides also agreed that 5,000 of 8,500 Palestinian prisoners would be
released by Israel in the coming weeks. Israeli negotiators refused to meet
PLO demands for the release of some prisoners belonging to the Islamic
extremist Hamas movement.
Yet to be agreed in Cairo are the security zoning arrangements for the Gaza
Strip; details of the crossing points into the self-rule areas and rules for
military operations and joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols.
The adjournment of talks for four days removed any chance of a breakthrough
before tonight's deadline for completion of Israeli military withdrawal as
set out in last September's peace agreement.
In Paris Mr Shochat said the two sides had finalised accords covering
agriculture, industry and energy and were close to agreement on direct and
indirect taxation. Problems still to resolve are Palestinian demands for a
symbolic national currency, the rate of value added tax to be imposed; and
details of import and export duties, labour, tourism and insurance.
Neither side has said yet when they will sign a final comprehensive
agreement including economic, security and transfer-of-power issues.
Continued delay in implementing the agreement and Israel's heavy-handed
treatment of Palestinians has fuelled Arab disappointment and suspicion and
strengthened the hand of extremist groups opposed to the peace process.

FT  13 APR 94 / Camdessus casts a line to Algiers: A Dollars 1bn IMF gamble
to save Algeria from 'creeping Afghanisation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
has taken a huge gamble. So has General Liamine Zeroual, the Algerian head
of state. If they fail, neither the IMF nor the Algerian army will have
another chance to save north Africa's largest country from a fate which a
senior US official likened to one of 'creeping Afghanisation'.
Mr Camdessus has asked the board of the IMF to extend a Dollars 1bn (Pounds
680m) one-year standby loan to Algeria, which the board is expected to
approve by the end of the month. He has called on Algeria's foreign
creditors to follow the IMF and provide the country with a further Dollars
8bn-Dollars 9bn which it will need to pay its international way this year.
Of this total, Dollars 3.5bn would come from the rescheduling of the
principal repayments of debt owed to its sovereign creditors, who are due to
meet at a Paris Club meeting in mid-May; Dollars 1.5bn would come from the
World Bank, African Development Bank and Arab Monetary Fund loans; Dollars
1bn from the European Union; and the balance from export credits which would
be maintained at last year's level.
Algeria has already been asked to take its medicine. Three weeks ago the
price of nine staple foodstuffs - including flour, bread and milk - were
increased by between 25 and 100 per cent. This followed similar rises in the
cost of petrol and domestic fuel. Other increases are intended to follow.
The dinar has been devalued by 40 per cent and interest rates raised.
Measures to liberalise foreign trade are expected this week. A later stage
in the process will require state companies to shed excess labour.
Mr Redha Malek, the prime minister since last August, announced on Monday he
was resigning. Foreign observers do not agree on why. It may be that he
disagreed with the policy now openly pursued by Gen Zeroual of trying to
talk to those members of the banned fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS) who do not wish to see their country slide into total anarchy.
It may be that the head of state wanted to replace him with a technocrat who
carries no political weight and whose job is that of the surgeon, a man who
can be disposed of easily if the going gets rough.
Mr Mokdad Sifi, who is taking over, certainly fits that description. He
comes from Tebessa, a town close to the Tunisian border which has provided
many key figures to the Direction Generale de la Securite Nationale, the
fount of much power in Algeria over 30 years.
Days before Mr Malek's departure, Mr Camdessus had expressed, in an
interview with Algerian state television, much enthusiasm and hope about the
process of economic reform upon which he felt Algeria was embarking.
Many Algerians hope the IMF chief's judgment is better vindicated by events
than it was after the last agreement with the Fund. That accord, signed in
June 1991, was followed promptly by the dismissal of the then reformist
prime minister, Mr Mouloud Hamrouche. Mr Camdessus heaped praise on his
successor, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, whose policies went on in effect to destroy
the economic reforms to which the IMF had just given its imprimatur.
The position today is incomparably worse. Some 4,000 Algerians have died
since elections, which the FIS was poised to win, were suspended in January
1992. Fierce repression has not prevented large areas of Algeria, including
some cities, from slipping out of the state's control, notably at night. The
hardline Islamic Armed Group is committing acts of terror on ordinary
Algerians and has targeted foreigners, many of whom have fled the country.
Although this has helped bring Algeria's economy to its current state of
semi-collapse, a main factor has been the fall in world prices of
hydrocarbons, which account for 90 per cent of the country's foreign income.
Foreign debt repayments would, in the absence of an agreement with the
country's western creditors, absorb virtually all Algeria's forecast Dollars
9bn income this year.
As they consider the possible fate of a reform package now being put
together, the country's foreign creditors are, in the words of one senior
European banker, 'functioning on a wing and a prayer'.
So are 26m Algerians. As one sardonically commented: 'The difference is that
we are risking our lives while western countries are only risking their
money.'

FT  13 APR 94 / Belgium searches its colonial soul
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, insists there will be no 'out
of Africa' policy. But as more Belgian citizens were evacuated from Rwanda
yesterday, political soul-searching has started in Brussels.
Amid fears that this week's massacre may have had a distinct anti-Belgian
twist, with at least 16 expatriates having died in the violence, the
government now admits it is re-evaluating its policies towards its former
colonies, Rwanda and Burundi.
The process is likely to be painful. For since Belgium pulled out of Rwanda,
which it administered between 1917 and 1962, it has been treading a foreign
policy tightrope.
On the one hand, recognising that its colonial legacy could not allow it to
abandon the country, Belgium has been keen in recent years to provide
humanitarian support for Rwanda - with 1,500 Belgians in the country,
Belgian nationals have dominated aid agencies in the country, while Rwanda
and Burundi have absorbed BFr1bn (Pounds 190m) a year, by far the largest
slice of Belgium's overseas aid budget.
On the other hand, Belgium's own historical role in the country - which saw
it supporting the minority Tutsi group against the majority Hutus - has left
it opposed to becoming entangled in the country's internal political
disputes, in spite of calls that it should take a more active role.
In recent years, the Belgian government has preferred to operate under
United Nations auspices, sending some 400 troops into Rwanda in the
aftermath of the 1990 peace accord signed between the Rwandan factions in
Arusha.
But as fighting has raged in the past week, local radio stations have
repeatedly accused the Belgians of conspiring with the Tutsis, in support of
the rebels now advancing on the capital Kigali. And panic-stricken reports
from foreigners leaving the city have fuelled fears in Brussels of an
anti-colonial backlash. Mr Francois Nagurukiyintwali, Rwanda's ambassador in
Belgium, insists that these reports have been exaggerated.
And as Belgium's own coterie of African experts points out, the anti-Belgian
sentiment is probably confined to a minority. Mr Filip Reyntjens, professor
of Rwandan and Burundi studies at Antwerp university, believes that only a
small group on the right wing of the Hutu-dominated political parties are
actively anti-Belgian, although he concedes this sentiment is probably also
shared by parts of the army.
Nevertheless, some Belgian politicians are calling for a complete
withdrawal. Others, incensed at the sight of Belgian troops standing by in
the face of brutal massacres, are insisting that the only a thoroughgoing
intervention could guarantee peace.
The Belgian government has indicated that its paratroopers will probably
withdraw once the evacuation is completed, but insists that either
'abandonment' or full intervention is out of the question.
Officials stress that any policy re-evaluation is likely to take some weeks.
In the interim the government is focusing its diplomatic efforts on the UN.
Mr Willy Klaes, foreign minister, was last night due to meet Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, to discuss the future of UN operations
in the country.

Rwanda's five-day-old government fled the embattled capital Kigali yesterday
as rebels fought their way into the city in an attempt to seize power.
'We are converging on Kigali from all fronts. Government soldiers are
surrendering, but there is still heavy fighting in the city,' said Ms
Christine Umotoni, one of the leaders of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front
(RPF).
Six days of ethnic bloodletting have left an estimated 20,000 people dead.
There were fears that the conflict between Hutus and Tutsis, sparked by the
death of President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, in an air crash last
Wednesday, would engulf the entire densely-populated country in central
Africa.
Most of the 2,000 foreigners living in Rwanda have been evacuated. The last
French convoy left with about 100 French paratroopers and 80 refugees of
various nationalities, including 20 Rwandan nuns. Belgium and France closed
their embassies in Kigali yesterday.
The RPF said it would assist the evacuation by allowing the transit of road
convoys through rebel-held territory. It ordered a temporary halt to the
fighting along evacuation routes. The rebels, however, have rejected United
Nations attempts to mediate a ceasefire in the capital. Rwanda's entire
19-member cabinet, appointed after Gen Habyarimana's death, were seen
leaving the Hotel des Diplomates in downtown Kigali as the rebels moved into
the capital. The government convoy headed south with a heavy escort of armed
guards.
'It is our duty to stop the butchery in Kigali,' Ms Umotoni said. But she
could not predict how long the battle for the capital would last. 'It
depends on what kind of resistance we meet.' It is the RPF's first attempt
to take Kigali since the war began in 1990. The rebels, who are led by the
minority Tutsis, are trying to broaden their appeal by calling on the Hutu
majority to join them in government.
It is not yet clear whether this appeal will calm the fears of a distrustful
Hutu community. But the rebels point out that the first victims of the
bloodbath that followed President Habyarimana's death were members of his
Hutu government. It is believed that Ms Agathe Uliwingiyimana, the prime
minister who was a Hutu, and many of her cabinet colleagues were murdered by
renegade members of the presidential guard because they backed a peace
agreement with the Tutsi-led RPF.
'The peace accord is dead,' Ms Umotoni said. 'All the key government players
in the peace negotiations have been systematically eliminated by the
presidential guard.'
Anarchy and civil war have filled its place. The 2,500 UN military
observers, sent to Rwanda last October, have not intervened to halt the
killing spree in Kigali. The UN says it does not have the mandate to protect
Rwandan civilians.

President Lech Walesa yesterday signed into law Poland's 1994 budget, ending
weeks of speculation that he might veto it to show his disaffection with the
left-wing government. He signed the law two days before the Paris Club of
government creditors decides whether Poland has met all the conditions for
completion of a 50 per cent reduction of its official foreign debt under a
1991 agreement. The Paris Club is expected to clear the final 20 per cent
tranche of the agreement struck when Poland's official debt was about
Dollars 35bn (Pounds 23.9bn). The budget envisages a deficit of 83,000bn
zlotys (Pounds 2.5bn), equivalent to about 4.1 per cent of gross domestic
product and a limit acceptable to international financial institutions. It
also allows for a 4.5 per cent increase in GDP this year and annual
inflation of 23 per cent, compared with more than 37 per cent in 1993.

A Spanish parliamentary committee is to investigate fresh allegations
against Mr Mariano Rubio, former governor of the Bank of Spain, in the
latest of a series of embarrassing controversies facing the Socialist
government. Mr Rubio is due next week to appear before parliament's economy
committee to be questioned on allegations that he may have evaded tax on
investment gains while in office. The daily El Mundo newspaper last week
published reports claiming Mr Rubio had kept some Pta130m (Pounds 643,500)
in a secret account. Another case, over alleged illicit enrichment by the
former Civil Guard director, Mr Luis Roldan, another government appointee,
is already under investigation.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, said earlier he had defended Mr
Rubio 'in good faith' over his links with a failed private banking venture,
Ibercorp. Mr Rubio, who was Bank of Spain governor from 1984 to 1992, was
questioned by a parliamentary committee over the Ibercorp affair two years
ago. There was no proof that he had behaved improperly.

Finland plans to take part in Nato's Partnership for Peace plan for military
co-operation but it is not seeking new defence solutions, according to the
prime minister, Mr Esko Aho (pictured above right with Mr John Major, his UK
counterpart, on a London visit). He said, however, that the move was not a
step towards membership of Nato.
All non-Nato countries in Europe were invited to join the scheme two months
ago, but Mr Aho stressed that Finland's situation was different from that of
the former members of the Warsaw Pact. 'So Finland's role in this issue will
be different from that of the east European countries which have a security
policy interest in this,' he said. 'We only want to give our support.'

Post-election euphoria on the Italian stock market, particularly among small
investors, overwhelmed the Milan stock exchange yesterday. It was forced to
close early after two chaotic 'pre-opening' trading sessions. There has been
a surge in activity since the victory in last month's election of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi and his right-wing alliance. Volumes traded have sometimes
overtaken Wall Street.
The stock exchange council was last night debating how to relieve
administrative pressure at a particularly sensitive moment for the bourse's
development. Tomorrow Milan makes the final move to a full screen-based
trading system. Small orders, which take as long to process as large trades,
are at the root of the problems, but the council does not want to discourage
small investors, enticed into the market by Italy's successful privatisation
programme.

German industry expects to grow more quickly than previously predicted,
according to a survey of 356 leading companies by the Munich-based Ifo
economic research institute. Industrial production is expected to rise by
1.25 per cent this year, compared with predictions in a similar survey last
summer of a 0.5 per cent fall. A growth rate of 2.5 per cent is predicted
for 1995.
Many companies were so shocked by the intensity of last year's recession
that they were loath to predict any recovery, the report said, explaining
the sudden turnaround. Most branches of the economy expect real growth rates
in the second quarter compared with the corresponding period last year.
Higher export orders and growing demand in the engineering and car
industries are now set to lift production in these sectors by 1.75 per cent
this year and 4.5 per cent in 1995. However, output will only match mid-1989
production levels, the survey said. Sluggish demand in the west German
economy means consumer goods production is expected to shrink 1.25 per cent
this year before picking up 0.25 per cent next year.

FT  13 APR 94 / Politics makes Fininvest a public business: A conflict of
interest for owner of Italy's second biggest private company as he prepares
to govern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Close associates of Mr Silvio Berlusconi say the Italian media magnate has
become so taken by his new political role he is willing to turn his back on
his Fininvest business empire.
But even if Mr Berlusconi is infatuated with politics, he has done little to
resolve the serious conflict of interest between his role as a politician
and his ownership of Fininvest, Italy's second largest private company. This
issue is becoming increasingly urgent as he looks set to form the next
government.
During the past week Mr Berlusconi has floated the idea of creating an
American-style 'blind trust' for his stake in Fininvest. But he has given no
details; and neither a blind trust nor other possible solutions to the
potential conflicts of interest would be easy to implement.
Italian law is ill-equipped to cope with the sheer size of the problem.
Fininvest, with a L11,600bn (Pounds 4.8bn) turnover, has interests ranging
from television, advertising, publishing and telecommunications to
retailing, insurance, pensions funds, healthcare and sport.
Legal experts say the US blind instrument would not be easy to adapt to
circumstances in which a company controls activities of public interest,
such as television.
For another thing, the US blind trust envisages an essentially 'caretaker'
management which is not easily compatible with the re-organisation at
Fininvest designed to reduce massive debt in a group barely showing profit.
In 1993 debt totalled L3,800bn, a third of turnover.
Last October Mr Berlusconi appointed Mr Franco Tato from his publishing arm,
Mondadori, as the group's first chief executive. Since Mr Berlusconi
formally entered politics in January, Mr Tato has, in effect, been in
charge. But in the terms of the US blind administration, Mr Tato would not
be able to make the kind of strategic choices Fininvest needs: he has to
decide whether Fininvest should remain a conglomerate or concentrate on its
core media business.
The setting up of a satisfactory blind trust is complicated by the secretive
tax shelter nature of the Berlusconi family's ownership structure of
Fininvest and the fact that it is not a quoted company.
According to Fininvest officials, Mr Berlusconi and his family own 51 per
cent of the company. The remainder is held on their behalf through two trust
companies, Servizio Italia and Saf, set up by BNL, the big state commercial
bank.
Mr Berlusconi has never revealed the precise ownership split between his own
stake and that of the rest of his family, but he is understood to exercise
full control.
Another means of distancing Mr Berlusconi from the conflict of interest
would be to place his stake in Fininvest into a special foundation in favour
of his five children, the two eldest of whom are already on the board of the
group. Though attractive, this solution risks creating big tax liabilities
under existing company law.
The other mooted solution involves divestiture of Fininvest assets,
especially those most likely to clash with Mr Berlusconi's role in
government - such as television. Divestiture, however, would be neither
quick nor simple.
For instance, the value of Fininvest's three commercial television channels,
which account for 45 per cent of the national audience, depends on how the
new government and parliament choose to review the 1990 legal distribution
of state and commercial networks.
If Fininvest were obliged to divest one channel, the value of that channel
would be hard to gauge since all three channels currently rely on the same
transmission facilities and enjoy a common library of film stock.
Unless Mr Berlusconi were forced into a 'fire sale', divestiture of all or
part would take considerable time. Fininvest would want to hold out for the
best price; while any big asset sale would involve unravelling the group's
complex debt and fiscal structure.
For instance, Fininvest managers have been trying to find suitable
purchasers for the Standa stores chain for more than a year to reduce the
heavy burden of the group's debt.
Mr Berlusconi, who bought Standa in 1988, spent almost L1,000bn on the deal
and subsequent investments. Standa, itself a loss-maker with a current book
value written down to L500bn, has been sweetened by the inclusion of other
retailing interests, including Euromercato, and is now believed to be worth
L1,300bn.
Talks with Germany's Karlstadt and Carrefour of France have so far failed to
produce a deal.
It is not hard to see why Mr Berlusconi favours a blind trust: Fininvest
would be retained more or less intact. But for a blind trust to have the
minimum of credibility, the operation would require transparency from what
has been one of the most opaque groups in the Italian private sector.
Whatever Mr Berlusconi decides, government policies are likely to cross
Fininvest interests at every turn. The company, for instance, would benefit
from any liberalisation of the state-controlled telecommunications regime,
in particular access to telephone lines for television image transmission or
new laws favouring cable and pay-TV; Fininvest's publishing interests would
benefit from the ending of the newspaper/magazines distribution monopoly
through kiosks; Fininvest's insurance business would benefit from Mr
Berlusconi's plans to accelerate the introduction of private pension funds.
Mr Berlusconi risks having to explain continually that he or his family are
not beneficiaries of government policy. And if he fails to distance himself
satisfactorily from Fininvest, he will play into the hands of those who have
claimed all along that he entered politics to protect his business
interests.

FT  13 APR 94 / Forza Italia begins change from force to party
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Forza Italia has begun to confront the problem of converting itself from a
movement backing Mr Silvio Berlusconi's political ambitions into a proper
political party, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The full-time post of party secretary has been created to co-ordinate a
permanent five-strong secretariat. Mr Berlusconi will be chairman but the
principal organisational role is expected to be carried out by Mr Domenico
Mennitti, the new secretary.
A 54-year-old journalist and executive in Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest group,
Mr Mennitti is a former parliamentary deputy for the neo-fascist MSI who
defected to Forza Italia before the election. One of his first tasks will be
to carry out proper checks on the more than 13,000 Forza Italia clubs formed
over the past five months throughout Italy. This applies in particular to
the south.
Yesterday, Ms Tiziana Parenti, a former Milan investigative magistrate who
was elected as a Forza Italia deputy, warned that the clubs could be
infiltrated by the Mafia. She was speaking during a two-day conference of
newly-elected Forza Italia deputies preparing for the opening of parliament
on Friday.
The previous day Ms Parenti, a possible ministerial candidate, criticised Mr
Berlusconi for failing to act more quickly to separate Forza Italia as a
political movement from the organisational structure of his Fininvest
empire. Forza Italia was set up and run by executives on secondment from
Fininvest, mainly using the network of representatives of Publitalia, the
group's advertising arm.
'I regret that we have to have gentlemen from Publitalia running the next
political phases of our movement,' Ms Parenti said. At least 40 executives
are understood to have taken unpaid leave from Fininvest to help fight the
election.
In reply to this continued Fininvest linkage with Forza Italia, Mr
Berlusconi said his company executives must now decide whether they were to
devote themselves to politics or return to business. The names of the people
likely to form the five-strong secretariat are all Fininvest employees.

Denmark's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate reached a record 12.6 per
cent in February, compared with 12.5 per cent the month before and 11.9 per
cent in February last year, according to the official statistical office.
Unemployment has been forecast to fall this year as a result of a government
job creation programme and recovery in the economy. Labour market reform has
given full-time workers paid leave so that the unemployed can fill their
posts for a short period. The statistical office attributed the unemployment
rise to delays in implementing other 'workfare' and job training programmes.
These problems were blamed by Mr Mogens Lykketoft, finance minister, for
increasing unemployment by about 20,000. Hilary Barnes, Copenhagen
France's consumer price index rose a provisional 0.2 per cent in March from
the previous month and advanced 1.5 per cent year-on-year, the national
statistics institute Insee reported yesterday. Since the beginning of the
year, the index has risen by 0.6 per cent, according to Insee.
Producer prices in the Netherlands rose 0.3 per cent in February from the
previous month but fell by 0.7 per cent from a year earlier, the central
statistics bureau said yesterday. In January the index was up 0.2 per cent
on the previous month, and 0.8 per cent lower than a year earlier. The
Swedish debt office reported yesterday that the public sector borrowing
requirement last month was SKr18.5bn (Pounds 1.59bn). It also estimated a
borrowing requirement of SKr5.9bn for April.

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission was yesterday poised to take Greece to the European
court over its blockade of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. An
intensive round of last-minute diplomacy apparently failed to persuade
Athens to back down over the issue.
The move could face the Commission with an unprecedented institutional
crisis.
A meeting of commissioners in Brussels today is expected to ask the European
Court of Justice to begin the legal proceedings against Greece, on the
grounds that the Greek action is in contravention of article 225 governing
European Union commercial policy.
It follows an ultimatum to Greece to remove its blockade or provide fresh
reasons for its action.
Although legal cases against member states normally take about 18 months to
pass through the court, Brussels is likely to ask for an emergency interim
judgment, which would probably take three to six weeks.
Commission officials yesterday said they were confident the court would find
for them. But with Greece showing little sign of backing down, and member
states apparently reluctant to provoke a head-on collision with Athens over
the issue, they admitted that it remained unclear how far any court ruling
could be enforced in the absence of a broader political agreement.
Under the newly revised article 171 of the Maastricht treaty the European
court has powers to fine a member state for a transgression of EU law, but
it has not yet done so.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway has secured three contracts valued at an estimated NKr8bn (Pounds
746m) to supply a total of 13bn cubic metres of natural gas to Britain,
Germany and Spain.
The biggest of the three export contracts announced yesterday has been
agreed with Mobil Erdgas-Erdol of Germany, which is to take 10bn cubic
metres (10 bcm) of gas over an 18-year period, commencing in 1996.
Enagas of Spain is being supplied with close to 1 bcm of associated gas from
Norwegian North Sea oil fields over a two-year period ending in March 1996.
But the Pounds 100m deal for Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, and
Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest publicly quoted company, to supply Britain's
ScottishPower with 1.7 bcm from the Froey field from the end of next year is
expected to bring to a head a three-year conflict over imports of Norwegian
gas by Britain which Norway claims are being blocked by the British
government.
The impasse centres on a deal valued at more than NKr20bn agreed in 1991 for
Norway to supply National Power, the UK utility, with 30.8 bcm of gas over
14 years through the Frigg gas pipeline. The British government insists that
a treaty covering the supply of Frigg gas to Britain through the Frigg
pipeline will have to be amended in order for new supplies from Norway to
make their way to the UK.
The Norwegians disagree and have privately expressed fears that the British
government will not approve the deal because of the political sensitivities
of importing foreign gas at a time when UK coal pits are being closed and
because of indigenous UK gas which could meet domestic demand.
Under the terms of the Frigg treaty, only Frigg field gas can be transported
through the Frigg pipeline.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'Today is a politics day,' said Canadian Major Roy Thomas, the senior UN
military observer in Bosnia, yesterday, revealing the degree to which the UN
is relying on the diplomatic skills of Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special
envoy, to extricate it from the rapidly escalating confrontation with the
Serbs.
When Bosnian Serb leaders broke off relations with the UN on Monday, after
Nato launched air strikes, they named Mr Churkin as the sole channel of
communication.
Mr Churkin, who seems a personification of diplomacy, has now emerged as the
central figure in the bid to stop fighting in Bosnia and bring the
protagonists back to the negotiating table.
Yesterday he was on his usual diplomatic shuttle, the only mediator with
access to both the Bosnian government and the Bosnian Serbs, after Mr
Radovan Karadzic, Bosian Serb leader, on Monday refused to meet Mr Charles
Redman, the US special envoy.
His diplomatic finesse extends beyonds Bosnia. Last month, at the Russian
embassy in Zagreb, he hosted a series of marathon talks between the Croatian
government and the breakaway Serb state of Krajina, which led to a so-far
effective ceasefire and raised hopes for a broader agreement.
Equally at home in Pale, the deserted ski resort which the Bosnian Serbs use
as their mountain capital, or in the swimming pool at Vougliameni, the
exclusive hotel near Athens where talks were held last year on the ill-fated
Vance-Owen plan, Mr Churkin has become increasingly confident in his own
ability to hammer out a settlement where others have failed.
But Mr Churkin is an unusually smart and professional operator, far removed
from the cameo image of a plodding and suspicious Soviet diplomat. A stint
at the Soviet embassy in Washington early in his career has also equipped
him with an impressive command of English, which further aids his assets as
a mediator.
Mr Churkin is now facing the biggest challenge of his career.
On Monday, after Nato had launched air strikes on Serb targets which were
attacking Gorazde, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, he contacted Mr
Redman to express Russia's dismay at not having been consulted, suggesting
that if it had been 'we might have been able to do something'.
He also conveyed Russian concern that the air strikes should target only
weapons directly firing at UN positions. Moscow sought assurances that Nato
would not hit Bosnian Serb command posts, let alone civilians.
Clearly, before Nato took such drastic action he would have liked to have
had the chance to pull another rabbit out of the hat, as he did in February
with his eleventh- hour announcement that Russian peacekeepers would be
deployed in Sarajevo.
On that occasion, air strikes were averted as Bosnian Serbs were able to
obey Nato's ultimatum without loss of face.

Relations between Ukraine and Crimea were tense yesterday, following Monday
night's takeover by Crimean President Yuri Meshkov of the Crimean branches
of the Ukrainian Internal Affairs and Security ministries.
The pro-Russian Mr Meshkov has sought greater autonomy from Kiev since his
election as Crimea's first president in January, but has become far more
confrontational since an overwhelming vote favouring the policy on March 27.
Observers fear that Mr Meshkov's moves, bitterly opposed by Ukrainian
President Leonid Kravchuk, could escalate into a conflict with Russia.
Nearly 70 per cent of Crimea's population is Russian.
At the same time, crisis talks began in Kiev yesterday to resolve the
weekend's armed confrontations between Russian and Ukrainians in the Black
Sea fleet.
At the end of last week Russian sailors defied Ukrainian orders and seized
one of the fleet's ships. Ukraine retaliated by attacking a Russian naval
base and arresting three Russian officers.
President Kravchuk's chief domestic adviser, Mr Nikolai Mikhailchenko,
yesterday accused both Russia and Crimea of provoking conflicts and
destroying opportunities to find compromises.
'Meshkov has begun the path of direct confrontation by making such sharp
moves,' he said, referring to Crimea's refusal to accept a Kiev presidential
representative and order to restrict local conscripts from serving elsewhere
in Ukraine, creating a de facto separate Crimean army.
Mr Meshkov has also replaced Kiev's appointees with his own in the two key
national ministries.
President Kravchuk's ability to focus on these issues has been hindered by
continued uncertainty in Kiev's domestic parliamentary elections, under way
for the last three weeks and not yet concluded.
International observers yesterday also raised serious concerns about the
fairness of the elections.
They cited pressuring of voters in rural regions, a politicised, poorly
functioning central electoral commission and instances where access was
denied to foreign observers at polling stations.
After two rounds of elections, some 337 seats in the 450-seat parliament are
now filled. Most of the remaining 113 will go to a third round of voting at
a date yet to be decided.
So far Mr Kravchuk has lost half his government, including his prime
minister, and the formation of a new government will be delayed at least
until May, when the new parliament is due to meet for the first time.
Mr Kravchuk is also preoccupied with trying to delay his own presidential
elections, now scheduled for June 26, and establishing a strong presidential
republic, at the same time as his adversaries are working to reduce his
position to that of a figurehead.

FT  13 APR 94 / Russia, Belarus agree on monetary union
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Russia and Belarus yesterday unexpectedly concluded a monetary union treaty
which will reintroduce the Russian rouble to the small Slav republic within
the next few months.
The treaty was signed by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister,
and his Belarus counterpart, Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, after a day of
last-minute negotiations.
It has been fiercely attacked by Russian reformers and ultra-nationalists
alike as giving too much away to a country which has everything to gain but
little to offer.
Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the Russian central bank
chairman, see the deal as helping Russian enterprises to restore
Soviet-style trading links. But progress has been held up by the need to
resolve objections from both sides.
Mr Sergei Alexashenko, Russian deputy finance minister, said the agreement
was supposed to be carried out in stages, although he also said 'everything
may have changed in the 24 hours leading up to the signing'.
In a first stage Russia and its neighbour, most of whose enterprises depend
on trade and energy supplies from Russia, would abolish customs barriers and
unify the two countries' tariff regimes.
In a second stage, Mr Alexashenko said Belarus had promised  - at Russia's
insistence  - to hold a referendum on its people's willingness to limit the
republic's sovereignty and liquidate its central bank. This would be needed
for Russia's central bank to take over the functions of the Belarus central
bank.
The third stage would tackle the crucial issue of the exchange rate at which
roubles would be substituted for Belarus's ailing surrogate currency, the
'zaichik'. Belarus initially insisted on a one-to-one exchange rate, while
Russia said the true exchange rate was closer to 3:1. Belarus then sought a
separate but more generous rate for individuals' savings, but Russia opposed
this as open to abuse by enterprises.
The final sticking point  - Belarus's demands for subsidised energy prices
from Russia  - was due to be postponed until the end of the year, by which
time Russian prices may almost match world prices.
The conservatives leading Belarus, who have achieved very little in terms of
economic reform so far, are clearly hoping the deal will boost their chances
of retaining power in the country's first presidential elections. Such a
deal would conveniently postpone the implementation of terms costly to
Russia and cumbersome for Belarus.

FT  13 APR 94 / Spain offers cash to buyers of new cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish government yesterday began offering cash incentives to persuade
owners of old cars to trade in their vehicles for new ones in an attempt to
revive flagging sales.
The scheme follows a similar move by the French government in February,
which has had an immediate impact in boosting new car sales above last
year's depressed level.
There is growing speculation that the new Italian government may also follow
the French and Spanish lead.
The Spanish government is offering Pta100,000 (Pounds 490) each time a car,
which is more than 10-years old, is scrapped in exchange for a new car. The
offer is due to run for six months. Carmakers have also announced incentives
of up to Pta200,000 in addition to the government's cash offer.
In France the government is contributing FFr5,000 (Pounds 585) until the end
of June next year for the withdrawal of old cars for new. The government
expects that the cost of the scheme will be balanced by higher VAT receipts
as a result of increased sales. It is forecasting an increase in new cars
sales of around 10 per cent this year.
In Spain the cash incentive is being offered as a Pta100,000 discount on the
13 per cent licensing tax levied on new cars. The total tax on cars is 28
per cent, including the 15 per cent value-added tax.
Around 37 per cent of the 13m cars on Spanish roads are 10 years old or
more. New car sales fell by 24 per cent last year to 744,000 units from
980,000 a year earlier, although demand has begun to recover in the first
two months of this year. Spanish car production fell last year by 16 per
cent to 1.5m.
In Italy, speculation that a new right-wing government would copy the French
and Spanish moves has already helped to boost Fiat's share price this week.
In Paris, the share price of the PSA Peugeot Citroen group has also been
helped by the Spanish government's move to stimulate new car sales. The
French carmaker led the Spanish market last year with a share of 20.2 per
cent.
In the UK motor industry leaders have called for incentives to encourage
scrapping of older cars to cut pollution. All new petrol-driven cars are
fitted with catalytic converters and exhaust emissions from new cars have
been cut to only a fraction of the exhaust emission levels of older
vehicles.

FT  13 APR 94 / Schneider Chief missing as threat to group mounts: German
company debts may total Pounds 3bn - Banks to hold talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Jurgen Schneider group, one of Germany's most prominent property
developers, is on the verge of collapse with banks owed up to an estimated
DM8bn (Pounds 3.2bn).
Bank creditors were yesterday summoned to an emergency meeting after the
company's charismatic founder and chief executive stepped down and went
missing.
More than 40 banks will meet tomorrow to consider Schneider's fate.
Financial information on the privately owned group is scarce. Estimates of
its total debts ranged between DM3bn and DM8bn, while the value of its 85
prestigious properties in Germany was placed at between DM5bn and DM8bn.
The collapse of Schneider would be one of the largest insolvencies in the
German property sector since the second world war. Fears of the knock-on
effects hit shares in German banks yesterday. Deutsche Bank  - believed to
be owed more than DM1bn  - dropped by DM17.50 to DM791.50, well ahead of the
overall market's decline.
The crisis follows the resignation and disappearance of Mr Jurgen Schneider,
a 59-year-old property developer. He had specialised in restoring elegant
historical buildings throughout Germany from his base in a castle in
Konigstein, a fashionable town just outside Frankfurt.
The Schneider group said Mr Schneider had resigned on medical advice
following an unspecified illness developed since Easter, and that his
whereabouts were unknown.
The group's remaining board members said they were 'thunderstruck' by the
circumstances of his departure, stressing that his absence denied the
company access to significant sources of funds and forced it to turn to its
bankers.
The events follow a long period of speculation about the group's financial
soundness. It was triggered by rapid expansion, particularly in eastern
Germany, combined more recently with widespread complaints in the building
sector over Schneider's slowness in paying creditors.
In February, Mr Schneider told a German newspaper the group was financially
sound, but this did little to stop the rumours.
Property analysts said yesterday that if Schneider collapsed, it would have
a big impact on confidence in the highly fragmented German commercial
property sector. The sector has been depressed in the past two years, but
has avoided the spectacular crashes in other economies, particularly in the
UK and the US.
The impact on the market overall is likely to be limited by the quality of
the group's properties. They include the Berheimer Palace in Munich, the
Hotel Rose in Wiesbaden and two prestige shopping developments in Frankfurt
 - the Schiller Passage and the Zeilgalerie.
Schneider also owns the Madler Passage in Leipzig, within which is Auerbachs
Keller, where Mephistopheles proved a devilish drinking partner in Goethe's
play Faust.
Of the group's 85 large properties, 32 are believed to be located in
Leipzig, making the company by far the biggest private investor in the
eastern German city.
The city's lord mayor summoned journalists yesterday to tell them that
Schneider's difficulties would not have a financial knock-on effect for
Leipzig, denying rumours that Schneider owns virtually the whole of the
city's historic centre.
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, said its lending to Schneider was
secured on individual properties. The lending is thought to have been made
via the group's Mannheim office and Deutsche Centralbodenkredit, a property
financing subsidiary.
Hypo-Bank, a large Bavarian bank specialising in property lending, said it
was owed a significant sum, but far less than Deutsche Bank; analysts said
this meant an exposure of up to DM500m.

FT  13 APR 94 / Howard forced to promise fresh curbs on video 'nasties'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Faced with almost certain defeat in the Commons, Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, was yesterday forced to agree to introduce tighter restrictions
on the circulation of so-called video 'nasties' which glorify crime and
violence.
Breaches of the new law, to be included in the criminal justice and public
order bill, could involve fines up to Pounds 20,000 and/or a prison term of
up to two years.
Mr Howard was involved in a day of frenzied political bargaining as some 80
Conservative backbenchers joined about 170 other MPs in supporting a move by
Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP, to strengthen the existing law.
Mr Alton had sought to insert a new provision in the bill to prevent the
hiring for home viewing of videos that might cause psychological harm to a
child. Such a provision was originally dismissed as 'unworkable' by the home
secretary, but he was forced to change his ground as support for the demand
for tougher penalties spread across party lines in the Commons.
Sir Ivan Lawrence QC, the Tory MP who chairs the cross-party home affairs
committee, and other prominent government backbenchers joined Mr Tony Blair,
Labour's shadow home secretary, in signalling support for Mr Alton.
Mr Howard was left in no doubt by the government's business managers that he
would have to give ground. He then promised to introduce a new provision in
the bill incorporating the criteria advocated by Mr Alton.
As a result, the British Board of Film Classifications will be under a
statutory duty to take account of the likelihood of psychological harm being
caused to children when deciding which age groups should be given access to
videos for home viewing. The penalty for allowing access to videos outside
the permitted age category will be increased to include a fine of Pounds
5,000 and/or a term of imprisonment of up to six months.
Those who distribute 'pirate' videos unable to satisfy any of the age
categories will face fines of up to Pounds 20,000 and/or a prison sentence
of up to two years.
Mr Howard told the Commons he would consider whether the most violent videos
already on release could be reclassified.
His climbdown was approved by a group of senior ministers at Downing Street,
including Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip,
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, and Lord Wakeham, chairman of the
cabinet home affairs committee.
Some Conservative MPs said Mr Howard had mishandled the video issue by
failing to appreciate the strength of feeling on the backbenches until it
was almost too late. However, others said his room for manoeuvre had been
limited by the unworkability of Mr Alton's proposals.
Labour will use the deal as a platform for a broad attack on Mr Howard
tomorrow.

FT  13 APR 94 / Serbs hold UN observers and refuse to meet envoys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Serb forces in Bosnia were last night holding more than 30 United Nations
observers  - some at gunpoint  - as the US and Russia called for a return to
negotiations over the country's future.
Despite the call, the Serbs refused to meet UN officials, including Mr
Yakushi Akashi, the UN special representative, and General Bertrand de
Lapresle, head of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, who arrived in Sarajevo.
France also accused Bosnian Serbs of hostage-taking, saying that 11 French
relief workers had been arrested on charges of trying to smuggle ammunition
into Sarajevo.
Meanwhile, President Clinton warned Bosnia's Moslem leadership not to take
advantage of Nato's air raids against the Serbs to mount new offensives.
Earlier, Moslem forces defending the enclave of Gorazde had broken an
overnight lull in the fighting by opening fire with mortars on Serb troops
surrounding the city.
Mr Clinton also said he had been encouraged by calls from Russia for a
withdrawal of Serb forces from their newly acquired territory in the Gorazde
area.
However, the US and Russia continued to differ over the legitimacy of using
Nato air power. President Clinton said it was possible that air strikes
might be used to protect not only Gorazde but five other UN-designated 'safe
areas' in Bosnia.
But President Boris Yeltsin of Russia reaffirmed his view that the use of
force by outside powers would not solve the Bosnian issue. He warned that
continued air attacks could prolong the war.
Mr Yeltsin, concluding a visit to Spain, said: 'In that part of the world,
we can only think of a negotiated solution.'
He confirmed the chill in east-west relations by saying that Russia, which
has given conflicting signals about its intentions, was now in 'no hurry' to
enter the Partnership for Peace arrangement proposed by Nato. This was a
surprisingly cool response to the proposal.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, yesterday insisted that Nato had
acted correctly in authorising air attacks on Serb forces and that there had
been no need for consultation with any government  - including Russia  -
before the strikes went ahead.
However, he sought to soothe Moscow's concern over the attacks by hinting
that consultation with other governments might precede future air strikes.
'Wherever it is militarily practicable, it is to wise to seek the support of
those countries that supported that resolution.'
Also yesterday in a show of defiance, Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb
leader, and General Ratko Mladic, commander of Bosnian Serb forces, said
they would shoot down any Nato aircraft flying over their territory.
Western officials said they doubted whether the Serb forces around Gorazde,
believed to number 10,000 men and to be using about 25 tanks, had
anti-aircraft guns sophisticated enough to threaten advanced Nato aircraft.

FT  13 APR 94 / Virgin taps into US market with Delta seats deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Branson yesterday stepped up his challenge to British Airways by
announcing a transatlantic partnership between Virgin Atlantic Airways and
Delta Air Lines, the third-largest US carrier. The deal could be worth
Pounds 150m in additional annual revenues for Virgin.
The partnership will help secure Virgin's longer-term future by enabling the
specialised long-haul UK carrier to tap into one of the biggest US airline
domestic networks, Mr Branson said.
It follows recent international airline alliances including an equity stake
taken by BA in USAir and a marketing agreement between Lufthansa of Germany
and United Airlines, the second-largest US carrier.
The Delta-Virgin deal does not include any equity investment, but Mr Branson
and Mr Ron Allen, Delta's chairman, said the door was open for an eventual
exchange of equity.
Under the partnership  - which still requires approval by the UK and US
governments  - Delta will purchase between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of
seats on Virgin flights to London from seven US airports  - Los Angeles, New
York JFK, New York Newark, Miami, San Francisco, Orlando and Boston.
Delta will independently price, market and sell the seats on flights, which
will carry Delta and Virgin flight codes.
Mr Branson said the so-called blocked-space and code-sharing agreements from
the US would provide additional revenues of between Pounds 100m and Pounds
150m a year for Virgin and absorb excess capacity on Virgin's current North
Atlantic services. Virgin expects to report a pre-tax profit of around
Pounds 10m this year on revenues of about Pounds 600m before the additional
revenues from the Delta deal, which is due to begin in November.
The scheme will not operate in the same way for Virgin passengers flying
from the UK to the US. Instead, Virgin flights to the US will link up with
conventional interline agreements with Delta flights, without full ticket
code-sharing.
Starting in July, members of each airline's frequent-flyer programme will be
able to earn and redeem points on the other.
The deal will enable Delta  - which operates a fleet of 563 aircraft and
carried 83m passengers last year compared with Virgin's 1.5m  - to offer
services under its own flight codes to London's Heathrow airport.
Delta, which currently operates flights out of London's Gatwick airport, had
been pressing the US government to negotiate a new 'open skies' agreement
with the UK to give it access into Heathrow. Under the current agreement,
only American Airlines and United can fly into Heathrow.
Delta stepped up negotiations with Virgin after Washington agreed last month
to extend BA's code-sharing rights with USAir for an additional 12 months
without securing greater access for US carriers into Heathrow.
'We still want to fly into Heathrow and we want open skies but we've also
got to play by the house rules,' Mr Allen said.
The Virgin-Delta deal comes just 10 days before a New York court hears a
Dollars 1bn anti-trust lawsuit brought by Virgin against BA.

FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Credit Mutuel 6% advance
'satisfactory'

<TEXT>
Credit Mutuel, the French banking group, saw net profits rise by 6 per cent
to FFr1.6bn (Dollars 270m) in 1993 from FFr1.5bn in 1992, despite the
pressures on the banking market,
Mr Etienne Pflimlin, chairman, described the group's 1993 performance as
'satisfactory'.
However, he was less optimistic about the outcome for this year due to the
unstable economic situation and changes in interest rates.
French banks last year continued to be affected by the weak credit demand
and high property provisions that have plagued them throughout the early
1990s. Credit Mutuel, according to Mr Pflimlin, reversed the general trend
by faring well in commercial activities but badly in market trading.
It saw net banking income increase by 10.1 per cent to FFr18.4bn in 1993
from FFr16.7bn in 1992, with gross operating profits rising by 23.8 per cent
over the same period to FFr6.5bn from FFr5.2bn.
The group was, however, forced to make provisions of FFr2.08bn, roughly the
same level as in 1992.

<TEXT>
Sri Lanka's economy grew 6.7 per cent in 1993 compared with 5.6 per cent in
1992, according to Mr HB Dissanayake, central bank governor, Reuter reports
from Colombo.
'There was a significant growth in the manufacturing, industrial and service
sectors. Tourism went up and construction grew,' he said. The upward trend
would go on as long as market-oriented policies were continued.
He said both direct foreign investment and portfolio investment had
increased considerably in 1993. Inflation was now at 11-12 per cent, down
from 20 per cent a few years ago. The authorities say inflation will remain
high as long as the country needs to spend large amounts on security and
defence.
Sri Lanka spends around SRs20bn (Dollars 408m) each year to fight Tamil
separatist rebels who are trying to carve out a state for the minority Tamil
community in the north and east. Tamil separatist rebels have denied
involvement in bomb attacks on tourist hotels in the capital Colombo last
week. Tamils said the denial by the main rebel group, the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam, was carried on rebel radio on Sunday.

Russia and Ukraine yesterday reached an agreement under which Kiev will
clear its huge debt arrears to the Russian gas company Gazprom by July,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Rem Vyakhirev, Gazprom head, announced the agreement after negotiations
in Moscow with Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk. The two
sides estimated the debt arrears at about Dollars 600m, compared with
previous Gazprom estimates of Dollars 900m. Half the debt to Gazprom for
deliveries in 1993 and the first quarter of this year will be paid in the
form of property, possibly including a stake in Ukrainian gas pipelines and
storage facilities. The two sides are due to meet again on May 10 to discuss
implementation of the deal, which lifts the threat of a cut-off in supplies
to Ukraine.

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European carmakers and automotive components suppliers yesterday launched a
joint initiative aimed at improving the often hostile relationships between
the two sides of the motor industry.
The two European trade associations representing the vehicle-makers and
their suppliers agreed a set of guidelines to encourage improved
co-operation. The aim is to improve the competitiveness of the European
motor industry as it seeks to restructure to meet the fierce challenge from
the US and Japan.
The protocol agreed yesterday will determine 'fundamental principles' and
'framework for co-operation.'
The industry associations accepted that the guidelines could not give a
legal or contractual definition to the relationship between vehicle-makers
and component suppliers.
Improving relations has been seen as pivotal in raising the sector's
international competitiveness, but the positive rhetoric has seldom been
matched by practical steps.
A recent report in the UK sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry
and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders was highly critical. 'The
mistrust which is in evidence is the result of many years of broken
promises, abuse of confidence, and general acrimony in the industry,' it
said.
The guidelines agreed yesterday seek to create greater transparency in
negotiations over costs and prices; to improve co-operation in design and
manufacturing processes; to promote the effective adoption of modern
manufacturing processes and to spread continuous quality improvement.

FT  13 APR 94 / Telecoms deal 'ends monopoly set-up in EU'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's deal between 30 of Europe's leading multinationals and a small
group of telecommunications operators marks the effective end of telecoms
monopolies in the European Union, the head of the Dutch state telecoms
company said yesterday.
The contract, for a private network linking the facilities of companies
including Rank Xerox, ICI, Philips, ABN Amro and ABB, was won by British
Telecommunications and an alliance of the US operator AT&amp;T and Unisource, a
joint venture between the Swiss, Swedish and Dutch state telecoms companies.
Addressing an FT-sponsored conference in London, Mr Ben Verwaayen, president
of PTT Telecom Netherlands, said most large-user corporate telecoms users
would soon have an effective choice of carrier for much of their voice
traffic. This was despite the formal EU deadline of 1998 for ending
monopolies on voice services.
'Very soon you will have a situation that, however closed it may look today,
you will have alternative routings available,' Mr Verwaayen said. He added,
however, that effective competition in the residential market was likely to
develop far more slowly. 'The changes are more for those who give us large
volumes.'
This week's corporate contract, estimated to be worth up to Ecu500m (Pounds
393m) a year, exploits existing EU rules permitting private corporate
networks and obliging state telecoms companies to provide leased lines for
them.
This is allowing companies besides national monopolies to provide corporate
services, provided they do not use the public network.
Telecom Netherlands is about to be privatised, and a competitor to it is
likely to be licensed in the Netherlands soon.

to L323bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Net group profits at Cariplo, Italy's largest savings bank, increased 4.2
per cent in 1993 to L323bn (Dollars 196.95m), compared with L310bn in 1992.
Gross earnings increased 22.4 per cent to L2,375bn, before provisions and
adjustments, while total assets grew 9.3 per cent to L150,893bn.
Cariplo shareholders yesterday backed the nomination of Mr Sandro Molinari,
the bank's chief executive, as chairman. His predecessor, Mr Roberto
Mazzotta, stepped down because he faces charges of corruption relating to
property transactions by the bank's pension fund.
Overall deposits in the group rose by 13 per cent in 1993 to L122,536bn,
while total loans increased to L134,607bn, a rise of 11 per cent.
Mr Giampiero Pesenti, the Italian industrialist, has increased his group's
stake in Credito Italiano, the recently privatised Italian bank, to 2.99 per
cent, the maximum allowed. The Pesenti group previously held 2.88 per cent
through Luxembourg-based Franco Tosi International.
On Saturday Credito's new shareholders will get their first chance to
influence the direction of the bank when they elect a board of directors.

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China, stepping up its drive against corruption by officials, yesterday
executed the businessman who masterminded one of the country's largest
frauds, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Shen Taifu, the 39-year-old founder of the Changcheng machinery and
electronics company, was executed by order of the Supreme People's Court
after his appeal against conviction was rejected, the official Xinhua news
agency said.
The court also upheld a guilty verdict against Li Xiaoshi, a former
vice-minister, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for bribery in
connection with the case, Xinhua said.
Liu Jiachen, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, urged all
officials, 'especially those with power', to learn proper lessons from the
Changcheng scandal.
Shen's execution, and the government's lengthy case against him, were
prominent items on the national radio and television news yesterday,
reflecting Beijing's hopes that its tough line will bolster its
anti-corruption image.
The Changcheng scandal broke last year after officials revealed the company
was really a pyramid-style scam which sucked up Yuan 1bn (Dollars 114m) from
unsuspecting small investors through temptations such as offers of 24 per
cent interest.
After a period of tension, during which thousands of Changcheng investors
feared for their savings, Beijing announced that most had recouped most of
their money. It denied using state funds to bail them out.
Li Xiaoshi's involvement in the case had been rumoured from the beginning.
Changcheng was launched amid praise from a number of well-known political
personalities.
Li was found guilty of accepting Yn52,000 in bribes and pocketing Yn20,000
in public money while in office.
The former vice-minister's 20-year term marks a departure from China's
traditional way of dealing with errant members of the Communist party elite,
who usually get retired or transferred.
But anger at government corruption during economic reforms is rising. Li has
become one of the highest-level officials ever publicly brought down on
corruption charges.
Shen had no such status to protect him and a death sentence was widely
expected as soon as he was taken into custody.
Shen's wife and accomplice, Sun Jinhong, formerly head of accounting at
Changcheng, was given 15 years.

FT  12 APR 94 / Fertile soil for economic reforms in Morocco: Prospects are
brighter for people living from the land, though the political climate
remains grey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since last autumn, the heavens have been kind to King Hassan. Never has so
much rain poured from the Moroccan skies in a quarter of a century.
This should ensure bumper crops and would be good for the half of Morocco
that draws a living from the land.
Two consecutive years of drought have taken their toll. Gross domestic
product contracted by 2.9 per cent in 1992, after farming output fell by 29
per cent, and was static last year.
Recession in Europe, Morocco's biggest trading partner, along with a fall in
the price of phosphates, one of the country's main exports, have also
contributed to lower growth.
But other sectors have recently been growing by about 3 per cent a year and
most estimates agree that GDP growth overall could reach 7 per cent in 1994.
As government ministers from all over the world assemble in Morocco this
week for the signing of the Uruguay Round global trade liberalisation
accords, the country has much to be proud of.
After 10 years of liberalisation moves, the dirham has been made convertible
for current account transactions and prices are essentially free of control,
the banking sector is slowly being recapitalised and privatisation is under
way.
Meanwhile, the strict fiscal austerity Morocco has followed since 1984 has
brought the budget deficit down from 12 per cent to 2 per cent of GDP.
Key changes are being enacted this year in the banking sector and the
privatisation programme launched last year speeded up.
The political climate, however, in keeping with the heavens, remains grey
and may not encourage the broad support the Moroccan government needs to see
through the reforms.
Last November the pro-labour Union of Socialist and Popular Forces (USFP)
and the nationalist Istiqlal (Independence) opposition parties alleged that
the second round of the general elections had been manipulated by the
powerful minister of the interior, Mr Driss Basri.
They declined the king's offer to join in a coalition government with other
pro-government parties.
King Hassan professed to be 'bitterly disappointed' but said he would
continue to seek a dialogue with the opposition.
Ministers in the government of technocrats headed since last November by the
veteran conservative prime minister, Mr Mohamed Karim Lamrani, who has long
been one of King Hassan's trusted advisers, are finding the new intake of
deputies far more combative and questioning of government decisions than
before.
Parliament thus provides a truer reflection of society at large - mindful of
the advantages of a strong monarchy but keen to speak its mind more freely
and win a real say in decision-making.
Mr Mohammed Sagou, finance minister, had an unusually rough ride when he
presented the budget earlier this year.
All parties are mindful of the violence racking neighbouring Algeria but so
far the king's religious authority has been enough to avert serious Islamist
opposition.
Moroccan leaders know they must speed up the pace of economic reform and
industrialisation if their country is to take full advantage of the trade
and aid partnership it is negotiating with the European Union and satisfy
the needs of most of the hundreds of thousands of new entrants to the labour
market every year.
The population has risen faster than average real GDP growth since 1989.
The World Bank notes that Morocco, along with Tunisia, has been caught
between competitors who had been more successful in broadening their
industrial base and exports, and others who enjoyed cheaper labour costs,
notably in textiles.
Reforms are being introduced into the banking sector.
Mr Mohamed Seqqat, governor of the central bank, is phasing in over this
year a set of stricter prudential lending rules.
Bankers in Casablanca say these rules are forcing them to limit their
exposure to any one group of companies to 7 per cent of their capital and
will force a reorganisation of their loan portfolios.
They will have to make higher provisions for loans they extend to companies
whose financial position is not considered sound.
The authorities are also gearing up for the launch of a market in government
securities and private bills.
The IMF and the World Bank are pressing the Moroccan authorities to lift the
monopoly which the central bank has so far enjoyed in the sale and purchase
of foreign currencies.
The development of a free foreign exchange market would give Moroccan
companies access to international capital markets.
Mr Jaloul Ayed, general manager of Citibank in Casablanca, points out that
'more and more Moroccan companies boast high technology, modern management
and marketing but are handicapped by the absence of a modern financial
system such as enjoyed by their peers in Europe and Asia.'
The privatisation programme launched last year is meanwhile being speeded
up.
Receipts from the sale of state holdings in Moroccan companies is expected
to increase 40 per cent to reach Dollars 350m this year.
By late spring, the state will have completed its disengagement from oil and
gas distribution companies nationalised in the 1970s - most have reverted to
their foreign owners.
Power generation is being opened up to the private sector for the first time
as international companies submit bids for a new thermal power station.
The government then plans to start privatising four financial institutions.
They include Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur, in which the state has
a 70 per cent stake and which holds a quarter of all domestic deposits.
The others are Banque Nationale du Developpement Economique; Credit
Immobilier et Hotelier, which finances hotels and housing, and Banque
Populaire du Maroc, a co-operative bank which holds a third of all deposits
and which is expected to be sold to its regional bank shareholders.
The new minister of privatisation, Mr Abderrahmane Saadi, a former partner
of Price Waterhouse and chairman of L'Economiste, Casablanca's most lively
economic weekly, says the government decided to retain only a 5 per cent
'golden share' in each of the four institutions.
Two broad challenges face Moroccan leaders as they enter this crucial stage
of reform.
The first is to redress the huge imbalance which exists in the standards of
education, health and income between different social groups in the cities
and between the towns and the countryside.
The second is to tackle constraints younger Moroccans seeking to set up
companies face - the high cost of industrial land, what many entrepreneurs
describe as the 'piranha-like behaviour' of customs and tax officials, and
an unreliable judicial system, notably in the field of business.
Such moves are vital if Morocco is to avoid, in the longer run, the
resentment and revolt which elsewhere in the Arab world have proved fertile
ground for supporters of radical Islam.

FT  12 APR 94 / Belgium steps up Kigali rescue

<TEXT>
Belgian paratroopers were yesterday beginning a high-risk operation to
rescue the remaining foreign nationals scattered across the Rwandan capital,
Kigali, the scene of bloody inter-tribal massacres.
But with the Rwandan rebels reported to be marching on the capital,
prompting fears of further clashes, the Belgian defence ministry said of
foreigners trapped in outlying areas: 'We do not envisage for the moment
pushing our action further than Kigali - it is not possible given the
difficulties we are experiencing in Kigali itself.'
The first group of Belgians to leave Rwanda yesterday were returned to
Brussels, with several hundred more expected to be evacuated from the centre
of Kigali later today. Several hundred French and US nationals also left
Rwanda yesterday.
There are currently 400 Belgian paratroopers in Kigali.
Rwanda, a former colony of Belgium, was previously estimated to have some
1,500 Belgian residents, the largest group of any foreign nationals.
Six Belgian civilians have been killed in the fighting, in addition to the
10 Belgian soldiers serving with the United Nations forces massacred on
Thursday, the Belgian government confirmed.
Three of these were killed in the northern town of Gisenyi at the beginning
of the fighting, with the remainder killed more recently in Kigali, said Mr
Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister.
The killings have provoked outrage in Belgium, fuelling fears that the
violence may have taken a particularly anti-Belgian twist, particularly
among the majority Hutu tribe, which has accused the Belgians of supporting
the rebels.

FT  12 APR 94 / McDonald's finds some burghers are riskier than others
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Netherlands is one of the most dangerous places in the world, outside
the US, to eat a Big Mac, according to a survey.
McDonald's commissioned Tillinghast, the actuaries and consultants, to
collect data on their outlets and found that some 50 McDonald's restaurants
in Amsterdam and other Dutch towns and cities were nearly twice as likely to
suffer property damage and loss of profits through fire, flood, wind damage,
vandalism and theft than fast food outlets located in eight other Asian and
European countries.
The survey, which Tillinghast has called 'The Big Mac Cost of Risk' was
carried out in 1992 to help McDonald's set up its own Dublin-based 'captive'
insurance company, especially dedicated to insure the company's own risks.
'There does not appear to be any single explanation,' said Mr Mark Scully,
one of two Tillinghast consultants who worked on the project.
Heavy storm and flooding which affected the Netherlands during 1990 and 1991
may be part of the reason, he suggested, although there are some indications
that vandalism is becoming a bigger problem.
The survey found that McDonald's restaurants located in France have a record
only marginally better than those in the Netherlands and have lost more
money from theft. The rate of theft and accident losses in Germany and the
UK also rose sharply during 1990 and 1991.
It also discovered that McDonald's liability claims - which mainly result
resulting from legal action by disgruntled customers - were three-and-half
times higher in Ireland than in the UK and almost eight-times higher than in
any other location.
Mr Scully said the Irish figures were 'startling. It seems that the legal
system is more adversarial, much more like the United States.'
The survey also found that crime and accident trends are rising sharply in
the UK, Germany and Hong Kong and that liability costs are increasing apace
in the UK, France, the Netherlands and Hong Kong.
Taiwan has the worst record of the east Asian countries included in the
survey. The cost of claims for property damage, business interruption,
crime, and liability are significantly higher than in either Hong Kong or
Singapore.
The safest McDonald's in the countries covered in the survey are in
Switzerland and Singapore.
The company excluded some countries from the comparison on the grounds that
they have insufficient restaurants to make a comparison credible.

FT  12 APR 94 / World Trade News: China 'must move further on rights'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A senior US commerce department official yesterday said China would have to
improve its human rights record further if President Bill Clinton was to
renew its Most Favoured Nation trade status in June.
China had made 'slow but discernible progress' in some areas, said Mr
Jeffrey Garten, undersecretary for international trade, but the
administration was 'deeply troubled' by the recent arrests of Chinese
citizens.
MFN status for China allows its goods the same tariff treatment as other US
trading partners. Loss of MFN would be a big blow to both economies.
Mr Garten was speaking at a US-China trade and investment conference in Los
Angeles, attended by by Ms Wu Yi, China's minister for trade and economic
co-operation.
He welcomed as 'positive' a statement on the universal declaration of human
rights, delivered by the Chinese foreign minister on April 6. Honouring the
declaration is one of the seven criteria set out as a basis for MFN renewal
by Mr Clinton last year.
However, said Mr Garten, actions like the recent detentions and arrests of
Chinese activists 'cast a cloud over our efforts to further co-operation
between our two countries'.
Mr Garten has been gaining a reputation as a thoughtful trade policy
theorist. But he has been criticised for his enthusiastic embrace of
US-China commercial relations as part of the department's aggressive export
promotion policy. Critics say this has sent 'mixed messages' to Beijing.
Yesterday, Mr Garten offered assurances that the US did not seek to infringe
China's sovereignty and three times stressed to a government obsessed by
stability that co-operation would lead to 'stable and prosperous' China.
'Our combined business skills and industriousness can create a powerful
engine for economic growth,' he said. 'The potential benefits to both our
countries in improving trade relations will be felt not only in commercial
terms and economic security, but more broadly in a secure and stable
Asian-Pacific region.'
The US asked only for adherence to universally recognised human rights
standards, which would provide 'a more stable and attractive climate for
trade and investment'.
Administration officials have recently indicated that there would be little
problem in certifying progress on two of the most pressing criteria:
emigration and prison labour.
The US wants more information on political prisoners, and the round-up of
dissidents is seen as a setback. There has been no improvement of conditions
in Tibet, but China has promised to provide information on 106 Tibetan
prisoners.
US officials have also suggested that China's co-operation on MFN this year
may bring an end to the annual renewal process. Mr Winston Lord, assistant
secretary of state, said the administration hoped for a 'normal process' in
the years ahead, ending the annual debate which has divided the Congress
since the Tiananmen uprising.
At present, China, as a non-market economy, must have its tariff status
renewed by the president or it will expire on July 3. Congress has until
September 1 to pass a joint resolution overruling the president, but he can
veto that and it takes two-thirds of the House and Senate to override him.

FT  12 APR 94 / Algerian PM resigns after IMF deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Algeria's president, Mr Liamine Zeroual, yesterday replaced his prime
minister after less than eight months in a surprise move which came as the
government took measures to put the economy back on course.
The departure of Mr Redha Malek and his cabinet in favour of a team to be
led by Mr Mokdad Sifi, transport minister, came shortly after Algeria's
army-backed rulers undertook a steep devaluation of the dinar as part of an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
At the weekend the government sent a letter of intent to the IMF which will
pave the way for a Dollars 1bn standby credit and economic reforms. These
are aimed at liberalising the country's economy which is increasingly
crippled by a debt-service ratio of over 100 per cent and a confrontation
between the army and supporters of radical Islam.
Since Mr Malek took office last August, Moslem fundamentalists have stepped
up their violent campaign against the government, widening random attacks to
include foreigners.
Mr Sifi, aged 53, has served in high-ranking posts in the ministries of
commerce, public works and finance.
France yesterday pledged its support for Algeria's new economic measures,
while awaiting announcement of the full composition of the new government
before commenting on the political changes.
'France has always said it is ready to play its part in helping the Algerian
people and we will continue in this direction,' Mr Richard Duque, the
foreign ministry spokesman, said yesterday.
In practical terms, this means France is holding open a largely unused
FFr6.3bn (Dollars 1.08bn) credit line granted to Algeria last year. Some
FFr5bn of this is export-credit tied to the purchase of French goods, and
should help maintain Algeria's imports from France which would otherwise be
severely hit by the 40 per cent devaluation. France is also Algeria's
largest single creditor, accounting for about 20 per cent of its Dollars
26bn debt.
Paris has also been urging its European Union partners and other creditors
to give Algeria generous rescheduling terms.
In Washington, Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said the reform
programme which the loan would support was 'courageous and far reaching . .
. worthy of the support of the international community.'
But some senior officials could not disguise their bafflement that Mr
Malek's resignation was not delayed until the IMF board approved the loan.

FT  12 APR 94 / There's still life in the old model: Despite economic woes,
Germany's social market system has proved resilient and flexible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic battering that the German social market model has received over
the past three years seems to have weakened its claim to the title of the
European economic model - a claim that appeared well established at the end
of the 1980s.
Even admirers such as the French businessman Mr Michel Albert, who coined
the term 'Rhine capitalism' to describe the German social market model of
regulated, long-term, consensus capitalism, have predicted that it will be
undermined by the new competitive forces sweeping through the European
economy.
Germany's high-cost economy is particularly vulnerable to the squeeze felt
by many European countries between growing low-wage competition from
developing countries and the more innovative economies of the US and Japan.
To many commentators, Germany is poorly suited to the growth of smaller
businesses, which need to react swiftly to market changes and require
organisational flexibility and less rigid pay and hours.
There is some truth in this view. Recent developments in Germany also
suggest, however, that the institutions of the social market are proving
both more supple and resilient than many believed possible.
This is not just a question of cyclical upturn after the sharpest recession
since the war. Witness the following recent events: the reduction in real
wages achieved through collective bargaining earlier this year; the radical
restructuring of many large companies (Daimler-Benz cut DM4bn, or Pounds
1.6bn, in costs last year alone); the first stage of reforming health costs
achieved in the face of widespread scepticism last year; and the massive but
belated transfer of resources from rich west Germans to poorer east Germans,
despite the unpopularity this provoked.
Several times in the past two decades mainstream economic and business
opinion in the Anglo-Saxon world has underestimated the strength and
solidarity of German economic institutions.
Indeed, according to free-market textbooks the German economic machine
should scarcely fly at all. Its labour and capital markets are choc-a-bloc
with rigidities. Taxes are high and rising, unions are still strong, and
environmental (and other) regulations are stringent.
Yet Germany has outperformed most other large economies on most indicators
even in its mature period of the past 20 years. Just prior to unification in
1990, it had the fourth-highest gross domestic product per head in the world
(compared with Britain's 18th) and its 'misery index' - combining the annual
inflation and unemployment rate - averaged 7.5 per cent a year between 1971
and 1992, almost the lowest in the world.
Part of the explanation for this relative success is that social market
'rigidities' help to resolve problems which are scarcely recognised by
conventional economics - problems of uncertainty and conflict in daily
business life.
German political and corporate institutions not only generate a high degree
of economic stability; they are also better than liberal market economies at
binding together economic actors in pursuit of common goals.
At the political level, under the Ordnungspolitik system set up after the
second world war, the markets operate within a regulatory framework over
which governments have only limited discretion. A broad range of interest
groups, as well as semi-independent bodies such as the Bundesbank, have a
significant voice. Cross-party support for the privatisation of the German
rail network is a recent example.
At the corporate level, employee, supplier and bank representatives on
company boards, plus the lack of a contested takeover system for companies,
also make it easier for corporate 'stakeholders' to commit themselves to
long-term relationships without fear of losing market advantage or personal
benefits.
It is this 'stakeholder company' which is at the heart of the German system
of market regulation, not the state. It is here that current reforms are
being played out.
The stakeholder- (rather than shareholder-) driven company is complemented
by a web of organisations linking employers, such as chambers of commerce
and industry associations, which help to produce services that include a
good training system for school-leavers. Such developments are not the
spontaneous result of companies acting in their own profit-maximising
interests, as British governments know well.
Despite these underlying institutional advantages, Germany's social market
virtues can become vices. The model needs periods of turbulent renewal such
as the one it is experiencing. Because consensus gives many different groups
in companies and in politics the power of veto, reform can be too easily
blocked. This contributed to some economic policy mistakes of unification's
early stages. A combination of political cynicism and interest-group power
led to the wrong decisions about paying for unification and about industrial
restructuring in the east. The result has been a bigger bill than necessary
and the destruction of many businesses in the east.
Further, in an era of more volatile market relationships the disadvantages
of long-termism become as apparent as the advantages. How do you ensure your
long-term relationships with suppliers, for example, do not inhibit
competitive pricing? How do you react swiftly to changed market conditions
when corporate culture is about negotiating change with long-standing
partners?
Germany's companies thrive best when undertaking incremental changes to
existing products and production techniques. Hence the country's strength in
industries such as cars, chemicals, machine tools - and its relative failure
in electronics and computers.
This innovation weakness, combined with the decline in productivity to an
annual average increase of 1.2 per cent between 1980 and 1991, suggested to
some the model was in long-term decline even before the financial burden of
unification.
Unification reduced per capita GDP to the level of Italy in 1991. It also
played havoc with Germany's public finances, which are in a worse state than
they appear because most analyses fail to take account of the state's large
public sector pension liabilities.
Some commentators have thus concluded that Germany must hack away at its
welfare provisions and corporate bureaucracy to embrace the vigour of
Anglo-Saxon individualism. There are, indeed, both internal and external
pressures for greater flexibility.
First, the system of centralised collective bargaining is bending. Employers
have recently been clawing back some of the fringe benefits granted in
easier times, and some have left the national bargaining system to do so.
The power of employer-friendly works councils inside companies is being
enhanced at the expense of external national unions, as employers try to
increase differentials between high- and low-skill employees.
Second, the appointment of former General Motors hatchet-man Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez to run Volkswagen's procurement division last year was symptomatic of
a new, and less friendly, relationship between companies and suppliers.
Lopez was the most extreme example of more ruthless market calculation in
company-supplier links, but other groups such as Mercedes-Benz have been
aiming in the same direction.
Third, the relationship between companies and their banks is changing and
the importance of equity capital is growing. Big companies can now raise
money direct from the capital markets, a practice which has downgraded the
strategic role of the big banks. In addition, a combination of international
banking practices and the European Commission (which favours open equity
markets and limits on bank shareholdings) threaten the cosy position of
German banks on the non-executive supervisory boards, where they have long
enjoyed access to inside information.
These changes may make the German social market a little less 'organised'
and a little less egalitarian. But it can afford a greater degree of
earnings inequality. The earnings gap between high- and low-paid workers
narrowed slightly in the 1980s - against the international trend - and it is
estimated that about 70 per cent of pay goes to middle-income households.
Despite signs of greater institutional flexibility, there are clear limits
to change. Germany's sectoral bargaining system appears to be restoring pay
restraint, and the alternative of decentralised bargaining with strong
unions is not an attractive proposition to most companies. The Lopez example
does not seem to have been emulated by many other big companies, at least
not as forcefully.
Finally, neither contested takeovers nor the power of footloose equity
capital are set for a large increase in importance because of the
concentrated ownership of companies in Germany. Of the 171 largest
industrial companies 86 per cent have a single shareholder which owns more
than 25 per cent of the concern. In most cases the shareholder is another
company or a family trust, which generally means that short-term profit is
not the primary goal.
Thus, backed by mildly deregulatory public policy reforms, the German
economic model is reinvigorating itself without abandoning the core
institutions of the social market, which can adapt and survive in the more
open and flexible markets of contemporary Europe.
Some aspects of the model are particularly well-suited to new manufacturing
trends. For example, when companies and their suppliers are used to
operating in an atmosphere of trust, it is easier for them to share research
and development costs as demanded in an era of rapid product turnover.
Successful adjustment to 'flexible specialisation' - which combines mass
production and customisation - requires a capacity for 'retooling' in
response to unpredictable demands. This needs surplus capacity in skills and
equipment. Investment in such capabilities is difficult to justify in
liberal market regimes with high short-term performance pressures and
companies dominated by accountants. The German system positively encourages
it.
The 'creativity' of German-style rigidities is now recognised by management
theorists such as Mr John Kay, who argues that long-term relationships are
crucial to the competitive advantage of companies. With the end of the cold
war and a new focus on competition between market models, there has been a
revival of interest in concepts such as takeholder company.
Adequate reform of the social market model is not guaranteed but the system
has reserves of strength. Even when productivity improvements were flagging
between 1970 and 1990 Germany remained the largest exporter of manufactured
goods in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and
increased its market share over that period. Further, the east German
economy could be on the point of take-off, which alone could help to shake
up the west.
Germany's job creation record is better than that of many industrialised
nations. According to the OECD, west German unemployment is now 6.3 per
cent, lower than the US, and falling. But it will remain high in east
Germany, and there is a danger that the strains of unification and high
immigration on Germany's labour market could create calls for protectionism.
Assuming this danger is avoided, the German model could soon be in a strong
position to claim market leadership again in the EU. The single market has
sharpened competition between different approaches to market regulation, and
Germany starts with the advantage that it is currently responsible for a
third of industrial output in the EU.
Already EU rules are more informed by a concept of Ordnungspolitik, which
allows market forces to operate within prescribed rules, unlike the public
policy system in France or Britain, and limits the scope for discretionary
intervention.
Apart from the financial services area, Brussels generally takes German
market institutions as its pattern. At a European level it wants to promote
organised employers, social partnership, and the stakeholder company, hence
its interest in works councils.
The strength of Germany's industrial lobby organisations in Brussels is
certainly no hindrance to the social market cause. And the arrival of more
countries with considerable institutional overlap, such as Austria and
Sweden, will be a further fillip. British supporters of a deregulated,
liberal, market, have got an uphill struggle ahead.

FT  12 APR 94 / Leading Article: Confrontation with the Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The confrontation narrowly avoided two months ago has now taken place. In
February, Bosnian Serb forces complied with Nato's ultimatum and pulled back
their weapons around Sarajevo, allowing a marked relaxation of tension in
the Bosnian capital and raising hopes of a more general peace throughout the
country. At the weekend, by contrast, they ignored clear warnings from the
UN and persisted in shelling the town of Gorazde.
On Sunday Nato aircraft went into action against them. Yesterday, after
appearing momentarily to back off, the Serbs undertook a further escalation,
reimposing the blockade of Sarajevo, resuming the shelling of Gorazde, and
targeting the very UN personnel whom the Nato air strikes had been designed
to protect.
A further Nato bombing raid knocked out three armoured personnel carriers
and a truck but appeared to have no other effect. Serbia itself, which in
the past few months had seemed anxious to play the peacemaker in order to
get UN sanctions lifted, yesterday stood firmly, if so far only
rhetorically, behind its Bosnian protege. President Slobodan Milosevic
announced that he no longer accepts the UN's objectivity, and will deal with
it only through the Russians. Russia's position has thus become both more
crucial and more uncomfortable.
In February Mr Yeltsin warned strongly against Nato air strikes, arguing
that they would go beyond what the UN Security Council had authorised, and
then intervened to prevent them by sending Russian troops to serve under UN
command in Sarajevo. This enabled the Serbs to withdraw without total loss
of face. A week later, when Nato shot down four Serb aircraft that were
violating the UN no-fly zone, Russia did not protest, but took refuge in
feigned uncertainty about the aircraft's true identity. Since then Mr Vitaly
Churkin, the Russian special envoy, has played a constructive role in
negotiating a ceasefire in Croatia, and in persuading the Serbs to make some
further tactical concessions in Bosnia.
Mr Yeltsin's public protest at not being consulted before Sunday's air
strikes appears to have encouraged President Milosevic to raise the stakes.
Mr Milosevic seems to be gambling on trying to prise Russia apart from the
west. However, the Russian protests yesterday were cautiously phrased, and
did not amount to an outright condemnation of the strikes themselves.
Additionally, it is even less plausible now than it would have been in
February to accuse Nato of acting unilaterally or bypassing UN procedures.
This time the ultimatum came from the UN secretary-general. He was careful
to base it on the first and least controversial of the UN Security Council
resolutions authorising the use of force in Bosnia, namely the one that
allows the UN to call on Nato for 'close air support' when its own forces
and other personnel are endangered in the execution of their humanitarian
mandate.
President Bill Clinton, who spoke to Mr Yeltsin by telephone on Sunday
night, must have made clear that the credibility of both Nato and the UN are
now at stake. There is no doubt that the UN action so far has been
justified. Russian help in defusing the crisis is more welcome than ever.
But there can be no question of allowing the Serbs to win.

FT  12 APR 94 / Leading Article: Video nasty
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British MPs will today vote on a measure to restrict the distribution of
video films likely to harm children. It would make it a criminal offence to
supply such videos for private use or show them in a public place where
children under 18 are admitted. Despite the opposition of ministers, it has
strong cross-party support.
The restrictions, proposed by Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP, would
be popular. Public concern over video nasties has been mounting, fed by
allegations of copycat violence by children and young people. It would be
foolish to deny a connection between what people do and the images they see:
businesses spend huge sums on advertising because it changes people's
behaviour. Most children will not copy screen violence, but many child
psychologists believe that repeated exposure desensitises them.
The case for censorship is thus easy to make. Specifying what is to be
censored, however, raises insuperable problems. Mr Alton's measure defines
harmful videos as those presenting 'an inappropriate model for children' or
'likely to cause pychological harm to a child'. Broadly interpreted, this
could cover the majority of films currently restricted to children of 12 and
over, since they have already been judged unsuitable for some. Interpreting
any such definition leads to the legal arguments that brought book
censorship into disrepute.
Enforcing censorship in one country is also increasingly difficult. The
growth of foreign travel eventually undermined book censorship in the UK:
banned books by authors such as James Joyce could readily be bought in Paris
and other European cities. Videos banned in the UK will be just as easily
available on the other side of the English Channel. With satellite
television and video on demand through cable, foreign travel may not even be
necessary.
There is sense in tightening up on video shops that supply videos to
children without adequate checks on their age. More information on the
contents of videos would also help parents keep a closer eye on what their
children watch. But the Alton measure will prove unenforceable and will
bring the law into disrepute. MPs should reject it.

FT  12 APR 94 / Leading Article: A Tokyo vacuum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan has long differed from other leading industrialised countries in
having no clear centre of power. The political horse-trading provoked over
the past few days by the resignation of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa suggests that
this situation will continue.
Mr Hosokawa's administration had made real progress in breaking with the
corrupt politics of the past and towards making the Japanese parliament more
representative of popular concerns. This must not be allowed to go into
reverse.
His drive for a more open style of democracy, his achievement in getting
electoral reform through parliament and his economic deregulation have
attracted so much public support that future governments will find it
difficult to turn back the clock. That much is encouraging.
Less so is the fact that the stable government needed to carry Japan through
this process is a distant prospect. The difficulty experienced by members of
the fractious seven-party alliance in agreeing a new leader supports the
view that the country is set for several years of rule by unstable
coalitions.
Stable government can only emerge once the present and former factions of
the Liberal Democratic party work out a pattern that reflects the Japanese
public's aspirations for a more open, honest and international style of
politics. A particular difficulty is that any likely candidate for the prime
minister's office will be as vulnerable to corruption allegations as was Mr
Hosokawa, if not more so.
This carries an important lesson for Japan's foreign partners. On the one
hand, Tokyo should be handled gently. Foreign trade pressure, of the kind
applied recently by the US administration, will be less effective than ever
in current circumstances and could be counter-productive.
On the other, if the US and other trade partners are to take Japan
seriously, they have a right to expect Japan to take itself seriously. The
quirky events leading up to Mr Hosokawa's resignation have a flavour of
farce, which risks devaluing the international image of Japanese
governments. Likewise, the opaque negotiations to find a new leader provoke
anxiety. Tokyo's smoke-filled rooms are no more fragrant today than in the
LDP's heyday, when policy was formed in private by an inward-looking elite.
Even if Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister and front runner to succeed Mr
Hosokawa, does make it to this week's Gatt ministerial gathering in Morocco,
he is unlikely to get there, according to the latest official report, until
the final day, Friday. That will leave inadequate time for discussions with
Mr Mickey Kantor, the senior US trade negotiator, as a result of which the
unwelcome shadow caused by the US-Japan trade row will linger for longer
than necessary.
To some extent, Japan is lucky to have a bureaucracy capable of filling the
power vacuum during the chaotic period to come. But not even the Japanese
public administration can set its own policy, despite US suspicions that the
more powerful ministries are inclined to act on their own agendas.
Bureaucrats alone certainly cannot handle the trade dispute with Washington,
as the past few months have shown. It is time for Japanese politicians to
wake up to their international obligations.

Risky place, the Netherlands. Apparently the country's 50 or so McDonald's
restaurants are at least twice as likely to suffer property damage and loss
of profits through fire, flood, vandalism and theft as their counterparts in
eight other Asian and European countries.
'There does not appear to be any single explanation,' says Mark Scully, a
consultant with the actuarial firm Tillinghast, which carried out the survey
for McDonald's. So if you fancy a Big Mac in The Hague, is the advice to

FT  12 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Burmah advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Burmah Castrol sprinted ahead, closing 11 firmer at 826p after the group's
preliminary results came in at the very top end of market expectations. But
it was the dividend increase, up 9 per cent on the year to 27.5p, that
caught the eye. Most analysts had been expecting a total payment of 26.5p,
with a handful of super-optimists looking for 27p.
Oil sector specialists said the company delivered a positive post-results
message to the market, hinting that the German and other European businesses
could be turning the corner and emerging from recession.
Ms Irene Himona, an oil sector analyst at Strauss Turnbull, the stockbroker,
and a long term supporter of Burmah Castrol shares, said the market had
adopted a much too bearish view of the company which, she added, should
stand at a market price/earnings ratio instead of the current 20 per cent
discount for 1994. 'Burmah Castrol is positioned to increase its dividend by
10 per cent for the next two years and still end up with dividend cover of
1.9 times,' said Ms Himona.
The pharmaceuticals area was under pressure as a spate of minor irritants
focused on Zeneca and Glaxo and reinforced the sector's precarious standing
within the London market.
Zeneca ended 5 off at 724p after the US Food and Drug Administration ordered
more stringent labelling on its breast cancer product. Although the concern
over the drug's links with cancer of the uterus were known, the move towards
tighter policing and a subsequent warning letter to doctors knocked
sentiment.
Meanwhile, Glaxo, which market's Zantac, the world's top-selling anti-ulcer
drug, suffered from the news that US company Lederle was co-promoting an
anti-ulcer treatment with SmithKline Beecham (steady at 370p). It was also
affected by the realisation that the appeal by Novopharm against Glaxo's
patent on Zantac started yesterday. Glaxo fell 6 to 598p.
Wellcome rose 14 1/2 to 561p ex-dividend after announcing details of the
streamlining of its research and development management structure, and it
was also helped by talk that NatWest Securities had upgraded forecasts.
NatWest's pharmaceuticals team was unavailable for comment. Fisons added 5
at 148p, with BZW said to have been a keen buyer.
The oil sector extended its recent strong performance, with Shell Transport
putting on another powerful display and moving up 15 further to 711p on
heavy turnover of 10m, including a block of 3.7m shares traded at 708p.
Dealers said Shell continued to respond to a batch of forecast upgrades last
week and some switching out of British Petroleum shares, which have
outperformed Shell in the recent past. BP finished only marginally higher at
374p.
Enterprise Oil was ahead 8 at 447p, after 450p, with analysts pointing out
the stock's higher leverage to crude oil prices than that of the integrated
stocks.
Vodafone was the lone poor performer in a generally strong telecoms area,
slipping 8 to 537p amid US selling and switching into BT and Cable and
Wireless. The latter, helped by improving sentiment towards Far Eastern
markets, appreciated 8 to 452p. BT was a similar amount up at 396 1/2 p.
The emerging takeover story in Hogg Group continued, with HSBC, which
acquired a 6.1 per cent stake a couple of weeks ago, adding to its holding
via purchases of Hogg shares by a number of its investment management
associates. HSBC now speaks for 7.26 per cent of Hogg's issued capital. Hogg
shares closed 4 higher at 215p.
A stock shortage was thought to have exaggerated gains in composite
insurances, where Sun Alliance was particularly strong and 11 better at
351p. Hoare Govett's buy recommendation continued to drive Prudential, which
settled 10 higher at 330p.
NatWest Securities fretted over accounting standards in the stores sector,
focusing its concern on recent revelations at Pentos. Shares in the high
street stationer slipped 1 1/2 to 32p. The broker also moved Next and Boots
on to its buy list, the latter advancing 7 to 535p, although the former
stayed at 231 1/2 p.
News of improved sales and a capital injection lifted Brown &amp; Jackson, the
troubled discount retailer, by 1 1/2 to 4 1/2 p, with a very heavy 37m
shares changing hands.
Tesco improved 3 to 215p ahead of today's results. Profits are expected to
fall from Pounds 581m to around Pounds 530m.
Building sector stocks raced higher after a positive review of the outlook
for UK construction output published by the National Council of Building
Material Producers.
BPB moved forward 11 to 320p, Hepworth 10 to 388p and Marley 6 to 174p.
British Airways gained support from two research notes, one from Kleinwort
Benson and the other from Lehman Brothers. Both pointed out the stock's
recent underperformance as a good buying opportunity, with Kleinwort
underlining the quality of the group's recent traffic figures. BA put on 5
at 429p. BAA received support from Smith New Court and firmed 2 to 975p. The
broker also likes Associated British Ports, up 2 at 547p.
Defence group GEC improved 7 to 316p on consideration of a Sunday newspaper
article suggesting that the company was in talks with Finmeccanica, of
Italy. Also, Hoare Govett reiterated a trading buy recommendation. Just
before the close of dealing, a block of 4m shares went through the Seaq
electronic ticker at 314p.

FT  12 APR 94 / Survey of Slovenia (4): Goal is efficiency - Privatisations
are beginning at last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After two years of prolonged and confusing debate, privatisations are
finally getting off the ground.
About 2,500 companies with a book value of Dollars 8.8bn are earmarked for
privatisation over the next two years. Many enterprises will be only
partially sold under a complicated set of rules which may yet be changed
because of enduring political opposition to selling enterprises to outsiders
 -people neither employed nor formerly employed by a company - and to
foreign takeovers. But for the time being, armed with a compromise set of
rules made more complicated by the need to appease critics, the government
is pushing ahead.
Unlike the Czech Republic (where the government opted for a relatively quick
transfer to private ownership of as many companies as possible - leaving
restructuring to the new owners) Slovene companies had to restructure first
because of the sudden loss of the bulk of their markets in the former
Yugoslavia. They had to make painful adjustments to survive, and
privatisation took second place.
In Slovenia, the objective and the methods chosen are also different.
Because of the country's unique self-management system, most property is not
directly owned by the state as in other communist countries. There are no
clear owners and responsibility is loosely divided among company managers
and workers.
This has given employees a greater say in the running of their company, but
it has also encouraged high wage rises and the maintenance of the status quo
 -which discourages change. For these reasons, establishing ownership is an
important element in the government's efforts to modernise the economy. The
idea is not so much to create a nation of shareholders as to raise
productivity.
'The ultimate goal of privatisation is not the distribution of shares, but
to raise the efficiency of companies, and you can't achieve that without
restructuring and an active owner,' says Ms Mira Puc, managing director of
the Agency for Restructuring and Privatisation.
The agency is one of two institutions dealing with privatisation. Its role
is to supervise and advise on methods of privatisation, but it cannot sell
companies, unlike the Development Fund, which is more like the Treuhand in
Germany. The Fund is currently responsible for restructuring about 100
companies to prepare them for privatisation. It has already sold about 30
companies, and another 50 companies are facing bankruptcy.
But the bulk of privatisations will fall under the supervision of the
privatisation agency. It is early days yet, and the agency has so far
received about 215 projects of which it has approved about 80, but the list
is growing every day, says Mr Joze Jaklin, the agency's deputy manager.
Companies have been given until the end of the year to prepare their
privatisation project. Failing that, the agency will decide on the method.
The process is unusually complex, but officials say that allowing each
company to decide was deemed the most politically acceptable and least
bureaucratic method.
Under the agency's guidelines, companies can choose among several methods of
privatisation. Part of the shares can be distributed to various state funds,
including the Development Fund, which can later sell the shares to private
investment funds. A company's shares can also be sold directly or through
public tender and public auctions.
Alternatively, managers and employees can opt for an internal buy-out, under
which they can acquire up to 60 per cent of their company's shares at
preferential terms. This includes the distribution of up to 20 per cent of
shares free of charge through ownership certificates - the Slovene
equivalent to privatisation vouchers - and up to 40 per cent through an
internal buy out, in which part of the shares are bought at a discount for
immediate cash and the rest bought over a four year period. The remaining 40
per cent of shares must be distributed among various state funds.
Depending on age, each Slovene citizen will receive ownership certificates
worth DM4,000-DM6,000 which can be exchanged for shares. Shares acquired
through free distribution or at a discount cannot be resold immediately.
Investment funds are being established; licences are likely to be issued by
May. Some 30 fund management companies have applied to establish about 70
investment funds. These will be similar to those in the Czech Republic but,
unlike the Czech funds, there are no limits on the size of the stake a fund
can have in any one company. Individual funds, however, can have no more
than 10 per cent of their portfolio in a single company.
So far only six companies have been privatised by internal buyout, most of
them small. Jub, the chemical company, is the largest of the group. The
agency has also approved public offers for a handful of companies, including
Lek, a large and successful drug manufacturer whose share offer was heavily
oversubscribed. Internal buyouts are more popular, as they give employees
the chance to take a stake in their own company, says Ms Puc.
'Conditions are different in each country. The political conditions here
would make it impossible to do it all through the state like in Germany,
because all managers here believe they already own the companies,' she says.

FT  12 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Property sector favoured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Property shares moved sharply ahead as a positive assessment on the sector
from Goldman Sachs was underpinned by some bullish industry and weekend
press comment.
The US investment bank put Land Securities on its recommendation list and
the shares led the sector-wide advance, moving ahead 22 to 657p with 3.6m
traded.
Mr Graham Stanley at Goldman believes recent pessimism on the outlook for
property shares has been overdone. 'Areas of the direct market are starting
to look overbought. Share prices currently value property company assets at
an average 8.4 per cent yield compared to an average yield in the direct
market of 7.5 per cent and falling. Selected property stocks appear to offer
good value.'

FT  12 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong finish but trading volume
decreases - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first day of the new equity trading session saw UK stocks in better
form, although the market took its cue first from British government bonds
and, later, from a promising start on Wall Street. By the close, London was
following New York step for step, closing very firmly as the Dow Industrial
Average swung higher in early trading after Ms Elaine Garzarelli, the widely
regarded Lehman Brothers analyst, revised her year-end forecast for the US
stock market.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended at the day's best reading of 3,149.4 with a net
gain of 28.6. A succession of large deals in blue chip stocks traded at the
market close. After slipping briefly at the opening, the market advanced
smartly behind more confident views on the interest rate outlook. The
Footsie showed a gain of 28.1 before a nervous opening on Wall Street
trimmed rises in London.
The UK market lagged behind equity markets in France and Germany, which
responded to increasing confidence that the Bundesbank will ease rates again
this week. Equity investors took a neutral view of the Pounds 277m rise in
UK bank credit business in February, which was seen as implying that
consumer spending had stood up well ahead of the increases in taxation
phased in this month.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index followed the trend of the Footsie, closing 24 points
up on the day at 3,779.5. Seaq volume gathered pace as the session
developed, but the closing total of 602.3m shares compared with 894.4m on
Friday. Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.79bn on Friday, at
the higher end of daily average levels.
Some encouragement was seen in the stock market's buoyancy in what is the
start of the first equity trading account of the new tax year in the UK. But
the London market appeared to be a follower of other markets yesterday, and
somewhat lacking in self-direction.
London's close pursuit of the New York market towards the close of trading
caused some analysts to warn that Wall Street could be tested tomorrow when
the latest US retail sales and consumer price statistics are due.
Equity strategists continued to compare the London stock market outlook with
that of Wall Street. At Salomon Brothers International, Mr Marcus Grubb
commented that Continental markets are likely to remain 'less vulnerable'
than the UK to inflation fears, which he believes will be prompted by the
strength of the US economy and expectations of further tightening of credit
policy by the Federal Reserve.
Mr Peter Lyon of Smith New Court told clients that economies outside the US
have 'plenty of spare capacity' and that their bond and equity markets can
continue to make progress even if the Federal Reserve tightens policy
further.
The Footsie was helped by renewed strength in the oil majors as investors
began to anticipate firmer crude oil prices as global economies extend their
recovery. Gains were fairly eveny spread across the manufacturing sectors.
There was renewed support for financial stocks, where the life assurance
companies stood out.
Consumer shares moved ahead as the bank credit numbers for February were
digested by the market. But across the range of the market, investment
support was still cautious and traders were wary of a return of the volatile
trends seen in equities over the past three weeks.

FT  12 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures rallied sharply yesterday, pulling the underlying cash
market upwards as investors shrugged off some of their concern that interest
rates might be on the turn, writes Peter John.
The FT-SE 100 contract expiring in June opened the new account at 3,129, up
from Friday's finish, and maintained the firm tone throughout the day,
hitting a high of 3,164 before reaching an official trading close of 3,158.
At that level it was about six points above its estimated fair value premium
of around seven points, which has been recalculated for the new account.
Traders said there was support from Salomon Brothers International and
NatWest Securities, as well as 'locals', or independent traders. One
enthusiastic dealer commented: 'The future has been fat all day' but it was
thriving on junk food - turnover of less than 10,000 contracts suggested
that the fundamental support in the market was thin.
Traded options, meanwhile, saw only 29,000 contracts traded, busier than
Friday's desultory level which saw only 21,766 lots changing hands but still
uninspiring. Among stock options, Glaxo ended the day as the most active
with 3,310 lots dealt, followed by BT with 2,542 and Lucas with 1,644. Shell
Transport and Rolls-Royce were also heavily traded.

FT  12 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs as end is seen to
correction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices ended mostly higher yesterday as the stock market started a
week packed with important economic statistics in an upbeat fashion, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 14.57 up at 3,688.83, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.77 at 449.87. Secondary indices, however,
languished, with the American Stock Exchange composite closing 0.55 off at
440.66 and the Nasdaq composite 0.60 easier at 748.11. New York SE volume
was moderate at 243m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,167 to 1,008.
Although equities opened firmer, it was not until late morning that blue
chips began to post anything more than modest gains. Analysts said there was
no particular news that inspired the buying, and attributed the rise to a
growing feeling among investors that the market's recent correction - which
saw the Dow lose 10 per cent of its value over two months - was ended.
Market sentiment was also seen as positive ahead of this week's crucial
inflation data. The March producer prices index is due out today, and is
expected to show only a slight increase in prices, while an equally modest
rise is forecast for the March consumer prices index, which will be released
tomorrow. Investors seem confident that the data will reassure the bond
market that inflation is not getting out of hand, in spite of the recent
sharp spurt in economic growth.
Although the market has been unnerved in recent weeks by political
developments overseas, traders said the raids by US fighters on Serbian
mil-itary positions in Bosnia-Hercegovina overnight and again yesterday had
little impact on trading.
Automobile manufacturers were all higher in the morning, buoyed by reports
that analysts believe rising interest rates will not undermine the strong
recovery in car sales, but they dropped back from their peaks. Chrysler
climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 1/4 in heavy volume before falling back
to finish Dollars 1/4 up at Dollars 51 1/8. General Motors gained a net
Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 58, but Ford Motor failed to stay in positive
territory and closed Dollars 3/8 down at Dollars 58.
Bank stocks were in demand as Wall Street anticipated another strong
quarterly reporting season from the sector. BankAmerica rose Dollars 3/4 to
Dollars 41 1/2, Chemical Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 38 5/8, Citicorp Dollars 1
to Dollars 39 3/8 and Nationsbank Dollars 2 to Dollars 51 3/8.
On the Nasdaq market, leading technology issues were mixed. Intel lost
Dollars 3/16 at Dollars 69 3/16.
Canada
Toronto closed a sluggish session lower on tumbling gold shares and a soft
bond market. The TSE 300 index shed 24.4 to 4,303.0 and falls led advances
by 436 to 324 after volume of 45.5m shares valued at CDollars 566m.
Twelve of the 14 sub-indices declined. The golds group dropped 2.8 per cent
as the bullion price in New York fell USDollars 6.30 to USDollars 378.25 an
ounce.
Brazil
Brokers in Sao Paulo said that a 7.9 per cent rise in share prices reflected
a thin market, and buying to square portfolios ahead of the futures index
and options settlements tomorrow and next Monday. The Bovespa index was
1,221 higher at 16,595 at the close.

FT  12 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Calm reaction to Hosokawa resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese equities have reacted calmly so far to the resignation of the prime
minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, which has plunged the country once again
into a period of political turbulence.
The market fell sharply on Friday as rumours began to circulate about the
resignation, but the losses were more than recouped later in the day.
Previous sessions, meanwhile, had seen enough foreign money returning to
leave Japan, in local currency terms, as one of the week's strongest
performers in the FT-Actuaries World Indices.
Strategists seem agreed that the Hosokawa resignation, a distinct
possibility for some time, is not a major threat to the investment climate.
NatWest Markets, for instance, comments that while foreign investors might,
in the short term, become a little more reserved, 'unless the economy
falters or suffers a relapse - possible, but not guaranteed - expectations
of a turnround in corporate earnings are likely to remain relatively
positive'.
Salomon Brothers is even more upbeat, revising its year-end target for the
Nikkei 225 index up from 20,000 to 24,000, and moving 'significantly
overweight'. The reasons cited include: an apparent bottoming out of the
economy; the fact that most stocks, excluding financials, are inexpensive in
p/e ratio terms; and further indications of economic improvement which may
lead to an asset allocation switch by domestic investors from bonds into
equities.
Nordic markets, with the exception of Denmark, enjoyed a fruitful week,
Sweden being the best performer both in the region and overall.
Unibors Securities comments that investors were seen buying cyclicals last
week, notably Volvo, Sandvik, SKF, Modo, Atlas Copco, Electrolux, Stora and
Trelleborg in Sweden and Kymmene and Nokia in Finland. This week, Unibors
suggests that Sweden will continue to be driven by bargain hunting 'in
oversold, inexpensive turnaround cyclicals'.
Norway is a different story, it says, with worries over a persistent oil
oversupply and its impact on interest rates undermining activity, and
investors focusing on how the government might avoid a budget deficit.
Mexico showed how much volatility remains following the recent assassination
of presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio: during the week interest
rates rose sharply and the peso weakened further.

FT  12 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slightly lower as
political uncertainty deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Equities lost ground slightly as uncertainty over the political situation
deepened, and most investors remained inactive, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average shed 36.91 to 19,898.08 as the divide between the
left and right wings within the ruling coalition widened. Market
participants had initially expected Mr Tsutomu Hata, current foreign
minister, to succeed Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister. However, with
the coalition on the edge of splitting, this seems to have become
increasingly difficult to engineer.
The index fell to a low of 19,867.47 soon after the market opened and rose
to a high of 19,999.30 later in the morning.
Both left and right wings of the coalition are trying to woo members of the
opposition Liberal Democratic party to join them. There is also a
possibility of a general election if an agreement cannot be reached soon.
There is little chance of the next government offering a totally different
approach to economic policy, and the question is how soon this year's
budget, which until now has been blocked by the LDP over Mr Hosokawa's
allegedly dubious loans and stock dealings, can be implemented.
Volume fell sharply, to 225m shares from 525m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks firmed 0.75 to 1,614.05 and the Nikkei 300 index lost 0.04 at
296.37. Advances outnumbered declines by 535 to 460, with 162 issues
unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.47 to 1,319.00.
Textile issues were higher on foreign buying. Teijin rose Y9 to Y541 and
Mitsubishi Rayon Y9 to Y416. Chemical shares were also among the winners,
with Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals up Y5 at Y406.
Japan Energy, a mining development and petroleum refining company, dropped
Y20 to Y405. The company holds a 41.5 per cent stake in Kashima Oil, a
privately owned refiner which announced huge unrealised losses over the
weekend due to foreign exchange forward transactions.
But other shareholders of Kashima were higher on bargain hunting, Cosmo Oil
gaining Y11 at Y863 and Mitsubishi Petrochemical Y20 at Y698.
Fuji Photo Film, sold last week on fears of a decline in market share,
rebounded Y100 to Y2,140.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 105.95 firmer at 22,071.13 in volume of 9.5m
shares.
Roundup
Renewed Japanese buying in several of the Pacific Rim markets was attributed
to the launch of fresh investment strategies at the beginning of Tokyo's new
financial year, rather than political worries following the resignation of
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister. Analysts noted that
trading volume was very thin throughout the region. Bombay was closed for a
public holiday.
HONG KONG saw a late round of buying, spurred by renewed demand from
Japanese investors, which took the market 1.9 per cent higher in otherwise
thin trade.
The Hang Seng index moved forward 178.55 to 9,476.77 in turnover that
expanded to an indicated HKDollars 2.89bn, from HKDollars 2.51bn on Friday,
but still well short of recent levels.
SINGAPORE advanced 2.9 per cent, with the rise attributed to US program
buying and some orders from Japanese investors. The Straits Times Industrial
index put on 61.71 at 2,191.95.
BANGKOK finished higher after a bout of late-session bargain hunting ahead
of a three-day national holiday from today. The SET index gained 11.26 at
1,235.26 in the lowest turnover of the year at Bt2.1bn, compared with the
previous lowest of Bt2.3bn on April 5.
SEOUL advanced for the sixth consecutive session in moderate trading as
early gains weathered afternoon profit-taking. The composite index added
11.05 at 894.47.
MANILA was marginally higher on late buying of San Miguel, after a slow
start which followed the overnight fall by PLDT in New York. The composite
index firmed 5.5 to 2,643.08 as San Miguel 'B' rose 4 pesos to 216 pesos.
TAIWAN reversed early gains and ended sharply lower on heavy profit-taking
in banking stocks after their sharp advance late last week. The weighted
index lost 77.36, or 1.4 per cent, at 5,488.48.
AUSTRALIA closed softer on one of the quietest trading days of the year,
with investors cautious ahead of US economic statistics coming this week.
The All Ordinaries index dipped 6.0 to 2,076.0.
Western Mining weakened 14 cents to ADollars 6.80 as its 48 per cent-owned
aluminium unit Alcoa reported a 5.6 per cent fall in first-quarter profits.
KUALA LUMPUR was mostly easier in continued thin trading, but institutional
buying of some core stocks left the composite index 11.39 higher at 973.34.

FT  12 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Copenhagen Airport at discount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first trading day of shares in the Copenhagen Airport privisation offer
was a disappointment to investors.
The shares closed at DKr291 yesterday, compared with the DKr310 which was
the striking price after the Danish government offered its 25 per cent stake
at an indicative price range of between DKr285 and DKr315 before Easter.
One broker commented that the international consortium behind the issue may
have priced it too tightly for Danish conditions.
The fate of the airport issue was watched with special interest because of
the upcoming Tele Danmark privatisation issue which is expected to pull in a
massive Dollars 3bn.
The Tele Danmark issue is currently on offer. The first trading day will be
April 28, when the Copenhagen Stock Exchange will remain open late to enable
trading to take place simultaneously in Copenhagen and New York.

FT  12 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris worries over decline in
turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses rose, but the day was less exciting than it looked, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS added 1.4 per cent with many investors looking ahead to Thursday's
Bundesbank meeting, hoping that this might trigger a further round of
Europe-wide rate cuts. The CAC-40 index put on 30.51 to 2,145.28.
However, professionals were worried by the relative lack of activity as
turnover remained at a modest FFr3bn. UBS said that after average daily
turnover of some FFr8bn in January and FFr6bn in February, the figure had
shrunk to a daily average of FFr4.7bn last month. The Swiss bank noted an
absence of foreign investors and a steady stream of rights issues, inflated
last week by Cap Gemini Sogeti and Cerus and with further additions expected
soon from Euro Disney and Eurotunnel.
Peugeot climbed FFr21 or 2.4 per cent to FFr895, as brokers revised their
estimates upwards. Kleinwort Benson, which recently issued a buy note,
forecast outperformance based on success with new models and benefits
arising from restructuring measures.
FRANKFURT fed on the global switch to cyclicals, Daimler leading the market
up with a DM17 rise to DM878 as the Dax index rose 21.99 to 2,225.33.
Turnover eased from DM10.2bn to DM9.6bn. Daimler led the active stocks list
in DM1.3bn after Der Spiegel said over the weekend that group net profits
would fall from DM1.45bn to DM615m in 1993.
Among the less fashionable financials, however, Commerzbank fell DM1.50 to
DM362.00 after it said that group net profits dropped in 1993. The bank
raised its dividend, but also announced a DM400m capital increase.
Back among the cyclicals, Siemens closed the session up DM10.30 at DM731.30,
benefiting from its recent underperformance. Thyssen jumped DM6.30 to
DM280.00 and Mannesmann by DM10 to DM441.50 on a large buy order.
MILAN extended its post election rally, the Comit index rising another 19.25
or 2.5 per cent to 775.88.
Fiat remained at the centre of attention, adding L420 or 6.7 per cent to
L6,630, for a cumulative 18.3 per cent rise since Easter. Yesterday,
speculation mounted that the new government might introduce tax incentives
to boost car sales, like those recently announced by the Spanish and French
governments. But Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International
commented that while the idea of such incentives was sound, it was not
compelling given the other commitments awaiting the new administration.
Pirelli surged L168 or 5.6 per cent to L3,159, off a day's high of L3,270,
after reports that it was joining forces with Alcatel Alsthom to buy a joint
stake in Stet which is slated for privatisation later this year.
ZURICH saw profit-taking but the SMI index still finished 10.6 higher at
2,884.0.
The market was driven by heavy demand for UBS, SFr10 higher at SFr1,268, but
elsewhere, the financial sector was mixed. Zurich Insurance bearers fell
SFr23 to SFr1,330 while Swiss Re, supported by a buy recommendation from
Credit Suisse, rose SFr12 to SFr630.
Nestle, a target of renewed US institutional buying, added SFr18 to
SFr1,234.
Investors gave a mixed response to first quarter sales figures from Roche.
While a 12 per cent rise in local currency terms was seen as satisfactory,
there was disappointment that this translated into a rise of just 6 per cent
in Swiss francs. The certificates gave up an early SFr45 advance to end
unchanged at SFr7,150.
AMSTERDAM was motivated by impressive rises in the internationals as the AEX
index rose another 7.12, or 1.7 per cent to 422.71. Royal Dutch recorded its
fourth successive gain as more foreign investors entered as buyers. The
shares advanced Fl 3.60 to Fl 204.40.
Unilever, up Fl 5.40 to Fl 204.70, was another good performer as the company
reiterated its commitment to brand products, an area which has come up
against increasing pressure recently from unbranded products.
Ahold was one of the few stocks to go against the trend, losing 40 cents to
Fl 48.60, after denying reports that its domestic supermarket chain had been
losing market share in the first months of 1994.
WARSAW tumbled another 10.7 per cent as investors, shaken by last week's
falls, continued to sell. The WIG index fell 1,436.7 to 11,959.7, down by
42.4 per cent since its peak on March 8.

FT  12 APR 94 / Markets Report: Political fears boost yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullish predictions about the outlook for the currency and concern about a
political vacuum in Japan caused the yen to appreciate on foreign exchanges
yesterday, writes Philip Gawith.
The Japanese currency finished in London at Y103.325 against the dollar,
compared with Y104.50 where it started the day. In New York it ended at
Y103.45. The trigger for selling the US currency was a forecast from US
economist Mr Fred Bergsten that the dollar could fall to a range of Y90 to
Y100 if Japan failed to stimulate its economy.
This forecast played on the nerves of a market already jittery about the
implications of the resignation last Friday of Japanese prime minister Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa.
In Europe, the lira continued its rise as further evidence emerged over the
weekend of co-operation between the victorious coalition partners in the
recent elections. After touching a high of L946 against the D-Mark, the lira
lost ground to finish at L950.3, compared with Friday's close of L950.9.
Markets were generally fairly quiet, with attention focused more on events
later in the week: the release of US and UK consumer price data, and the
Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday.
Mr David Barrett, proprietary trader at NatWest Markets, said the market had
recently been fickle towards the yen and Mr Bergsten's comments provided the
excuse it needed to buy the currency. Although not part of government, he is
seen as reflecting the views of the Clinton administration on the dollar/yen
rate.
Another reason for yen strength is the view that the US may find Mr
Hosokawa's successor less to its liking. Mr Barrett said the question the
market is asking itself is: 'Will it (the resignation) accelerate the trade
war?' He predicts that the dollar will remain soft until there is clarity
about a new prime minister and cabinet.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London, said he
would not discount the dollar falling below Y103 and testing record lows
against the yen.
Against the D-Mark, the dollar eased to end at DM1.7080 from DM1.7134, but
it closed in New York at DM1.7129.
The D-Mark had a mixed performance in Europe. It closed slightly softer
against the French franc at FFr3.425, from FFr3.427 on Friday. It was also
lower against the lira and the escudo, but was unchanged against the peseta
and up against the Danish krone.
Rates eased in German money markets, with call money falling to 5.75/5.85
per cent from Friday's 5.85/5.95 per cent. The repo rate, currently at 5.73
per cent, is expected to fall further this week. Sentiment about interest
rate prospects was slightly more positive in the futures market. The June
contract ended one basis point firmer at 94.56.
Elsewhere in Europe, the lira rose on the back of weekend comments from Mr
Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, indicating his backing for a
government alliance with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Forza Italia leader.
The escudo was firm at Es101.6 per D-Mark following comments from Mr Eduardo
Catroga, the finance minister, that the exchange rate was correct. Although
the government seems to have arrested the currency's recent weakness, Mr
Cunningham said there remained concern about whether there would be any
demand for the currency when the government started to reduce interest rates
to boost growth.
Sterling was quiet yesterday ahead of important trade and retail price data
due later in the week. The trade weighted index finished at 79.7 from a
previous 80. The UK currency ended at DM2.517, down from DM2.5265. It was
slightly lower against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.4737 from Dollars
1.4745.
The interest rate futures market has continued its recovery from recent
lows. The June short sterling contract closed yesterday at 94.56 (the same
as the June Euromark contract) from 94.51 on Friday.
The Bank of England yesterday offered Pounds 450m of assistance to the
discount market after forecasting a Pounds 550m shortage.
Yesterday saw the first sign of serious pre-election jitters in South
African financial markets. The financial rand (finrand) - the investment
currency for foreigners - fell by 12 per cent to finish in London at R5.6435
against the dollar, the lowest level in six years, from Friday's close of
R5.025. The currency, regarded as a barometer of foreign investor sentiment,
touched a low during the day of R5.72.
Mr Tom Chenoweth, chief dealer at Standard Bank in London, said trading had
been 'horrific', with panic selling the order of the day. He said the market
had been spooked by reports in the London Sunday press quoting senior ANC
officials as saying they would 'wipe Inkatha out' when they came to power.
The financial rand market is small and highly volatile, but even by these
standards yesterday's move was exceptional. The more widely traded
commercial rand also weakened, ending at R3.5925 from Friday's close of
R3.5565.

FT  12 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec stresses discipline as
production rise reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday reminded member
states of the importance of production discipline amid reports that its
output in March exceeded the 24.52m-barrels-a-day ceiling.
Dr Subroto, secretary general, said 'the most important thing now is
production discipline'. He thought prices in the second quarter, usually the
weakest period for demand, would 'not be too bad' if discipline was
maintained.
He said final Opec production figures for March had not been compiled,
although he acknowledged that they were likely to show a slight increase.
Yesterday the Middle East Economic Survey reported that Opec output was
24.99m b/d last month, up from 24.76m b/d in February.
Dr Subroto, in London to attend a conference on Opec's future, said the lack
of cohesion among some of its biggest producers was one of the causes of the
present problems.
Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the former Saudi Arabian oil minister, told the
conference Opec states were divided into two camps. The interests of big
producers with spare capacity - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq when it is
allowed to resume exports - lay in 'high volumes, low prices and expanding
markets'. Most of the other nine members, however, had little spare capacity
and were mainly interested in price increases.

FT  12 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Labour shortage delays rubber
tapping

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
About 540,000 hectares of rubber trees on Malaysian smallholdings are still
untapped, mainly because of a shortage of workers, the Rubber Industry
Smallholders Development Authority said, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Shahabuddin Shafie, the authority's director-general, was quoted by a
local newspaper as saying that the figure accounted for 30 per cent of the
1.8m rubber trees in Malaysia.
'The industry is facing a serious shortage and that is why the trees have
been left untapped,' he said. 'People prefer to work in factories than in
rubber smallholdings and if left unchecked (this) will affect the rubber
output.'
Malaysia's rubber output fell to 1.07m tonnes in 1993 from 1.17m tonnes in
1992.
The country's central bank, in its 1993 annual report, said that production
in the smallholding sectors, which contributed to 70 per cent of the
country's output, declined by 3.5 per cent in 1993 to 851,800 tonnes.
The authority is looking into ways of curing the labour shortages in the
country's rubber industry. 'This will include increasing the wages of rubber
tappers to as competitive as those in the construction or the industrial
sectors,' Mr Shahabuddin said.

FT  12 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wood pulp prices go higher
still
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North American and European wood pulp producers are taking advantage of
unexpectedly strong paper markets to push through another hefty price
increase.
Several companies have notified customers of a 10 per cent rise in northern
bleached softwood kraft pulp, the industry's staple product, bringing the
price to USDollars 560 a tonne.
The latest increase means that pulp prices have soared by more than 40 per
cent since the market first came to life last autumn, but they remain far
below the peak of Dollars 840 a tonne reached in the late 1980s.
Mr Roger Wright, a UK-based pulp and paper consultant, said there was 'a
50-50 chance' of prices rising to Dollars 600 a tonne by the end of the
year, but he predicted some weakening before then. Mr Timo Poranen, chief
executive of Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forest-products group, forecast a
price of about Dollars 550 at the end of 1994. Mr Poranen said that the pulp
market had undergone an important structural change in recent years, as a
widening variety of grades had lifted total stock requirements.
Demand for paper is especially strong in Europe, where prices for printing
and writing grades rose by 10 per cent in the first quarter and are expected
to climb by a similar margin over the next three months. Mr Wright said that
delivery times had lengthened from two weeks last autumn to between nine and
12 weeks.
Pulp prices have also responded to disruptions in wood supplies from Russia
and Finland, and higher prices demanded by eucalyptus woodlot owners in
Spain and Portugal.
Pressure to rebuild stocks has been heightened by fears of a strike at
British Columbia pulp mills later this year.
But many of these factors could prove temporary, with wood and pulp supplies
rising sharply later in the year. Mr Wright said that past experience
indicated that pulp producers 'shoot themselves in the foot when they're in
a strong position'.

FT  12 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Market
forces leave UK research in limbo - Funding cuts have left a yawning gulf
between pure and applied agricultural science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The name of John Innes will always be associated chiefly with garden
compost. But an equally important contribution to agricultural science from
the founder of the firm that originated plant nutrient analysis for that
growing medium was his endowment of the research institute bearing his name.
For many years the institute has been under the management of the UK
Ministry of Agriculture and a few weeks ago the Cambridge Laboratory and the
Nitrogen Fixation Unit were incorporated into it under the umbrella title of
The John Innes Centre.
Situated on the outskirts of Norwich, the centre is now a power house of
basic, strategic research into all aspects of agriculture and its scientists
co-operate closely with the Sugar and Food Research Institutes and
University of East Anglia, which share the same science park.
Last Friday Mrs Gillian Sheppard, the Minister of Agriculture, visited the
centre to review some of its work. In particular she looked at pioneering
plant breeding methods that may enable oilseed rape to become one of the
most versatile plant species in the world.
Scientists told the minister how, by using transgenic techniques, they hoped
to be able to create several new varieties of the crop. Each would have its
own characteristics, which would enable the oil produced to be used in
particular industrial processes from lubricants and industrial nylon to
cosmetics and detergents. Furthermore these oils could replace the
non-renewable, fossil feed stocks now used for such processes and both the
agronomic and industrial implications are environment friendly.
'It is our job,' one scientist told the minister, 'only to develop the
technology.' And he conceded that the ministry was funding this basic
research to the tune of Pounds 1.4m. Having developed the technology,
however, under the terms of its remit the centre is forced to rely on
industry to exploit and commercialise the science.
In the case of new oilseed rape varieties there is no shortage of commercial
interests ready to take on the exploitation. But when new technology fails
to indicate almost immediate economic opportunities, or when a promising
product is so new that there is no immediate market for it, the work is not
always developed to full potential.
Previous ministers of agriculture have seen fit to cut expenditure on
agricultural research and in particular that sector of the work dubbed 'near
market'. In other words to concentrate on basic research but to leave its
application to commercial interests.
Since 1985, for instance, Pounds 58m has been lopped off the ministry's
annual research budget - most of it from the 'near market' sector. That has
also included cuts in expenditure on extension and advisory services, which
previously assessed and disseminated scientific developments to both farmers
and the wider agricultural industry.
Ministry expenditure on agricultural research remains substantial at Pounds
128m a year. But many scientists and farmers now believe that the virtual
removal of the applied sector from government funding has left a yawning
gulf between scientific ivory towers, like the John Innes Centre, and the
people on the ground who could benefit from their work.
Attempts are being made to bridge that gulf by farmer-funded schemes that
concentrate on applying research. Cereal growers, for instance, contribute
to such work via a statutory levy on all grain sold; and sugar beet growers
fund the vast majority of research work on that crop through a long standing
R &amp; D levy.
This week milk producers will be invited to vote for or against a levy on
all milk sold after the winding up of the Milk Marketing Board. The levy,
which is likely to be fixed in the first instance at 0.04p per litre, would
raise some Pounds 4.5m per year for research and market development and fund
a new Milk Development Council.
There can be no doubt that the new body is necessary and it is almost
inconceivable that milk producers will vote against it. But many farmers
have grown used to free access to research over the years and it now offends
them to have to pay. Such feelings are exacerbated by the fact that even
ADAS, the government's advisory service for farmers, has now gone
commercial. Even to have the right to telephone an advisory officer, who, a
few years ago, would have given his full management or agronomic services
free of charge, now costs an annual subscription of Pounds 225.
That, of course, is the reality of market forces and undoubtedly farmers
will have to get used to the change of culture. Nevertheless if, as seems
probable, valuable and expensive government funded basic research is failing
to be applied because of the lack of a co-ordinated approach it may be
necessary, in order simply to get value for money, for the ministry to
reinstate some of its 'near market' activities.

FT  12 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian forecast increased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fresh assessment of Norwegian oil and natural gas liquids prospects has
indicated that output will peak in 1996 at 2.85m barrels a day, about
350,000 b/d more than predicted earlier and 19 per cent above the 1993
level.
According to a study soon to be released by Wood Mackenzie, the
Edinburgh-based energy consultant, Norway will retain its number one ranking
among western European oil producers throughout the 1990s.
WoodMac forecast earlier this year that production would peak at a daily
rate of 2.5m barrels and that Britain might take over as western Europe's
top producer. But the new assessment sees Norway maintaining production
above 2.5m b/d throughout the 1990s. This will be achieved mainly by
extended peak contributions to overall output by the existing Statfjord,
Gullfaks, Oseberg and Snorre fields.
The consultant sees comparable UK production being maintained at a steady
level of 2.4m b/d during the 1994-96 period while Norway's output will go
from strength to strength, rising from 2.38m b/d in 1993 to 2.67m b/d this
year, and shooting up to 2.82m in 1995 and 2.85m in 1996. In 1996 new field
developments could be producing about 650,000 b/d, but existing fields are
still expected to account for over 75 per cent of total output.
Annual Norwegian gas sales are forecast to reach 63bn cubic metres by early
next century, more than double the 1993 level of 29bn cu m.
WoodMac says the level of forecast capital expenditure for Norwegian
offshore developments is significantly higher than estimated last year, when
it was thought that capital expenditure would decline steadily through the
1990s to about NKr20bn by the turn of the century from the 1993 peak of
NKr53bn.
'Despite the forecasted lower levels of future capital expenditure we
estimate that around NKr210bn (nominal) will be invested offshore Norway
over the next five years. Over NKr30bn per annum is expected to be spent
until after the year 2000,' WoodMac forecasts.

FT  12 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee at fresh peaks - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE futures surged in late trading yesterday as markets on both sides of
the Atlantic chased each other to fresh peaks.
At the London Commodity Exchange the July position closed at Dollars 1,468 a
tonne, up Dollars 31 on the day, after earlier dipping to Dollars 1,423.
'There's still no sign of the anticipated correction,' one trader said.
Another noted that the market was looking relatively comfortable at these
prices, reflecting tight robusta supplies.
London Metal Exchange COPPER and ALUMINIUM prices moved higher in tandem
towards the end of the after hours 'kerb' session, with the latter looking
set for further short-term gains, dealers said.
Aluminium recovered well from a midday slip below Dollars 1,330 a tonne, for
three months metal, and with buyers prepared to defend Dollars 1,320 prices
pushed up to Dollars 1,329, up Dollars 5 from Friday's kerb close.
The GOLD price slipped rapidly in the afternoon at the London Bullion Market
to fix at its lowest level since March 10, as dealers reacted to fresh
selling, mainly of silver, at the New York Commodity Exchange.
By the close it stood at Dollars 380.75 a troy ounce, down Dollars 5.45 on
the day. Silver was down 7 cents at Dollars 5.42 1/2 an ounce.

FT  12 APR 94 / Survey of Slovenia (7): Two-pronged strategy - Foreign
policy has its back to the Balkans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Describing Slovenia's foreign policy, Mr Lojze Peterle, the foreign
minister, outlines a two-pronged strategy aimed at reinforcing regional
integration within the post-communist central European states and the
European Union. 'Slovenia will become an associated member of the EU by the
end of 1994,' he predicts, noting that the EU accounts for 70 per cent of
Slovene trade.
In an effort to enhance regional co-operation, Slovenia has joined the
Central European Initiative and the Visegrad group, which includes the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. Following their lead, Slovenia
joined Nato's 'partnership for peace' in March, described by Mr Peterle as a
'very important step in easing our worries about security' after nearly
three years of war in former Yugoslavia.
It is not clear how membership will work if Slovenia remains subject to the
UN's arms embargo, applied to all former Yugoslav republics. Mr Janez Jansa,
the defence minister, has insisted that the embargo be lifted, so that
Slovenia can co-operate with the Nato programme. 'During this last year we
accomplished everything we wished. The only problems were the embargo and
the question of succession in former Yugoslavia,' explains Mr Peterle.
Slovene politicians say that the question of succession - dividing up the
former federal republic's assets and liabilities - may take time to resolve,
amid a host of claims.
While succession talks continue in Geneva, Slovenia will not grant
diplomatic recognition to the rump Yugoslavia, says Mr Peterle. But he hopes
for the rapid stabilisation of the region - especially for an end to the war
in Bosnia.
Slovenia has denounced Serbian aggression. Last autumn, senior Slovene
officials were implicated in arms smuggling operations to Bosnia. Officials
(speaking anonymously) claim that the operations were a bid to help Croatia
and Bosnia against the Serbs, but sceptics says the motive was profit. Mr
Peterle dismisses the scandal as a 'transitional period' in Slovenia's short
history as an independent state.
Convinced that European integration depends on resolving disputes with its
neighbours, Slovenia has concentrated on improving its relations with
Croatia. Once united against domination by Belgrade, they are locked in a
quarrel over a tiny stretch of frontier.
Over the past few months Slovenia and Croatia have signed six agreements
(including trade and fishing) and convened working groups to deal with
remaining points of difference. 'They have a hot-cold relationship. But now
it seems, after a year, that they are trying to get it on a reasonable
footing,' says a western diplomat. However, according to recent newspaper
polls conducted in both capitals, there remains a high degree of mutual
suspicion.
Ahead lies the question of financing Krsko, the jointly-owned nuclear power
plant which supplies energy-starved Croatia. Zagreb has agreed to pay
one-third of the Dollars 25m owed to the plant, and the rest by August.
The Bay of Piran, in the Adriatic, is another problem. Croatia wants to
divide the bay in half; Slovenia insists that the waters were under Slovene
police jurisdiction when the two countries broke away from Yugoslavia three
years ago.
Relations with Italy, on the other hand, have improved considerably. Italy
has riled Slovenia from time to time, by demanding the restitution of
property rights to Italians who, after the second world war, were displaced
from Istria, a stretch of the Adriatic coast which belongs mostly to
Croatia.
Slovenia has called for reciprocal representation for its minority across
the frontier in Italy. 'Some 3,000 Italians have their legal representative
in the Slovene parliament,' says Mr Peterle, 'Slovenes should have the same
rights.'
Like most Slovenes, Mr Peterle has adopted a pragmatic approach. Slovenia,
he explains, must push forward with European integration. 'We will start
negotiations this spring. We have a lot to do. Hundreds of laws must be
changed - and in the meantime we will forge closer co-operation with central
Europe.'

FT  12 APR 94 / Survey of Slovenia (9): Costs cut at all levels - Gavin Gray
profiles Henkel Zlatorog, the cosmetics company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GAVIN GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the face of it, Slovenia looks one of the least promising countries in
central and eastern Europe for consumer goods producers. Average wages and
production costs are the highest in the region and, with a population of
only 2m, the country's domestic market is smaller than many cities in
Europe.
Things seemed very different in May 1990, when Tovarna Zlatorog, the soap
and cosmetics factory in Maribor, signed a joint venture agreement with
Henkel, the German personal care products company. The two companies had
been working together since 1968, both informally and through trade
agreements. They hoped that setting up a joint venture would cement their
relationship and help the factory lift its market share in the 23m strong
Yugoslav market.
'The aim of the joint venture was to cover all of the former Yugoslav
market,' says Mr Ernst Hackel, a member of the board of Henkel Austria.
'During the first year we ran into difficulties because we couldn't trade
with Yugoslavia. After 1991, Henkel Zlatorog faced many problems.'
Instead of pulling out after the break up of Yugoslavia, Henkel pressed
ahead with the venture. In March this year it lifted its stake in the
company to 51 per cent and it has invested DM20m so far, including DM5m for
washing powder production. While new equipment has improved efficiency, the
size of the workforce has shrunk from 1,264 when the joint venture was
signed, to 591 today.
'The whole process of production has been changed to cut costs at all
levels,' adds Mr Andrej Mesaric, general director of Henkel Zlatorog. 'Our
western partner brought knowledge of production and the way a company should
be run. Henkel not only cut the number of employees but also cut production
costs, leading to a rise in productivity.'
The factory is now producing cosmetics for Henkel Austria and is also
exporting cosmetics to Romania. Even so, turnover is still down sharply,
having fallen from DM200m in 1990 to DM110m in 1993. 'Without Henkel we
would have had considerable difficulties in surviving,' says Mr Mesaric.
Henkel Zlatorog's managers are looking forward to the revival of their old
markets in other former Yugoslav republics. In 1993, about 10 to 15 per cent
of its sales were in Croatia and a further 3 per cent were in Macedonia.
Mr Hackel says: 'If these trends continue, our market will rise in the next
two to three years, from the present 2m in Slovenia to 10m people when these
other former Yugoslav republics are taken into account.'

FT  12 APR 94 / Survey of Slovenia (8): Lunch on the family farm - The
tourist industry wants Slovenia reinstated as a holiday destination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swimming pools, horseback riding, tennis courts - all these and more can be
enjoyed at more than 100 farms open to holiday-makers in Slovenia, writes
Laura Silber.
Take, for example, the Vhrovec family farm, tucked into a hillside in
Ivancna Gorica, in the heart of Slovenia. The farm boasts scenic walks,
horse-drawn carriage rides, or a visit to the nearby 12th century Sticna
monastery. In the cosy dining room, heated by a porcelain stove, young Ms
Damjana Vrhovec offers her guests home-made wine and schnapps before her
mother, Majda, finishes cooking lunch.
Farm tourism has been popular for years. 'We can give visitors whatever they
want - single guests, city families who want to learn about life on a farm,
elderly couples who have come for the scenery and excellent food,' says Mr
Gregor Bogataj, representative for Vas, a co-operative tourist agency
founded by farmers.
Farms dot Slovenia's varied countryside, which sweeps down from the Julian
Alps over valleys and plains to the Adriatic coast. Gorenjska, the Alpine
region, with glacial lakes and evergreen forest, offers outdoor pursuits
from mountaineering to golf. Stajerska, to the east, is renowned for wine,
beer, and its rejuvenating thermal springs. Primorska, hugging 46km of
Adriatic coastline, has haunting karst limestone caves.
But in spite of the magnificent scenery, some in the tourist industry
complain that the country's 100,000 beds are not fully booked except at the
height of the summer season; they want to reinstate Slovenia as a travel
destination for foreign tour operators.
Before the break-up of Yugoslavia, Slovenia was a stop for coach tours en
route from Venice to Vienna. Hotel capacity was filled as groups headed for
holidays in Dubrovnik or other favourite spots on Croatia's Dalmatian coast.
But Slovenia disappeared from the travel brochures after the 10-day war
against the Yugoslav army, followed by independence in June 1991.
It has been difficult to erase those images of violence, or to convince
prospective foreign tourists that the internecine fighting further south is
far away enough for them to be completely safe in Slovenia. Mr Janez
Repansek, an adviser to the government on tourism, says: 'Unfortunately
geography is not most people's strongest subject. Many have trouble locating
Slovenia on the map . . . we still must convince them that Slovenia is no
longer part of former Yugoslavia.' And he adds: 'Even our crime rate is
below the European average.'
In spite of these difficulties, tourism in 1993 earned Dollars 800m in hard
currency - the largest single earner (taking into account private
transactions). Foreigners accounted for Dollars 1.6m out of 5.3m nights last
year, a 25 per cent increase over 1992. Mr Repansek says: 'It is slowly
changing for the better. Foreign guests who come here realise there is
nothing unusual - no war, no soldiers and no refugees. They find they are on
holiday in a normal central European country,' His job is to reassure tour
operators that Slovenia is a high quality product offering good value.
'British tour operators have promised to come back. They say it is not a
question of improving the product - they are waiting for their clients to be
ready to come.'
Meanwhile, plans are under consideration to establish a five-star hotel in
Ljubljana, the capital, which is built on the ruins of the Roman city of
Emona, where the river Ljubljanica flows past baroque spires. Adria, the
national carrier, has resumed daily flights from London.
Tourist officials also smile delightedly at Slovenia's medal-winning
performances at the winter Olympics in Lillehammer. They regard these as the
best promotion for Slovenia's winter sports, where tourists can choose
between the unspoilt Alps, the birch forests of the southern Bela Krajina
region and Lipica, the village where the famous Lippizaner horses were
originally bred.
But if foreigners really want to enjoy Slovenia, the best holiday is on a
farm. The Vrhovec family and dozens of others will be waiting to offer warm
plates of struklji (a Slovene crepe, prepared in some 70 different sweet or
savoury ways), and cellars filled with bottles of home-brewed wine.

FT  12 APR 94 / Survey of Slovenia (10): Legislation follows the EU line -
Foreign investment is needed - and controversial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investment has proved almost as controversial as privatisation,
although both have a prominent role in the government's strategy to
modernise the economy. Selling Slovene companies to foreigners is not
popular, but officials are convinced it is only a question of time before
more people recognise the benefits.
'People are not very keen on foreign investment, but (their attitude) is
changing. Many people want to buy their own company, but when they see the
company cannot survive (without new capital and technology) they'll accept
foreign investment,' says Ms Mira Puc, managing director for the
privatisation agency.
Foreign investment in Slovenia has been relatively small during the past 25
years, representing less than 8 per cent of aggregate gross domestic
product, or 0.3 per cent of average annual GDP, according to the Vienna
Institute for Comparative Economic Studies.
One of the reasons was the restrictive investment regime which limited
foreign investment to contractual joint ventures in which the foreign
partner could participate in the management of the company and share in the
profits, but had no ownership rights. These contractual joint ventures were
essentially quasi-credit arrangements making possible duty-free imports of
machinery and equipment.
Regulations were substantially liberalised in 1988, leading to more foreign
investment. Slovenia, with less than 9 per cent of the population, received
more than 25 per cent of total foreign investment in the former Yugoslavia
between 1988 and 1991. Since 1988, more than 3,000 investment projects were
realised with foreign investment of about DM1.8bn.
Over the years, the largest share of foreign investment has gone into
manufacturing, followed by construction, trade, tourism and business
services. Manufacturing investment has been concentrated in transport
equipment, chemicals, electric appliances, and food and beverages.
The biggest investor has been Germany with DM721m invested at the end of
September 1993, followed by Austria with DM 332m (but with the largest
number of investments), Italy with DM257m, and France with DM115m.
The new law allows for 100 per cent foreign ownership, although there are
still restrictions limiting investment in sensitive sectors such as defence,
aviation, telecommunications and the media. Foreigners cannot own land,
although a joint venture with a foreign partner can.
The law acted as an incentive, but the break up of Yugoslavia and the onset
of war frightened off many investors. Now the prospect of peace in Bosnia
and, at some stage, of an end to UN sanctions against Serbia, is also
encouraging investors to look again at Slovenia.
According to a recent Slovene government survey, most investors are
attracted to Slovenia by the prospects of higher profits; building or
expanding their markets in the region - including those in the much larger
former Yugoslavia; the availability of a skilled labour force and low
production costs compared with western Europe.
A stable legal framework for investors is gradually being put into place and
this should also help. A new company law based on German company law was
passed last June, bringing legislation into line with that in the European
Union. Corporate taxation at 30 per cent is low, and new companies are
exempt from tax in their first year.

FT  12 APR 94 / Survey of Slovenia (6): Exports pick up - Trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exports declined by 9 per cent from Dollars 6.68bn in 1992 to Dollars 6.08bn
last year, writes Patrick Blum. Imports were almost 5 per cent higher,
rising from Dollars 6.14bn to Dollars 6.48bn last year, causing a Dollars
400m trade deficit.
Mr Vojka Ravbar, state secretary for foreign economic relations, says
exports were about 6 per cent higher than the dollar value suggests because
of exchange rate fluctuations. Officials hope they will pick up again this
year. Germany was Slovenia's largest trading partner, accounting for 29.5
per cent of exports, followed by Italy, Croatia, France and Austria.
There has been a big shift in exports to the west from eastern Europe and
the former Yugoslavia, with the European Union now accounting for more than
half of Slovenian trade. The war in Bosnia and United Nations sanctions have
caused a halt in trade with the rump Yugoslavia, except for medicines and
some foods. Trade with Bosnia has become insignificant. Trade with Croatia
and Macedonia has declined considerably.
The sudden loss of more than a third of its export markets caused thousands
of jobs in Slovenia to disappear, particularly among the large traditional
industries based in the eastern parts of the country and around the capital.
Many of these companies had a captive market of almost 24m people; they
await an end to the fighting in Bosnia with the hope that they might at
least win back some of their former markets in Serbia and Montenegro, as
well as in the rest of the former Yugoslavia.
Slovenia has also lost ground to western competitors in traditional markets
in central and eastern Europe. The former system of guaranteed markets
through government agreements has ended with communism, and producers must
find their own customers amid rising competition both from low cost eastern
European producers and aggressive western companies.
Slovenia sees its future closely tied to that of the EU. A co-operation
agreement was signed last year, giving tariff-free access to the EU for
about 90 per cent of Slovenian industrial products, and Ljubljana hopes to
conclude an association agreement with the EU this year. The government also
hopes to sign a free trade agreement with Efta this year. It hopes that this
will allow Slovenian exporters free access to Efta's markets before fully
opening up Slovenia's own market.
Free trade agreements have also been signed with the Czech Republic,
Slovakia and Hungary, opening up a market of more than 50m people. There are
discussions with Poland for a similar agreement.

FT  12 APR 94 / Survey of Slovenia (5): Rehabilitation is only a start - The
banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After more than a year of reform, Mr Marko Voljc, chairman and chief
executive of Ljubljanska Banka (LB), Slovenia's largest and most powerful
bank, feels he can relax a little.
Its rehabilitation - the process by which its balance sheet has been partly
cleaned of bad debts, and the start of a long term programme of
modernisation and improvements - has already brought tangible results. The
bank, which still dominates Slovenia's banking sector, returned to profits
in the middle of last year. It has sharply reduced its stock of
non-performing loans by exchanging tolars 90.59bn (DM1.4bn) of bad debts for
government bonds, and operating costs have been cut by 15 per cent. 'The
results have justified the government's intervention (in the bank).
Ljubljanska Banka's rehabilitation has reduced the threat of a banking
crisis,' Mr Voljc says.
Most bankers would agree, although few may share Mr Voljc's optimism.
Rehabilitation is only the first stage in official efforts to establish
banking on a normal commercial and profit basis. The process is likely to be
painful, and accompanied by mergers and closures among the smaller banks.
'It's a long term project that will last eight to 10 years,' says Mr Jamko
Dezelac, managing director of the Bank Rehabilitation Agency (BRA)
responsible for cleaning up balance sheets and setting banks on the path of
reform.
New regulations coming into force in January 1995 will increase competition
and, it is hoped, efficiency. The central bank will make sure that banks
adopt western standards of capital adequacy and risk assessment. Monopoly
practices and cosy cartel arrangements to maintain high margins will no
longer be tolerated. From January 1995 a full banking licence will require a
minimum DM60m in capital - double the current DM30m. All this will force the
banks to sharpen up. From today's 32 banks, it is also expected to lead to a
dramatic reduction in the number of institutions. Almost everyone agrees
that Slovenia has too many banks, and that productivity is too low. When the
authorities judge that the moment is right, the banks will be privatised.
Several foreign banks have shown interest. Austria's Creditanstalt and Bank
Austria, and Societe Generale of France have already established
subsidiaries, al though foreign banks are waiting for the rehabilitation
process to be completed before entering the market.
'I expect that in one or two years we could sell some banks (to foreign and
domestic investors) at an honest price,' says Mr Dezelac. Initially, the
state will keep 10-20 per cent holdings, although the government does not
want to be a permanent owner.
Originally the LB group, which consisted of several banks, had a market
share of more than 85 per cent for domestic savings and more than 90 per
cent for international operations. Its predominance in the sector impeded
reform and undermined efforts to control inflation. 'It made it difficult
for us to lead a monetary policy,' says Mr France Arhar, central bank
governor. To modernise the whole sector, LB's weight in the system had to be
reduced.
'We can't have one huge bank which controls everything. In the future, we
expect that we'll have five or seven banks with a general licence, and lots
of other banking institutions operating mainly as savings and
co-operatives,' says Mr Dezelac.
Daughter banks of the LB group are being hived off. Kreditna Banka Maribor,
based in eastern Slovakia, and Komercialna Banka Nova Gorica, near the
Italian border, are undergoing rehabilitation.
Public debt and bad loans in the Slovene banking sector have been estimated
at about DM3bn, of which more than DM2bn are in the banking system, and
DM800m in foreign exchange deposits with the former central bank of
Yugoslavia. There are also claims on frozen assets in Croatia. Deposits with
the former central bank of Yugoslavia are unlikely to be recovered.
Domestic bad loans remain a big problem. Mr Dezelac says that while the BRA
can help the banks to restructure portfolios, it will be up to them to
improve performance. 'We can solve the solvency issue, but there will still
be problems of cash flow and liquidity.'
Privatisation and foreign investment will help, although Mr Voljc sees only
a limited role for foreign investors. 'I don't see Slovene banks being
dominated by foreign investors. My own preference is (foreign investment of)
up to 25 per cent,' he says. In February the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) signed a DM50m loan agreement with SKD
Banka, to be used in funding SKB's sub-loans for capital investment
projects, start-up working capital and acquisition of shares in companies
being privatised.
But in an open market the weight of foreign banks will depend on the
domestic banks' ability to remain competitive. This will not be easy, admits
Mr Voljc. 'Companies and individuals are becoming increasingly choosy. If
they can't get what they want here, they can go elsewhere, or abroad. So we
have to modernise.'

FT  12 APR 94 / Survey of Slovenia (1): Small, scenic and flexible - The
most successful of the former Yugoslav republics is working towards
integration into western Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past is another country for the great majority of Slovenes. They feel
their country has emerged from seven decades as a minor player in the
Yugoslav drama to assume its rightful role as an independent, central
European state.
Nearly three years after breaking away from the Serb-dominated Yugoslav
federation, Slovenes bristle when compared to the war-torn republics further
south, while breathing a sigh of relief at having escaped the war which is
wrenching the lives of their former countrymen.
Over the past year, Slovenia has continued on its steady course, joining
international financial institutions and signing several free trade
agreements. By the end of 1994 it is likely to join the other post-communist
states of central Europe as an associate member of the European Union, and
has signed up for Nato's 'partnership for peace.'
Mr Janez Drnovsek, the prime minister, who heads the broadly-based coalition
government, outlines a modest, pragmatic programme for the immediate future.
'We will continue without making any spectacular moves, pursuing sound,
moderate policies of economic development and stability,' he says.
While these aims would be little more than a pious wish list for much of
eastern and central Europe, they are a practical reality for this scenic
Alpine country of 2m inhabitants lying between Italy, Austria, Hungary and
Croatia.
Politically, the country is striving towards stability. Mr Milan Kucan, the
president, a former communist who led Slovenia's drive for independence,
remains popular, with his support crossing party lines. At the same time, Mr
Drnovsek has gained ground, widening the distance between his Liberal
Democrats and their next challenger, the Christian Democrats. Earlier this
month his party merged with three smaller left-of-centre parties and now
holds one-third of the 90-seat national assembly.
In a small country, however, small storms can sometimes take on threatening
proportions. Debate has been raging over state security and allegations of
wire-tapping, in revelations much trumpeted by Mr Janez Jansa, the
controversial minister of defence who was ousted last month.
Economically, however, there is growing confidence that the worst of the
post-independence re-adjustment is over and Slovenia is set on the road to
prosperity. This confidence is borne out by statistics. For the first time
since Slovenia declared independence in June 1991, GDP has stopped
contracting. Independence was followed by a 10-day war against the Yugoslav
People's Army in which a handful of Slovenes, several Turkish truck drivers
and some 50 young conscript soldiers died.
After the violent break-up of Yugoslavia, Slovenia lost one-third of its
export markets in the other former federal republics. That was a serious
shock for an economy where more than 60 per cent of GDP is realised through
trade. It led to a determined search for new markets. Last year GDP grew by
1 per cent and similar growth is forecast for 1994. Inflation dropped from
92.9 per cent in 1992 (on an annualised average) to about 20 per cent last
year.
'There is a bit more optimism, because growth means there will be fewer
social tensions and Slovenia will be more stable,' says Mr Ali Zerdin, a
journalist with Mladina, the independent weekly.
Last year's resumption of growth ended a two-year slump. But consolidating
the recovery still depends on measures to reduce public spending and wages.
For in spite of efforts to freeze wages, incomes rose nearly 14 per cent
last year, to an estimated Dollars 6,050 per head. This is not only higher
than the other former Yugoslav states but also well beyond the level of
average incomes in post-communist states such as Hungary, the Czech republic
and Poland, which are competing with Slovenia for investment and jobs. A lot
of painful restructuring still lies ahead, especially among loss-making
heavy industry. The government plans to privatise many larger companies by
the end of the year - even though this will increase unemployment, already
at 15 per cent.
But the financial structure is also being over-hauled. Government experts
responsible for the restructuring of banks agree that there are too many
banks, and most of them are under-capitalised. As further restructuring
takes place, the authorities would like to see the numbers drastically
reduced from the present 32 to about six main banking institutions. They
claim progress in cleaning up the balance sheets.
On the monetary front, Mr France Arhar, governor of the central bank, says
that Slovenia will continue its highly restrictive monetary policy and keep
a strong national currency. Politicians agree. 'We will continue with our
restrictive monetary policies and our balanced budget,' the prime minister
confirms.
The results are already tangible. The tolar (the national currency
introduced in October 1991) has remained stable while hard currency reserves
have risen from virtually zero to about Dollars 1.7bn.
While the economic picture has brightened, the question of unresolved
foreign debt threatens Slovenia's credit rating. Government officials are
anxious to settle the allocation of Dollars 1bn debt owed by the former
Yugoslavia. They feel, however, that their creditors are expecting Slovenia
 -the most prosperous country born of the collapsed Federation - to shoulder
an inequitable part of the burden.
But until the fighting ends in the former Yugoslavia, Slovenia's full
potential will remain under-exploited. While nostalgia for Yugoslavia is
publicly absent, Slovene businessmen admit that they look back somewhat
wistfully to the old days when they had easy access to Serbia's cheap raw
materials, easier transport links, and the 22m-strong markets of the former
Yugoslav republics. All the latter are now depressed by plummeting incomes,
or cut off by war and the UN embargo on trade with Serbia. While still able
to trade with Macedonia, the UN ban on transhipment through Serbia and
blocked access to the Danube underlines the disruptive impact of the war.
Three years ago, these almost captive markets eagerly bought Slovene
products, in particular, light industrial consumer goods which were of
higher quality than most Yugoslav products, and less expensive than those
imported from Western Europe.
In the past, critics dismissed the prospects for Slovene independence
because of its small size and population. But this now appears to be an
asset. A diplomat puts it simply: 'Slovenia is small enough to be flexible.'
Furthermore, the volume of Slovene exports will never be large enough to
upset its neighbours, but if it is increased it will guarantee most Slovenes
a comfortable standard of living.
While the fighting continues in Bosnia, and until the Croats and Serbs
reconcile their differences, an independent Slovenia physically separates
the prosperous European Union from the Balkan imbroglio further south. It
sees its future as full integration into the EU and Nato. But Slovenes also
worry about the cultural and economic influence of their bigger neighbours,
Italy, Austria and Croatia, and how their ethnically homogeneous state will
manage to preserve a culture and language which survived five centuries of
Austro-Hungarian rule.
There is some ambivalence and fear over the pace of integration. For some
factory managers, for example, foreign investment is still tantamount to
foreign rule. But a confident Mr Drnovsek believes that Slovenia will
continue to 'develop as a stable European country' as the young state leaves
the past behind.

FT  12 APR 94 / Survey of Slovenia (3): Growth is expected to double - The
economy reflects consolidation and steady progress
</HEADLINE>

Consolidation and steady progress are the fashionable words among economic
policy makers in Ljubljana, prompted by some of the best economic indicators
in central and eastern Europe.
After the initial post-independence disruption, Slovenia is begining to reap
the benefits of consistent, market-orientated reforms and of its
disengagement from former Yugoslavia.
The economy grew by about 1 per cent in 1993. Growth is expected to double
this year. Foreign reserves are at a record Dollars 1.7bn - and rising.
Inflation has been brought down from 22 per cent a month in 1991 to less
than 1.5 per cent a month now. A 1994 government inflation target of 13 per
cent looks as if it will be achieved, provided that wage rises are held back
and spending by local authorities is contained.
The budget deficit is small, representing less than 1 per cent of gross
domestic product (GDP) last year. External indebtedness, at Dollars 1.8bn,
is relatively low, although Slovenia has inherited part of the former
Yugoslav debt.
The country has benefited in other ways. Under the old regime, the Yugoslav
economy was already less centralised and rigid than its communist
neighbours. As the richest of the former Yugoslav republics, Slovenia had a
relatively modern and open economy and some of its companies were able to
compete in western markets. The country's small size and homogeneous
population also helped.
But there were big challenges in making the systemic change. Inflation had
to be brought down, and tough adjustments made to offset the loss, caused by
the war in Bosnia and United Nations sanctions on Serbia, of about 40 per
cent of export markets. With exports accounting for 60-65 per cent of GDP,
losing these markets threatened a wave of bankruptcies.
In the event, most Slovene companies adjusted, mainly by slashing jobs; as a
result, unemployment has grown to more than 14 per cent of the workforce and
continues to rise. Janez Drnovsek, the prime minister, says that the
government's first priority was to stabilise the economy, then to encourage
a resumption of growth.
Throughout the process monetary policy had to remain restrictive and the
budget had to be balanced to bring down inflation. Unemployment, Mr Drnovsek
says, is unlikely to fall rapidly - even with recovery. 'It was not easy
during the past two years, but I think we are through the worst, and we can
now envisage faster than expected economic developments,' he says.
The rise of unemployment puts pressure on the budget, although the social
impact has been partly offset by the large number of people working in the
grey economy. Nevertheless, Mr Mitja Gaspari, the finance minister, says
that social transfers are likely to rise to about 5.2 per cent of GDP this
year, compared with 4.8 per cent of GDP in 1993.
This year's budget has yet to be discussed and approved by parliament, but
it has already faced considerable opposition from ministers because of tough
expenditure constraints. Mr Gaspari foresees a 1994 deficit of tolars 7bn,
representing about 0.5 per cent of GDP. 'We want to keep the deficit low.
There will be no important changes in our orientation,' he says. But the tax
system is being modernised and streamlined; there are new taxes on tobacco
and alcohol; and value added tax will be introduced in 1995-96. Tax
collection will be improved and simplified.
Nevertheless, Mr Gaspari is cautious about prospects. 'All the figures we
have do not yet confirm a sustained growth pattern. Domestic consumption
alone is not enough to sustain growth and it is not certain that we can
continue with a restrictive wage policy.' There is strong trades union and
political opposition to cuts in real wages and living standards, and private
consumption has remained high, rising by 8.8 per cent in 1993.
This is obvious in Ljubljana's commercial and shopping centre. It bustles
with activity. Popular pizzerias are full of students who spend more money
on their lunch than students in most other former communist countries.
Slovenes had the highest standards of living in the former Yugoslavia. With
per capita GDP at about Dollars 6,000 a year, it remains almost double that
of Hungary and more than twice that of the Czech Republic, whose living
standards are the highest among the former Soviet bloc reforming economies.
Such prosperity is reflected in the region's highest labour costs, although
this is partly compensated for by higher productivity, better
telecommunications and and more developed infrastructure. Productivity is
estimated to have risen 3.7 per cent last year, and is expected to rise by
another 2 per cent in 1994. 'Productivity in Slovenia is the highest among
the whole group of reforming economies in central and eastern Europe,' says
a senior western executive with a large joint venture in eastern Slovenia.
But the government felt compelled to introduce wage controls in 1993 and may
re-introduce them this year. The prime minister worries that 'high wages are
a problem which can endanger the competitiveness of our companies.' He
complains that managers and workers in self-managed companies have been used
to awarding themselves excessively high wage rises - he hopes this will stop
once companies are privatised and face market pressures.
Dissolution of the former Yugoslav market meant that companies lost access
to cheap materials and inputs. Now they need to reduce costs by modernising
production lines and developing new products - and looking for new markets.
But with real interest rates at about 12 per cent for prime customers, and
18 per cent for others, companies say they cannot afford to borrow and
invest. Government efforts to force interest rates down more rapidly failed,
as the banks fought to hold on to their margins, but rates are now falling
very gradually.
Meanwhile, foreign investment is being officially courted, although there is
still considerable public resistance to selling Slovene companies to
foreigners. There are more than 3,000 joint ventures with foreign partners,
and more than Dollars 1bn of foreign capital has been invested since 1990.
Mr France Arhar, governor of the central bank, leads the charge against
popular fears of foreign investment. 'A small economy must have an open
market for capital movements, goods and services. This is a precondition if
we want to maintain or increase production.'
Privatisation and foreign investment are expected to accelerate the pace of
restructuring, which until now, critics say, has consisted mainly of cutting
jobs rather than modernising production to meet higher western requirements.
With domestic demand expected to stagnate this year, growth prospects
continue to depend mainly on higher exports and recovery in Europe.
