FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Dresdner, Daimler dividends
highlight German contrasts

<TEXT>
Stark contrasts in the state of health of Germany's financial and industrial
sectors were highlighted yesterday with the announcement of a 38 per cent
cut in Daimler-Benz's dividend and a 12.5 per cent increase at Dresdner
Bank.
Daimler, the country's largest industrial concern, and parent to
Mercedes-Benz, AEG and Deutsche Aerospace, blamed difficult business
conditions and heavy restructuring costs for a decision to slash its pay-out
from DM13 to DM8 (Dollars 4.66).
The first reduction since the second world war was approved at a meeting of
the management and supervisory boards yesterday, which also agreed to go
ahead with a rights issue later this year to support growth plans. Details
of 1993 earnings are due at a press conference next Tuesday.
Dresdner Bank, second in size only to Deutsche Bank, will give details today
on profits and its decision to raise its dividend from DM12 to DM13.50.
Markets had been well-primed for Daimler's reduced payment since last
autumn, when executives, hitherto optimistic about dividend prospects, had a
change of heart.
The change followed employee unrest caused by warnings that the job cutting
programme was to be extended and Deutsche Aerospace was to close at least
six German sites.
Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman, said at the time the company would try to
avoid 'bitter disappointments' for shareholders, but added that employees
could not be expected to be the only people to make sacrifices. Many
analysts suggested a payment of DM10 would have been appropriate.
Dresdner's dividend matched most expectations, which had hardened after
Deutsche Bank last week reported a 16 per cent increase in operating profits
after provisions for bad debts of more than DM3bn.
Earnings rose despite what chairman Mr Hilmar Kopper described as 'quite a
bad year' for the domestic business. Deutsche is the effective house bank to
thousands of small and medium-sized companies which have been badly squeezed
by recession. Dresdner, smaller, but less exposed to the industrial slump,
is expected to show a relatively better result.

FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Laidlaw earnings tumble 40%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Laidlaw, the Ontario-based waste and passenger services group, blamed the
Los Angeles earthquake, harsh winter weather and regulatory problems at its
flagship hazardous waste dump for a 40 per cent drop in earnings in its
second quarter.
Net income fell to USDollars 17m, or 6 cents a share, in the three months to
February 28, from Dollars 28.1m, or 10 cents, a year earlier. Revenues
climbed to Dollars 520.4m from Dollars 469m.
Laidlaw's results no longer include any contribution from its 24 per cent
stake in ADT, the international security and vehicle auction group. The
Canadian company began distancing itself from ADT last January through an
issue of debentures which it can redeem with its ADT shares.
Income from Attwoods, the UK-based waste management company in which Laidlaw
has a 35 per cent stake, fell to less than Dollars 1m from Dollars 4.3m, due
to a previously-announced special charge.
Mr Jim Bullock, chief executive, predicted an improvement for the rest of
the year, due to the strengthening US economy and to a flurry of
acquisitions of US ambulance operators. The move into ambulance services is
expected to contribute Dollars 125m to fiscal 1994 revenues.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Goldsmiths boosted across the board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Goldsmiths Group, the retail jeweller which runs 111 branches throughout the
UK, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.55m for the 11 months to January
29.
That compared with just Pounds 48,000 for the 12 months to February 27,
1993. The figures were achieved on the back of a rise in turnover from
Pounds 42.9m to Pounds 44.6m.
On a comparable basis, the sales rise was 11 per cent.
Mr Jurek Piasecki, chairman, said trading was 'consistently good' across all
product groups and through the country as a whole.
Exceptional growth was experienced in the south of England.
He added that significant increases in sales were recorded each month,
culminating with an 'excellent' Christmas period, when sales on a
like-for-like basis were 13 per cent up on the previous year
The upward trend had continued into the current year with sales in February
and March some 15 per cent ahead of 1993's figures.
Earnings per share emerged at 5.11p (0.12p) and the single dividend is
stepped up from 0.3p to 1p. By the year-end, borrowings had been reduced.

<TEXT>
A sharp increase in underwriting losses last year depressed profits at
United Friendly, the life and general insurance company.
At the pre-tax level they fell by Pounds 3m to Pounds 20.4m. The final
dividend, however, is increased to 11p making a 16.5p (14.5p) total, payable
from earnings of 21.2p (23p) per share.
A poor performance by the motor insurance division was largely responsible
for the profits decline. Against the industry trend, underwriting losses on
motor widened to Pounds 8.4m.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Ransomes to pay overdue preference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ransomes yesterday decided to pay its long overdue convertible preference
share dividend and also launched an attack on Steinhardt Partners, the US
hedge fund manager which has bought 30 per cent of the engineering company's
preference shares.
Mr Peter Wilson, Ransomes' chief executive, said proposals it had received
from Steinhardt for a recapitalisation of the company, involving conversion
of the preference shares into ordinary shares, were 'totally unacceptable'.
He said the terms proposed by Steinhardt were too favourable to the US hedge
fund and damaged the interests of holders of the ordinary shares.
Mr Wilson said he had no doubt he had the backing of shareholders and the
group's main bank lenders, led by Barclays, for his rejection of the
Steinhardt approach.
If Ransomes had failed to pay the preference share dividend by the end of
the month, the preference shares would have become voting securities, giving
Steinhardt 15 per cent of votes in the company.
However, Mr Wilson denied that the decision to pay the dividend of 4.125p
per share, at a total cost of Pounds 2.3m, was in any way related to
Steinhardt's acquisition of the stake over the past two months.
He said payment had been made because the company's trading performance had
improved in the first quarter of the year and the order book was strong.
Ransomes had got the approval of its banks, which include National
Westminster Bank and France's Societe Generale, before paying the dividend,
he said.
The group, a leader in the manufacture of grass-cutting equipment, had
borrowings of Pounds 75m at the end of last year and made pre-tax losses of
Pounds 8.9m in 1993.
Mr Wilson said the group was working on its own proposals to reduce the
excessive burden of its debts, but had not yet decided a strategy.
The convertible preference share price yesterday rose from 65.5p to 76p,
compared with the average price paid by Steinhardt for its stake of 55p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Regal Hotel Group, the acquisitive operator of 3-star provincial hotels,
returned to profit in the year to January 2, aided by the deconsolidation of
its Bramhope offshoot.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 573,000 included an exceptional credit of Pounds
1.24m related to Bramhope. This resulted from the subsidiary being
controlled by the Royal Bank of Scotland and representing assets that were
part of Regal prior to its reconstruction in December 1992.
Turnover in the period under review amounted to Pounds 2.68m.
The year to December 27 1992 suffered a Pounds 500,000 loss (restated under
FRS 3) on sales of Pounds 2.95m.
The group acquired three hotels last year and a further three have been
purchased - one conditionally - so far this year. This means that its
portfolio now comprises eight hotels, of which six are owned and two
managed.
The company, traded on the USM, said that the operating loss from continuing
operations of Pounds 488,000 - excluding exceptional redundancy costs of
Pounds 49,000 - was in line with its expectations. It was attributed to the
head office overhead being in place before the build up of the hotel
portfolio.
It intends to accelerate its acquisition programme this year, while
maintaining its focus on the commercially-driven provincial 3-star hotel
market and a modest level of gearing.
Regal noted that a steady improvement had been experienced in trading
conditions since the last quarter of 1993.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cassell to be valued at Pounds 15m in May
float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cassell, the publisher which recently bought the Victor Gollancz fiction
imprint, will come to the market next month through a placing which will
give the group a market capitalisation of about Pounds 15m.
Cassell is best known as a publisher of dictionaries and reference books and
it was this imprint which was sold in 1986 by CBS, the US media group, to a
management buy-in led by Mr Philip Sturrock, an experienced publisher backed
by venture capitalists.
Mr Sturrock has lifted Cassell's sales from Pounds 3m in 1986 to Pounds 20m
last year, mainly by five acquisitions.
These include Ward Lock, best known for its Mrs Beeton cookery books; Arms
and Armour Press, a specialist military imprint; and New Orchard, which
supplies bargain bookshops.
This buying spree has left Cassell heavily geared and the group wants to
float to finance further expansion by acquisition. It said the businesses
acquired were largely lossmaking and under-exploited. Their integration had
involved substantial cost-savings.
Mr Sturrock said there were still plenty of potential acquisition targets
and the 'next stage' was to build turnover to at least Pounds 100m. The
group, which employs 175 people, sells about 35 per cent of its books
outside the UK - mainly in the US.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Unipart climbs to record Pounds 24.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unipart, the motor components and accessories manufacturer and distributor,
made record profits for the second successive year in 1993.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.9m for the year to December 31 were 26 per cent
higher than the previous Pounds 19.8m, on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds
714.1m (Pounds 661.4m).
The increase was achieved against a background of slow recovery by the UK
motor industry from its steepest recession on record and a 15 per cent slump
in vehicle demand in continental Europe.
The performance was claimed by Mr John Neill, chief executive, to vindicate
'the long-term view' which he insists managers have taken of the business
since it was privatised from Rover via a management-led buy-out in 1987.
The company is 42 per cent owned by management and employees, 38 per cent by
institutional investors and 20 per cent by Rover.
Mr Neill said he did not expect Unipart's own business to be affected in the
short term by BMW's takeover of Rover and Honda's initially hostile reaction
to it.
Rover and Honda account for the main portion of Unipart's components
manufacturing business, but Honda has indicated that existing contracts with
Rover will be honoured and in the meantime, is continuing to expand its own
carmaking operations at Swindon, Wiltshire.
Mr Neill would not comment on longer-term implications of the takeover for
Unipart.
However, it is likely to be a net beneficiary of the expansion of production
at Rover at which BMW has already hinted.
At least one other leading German manufacturer is understood to have made
approaches about possible component supplies.
Mr Neill said he hoped for a further rise in profitability in 1994.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Capel hits out at analysts over recovery
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Analysts are underestimating the scope for profits recovery from UK
industrial companies over the next two years, according to research from
James Capel.
The stockbroker's market strategy team argues that sector analysts,
including its own, are being too cautious about prospects for sales growth
and margins and concludes that cyclical recovery stocks are still cheap.
The report, entitled A Profits Pathology, says there is 'substantial scope
for an earnings surprise in UK industrial stocks'. It points to experience
in the US, where corporate earnings have been on average 3 per cent better
than expected over the past year.
Aggregate projections from Capel's sector analysts forecast earnings per
share growth of 19 per cent in 1994 and 13 per cent in 1995. But the report
forecasts 25 per cent and 20 per cent growth. That reduces the prospective
p/e for industrial stocks from 16.5 to 15.5.
While the most rapid growth will be seen in 1994-95, Capel predicts 'it may
well be another 3-4 years before this cycle peaks'. Over the next five years
the UK should be able to sustain average profit growth of 11.5 per cent,
taking GDP profits' share back to levels last seen in the early 1960s.
The bullish forecasts are based partly on the prediction of low growth in
input costs, such as raw materials, utility prices and labour, compared with
manufacturers' prices, together with continued productivity improvements,
particularly in services.
Capel also believes that companies have become more 'operationally geared'
over the last decade, judging by the sharp rise in capital/labour ratios.
This should mean that changes in turnover will have a greater impact on
profits.
The aggregate forecasts of Capel's sector analysts are based on annual sales
growth of 6 per cent over the next two years, in line with the nominal
growth of the UK economy. But, with the world economy recovering, the
strategy team argues that this could be too modest, given that half the
sales of UK industrial companies are overseas.
The report suggests that the caution of sector analysts may stem from the
fact that they misjudged the impact of recession on UK industrial profits.
More generally, forecasters find it difficult to gauge the timing and scope
of turning points in the profits cycle.
'Most forecasters failed to predict the earnings downturn in 1991 and 1992,
much as they had failed to predict the extent of the upturn in 1983 and
1984.'

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Gowrings recovers to Pounds 251,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sustained growth from its leisure and food services operations offset a
downturn on the motor side and enabled Gowrings to turn round from a
restated pre-tax loss of Pounds 82,000 to a Pounds 251,000 profit in 1993.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 54m (Pounds 52m), while profit included
exceptional credits of Pounds 157,000 (Pounds 42,000) - mainly a surplus on
disposal of fixed assets.
Earnings per share were 2.29p (1.4p losses) and the final dividend is an
unchanged 1p for a same-again total of 2p.
Motor division profits fell to Pounds 61,000 (Pounds 406,000) as a result of
lower manufacturer's discount and incentives and Pounds 99,000 of redundancy
costs.
The leisure side, however, lifted profits from Pounds 293,000 to Pounds
522,000, with good results from the BurgerKing restaurants and an
improvement at Park Homes.
The company said trading for the last quarter of 1993 was markedly better.
This trend had been maintained in the first quarter of this year, with both
the motor and leisure divisions showing an improvement over last year.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Invesco shows sharp increase to Pounds
33.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Invesco, the international fund management group, reported sharply improved
profits after a year of worldwide restructuring and negative publicity in
the UK.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-December were Pounds 33.4m, against
Pounds 12.6m last time, and were struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 2m
 -down from Pounds 16.6m in 1992.
Income for the year rose by Pounds 36.4m to Pounds 172m.
Profitability was concentrated in the US division. The North American region
made a profit of Pounds 41.7m, while the Pacific region incurred a Pounds
574,000 loss. The European division, including the UK, made an initial
profit of Pounds 4m, but exceptional items turned that into a loss of Pounds
10.6m.
The exceptional losses resulted from an Pounds 11.5m out of court settlement
of a legal dispute over the Mirror Group pension scheme and a Pounds 3m
write-off of computer software costs.
They were offset by several positive items, including gains from the sale of
investments in Oak Industries and Second Consolidated Trust, which
contributed Pounds 3.7m and Pounds 2.6m respectively.
Mr Charles Brady, chairman, described 1993 as a 'confused' year, and said
that while 1994 would be better, the group would not reach its full
potential until 1995 or beyond.
Administrative reorganisation and withdrawal from areas other than the core
business of fund management will continue this year, and more job losses are
likely in the UK. A consolidation of unit trusts is also planned.
Funds under management at the year-end were Pounds 45bn, up from Pounds 40bn
at the end of 1992.
The proportion of funds from US sources grew to 80 per cent, from 78 per
cent.
Earnings per share emerged at 10p (2.5p), and the total dividend is raised
0.5p to 3.5p via a final of 2.5p.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Metals foray benefits Middlesex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Middlesex Holdings yesterday announced a return to the black at the
operating level in its first results since entering the metals trading
business in the former Soviet Union.
The former Ferromet, which is chaired by Mr Phil Edmunds, the former
Middlesex and England cricketer, achieved operating profits of Pounds
158,000 in 1993, against a loss of Pounds 1.1m, on sharply lower sales of
Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 7.24m).
The absence of an exceptional Pounds 8.99m gain from disposals enjoyed in
1992 resulted in a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.85m to Pounds
155,000.
Earnings per share fell from 2.71p to 0.03p and, as previously, there is no
dividend.
The operating profit was due to a Pounds 358,000 trading contribution from
metal trading businesses formerly owned by Mr Masoud Alikhani, the
Iranian-born businessman
These companies were injected into Middlesex as part of a capital
restructuring and Pounds 754,725 rights issue last November. Mr Alikhani was
appointed chief executive at the same time.
Following the restructuring, 29.9 per cent of Middlesex is held by Mr
Alikhani, his family, and a group of seven Russian investors.
Mr Alikhani says he intends to exploit the lack of financial infrastructure
in the former Soviet Union which leaves many local companies unable to
transact business in neighbouring republics.
Middlesex currently buys raw materials to supply to smelters, which then pay
the company in the finished product. The group is also involved in oil
trading.
Middlesex intends to expand in the CIS and has recently appointed Mr
Alexander Vladislavev, vice-president of Russia's equivalent of the CBI, as
an executive director.
Mr Alikhani has warranted to bring trading profits of Dollars 1m (Pounds
600,000) into Ferromet.
This had already been achieved since the businesses were injected, he said.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Brammer edges ahead to Pounds 8.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brammer, the industrial services group, reported a marginal increase in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.22m to Pounds 8.28m in the year to
end-December.
The latest figure was struck after a Pounds 900,000 loss on the disposal in
November of Master Pumps Equipment, its US subsidiary, and net interest
payable of Pounds 1.2m, compared with a nil charge in 1992.
At the operating level profits were ahead from Pounds 8.25m to Pounds 10.4m.
Total turnover rose from Pounds 123m to Pounds 141m, mainly reflecting the
first full year of Roulement Service, the French bearings distributor
acquired in 1992.
'The underlying businesses showed a very strong operating performance,' said
Mr Robert Ffoulkes-Jones, chief executive. The first quarter this year had
shown a substantial improvement over first-quarter 1993. 'Should the trend
continue we will have a strong 1994.'
Brammer's business is 81 per cent distribution of bearings and power
transmission products, in which it is market leader in the UK and France,
and 19 per cent rental of test equipment.
BSL, the power transmission business in the UK, increased its market share,
lifting sales by 5.4 per cent and profits by almost 15 per cent. Roulement
sales were down 3.3 per cent, but the French market overall was 15 per cent
down, Mr Ffoulkes-Jones said. He wants to push the French market share ahead
to a similar level to that of BSL - more than 35 per cent.
Group operating profits in the UK rose from Pounds 7.92m to Pounds 10.5m on
turnover of Pounds 97.4m (Pounds 91.4m). Continental European activities
incurred an operating loss of Pounds 233,000 on turnover of Pounds 36.4m,
compared with profits of Pounds 172,000 on turnover of Pounds 34m.
The rental division, which specialises in electronic testing equipment,
doubled operating profits to Pounds 1.66m on turnover of Pounds 24.6m
(Pounds 22.7m). The group had overcome its former dependence on defence for
40 per cent of its business by switching to the data communications and
telecommunications sector. Defence now accounts for just 5 per cent of
turnover.
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 2.1m, helped by a Pounds 5.6m
placing in September. Gearing at the year end was 6 per cent (26 per cent).
Earnings were unchanged at 13.3p, and a same-again final dividend of 8.5p is
proposed, maintaining the total at 13p.
COMMENT
Brammer has survived the recession with an unbroken run of 13p dividends for
the past six years. The yield of more than 5 per cent is itself a good
enough reason for holding on to the shares. Profits of Pounds 11m this year
put the group on a prospective multiple of almost 19. The main business of
transmission distribution is strong, and at last the rentals business is
beginning to make some money. Worth a look if you believe there is a growth
story in sight.

Pounds 34.7m.
It is the second regional wholesaler acquired by UniChem in the past six

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Development Securities buys portfolio of
London properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Development Securities, the revamped Clayform Properties headed by Mr Martin
Landau, the property entrepreneur, has acquired a Pounds 92m portfolio of
primarily office properties.
The company, which will assume Pounds 64m of debt with the portfolio, is
raising Pounds 19.3m through a placement to partly fund the Pounds 29m net
purchase price.
Since Mr Landau joined the board of Development Securities last June, the
company has issued Pounds 80m of new shares and built up net assets of
Pounds 83m following this latest transaction.
Mr Robert Ware, joint managing director, said: 'We're now at a size where we
can grow organically.' He pointed out that the company would not issue more
equity for at least a year.
The latest purchase comprises 17 properties, mainly in the Greater London
area. They currently produce net rental income of Pounds 7.3m, representing
a yield of 7.9 per cent.
Development Securities will pay Pounds 1m in cash and issue 10m shares at
30p. The remaining Pounds 22m will be paid via a loan note or cash. It paid
Pounds 3m for an initial option on the properties, which were purchased from
private companies controlled by Mr RJ Livingstone.
The company will raise Pounds 18.3m net of expenses from the placement of
64.66m new shares, priced at 30p. There is a clawback for existing
shareholders on a 3-for-10 basis.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Clark pays former directors Pounds 0.57m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
C&amp;J Clark, the family owned shoe company which last year rejected an invited
bid from Berisford International, paid Pounds 567,000 in compensation to
departing directors, including the former chairman.
The largest payment was Pounds 427,000 to Mr Patrick Farmer, who joined the
board as an executive director following the Pounds 15m buy-out, backed by
Clark, in 1984 of the Farmer retailing chain.
Mr Walter Dickson, the chairman who sparked a shareholder rebellion by
proposing to sell Clark to resolve the disputes which had wracked the
company for years, received Pounds 140,000. This represented the balance of
his Pounds 286,000 annual salary which was outstanding upon his departure in
July.
Mr Roger Pedder, who replaced Mr Dickson in November, said Clark would this
year review steps towards flotation, the compromise which helped to thwart
the Berisford bid.
He also announced a substantial increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds
121,000 to Pounds 20.8m for the year to January 31. Sales were 5 per cent
higher at Pounds 655.3m.
Mr Pedder was pleased with the performance because it was 'better than the
outlook on which the Berisford offer was based, justifying the decision by
shareholders to retain their investment'.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson recovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Owen &amp; Robinson, the jewellery and footwear retailer which underwent a
capital reconstruction last year, returned to profit in 1993-94 - with help
from one-off gains.
In the year to January 31, pre-tax profits of Pounds 111,000 compared with
losses of Pounds 2.53m. However, as forewarned last year, no dividend is
recommended.
The group's shares, which had risen recently on rumours that Mr Philip
Green, former chairman of Amber Day, planned to buy a 15.8 per cent stake,
added 4p to 30p.
Turnover fell 15 per cent to Pounds 21.6m, although within that the sales
through the Foothold chain rose 5 per cent.
Operating profits were Pounds 617,000 (Pounds 886,000 losses) but this
included one-off gains such as a Pounds 235,000 write back of provisions no
longer needed, the receipt of an insurance claim worth Pounds 394,000 and a
Pounds 258,000 refund from a pension scheme.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 920,000 to Pounds 367,000 after last
summer's reconstruction and share placing. Earnings per share were 0.48p
(7.6p losses).

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hewden-Stuart rises to Pounds 19m - Company
confident year will see start of building industry recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hewden-Stuart, the UK's biggest independent plant hire company, said
yesterday it was still confident that 1994 would see the start of a national
recovery in the building and construction industry.
The Glasgow-based group reported a 60 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 12m to Pounds 19.1m for the year to January 31, on sales up by
21 per cent to Pounds 200m (Pounds 165m).
The group said the improvement reported at the interim stage had continued,
and profits in the second half were up 90 per cent on the same period last
time.
Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman, said the board had decided last autumn that
this year would see an upturn which would benefit the group in due course
and had accordingly authorised a major capital investment programme.
He said: 'Our very strong cash position, coupled with the enormous cashflow
which is now running at over Pounds 1m per week, has enabled the directors
to take a long-term view of capital investment.'
Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 24m to Pounds 54m, all funded out
of cash balances which remained in surplus at the year-end, and the group
said spending on new plant was likely to continue at a similar level this
year.
Last July Hewden paid Pounds 11m for the non-operated plant hire assets of
BET Group. The group said these assets had been integrated with existing
subsidiaries, but had contributed an estimated profit of Pounds 400,000 on
sales of about Pounds 8m.
Upturn in demand was clear in the south and south-east of the UK, but less
marked in Scotland and the north-east of England, which had been less
affected by the recession and so had smaller scope for recovery.
Mr Sandy Findlay, chief executive, said higher utilisation levels meant the
group was beginning to be able to ask clients to pay higher rates for modern
equipment.
Earnings per share rose by 85 per cent to 6.77p (3.67p). A final dividend of
2.15p makes a total for the year of 2.9p (2.7p).
COMMENT
Analysts were full of praise for these results, and Hewden's shares rose 9p
to 161p. Even the tower crane division, which fell off a cliff with the end
of the last building boom, has been returned to modest profit. Elsewhere,
the acquisition from BET and the decision to increase capital expenditure
seems perfectly timed to benefit from an upturn in demand. The shares have
outperformed the market by more than 50 per cent over the last 12 months,
and are currently trading on a prospective multiple of over 19. That
substantial premium looks justified, given Hewden's huge operational
gearing, and the quality of management singles it out as one of the safest
of the recovery plays.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Alexandra Workwear lifts dividend by 47%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexandra Workwear, the uniform supplier, yesterday increased its dividend
by 47 per cent on the back of a substantial improvement in annual pre-tax
profits from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 4.6m.
Mr Julian Budd, finance director, said the increase marked a 'restoration of
the dividend', which was cut in 1992 when the company fell into losses.
The pay-out rose from 3.8p to 5.6p, including a 75 per cent increase in the
final to 2.1p. For the first time in two years, the dividend was covered,
with earnings rising from 3.5p to 9.5p.
The improvement in profits was achieved on a 3 per cent increase in sales to
Pounds 58.5m for the year to January 29.
Mr Budd said gross margins had improved by two points to 44 per cent, due to
a shift towards higher quality business. 'In previous years there was a need
to get . . . volume at very low prices,' Mr Budd said. 'We are now seeing
those strategic sales dropping out.'
Profits also benefited from a sharp reduction in interest payments from
Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 800,000. Alexandra had reduced net debt from 46 per
cent of shareholders' funds to 19 per cent last year.

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: O'Reilly to retain Independent stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish publisher and businessman, has decided to keep
his large minority state in Newspaper Publishing, owner of the The
Independent and the Independent on Sunday.
Mr O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland, paid Pounds 23m
for a 29.9 per cent stake in the lossmaking newspaper group.
The Irish company could have made a Pounds 1m profit today if it had decided
to accept the offer for the shares made by the consortium which controls The
Independent. The consortium includes Mirror Group Newspapers, El Pais of
Spain and La Repubblica of Italy.
Mr Liam Healy, chief executive of the Irish group, said yesterday he
believed that The Independent could be turned around and the investment
would be a good one for his shareholders.
'We see considerable scope for both cost and revenue improvements which
should transform Newspaper Publishing into a profitable company,' said Mr
Healy, who added that his group intended to be a long term and supportive
shareholder.
If, as seems likely, Newspaper Publishing will have to raise an additional
Pounds 20m in some form, the Irish may have to put up another Pounds 7m.

Shares in Sentry Farming Group jumped 9p to 90p after the Suffolk-based

Pounds 786,000 in 1993.
Turnover grew 22 per cent to Pounds 6.22m.
USM-quoted Sentry attributed the result to an improved level of farming
efficiency and an increase in acres farmed, together with the benefit of
currency movements.
Earnings per share advanced from 6.9p to 11.1p, while the dividend is

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wolseley Pounds 57m Austrian buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolseley, the expanding heating and plumbing distributor, has set its sights
on Germany and the old Austro-Hungarian empire.
Yesterday, the group announced the acquisition for Pounds 56.9m of the OAG
Group, the biggest distributor of plumbing supplies in Austria.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman of Wolseley, said OAG was the company's first
German speaking acquisition, which he hoped would lead in time to further
growth in Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
OAG, founded in 1871, has 40 branches in Austria. It extended its operations
to eastern Europe in 1990 and 1991. It has five branches in Germany, five in
Hungary and four in the Czech Republic. Operating profits last year were
Pounds 9m on sales of Pounds 187m. Net assets were Pounds 18.2m.
The seller is Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie of Vienna, a leading Austrian
quoted company.
The deal should be completed in about eight weeks, depending on regulatory
approvals. It could be terminated if the approvals are not given before the
end of the year.
Wolseley is financing the deal with the Pounds 55m it raised last August
through a placing of 8.7m shares, and is making up the balance through its

FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Wardle decline to Pounds 3m lops 27p off
share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adverse currency movements and lower interest rates knocked more than Pounds
1m from interim profits at Wardle Storeys, the cash-rich plastics and safety
equipment company.
The shares fell 27p to 435p yesterday as the group announced a 23 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.04m to Pounds 3.1m, for the six
months to end-February. Turnover was flat at Pounds 38.2m.
Mr Brian Taylor, chief executive, said he was confident for the outlook in
the second half and the following year.
Operating profits at the technical products division, which makes
specialised plastic sheet and coated fabrics, fell from Pounds 1.21m to
Pounds 1.09m on turnover just ahead at Pounds 26.7m (Pounds 26.3m).
The figures concealed a strong performance by the division, Mr Taylor said.
Over the last four years the group had invested some Pounds 14m in new
machinery, resulting in significant cost savings in both manpower and raw
material usage. But the benefits had been more than offset by a Pounds
535,000 adverse movement in the lira against sterling.
The division makes about 20 per cent of its sales in Italy, where main
customers include Fiat and Zanussi.
Operating profits at the safety and survival equipment division fell from
Pounds 1.53m to Pounds 1.26m on turnover of Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 11.9m). Mr
Taylor described the market for inflatable life rafts and other marine
safety equipment as tough.
The Pounds 345,000 profits downturn to Pounds 548,000 in the parachute
business had been expected, but significant orders, including one from the
French defence ministry, had been won.
Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 757,000. The group
ended the period with net cash of Pounds 26m (Pounds 23m).
Earnings per share were down from 10.9p to 8.3p. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 5p.
The group is expecting an exceptional profit of Pounds 1.5m in the second
half from the sale of land.

FT  08 APR 94 / Invalid looks set to make recovery: Alice Rawsthorn looks at
the French banking sector in the wake of the rescue deal for Credit Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past few weeks, the French banking industry has been dominated by
the political rows over the government's FFr44.9bn (Pounds 5.25bn) rescue
deal for Credit Lyonnais. But behind the scenes, France's other big banks
have quietly been healing their wounds after two bruising years of
recession.
Suez, the holding company with extensive banking interests, earlier this
week confirmed that it came back into the black last year. Paribas, Societe
Generale and Credit Commercial de France recently announced increased
profits for 1993. Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) was the only one of the
large banking groups to suffer a fall in profits last year.
French banking is still in a fragile state, as illustrated last week by the
government's announcement that it was postponing the privatisation of Banque
Hervet, a small commercial bank, until it had completed a FFr750m
recapitalisation plan. But the economy is now creeping out of recession and,
judging by the cautiously confident tone of recent results announcements,
the banking industry is on course for recovery.
'France has just had its worst recession since the war and all the banks
have suffered,' said Mr Sasha Serafimovski, banking analyst at Merrill
Lynch. 'But 1994 will be a much easier year for the industry and we should
see the start of a recovery.'
One of the main problems for France's banks during the early 1990s has been
the decline in demand for credit, reflecting the impact of high real
interest rates and the low level of confidence among companies and
consumers.
The credit squeeze, which followed a buoyant era of double digit growth in
credit during the late 1980s, has imposed intense pressure on margins by
forcing the banks to fight for share in a shrinking market. Their only
consolation last year was a windfall profit from their market trading
activities during the summer's currency crisis, which compensated for their
poor returns from retail banking.
In theory the level of credit demand should increase when the economy picks
up. But in practice there is usually a time-lag while confidence recovers.
The French banks also face the problem of a highly liquid corporate sector,
which means that companies will wait until they have exhausted their
existing capital before borrowing again.
There is, however, some hope of an improvement in credit demand this year.
Meanwhile the banks hope to accentuate the beneficial effect of improved
market conditions through increased productivity. French banks have high
overheads by international standards. Ms Sheila Garrard, banking analyst at
Lehman Brothers, estimates that operating costs account for 67 per cent to
68 per cent of the net income of both BNP and Societe Generale against 65
per cent for comparable banks in the UK and Switzerland, or 60 per cent in
Spain.
So far the banks have been hampered in their cost-cutting efforts by strict
French labour laws and tough trade unions. However Credit Lyonnais last
month unveiled a dramatic plan to reduce its 38,449-strong French workforce
by 10 per cent over the next three years as part of its rescue effort.
Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, claims that the group is
in such a precarious state that staff have no choice but to accept the cuts.
If he succeeds in implementing his rationalisation proposals, other French
banks will be in a much stronger position to demand heavier cuts from their
own employees.
Meanwhile the banks are hopeful that 1994 will herald the end of their
difficulties in the property market. Commercial property has been one of the
chief casualties of the French recession. A number of banks, such as Credit
Lyonnais, Hervet and some Suez subsidiaries, have been forced to make heavy
writedowns on property-related loans and investments.
However the banks will almost certainly have to make further writedowns on
non-performing corporate loans as, traditionally, the rate of business
failures has remained high even after the end of a recession as small
companies often hit cashflow crises in the struggle to meet increased
demand.
'We're certain to see better results for the French banks in 1994, but
that's only the start of the story,' said Merrill Lynch's Mr Serafimovski.
'The real recovery will come in 1995 and 1996. The question is how big it
will be.'

FT  08 APR 94 / Suter returns to acquisition list with bid for Wilkes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suter, the industrial conglomerate chaired by Mr David Abell, yesterday
ended its year-long pursuit of James Wilkes by making a recommended offer
for the Sheffield engineering group which has strong automotive interests.
Suter had built up a 29.5 per cent stake in its quarry and is offering
Pounds 23.4m for the rest. It would assume debt of Pounds 17m.
The offer is of one new Suter share plus 165p in cash for every two Wilkes
shares - valuing each Wilkes share at 180p, with a cash alternative of 175p.
Suter's shares closed 1p lower at 195p, while Wilkes rose 17p to 177p.
A recommendation from the Wilkes board was the preferred option for Mr
Abell, who has recently been trying to live down Suter's reputation for
taking small stakes in companies and not necessarily making a bid.
Suter's purchase of the Wilkes stake in March last year was its first move
since the publication of a DTI report on share dealings by Suter and Mr
Abell in the mid- 1980s. The report found no evidence that these and other
parties acted in concert, but criticised Mr Abell and questioned the timing
of his private share purchases.
Mr Abell, who was cleared of insider dealing by the DTI, was strongly
critical of the report's findings, but would not have relished a hostile bid
battle for Wilkes, in which these issues would inevitably have been raked
over again.
Suter has paid an average of 100p per share for its existing stake in
Wilkes. The Sheffield group's shares had collapsed from a high of 190p in
1992 - the year it fought off a hostile Pounds 35m bid from Petrocon - to
48p last January after interim losses.
Although Mr Abell has offered the Wilkes board a price per share near this
year's high of 182p, he denied that Suter had overpaid. Analysts believe the
deal could be earnings-enhancing from day one, given Suter's scope to reduce
costs.
Mr Doug Rogers, Wilkes's chairman, would join the board of Suter as a
non-executive director, but Mr Arthur Watt, Wilkes's chief executive, would
leave after assisting with the integration.
Wilkes yesterday said that it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m in 1993,
compared with a loss of Pounds 7.05m. Sales were flat at Pounds 40.4m
(Pounds 41.3m). Earnings per share of 5.3p compared with a loss of 36.9p
last time. No final dividend was recommended, because of the offer.

FT  08 APR 94 / Shareholders jib at rewards for BP bosses: Spokesman claims
share option plan violates Cadbury code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weak crude oil prices are the usual cause of oil company directors squirming
in their seats. Yesterday it was the turn of British Petroleum shareholders
to provide the irritation when they challenged the BP board over executive
remuneration.
The most contentious issue at yesterday's annual meeting, at the Barbican in
London, centred on a resolution to extend a 10-year-old share option scheme
for middle-ranking BP managers. Many shareholders saw the issue as a
rallying point for opposition to extensive executive incentive schemes at a
time when BP's dividend is frozen.
There was never any doubt that Lord Ashburton, BP chairman, would overcome a
steady stream of sniping from the floor. He did, after all, have more than a
billion proxy votes in favour of the resolution.
But the merits of the resolution were soon swamped by broader expressions of
shareholder concern over other incentive schemes, including one covering
BP's top 80 managers.
Detailed questioning by a member of the UK Shareholders Association took its
toll. Lord Ashburton conceded that the draft share option scheme had
'technical shortcomings'. He also agreed that a review of the plan by the
Association of British Insurers had criticised it for a lack of specific
performance criteria.
To frequent bursts of applause from the audience, the shareholders'
association spokesman claimed the plan violated the Cadbury code on
corporate governance, because it failed to provide 'a full and clear
statement of the directors' criteria on which performance would be
measured'. He also argued that the directors on BP's compensation committee
were not sufficiently independent to oversee the scheme.
Other shareholders expressed concern at the total number of shares - more
than 84m - on offer through the employee schemes.
Lord Ashburton's counter-attack stressed the importance of incentive schemes
as part of executive salary packages. He said base salary accounted for only
50 per cent of the total remuneration of BP's top executives, with bonuses
and share schemes accounting for the rest.
He explained that bonuses paid to executives last year were 'materially
higher than those paid the year before because the company's results were
materially higher'.
As for the dividend, it would be raised as soon as 'trading conditions . . .
and prudence' made it possible.

FT  08 APR 94 / Amec chairman warns of tough building markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amec, the UK construction, engineering and property group, returned to the
black last year, making pre-tax profits of Pounds 21m. This compared with
losses of Pounds 88.2m in 1992, when figures were depressed by property
write-downs and contract provisions.
The turnround was less than expected, however, and the shares fell 5p to
135p.
Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman, warned that UK construction markets were likely
to remain difficult while too many companies were chasing too little
business.
He joined the heads of other large UK construction companies in calling for
much-needed rationalisation to take place within the industry. Sir Alan
added that he did not believe this would occur.
Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing, last month blamed banks and
institutional shareholders for propping up 'enfeebled contractors', adding
to the damaging over-capacity.
Amec said yesterday it was placing greater emphasis on pursuing overseas
orders and establishing long-term relationships with customers to reduce its
dependence on conventional bidding, where margins were expected to be
'extremely competitive in most areas of UK markets'.
It added that similar conditions prevailed in many parts of continental
Europe, apart from Germany where demand for construction remained strong.
The company had also made good progress in the Far East.
Amec, as previously indicated, is increasing its final dividend from 1p to
1.5p making an unchanged total of 3p. Earnings per share of 3.6p compared
with a 44.5p loss after exceptionals.
Group turnover rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 2.18bn due mainly to increased
hook-up work on North Sea oil and gas rigs. This work was expected to
decline in the current year, said Sir Alan.
Mechanical and electrical engineering profits, which have held up better
than general building and civil engineering, rose from Pounds 18m to Pounds
22.8m on flat turnover of Pounds 1.36bn. General contracting profits, by
comparison, fell from Pounds 22.7m to Pounds 9.6m.
Housebuilding moved back to a small profit last year. Overall the
residential and commercial property division reduced its losses from Pounds
17.1m to Pounds 7.6m.
In the UK, profits fell from Pounds 37.3m to Pounds 28m. Losses in the US
went up from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 6.1m, but the figures masked a strong
second-half improvement.

FT  08 APR 94 / Highland bags 10% rise midway with help of Famous Grouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Highland Distilleries, the Scotch whisky producer, has bucked the trend of
falling profits in the whisky industry with a 10 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 23.4m in the six months to February and a 10 per
cent dividend rise.
Mr John Goodwin, chairman, said the rise in operating profit - up 2 per cent
to Pounds 13.6m - was attributable to the performance of the Famous Grouse
brand, which now provides some 45 per cent of group profit before tax.
In the UK, Grouse volume was slightly down, but market share was maintained.
Market share in Scotland dipped from 24 to 23 per cent, but rose from 11 to
12 per cent in England and Wales, leaving the UK share unchanged at 14 per
cent.
Highland said the UK price of Grouse was constant, while competitors' prices
had fallen. Mr Goodwin said: 'We could easily increase our volume through
promotional support and lower prices, but that would do a lot of damage. Our
premium price position is of vital importance.'
Exports of Famous Grouse, accounting for 40 per cent of the brand, were up
16 per cent by volume and 30 per cent by value. Mr Goodwin said that whereas
three years ago exports accounted for only 20 per cent of the total and made
no contribution to profit, they had moved steadily into profit since then.
The combination of falling sales at home and rising sales abroad meant that
overall volume had held steady.
Sales of new whisky fillings were down 20 per cent. However, orders for
calendar 1994 were up 9 per cent. Sales of mature malt whiskies were up, and
volume sales of the Highland Park malt brand were up 23 per cent.
Capacity utilisation at the group's distilleries was slightly better at just
over 40 per cent.
Mr Goodwin said it was difficult to see any change in the overall market in
the course of 1994, although he expected a 'fairly modest' turnround in
1995.
Interest receivable rose from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 3.2m, with the net cash
position moving from a negative Pounds 2.8m to a positive Pounds 14.7m.
Income from associates - mostly the related whisky company Robertson &amp;
Baxter - was Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 5.8m), with much of the increase
attributable to the first-time consolidation of the North British grain
distillery.
Earnings per share were up 9 per cent at 12.2p (11.2p). The interim dividend
has been raised to 1.76p (1.6p).

The US and developing countries yesterday settled a bitter dispute over
workers' rights which had threatened to overshadow the signing of a global
trade accord at next week's ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade in Marrakesh, Morocco.
The US had demanded that a formal declaration planned for the meeting should
commit the World Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed the Gatt next
year, to discussing links between trade and labour standards.
The demand was strongly opposed by most developing countries, which feared
it was a pretext to erect trade barriers against them. The aggressiveness of
the US approach was also criticised by the European Union.
In a compromise negotiated in Geneva, the US has accepted that the
declaration should go ahead without any mention of workers' rights. However,
other Gatt delegations have agreed in principle that the issue should be
aired in the preparatory committee which will draw up the WTO's agenda.
Developing countries have also said they will not object to Mr Mickey
Kantor, the US special trade representative, stressing in Marrakesh the
importance the Clinton administration attaches to labour standards.
The US and other countries said they were satisfied with yesterday's
settlement. 'It's enough to say (the issue) is on the agenda and we're
beginning,' Mr Kantor said. A delegate from a large developing country said:
'The outcome met everybody's biggest concerns, without requiring anyone to
give up anything substantial.'
Washington appears confident that several leading trading powers, including
the EU, Japan and Sweden, will support its call for an early debate on
workers' rights in the WTO preparatory committee. However, it still seems
undecided on the tactics to adopt.
US officials believe they need to do more to persuade other delegations that
they are not seeking a backdoor way to erect trade barriers. Mr Kantor
repeatedly emphasised yesterday that the US would oppose the use of workers'
rights as a 'protectionist tool'.
The issue will have to compete for attention with a growing list of other
proposals.

FT  08 APR 94 / Bosnian Moslems pave way fortalks with 24-hour ceasefire: US
and Nato urge dispatch of peacekeepers to Gorazde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bosnia's Moslem leadership, under mounting diplomatic pressure to enter
peace talks with its Serb enemies, yesterday announced a 24-hour ceasefire
intended to pave the way for talks on a longer-term truce.
The gesture came after General Sir Michael Rose, commander of United Nations
forces in Bosnia, failed to bring the two sides together yesterday for talks
near Sarajevo airport. But the two sides received peace proposals from Gen
Rose and are due to respond - and may meet - today.
A Bosnian Serb commander said that he would do his utmost to restrain his
troops during the 24-hour ceasefire proposed by the Moslem leadership.
Mr Charles Redman, the US special envoy to former Yugoslavia, arrived in the
Croatian capital of Zagreb yesterday to give momentum to the peace effort.
He will go on to Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serb HQ in Pale, and Belgrade.
Late last night, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that his
country and its Nato allies were urging the United Nations to act quickly to
dispatch hundreds of Ukrainian and other peacekeepers to the Serb-encircled
Moslem enclave of Gorazde.
Serb forces continued shelling Gorazde yesterday, ignoring a UN security
council demand and their promise to Gen Rose to stop bombarding the town,
US officials say that British and French peacekeepers may be redeployed to
join Ukrainians in trying to protect Gorazde's 65,000 civilians. 'The plan
is being put on a fast track,' senior US officials said in Washington. The
US has offered to transport the Ukrainians, most of whom would come from
Kiev, to a staging area.
US officials said that Ukraine had offered some 800 soldiers for the Gorazde
mission but that British and French forces already in the Balkans may be
included.
The US administration has disappointed the Moslems with its cautious
attitude to the latest fighting around Gorazde. However, President Bill
Clinton's national security adviser, Mr Anthony Lake, stressed yesterday
that the UN peacekeepers sent to Gorazde would be protected by Nato
airpower.
'We stand by that commitment,' Mr Lake said in a speech prepared for
delivery at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
He said the UN forces should be on their way to Gorazde as soon as possible.
'We must make clear to the Serbs and to the Serbs of Bosnia that the costs
of continued intransigence are high'.
Serbian forces have recently gained strategically important ground near
Gorazde, one of three UN-designated 'safe areas' in Bosnia, drawing nearer
to their long-standing goal of unchallenged control of eastern Bosnia, which
adjoins Serbia.
The Moslem Bosnian leadership has been reluctant to enter peace talks if
this is likely to consolidate the new Serb acquisitions.
In Zagreb, meanwhile, at least 15 people were injured yesterday in
explosions at a military ammunition dump. The explosions occurred after fire
broke out in a warehouse.

FT  08 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Credit cards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclaycard's offer to take over balances from other cards at a discount
looks baffling when it already has a market share of 38 per cent by value
and is recruiting new customers at record rates. There is no immediate
threat from newcomers to the market - Barclaycard's link with Ford seems to
have been an effective response to Vauxhall's GM card. Then again, the offer
is not quite as generous as it looks. There cannot be many low risk
customers around who are also feckless enough to run up a balance of at
least Pounds 3,000 on their credit cards when cheaper forms of borrowing are
available elsewhere. Barclaycard's campaign may keep its public profile up,
but the offer looks unlikely to cost that much.
Still Barclaycard's tactics do reveal a reluctance to take on board the
notion that its business might grow even faster if it were prepared to cut
its prices. There must be some resistance to an annualised percentage rate
of nearly 22 when base rates are a mere 5 1/4 per cent. Since most banks
want to lend more and the consumer sector offers a better prospect of loan
growth than the corporate sector, the chances are that margins on credit
card lending will come under pressure. At that point profits will become
harder to earn, even if there is some reduction of bad debts in the
recovery.

FT  08 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Invesco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the legacy of Maxwell now behind it, Invesco deserves to be judged
squarely on its merits as a fund manager. Yesterday's 10 per cent fall in
the shares suggests the market's judgement is not favourable. With 80 per
cent of its business in the US - where last year's bull run in investment
markets was less pronounced - funds under management were never likely to
match the spectacular growth achieved by others in the sector. More worrying
is the rise in expenses, which held full-year profits below expectations.
There may be special factors at work. Investment in systems now might
attract more pension fund clients in future. Still, it would be heartening
to see some concrete results from the company's declared determination to
get to grips with costs. A European operating profit of Pounds 4m is
especially disappointing. If Invesco can convince on costs, though, it looks
well placed. While UK institutions' memory of past mistakes will linger, and
its franchise in unit trusts will take time to rebuild, Invesco's position
as an international manager serving US pension funds should leave scope for
growth.
In the short-term, the sensitivity of fund managers' shares to movements in
the equity market is a reason for caution. Before yesterday Invesco had
already fallen by 20 per cent since the stock market turned in early
February, in common with most of its peers. If Invesco wants to evolve
beyond the status of a geared play on equities - as M&amp;G did for a while in
the 1980s - it still has something to prove.

FT  08 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Amec
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given that at the interim stage the City expected Amec to make Pounds 30m in
1993, a full year profit of Pounds 21m is a real disappointment. That is
especially true because the company looks unlikely to beat the Pounds 30m
target this year, despite the gathering improvement in the UK housing
market. The result only underlines how far market enthusiasm for cyclical
stocks exceeded their capacity to deliver. Not only are contracting profits
much further out in the economic cycle; the tax charges for companies which
have run up losses in the recent past will rise as recovery comes. Earnings
performance may well be pedestrian over the next two or three years.
With contracting remaining difficult it is odd that Amec's shares are
trading at a premium to pure UK housebuilders. They are more obvious early
beneficiaries of low interest rates and economic recovery. Construction
companies also generate uncertainty because timing of profits over long
contracts makes profits hard to model. The sector as a whole might benefit
from an accelerated trend towards greater disclosure. A more detailed
breakdown of Amec's North Sea and mechanical engineering businesses might
help reassure.
Even so, as Amec points out, excess capacity in construction is likely to
dog the industry for some time, making positive surprises even less likely.
Shareholders might have greater justification for the last year's enthusiasm
if the shares had managed more than a 2 per cent annual compound capital
growth rate over the last decade.

FT  08 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Recovery in the balance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Welcome though yesterday's UK manufacturing output figures are, they reveal
little about how consumers will actually react to this month's tax
increases. There are signs the recovery is broadening out into the capital
goods sector: output of investment goods rose 1.8 per cent in the three
months to February. Strip out the fall in car production, which may well
have been erratic, and there appears to have been a healthy increase in
output of consumer goods as well. Insofar as that leads to higher
employment, aggregate personal disposible income will grow, offsetting at
least some of the effect of the tax increases.
In short it looks as though the tax increases are taking effect when other
ingredients of continuing recovery are in place. The unanswered question is
whether a collapse in consumer confidence would choke off investment
spending and therefore hopes of a broader-based recovery as well. At least
this week's buoyant M0 figures for March suggest this has not happened yet.
And there are some grounds for believing the impact of the tax increases may
be less than many feared.
Only some of the increases will actually show up in monthly pay checks. Some
are better described as cuts foregone. Some, like levies on insurance and
travel, have yet to strike and will be absorbed into broader price movements
anyway. Meanwhile, a greater sense of job security and higher turnover in
the housing market may encourage consumers to borrow more. In that case the
balance of payments could displace consumer confidence as the principal
economic worry. That would make it even harder for the government to curry
favour with voters in the local and European elections by cutting interest
rates.

FT  08 APR 94 / Bosnian Moslem leadership announces 24-hour ceasefire:
Serbian officials respond by saying gesture is insufficient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnia's Moslem leadership, under mounting diplomatic pressure to enter
peace talks with its Serb enemies, yesterday announced a 24-hour ceasefire
and said this was intended to pave the way for talks on a longer-term truce.
The gesture was rebuffed by Serb officials, who reiterated demands for an
immediate start to talks on a permanent, general ceasefire.
The Moslem announcement signalled a retreat from its previous reluctance to
enter peace talks while Serbs were in control of freshly acquired land
around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde.
UN military officials could not confirm the new truce, and said merely that
they had issued ceasfire documents to both sides and were expecting an
answer today.
General Sir Michael Rose, head of UN forces in Bosnia, shuttled between Serb
and Moslem commanders but failed to settle terms on which they could meet
yesterday afternoon at Sarajevo airport, as initially planned. Another UN
officer, Colonel Richard Pernoud, said the two sides might come together
today.
Serbian forces have in recent days gained strategically important ground
near Gorazde, and moved closer to their long-standing goal of unchallenged
control of eastern Bosnia, which adjoins Serbia.
The Moslem leadership, whose troops are reported to be gaining ground in
central Bosnia, wants international pressure to focus on the plight of
Gorazde, one of three so-called 'safe areas' in the east of the republic.
But the mild language of a UN Security Council resolution on Wednesday
night, which stopped well short of threatening air strikes against Serb
forces surrounding Gorazde, has disappointed the Bosnian government.
Mr Anthony Lake, President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, said
the US had not ruled out the option of taking military action to defend
Gorazde and other besieged Bosnian cities.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, expressed impatience with his
adversaries. 'If the Moslems do not immediately stop their offensive along
all confrontation lines, we will order an all-out counter-offensive, and
then let the Security Council help them,' he said. The Serbs maintain that
their offensive in the Gorazde area, in which about 400 people have been
killed or injured, was in response to advances in central Bosnia by Moslem
infantry, whose effectiveness is growing as the weather improves.
Gen Rose has accepted this contention, but there are reports of unhappiness
among some of his UN colleagues about his apparent determination to play
down the situation in Gorazde and avoid Serb embarrassment.
The UN commander said after meeting General Rasim Delic, the head of the
Bosnian army: 'I am disappointed that the war will go on as long as we
continue to debate on this level. We need immediate cessation of hostilities
followed by the peace process, and that's what we are trying to achieve.'
General Delic told reporters: 'There is nothing going on.'

FT  08 APR 94 / AZT findings dash Wellcome's hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Results published today in The Lancet medical journal dash the hopes of
Wellcome, manufacturer of the leading Aids drug AZT, that fresh data and
analysis would vindicate its claims about the drug's benefits.
Full findings of the Anglo-French study of AZT confirm the preliminary ones
that shocked the medical world a year ago. People who are infected with HIV
derive no long-term benefit from taking AZT before they show any symptoms of
disease.
The team of scientists from the UK Medical Research Council and France's
National Aids Agency, who carried out the so-called Concorde study, conclude
that 'the results do not encourage the early use of AZT in symptom-free
HIV-infected adults.'
Concorde leaves more than 10m people worldwide, estimated by the World
Health Organisation to be HIV-positive but not yet suffering from Aids,
without any proven treatment to delay symptoms.
The study allocated 1,749 patients at random into two groups, one taking AZT
and the other a placebo. Their clinical progress was followed for an average
of 3.3 years.
People on AZT were doing better than the placebo group after one year. But
this 'transient benefit' had disappeared completely by the end of three
years, the Concorde scientists say.
Death rates after three years were 8 per cent for the AZT group and 6 per
cent for the placebo group; 18 per cent of both groups developed full-scale
Aids.
As the news was assimilated by the stock market, Wellcome's shares fell 8p
to 557p. They had stood at 762p before the preliminary results appeared a
year ago.
Mr John Robb, chief executive, said the final outcome was neither a surprise
nor necessarily bad for the drug. The company's strategy with the
development of Aids treatments would continue unchanged, he said. The future
lay in combining AZT with other drugs to contain the disease.
Several stock market analysts had miscalculated that the full version of the
trials would at least soften the harsh preliminary conclusions.
The Concorde team is now following patients' progress for a further 15
months. 'We are particularly interested in the mortality rates,' said Prof
Ian Weller, principal UK investigator. 'We want to find out whether the
trend to slightly higher mortality in the (AZT) group - 8 rather than 6 per
cent - has persisted or even increased.'

FT  08 APR 94 / Leading Article: The last board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Abolishing Britain's Agricultural Wages Board is, on the face of it, hard to
justify on either political or economic grounds. A government which has
committed itself to an open-minded consultative process will now find it
hard to argue that 10 supporters of abolition out of 4,000 responses
represents a groundswell of hostility.
Opponents of abolition - which include both sides of the agriculture
industry - say that farming is different. They argue that introducing annual
pay negotiations into farms where employer and a few employees live and work
side by side would mean an increase in avoidable friction. And given the
trend towards an ever shrinking number of higher-paid, multi-skilled
workers, abolition will not create many new jobs in the country even if it
does make those farm workers with little clout marginally cheaper.
But, as with many such united fronts, outsiders have grounds for suspicion.
Agriculture remains rigid with subsidies and cartels. Handing the authority
over wage rises to a statutory body is part of a broader pattern which is at
last being challenged in everything from the abolition of the Milk Marketing
Board to pressures from the Gatt to align agricultural support prices more
closely with market prices. Holding on to the wages board could send a
signal of tolerance towards a culture which the urban taxpayer has supported
for too long.
There may, indeed, be a case for keeping pay negotiations outside the farm,
but employers and employees can establish a substitute mechanism for wage
setting if the existing system is abolished. It is true that removing the
statutory basis would make it possible for opportunists to undercut whatever
was agreed voluntarily, but the threat of ejection from the the NFU would be
one disciplinary lever. A more telling argument against abolition is that it
is unfair that farm workers should bear whatever pain may be associated with
deregulation before the farmers have to take the medicine. The government
might acknowledge that point of equity, and finesse political difficulties,
by promising that the wages board will be abolished in 1997.

FT  08 APR 94 / Mood swings and trade winds: Serious tensions threaten the
progress achieved in the Uruguay Round agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When ministers from more than 120 countries gather in Marrakesh, Mor-occo,
next week for a four-day conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, they will be striving for a show of harmony. But behind the scenes,
many delegations seem more likely to be scowling at each other.
The uncertain mood reflects deep strains in a world trade system torn
between conflicting impulses. One set is propelling economies towards
steadily greater interdependence; but another threatens to drive them
further apart.
The cause of closer integration has been powerfully advanced by last
December's Uruguay Round agreement, which ministers will sign next Friday.
The most ambitious trade liberalisation deal in history, it is expected by
some forecasters to enrich the world by about Dollars 300bn annually.
Due to take effect next year, the round promises to step up the onslaught on
economic frontiers which are already crumbling under the impact of
technological innovation, freer capital mobility and instantaneous
information flows.
However, achieving these gains is likely to prove far from painless. The
fiercer global competition grows, and the broader its impact, the tougher
the industrial adjustments it requires. As a consequence, many governments
face mounting domestic pressure to protect threatened interests. One symptom
is this week's mass protests against the round in India.
Still more serious is the threat of a lurch towards more aggressive
unilateral policies and managed trade, which would strike at the basic
principles of the Gatt system. Its persistence has been underlined by the
Clinton administration's recently renewed pressure on Japan to open its
market further or face possible US trade sanctions.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the Gatt, has condemned the trend
as misguided and dangerous. 'A new outbreak of bilateral trade tensions is
putting the achievements of the Uruguay Round to the test even before they
are fully operational,' he said last month.
Against this background, it is remarkable that a deal has been concluded at
all. The more so since recession and stubbornly high unemployment in many
industrialised countries make trade concessions harder to sell at home.
As well as cutting tariffs, the round aims progressively to free trade in
services - a fifth of total world trade - agriculture, textiles and
government procurement. Though concrete liberalisation in some of these
sectors has yet to be agreed, all have for the first time been brought
firmly within the framework of Gatt rules and disciplines.
The round has also given birth to a new institution, the World Trade
Organisation. Due to take over from the Gatt next year, the WTO will have
greater authority to adjudicate international disputes and is intended as a
permanent forum for trade negotiations.
However, the power of any club to enforce rules is no stronger than its
members' willingness to respect them. In future, attitudes seem likely to be
influenced not only by swings in the economic cycle, but by a steadily
accelerating shift in the world's economic centre of gravity to the south
and east.
Since the Uruguay Round was launched in 1986, a wave of liberalisation has
swept across much of the developing world. It has paid off in faster growth
and soaring exports, particularly of manufactured goods. As the table shows,
gains in Asia have been particularly striking.
The most potent element in the ascendancy of the emerging nations is the
explosive growth of China which, on recent trends, could become the world's
largest economy early next century. China's weight in international policy
will be felt well before then if it succeeds in its plans to join the WTO
this year.
It is far from clear that the older industrialised powers which have long
dominated world trade policy have yet come to terms with the implications of
these developments. As they confront them, international frictions could
intensify. One risk is of a retreat into protectionism. In several richer
countries, job losses and declining industrial performance are already
blamed on 'unfair' competition from emerging economies with lower costs.
Social and political issues may prove another source of divisions, to judge
by the recent row over US attempts to place labour conditions on the WTO
agenda. The move has been attacked as a protectionist ploy by developing
countries, some of which openly scorn western notions of democratic values
and human rights.
However, the fault lines do not only run from north to south. Relations
between the world's biggest trading powers are also strained - most
obviously by continuing bilateral tensions between Washington and Tokyo.
Dealings between the US and the European Union are marred by bickering over
specific issues and by more general mutual suspicion. This has so far
thwarted a common interest in working together to try to reduce Japan's
trade surplus. Brussels remains deeply nervous about Washington's motives,
while the US decries the EU as cowardly and hypocritical.
Underlying this mistrust are growing uncertainties about the direction of
both powers' future policy. The biggest centre on the US, where the Clinton
administration has embraced a neo-mercantilist approach giving priority to
government-backed promotion of exports and selected industrial sectors.
'US attitudes are undergoing a sea-change,' says an international trade
policy expert. One recent manifestation was the administration's decisive
role in the Dollars 6bn sale of Boeing airliners to Saudi Arabia. Another
was its retreat from earlier demands that the Uruguay Round restrict
government subsidies because it wanted the freedom to support US high-tech
industries.
The export drive has added impetus to attempts to prise open foreign
markets. As impatience for quick results grows, US officials are
increasingly disposed to view unilateral measures as preferable to the often
slow and unwieldy mechanisms of the Gatt.
To its supporters, the approach is a robustly practical defence of national
interest. To its critics, who include many other Gatt members, it amounts to
bully-boy tactics which threaten to replace multilateral trade rules with
the law of the jungle.
Across the Atlantic, the balance is more delicately poised. Fears of a
'Fortress Europe' have proved overdone. Yet France's readiness last year to
take the Uruguay Round to the brink over farm trade underlines the fragility
of the EU consensus.
That it has remained intact and broadly liberal is due partly to the
influence of Sir Leon Brittan, the trade commissioner. But his successors
may not be as committed to upholding free trade. If the US drifted further
towards uni-lateralism, the task might prove impossible.
It is, however, by no means certain that will happen. Optimists point out
that the Clinton administration, while talking tough, has shrunk from
pushing bilateral disagreements to the point of crisis.
Furthermore, the Uruguay Round will meet US criticisms of Gatt disputes
procedures by speeding them up. It will also curb use of unilateral weapons,
such as US section Super-301 trade sanctions, though Washington claims it
will still have the right to invoke Super-301 in certain conditions.
But probably the strongest safeguard of the integrity of the multilateral
trade system lies in the changed attitudes of emerging economies. Once
suspicious of Gatt as a tool of western capitalist exploitation, many now
see it as a guarantee of their national interests.
'At the start of the Uruguay Round, countries such as Brazil were still
focusing heavily on a defensive third world agenda,' says a western diplomat
in Geneva. 'By the end, they were much more eager to press ahead with
liberalisation of trade.'
As well as keeping markets open for their exports, Gatt disciplines provide
their governments with useful leverage to push through politically
controversial reforms at home.
The fact that these countries are also among the world's fastest-growing
markets should, at least, give pause for thought to industrialised powers
wavering in their commitment to multilateral trade policies. That, however,
seems unlikely to prevent further stresses and strains between Gatt's
members. On recent evidence, the road from Marrakesh will prove no less
tortuous than the one leading up to it.

FT  08 APR 94 / Leading Article: Europe and the Maghreb
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's leaders need urgently to cast their eyes southward. The virtual
civil war in Algeria and the threat that similar struggles could take place
in neighbouring north African countries are matters of concern not just for
Europe's Mediterranean states, but for the whole continent.
The European Union has a strong interest in ensuring that the Maghreb region
retains a pro-western orientation, reinforced by commitment to democracy and
open economies. All three principles are put at risk by the increasingly
brutal confrontation between Islamic extremists and secular forces in
Algeria. Close to 4,000 lives have been lost in the past two years. France
recently advised its remaining 2,000 citizens in Algeria to leave.
In January 1992, the Algerian army denied power to the Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS) by suspending elections it was expected to win. There is a
pressing requirement for a solution under which the FIS is allowed to
participate in the democratic process in exchange for a renunciation of
terrorism. Otherwise, the danger will grow of instability spilling over into
Morocco and Tunisia - and possibly beyond.
The disorder in Algeria, a particular anxiety for France, the former
colonial power, could have repercussions on Italy, Spain and Portugal, which
rely on Algeria for natural gas. On a wider scale, the twin dangers of
large-scale emigration from north Africa and the spread of regional
disturbances to immigrant communities abroad have worrying implications
throughout the Union.
This turbulence brings another trial for the EU's nascent common foreign and
security policy, already found wanting in the fires of the former
Yugoslavia. The EU can do little about the root causes of Islamic
fundamentalism. But it can turn some of its attention away from eastern
Europe and seek some coherence among the fragmented initiatives of its
member states.
The EU's main message should be the urgency of linking economic and
political reforms. The EU says it wants elections in Algeria within two
years, but the possibility cannot be ignored that the FIS may take power
sooner. This strengthens the case for speedy steps to restructure the
economy, which the army-backed regime has put in abeyance.
An accord between Algeria and the International Monetary Fund is now in
prospect which should pave the way for rescheduling the country's Dollars
26bn foreign debt and for a balance of payments loan from the EU to offset
this year's shortfall in Algeria's oil revenues. The EU should make sure
that this IMF process is not delayed or undermined.
In parallel, the Union must give fresh impetus to attempts started five
years ago to open up trade with north Africa. This drive has lost momentum
as a result of the European recession, Spanish anxiety about competition for
its fishermen and farmers, and the emphasis on trying to liberalise trade
with eastern Europe. Ultimately, the Union's efforts to ensure a stable,
peaceful and prosperous Maghreb will succeed only if the people there see
direct rewards from closer ties with Europe. If the EU fails to number north
Africa among its most pressing priorities, it will lose its chance - perhaps
for a very long time - of influencing events in a region whose destiny will
remain closely linked to its own.

FT  08 APR 94 / Leading Article: Chinese order
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
President Clinton must view recent events in China with apprehension. They
could place him in an appalling dilemma - partly of his own making - when he
comes in early June, around the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square
massacre, to decide whether to renew China's most-favoured nation trading
status.
He said last year that he would do so only if there were a significant
improvement in human rights in China. The latest detentions of dissidents
make it no easier for him to assert to the US Congress that there has been
such an improvement. He could find himself obliged - by the timetable and
conditions which he himself set - to revoke MFN, a step which would have
serious consequences for American business, for the Chinese economy and its
reform programme, for world trade, and for multilateral co-operation on
issues such as nuclear arms.
A great deal can happen in two months, so it is as well to tread cautiously.
China may take steps which would make MFN renewal more palatable to the US
human rights lobby. Efforts to interpret the latest investigations of Mr Wei
Jingsheng, China's most prominent dissident, are made without knowledge of
their motivation. But those behind the detentions of Mr Wei and others are
clearly unconcerned about reprisals. They may have been persuaded by US
businessmen that Mr Clinton would not revoke MFN. Or they may feel that
Beijing must not, whatever the consequences, be seen to accede to foreign
meddling in its affairs.
Internal stability is of over-riding importance to China's Communist
leaders, as the events of 1989 showed. To them, continued dominance depends
on preventing the ignition of any movement which pulls together various
strands of disaffection, much of it stirred by the effects of economic
reform. While most in the west would not condone Beijing's authoritarian
methods of maintaining domestic order, they would also agree that economic
reform offers the best chance of leading China to a more prosperous and
fairer society.
There are divisions within the Clinton administration about the wisdom of a
policy which places annual MFN renewal at the centre of Sino-American
relations. The commerce department has made no bones of its belief that US
business stands to be seriously damaged by invocation of an arbitrary
deadline set in Washington.
To be fair, the administration has moved to broaden the relationship,
attempting to make human rights only one among the subjects to be discussed
in more frequent two-way visits by officials. It should continue to do so.
While making clear its distaste for Chinese methods, the west has an
over-riding interest in seeking Chinese participation in trade accords,
prevention of nuclear proliferation, and co-operation on specific issues
such as North Korea.
Ways of escaping Mr Clinton's MFN dilemma, short of a politically damaging
retreat, are not apparent - for example, removal of MFN only from goods
produced by the public sector would be difficult to enforce. If he does not
succeed, his much-vaunted aim of greater Asia-Pacific co-operation will be
as nought. The sympathies of most Asian countries, which accord less
priority to human rights than does the US, will lie with China.

Life begins at 60 - and for no one more so than George Mitchell. Consider
the cornucopia of job opportunities now on offer to the 60-year-old Democrat
from Maine, the Senate majority leader whose decision not to seek certain
re-election this year caused many in Washington to believe he had gone nuts.
Bill Clinton clearly wants him to serve on the Supreme Court, where there is
an immediate vacancy and for which, as a politician and former federal
judge, he is eminently qualified. Whether or not he passes up on the
opportunity this time round, he could still be the next chief justice, if
William Rehnquist hangs up his robe before the next election.
He could also easily be the next secretary of state whenever Warren
Christopher moves on, especially now that the once-heir apparent Strobe
Talbott has a bit of a blotted copybook. This would neatly square a circle,
since in 1980 Mitchell took over the Senate seat of his Maine mentor, Ed
Muskie, who replaced Cy Vance at Foggy Bottom.
Baseball wants him to be its commissioner, another vacant slot. An ardent
fan, Mitchell is tempted, but points out that managing 30 megalomaniac
team-owners might be harder work than managing 99 megalomaniac senators.
With these prospects, it must come as a relief to Messrs Lubbers, Brittan et
al that Mitchell has not yet expressed an interest in a certain position in
Brussels.

Thank goodness for that. Someone has owned up at last for misspelling the
name on Dulwich College's new minibus, referred to in Wednesday's column -
and it was not a pupil.
Parents, who have to pay up to Pounds 11,670 a year for the privilege of
sending their kids to the exclusive London school, will be relieved to learn
that the culprit did not have the benefit of a Dulwich education. It was the
fault of Kirkham Minibuses, which supplied the vehicle, and the bursar
stresses that he had already spotted the mistake.
The Lancashire firm, better known for its craftsmanship than its spelling,
is correcting the error and writes to say that it has apologised to the
headmaster for 'any embarrasment'.
Oh dear, Kirkham. Surely you know that there are two s's in . . .

<TEXT>
One of the great trade secrets of the world's industrial paints business can
now be told. How did Austin O'Malley, just retired as head of PPG's European
automotive paints business, always appear to be in several places at once?
The 65-year-old Irishman developed the technique in the 1960s when working
for Pinchin Johnson, which supplied paint to the Ford and Vauxhall factories
on opposite banks of the Mersey. O'Malley was the technical support man for
both plants and soon found that he could not flit quickly enough between
Ford at Speke and Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port to keep both sets of bosses
happy.
So when he was in Speke for the day, he persuaded the Ellesmere Port
receptionists to put out regular messages over the factory Tannoy calling
him to the foyer, or the paint shop office, and so on. The Speke
receptionists did the same when he was at Ellesmere Port.
Former colleagues, who tried in vain to find O'Malley in factories where his
name was being broadcast, swear the technique made him a household name and
helped advance his career up the European paints ladder.

UK foreign secretary Douglas Hurd has muffed another chance to wave the flag
for British industry on his state visit to Brazil this week. No sooner had
his feet hit the tarmac, than he was whisked away to open a new plant making
diesel engines under licence from a German-owned subsidiary of BMW. To be
fair to Hurd, the deal to build Land Rover engines was clinched before the
Germans took over.
Even so, if he had been a couple of weeks earlier, he could have opened a
proper British factory - TI Group's new plant in Curitiba which makes
refrigeration parts.

For the second time, Legal Business magazine has voted him England's worst

In the three years since his appointment to the Bench, Sir Peter Cresswell
has been transformed from a brilliant banking QC into a wimp so incapable of
making up his mind that it's said 'if his wife puts out two bowls of cereal

Not too wimpish, however, to demand a right of reply: he notes 'the comments

After almost every round of world trade talks, exhausted negotiators have
thrown up their hands and cried: 'Never again]' Yet a few years later they
have been back at work hagg-ling over another omnibus package.
This time, many insist, things really will be different. One reason is that
the new World Trade Organisation is intended to make future rounds
unnecessary by acting as a permanent bargaining forum. Full-scale
ministerial conferences are planned every two years to inject regular
political impetus.
Another is that, in principle, the Uruguay Round is supposed to embrace
almost every important aspect of international trade. However, its ambitious
scope has also left much unfinished business to be sorted out.
Gatt members have yet to strike the hard deals needed to flesh out their
commitment to free trade in financial services, telecommunications and
maritime transport. In sectors such as agriculture and textiles, where
liberalisation timetables have been agreed, reviews are planned to assess
progress or to chart the next phase of market opening.
In addition, fresh items are jostling for a place on the WTO agenda. One is
trade and environment policy, on which the Marrakesh conference is expected
to set up a working group. The US wants to add to the list workers' rights
and competition policy, while India wants a debate on the free movement of
people.
These issues are doubly controversial. Not only do they threaten to divide
Gatt's ranks, as the rumpus over workers' rights has showed. Some
policymakers fear they could further politicise the organisation and lead to
conditions being placed on free trade - a development contrary to Gatt's
central mission of tearing down barriers.
Yet trade liberalisation is already evolving in a direction which may
entangle it with a wider range of sensitive issues. Increasingly, it is
thrusting beyond barriers at borders, such as tariffs and quotas, to tackle
obstacles deep inside national frontiers, such as exist in most types of
services.
As a consequence, it seems bound to cut across ever more policies which
governments have traditionally regarded as domestic priorities, or as being
within the legitimate domain of national sovereignty. Sorting out clear
dividing lines may not be easy.
It is too early to judge how effectively the WTO will resolve such
questions. Its first task is to show it can reach the kinds of decisions and
breakthroughs which, until now, have required the political dynamics and
scope for complex trade-offs generated by a full-blown round of world trade
negotiations.
The organisation's success on that score may determine whether it develops a
powerful voice in wider international policymaking or risks becoming - in
the words of the old joke about the Gatt - little more than a general
agreement to talk and talk.

FT  08 APR 94 / Greener valleys singing the blues: Roland Adburgham on the
limited impact of government aid in depressed Welsh communities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was not unexpected, but the announcement that Tower colliery in Mid
Glamorgan will close next week, bringing to an end generations of
deep-mining in south Wales, sent reverberations through the surrounding
valleys.
The impact was twofold. There was the symbolism of the closure - south Wales
once had a quarter of a million men working in the coal mines - and the
defeat of a determined campaign by the local community to save what it
regarded as a viable pit. Second, there was the loss of another 200 jobs in
an area where nearly one in four of the male workforce is unemployed. There
are 30 people unemployed for every vacancy at the local job centres in the
Aberdare travel-to-work area, which includes Tower.
By highlighting the valleys' seemingly intractable economic problems, the
closure of Tower raises the question of whether the government's
interventionist programme for regenerating the valleys has failed. The
initiative was started by the Welsh Office in 1988 to alleviate the painful
structural changes caused by the rundown of the old coal and steel
industries. Under its umbrella, more than Pounds 770m of public funding has
been injected into the valleys, where 700,000 people live.
The programme, launched by Lord Walker, then Welsh secretary and now
chairman of English Partnerships, the regeneration agency for England, is
currently in a second five-year phase. This was unveiled last autumn by Mr
John Redwood, Welsh secretary, as a plan called 'building on success'.
But the 'success' he confidently claimed for the programme was cast into
doubt last November in a statistical report published by the government. It
found 73 plants had opened in the valleys since 1988, but 138 had closed. In
spite of the opening of plants by overseas companies such as Hitachi of
Japan, the manufacturing workforce had declined at a faster rate than in
Wales as a whole.
Lord Walker's original claims for what he described as 'the most
comprehensive programme for economic growth the valleys have known' have
proved too optimistic. He spoke of 'pump priming' by the government which
would lead to private-sector investment of more than Pounds 1bn, and of
reducing long-term unemployment by two-thirds. In fact, the Welsh Office now
estimates that, in the first five years, private investment totalled less
than Pounds 700m. Unemployment remains high: the rate in Mid Glamorgan,
which covers much of the valleys region, stands at 12.5 per cent, compared
with an average for Wales of 10.4 per cent. The most obvious improvement is
in the greening of the grime: the appearance of the valleys has been
transformed by the reclamation of slag-heaps.
Mr Redwood's view is that the initiative's impact has been overshadowed by
the recession and, without it, the valleys would have been much worse off.
He supports continued intervention on the grounds that it was state-owned
industries that caused the damage. Yesterday he announced grants totalling
Pounds 2.5m for projects in five communities. In all, his five-year
programme promises a total of more than Pounds 1bn of funding. This time, no
target has been set for private investment, although Mr Redwood agrees more
needs to be attracted.
One entrepreneur who supports the initiative is Mr Alf Gooding, who was born
in the valleys. Gooding Sanken, the company he set up with Sanken Electric
of Japan to make power supply units, moved last year into a plant in Cynon
Valley, in the heart of the region. The factory was built by the Welsh
Development Agency - under the valleys initiative, the agency plays the lead
role in encouraging inward investment and land reclamation.
The factory employs 250 people and, if the workforce reaches the projected
400, Gooding Sanken can recoup 40 per cent of its Pounds 10m investment.
Without the aid, Mr Gooding says, the factory would not be there. 'How can
anyone say anything other than that the initiative is doing one hell of a
good job?' he asks.
Mr Tony Roberts, chief executive of Cynon Valley council, which has Tower in
its district, agrees the initiative has encouraged public and private sector
partnerships and helped to put a spotlight on the valleys. But he is
flummoxed by what he sees as the illogicality of a national energy policy
which results in the closure of Tower colliery. 'On the one hand we are
being encouraged to play our part in regeneration, but then we have to
sacrifice Tower on the altar of market forces. It does not seem sensible.'
Sceptics have long argued the initiative is primarily a public relations
exercise, a packaging of schemes with little 'new' money over and above what
would be available elsewhere in Wales. Dr Victoria Winckler, head of policy
research at Mid Glamorgan county council, recognises there have been
improvements in roads and housing, for example, but argues these might have
happened in any case. 'As far as we're concerned as a local authority, the
initiative has had no identifiable effect.'
There are still high levels of deprivation and low levels of economic
activity, she says. 'A lot of people have moved out of the workforce
altogether.'
In a recent report, Poverty and Prosperity in Wales, Professor Barry
Wilkinson and Mr Jonathan Morris of Cardiff Business School found the
poorest parts of Wales were still in the valleys and the disparities
worsening.
Professor Wilkinson says migration out of the valleys is continuing. 'I
think the Welsh Office should be upfront about it. They should acknowledge
these areas are not getting any better. I think the government should either
pump in real money to preserve the communities, or stop paying lip service
to the problem and say that, when Norman Tebbit (former employment
secretary) said 'get on your bike', he meant it.'
Mr Roberts, of Cynon Valley council, emphasises the need to support existing
businesses, but recognises that commuting down the valleys to Cardiff and
the M4 motorway corridor - which has been more successful in winning inward
investment - is part of the answer. He argues the initiative should improve
the road and rail links to help that trend.
This implies accepting that the concept of the old communities, the raison
d'etre of which was the pit at the end of the street, must be consigned to
the past. No large plants will provide a substitute: other UK regions can
offer similar grants to inward investors. Any incoming industry is likely to
be small-scale: the most recent is the Japanese company, TAP Manufacturing,
which is building a car parts plant in Rhymney Valley. It will employ only
60 people.
Demand will continue to diminish for the high-wage, skilled male worker.
Those jobs which are created are more likely to be for women than men. At
Gooding Sanken, 70 per cent of the workforce is female. If part-timers are
included, more women are now in work in Mid Glamorgan than men. Outside
manufacturing, local jobs are likely to be found in service industries,
particularly tourism, which require very different skills to manufacturing.
One example is the Rhondda Heritage Park, a museum commemorating what was
once the powerhouse of the industrial revolution.
It is a cultural change in which government money is only part of the
answer, as the relative failure of the valleys initiative has shown. Two
years ago, in a report Resurrecting the Valleys - Can Existing Policies Do
the Job?, Mr Kevin Morgan of the University of Wales wrote: 'A new recipe
for social and economic regeneration involves far more than additional
resources. While finance may indeed be the key ingredient, it is not of
itself sufficient. In other words, the future shape of the valleys . . . is
partly in our own hands.' Today, that has been brought home only too clearly
to the Tower miners.

FT  08 APR 94 / The cost of flying without a harness: US airlines'
experience of deregulation bodes ill for European carriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems heretical to ask the question at a time when the merits of market
liberalisation have become so widely accepted. But if deregulation is such a
great idea, why is the US airline industry in such a mess?
Barely a day passes in the US without news of continuing turmoil in the
industry. This week alone has brought an announcement of another 1,000 job
cuts at Continental Airlines as part of a cost-cutting drive, a decision
from American Airlines to lay off a further 50 pilots as it continues to
shrink its route network, and a reorganisation plan from America West
Airlines aimed at bringing the troubled carrier out of bankruptcy.
Yesterday it emerged that Trans World Airlines, itself only just out of
bankruptcy, had said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission
that it would have to consider selling all or part of the company if its
financial results failed to achieve planned levels this year.
Some 15 years have passed since the US air travel market was deregulated:
long enough, you might think, for it to have found some sort of equilibrium.
Instead, the industry seems to exist in a state of perpetual crisis. In the
past four years, its losses have exceeded all the profits made by US
airlines since the invention of powered flight. Small wonder that European
airlines are unenthusiastic about open skies.
When deregulation came to the US market in 1978, American carriers looked
better prepared for it than their European counterparts do today.
Admittedly, federal government control over domestic routes and fares had
left them with limited experience of competition; but at least they were
creatures of the private sector, and generally profitable too.
As expected, deregulation attracted dozens of entrepreneurs into the US
airline industry - some starting new services where none had existed before,
and others undercutting fares on existing routes. It also gave the big
carriers the freedom to expand services and compete on price.
Over the next few years, lower fares and new services produced a big
increase in passenger numbers, but the combined effects of fare cuts and
excess capacity sent the industry into heavy losses. Bankruptcy not only
took its toll of the new entrants, but started hitting established carriers
such as Braniff International and Continental Airlines.
All this could have been predicted: deregulation is supposed to eliminate
the weak. But the process did not stop there. In spite of a brief period of
profitability during the economic boom of the late 1980s, the airline
failures went on. By 1992, bankruptcy had claimed 117 carriers including
some of the best-known in the industry, such as Eastern Airlines, Trans
World Airlines and Pan American World Airways.
Today, the US airline industry looks in as bad a state as ever. The
competition is crippling, with big carriers besieged by small, low-cost
operators attacking the most profitable markets. The industry as whole lost
about Dollars 1.2bn last year. This year, thanks to robust growth in the US
economy, low fuel prices and drastic cost-cutting by the big carriers, it
may show a small profit: but few can foresee a day when the industry will
deliver an acceptable return on its assets.
At least two special factors suggest that the US experience might not
necessarily be replicated in Europe. One is that overcapacity in the US has
been exacerbated by chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, which has enabled
carriers such as TWA and Con-tinental to bounce back when they would
otherwise have failed.
Another is that the financial weakness of the industry is in some measure
the result of a flurry of highly leveraged buy-outs in the 1980s which left
some of the largest carriers heavily burdened with debt.
However, two other factors that have emerged from US experience could apply
to a deregulated air travel market anywhere.
First, the airline industry is notoriously cyclical, and each general
economic downturn results in a surplus of unwanted aircraft and personnel.
This presents entrepreneurs with an opportunity to snap up cheap aircraft
and employees and undercut existing carriers with low fares: so when things
are bad, they get worse.
Second, the airline industry - like one or two other sectors such as
newspapers and hotels - seems to be imbued with a perceived glamour that
causes otherwise sensible people to enter it and remain in it, regardless of
the potential for making money.
Of course, by the only criterion that really matters - customer satisfaction
 -airline deregulation in the US has been a staggering success. Passenger
numbers have risen by more than 70 per cent since 1978.
Why? Full fares are a third lower in real terms, and more than 90 per cent
of tickets are sold at discounts averaging two-thirds off the full price.
People have 37 per cent more flights to choose from: smaller cities in
particular have far more flights to far more places than ever before. The
fight for customers has brought innovations such as frequent-flyer
programmes and ultra-cheap, no-frills flights. The safety record is first
class.
Deregulation should do for Europeans what it has already done for Americans.
That is why it is such a great idea. But the US experience leaves little
room for doubt about what it will do to Europe's airline industry. In short,
it looks like being a bloodbath.

FT  08 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Price to pay for manipulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, ICI's comments about prices in the Electricity Pool ('Power costs anger
large users', April 6) deserve little sympathy.
We have what it calls 'manipulated prices' because the largest users of
electricity, presumably including ICI, somehow convinced the regulator that
they pay too much for their power. His response was to persuade the two
biggest generating companies to use their market position in a way which
would achieve an average annual price of 2.4 pence per unit.
ICI will have to accept that even regulated prices will rise and fall before
such an average is achieved.
There is also an unfortunate side effect to the decision. The manipulated
price has been fixed at a level below that needed to secure the development
of new power stations. This is hardly the way to hasten the arrival of the
regulator's 'fully competitive market'.

<TEXT>
Sir, Any long-term holders of shares in one of the five major UK composites
are entitled to feel aggrieved at the present low ebb of their investment,
with quoted prices little more than they were 10 years ago in some cases.
And they have also suffered reduced dividends through massive losses.
Although these have been reversed, we are now told that current improved
insurance rates may not hold. This bodes ill for the future.
According to prices in the FT's London Share Service of April 2, the five UK
composites are worth in total some Pounds 12bn. Even if you include the two
major UK life companies, Legal &amp; General and Prudential, the total reaches
some Pounds 20bn. This is only the same figure as that of Allianz alone, and
not far in excess of the other London quoted overseas group, American
General.
Surely economy of size must indicate that mergers should have taken place
long ago. And is it possible that individual groups have desisted from this
course of action in order to postpone the inevitable disclosure of trading
problems? This might perhaps include large book losses arising from
excessive purchases of property at the height of the recent boom, and the
antics of high pressure salesmen employed to sell their products on a
commission-only basis.
Or is it simply to preserve the identity of the once glorious empires of
times gone by - times that are unlikely ever to return?
I suspect there will shortly be some lively annual meetings called.

FT  08 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: A card likely to be played
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN TEMKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to your excellent appraisal of Chief Buthelezi's current
position ('The Zulu factor', March 30) and Mr Chris Jones's letter (April
4).
The 'ethnic card' is not a new one. Any reference to proceedings in the
KwaZulu legislative assembly shows, for example, that the role of the Zulu
monarchy was consistently taken into account whenever there were discussions
relating to the 'homeland's' status in South Africa, in particular, whether
or not 'independence' should be accepted. Inkatha, later the Inkatha Freedom
party, is a political party which, though supporting the monarchy, is quite
separate from it. Thus the request that the king and his advisers should
participate in the constitutional talks should have been seen as key to
deciding the future status of the monarchy and the limits of Zulu autonomy.
The denial of his request means that the major political party of the Zulu,
the IFP, (with reluctance) was represented at the talks, but the historical
claims of the Zulu were left unvoiced.
It is hardly surprising that the African National Congress, with some
hindsight, should have recognised the problem and have played the ethnic
card itself.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD E NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As the association of UK consumer electronic manufacturers, we would
normally support additional programme services. However, we are against the
proposal to go ahead with a Channel 5 licence using existing technology.
First, the frequencies proposed for Channel 5 have been used for 15 years
for interconnecting signals from domestic video recorders to television
receivers. Interference problems if a Channel 5 service commences will be
enormous, involving the retuning of video recorders and TV equipment in 3m
to 5m homes; moreover, there will be a huge problem of cost (perhaps Pounds
50 per household), and problems of access to domestic installations.
Second, the development of digital TV broadcasting technology is moving very
fast, and offers the prospect within three to five years of providing six to
eight TV channels of normal definition in the frequency spectrum used by a
single conventional Channel 5.
Such digital services would cause much less of an interference problem with
conventional domestic installations. Also, with the passage of time, such
problems would be lessened by the increasing number of domestic
installations employing interconnection of domestic video recorders and TV,
using the eurosockets now fitted to virtually all video recorders and table
model colour television receivers.
In BREMA's view, the case for Channel 5 has now been overtaken by
technology.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your publication of the letter (March 30) by Jersey politicians
criticising your survey on the island (March 22) has aroused a predictable
furore, with accusations of disloyalty and, in the case of the local press,
the 'sin' of running Jersey down in front of outsiders. Such a response
smacks more of a totalitarian than a democratic state. It would be
unthinkable for an American to be treated this way for being critical to a
foreign newspaper of political life in the US.
Employed people are particularly vulnerable here. The close circle of local
and imported managers and businessmen can make it difficult for those who do
not 'toe the line'. They may be denied promotion or even lose their jobs.
Any relief in unemployment is at the discretion of local connetables
(mayors) or their committees, who can insist on households getting loans on
their houses or moving to premises with lower rents. For employers there are
plenty of replacements 'off the boat' for what is frequently low-paid work
in an increasingly expensive place to live.

FT  08 APR 94 / Arts: Clean Break's Red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anna Reynolds, the writer in residence for the Clean Break Theatre Company,
has developed an unmistakeable style.
Clean Break means what its name suggests, plus a lacing of feminism: it is a
company for women ex-prisoners and ex-offenders wishing to break with the
past.
Ms Reynolds was once a prisoner. Her writing draws heavily on her experience
and suggests that she sees theatre as a kind of therapy for those who are
locked up, though I suspect that no one can write as well as she does
without considerable background reading. In any case, her works are already
appealing to a wider audience, and deservedly so.
Her early piece, Jordan, was first performed at the Lilian Baylis Theatre
two years ago. The revival of that acclaimed production can still just about
be caught (that is, until April 10) at the Battersea Arts.
Based on a true story about a woman, Shirley Jones, who was incarcerated for
killing her baby son and then committed suicide on the day of her release
from prison, it is a monologue full of incident. As in the original, it is
superbly acted by Moira Buffini, the co-author, as Shirley.
Ms Reynolds's Wild Things was enthusiastically reviewed by my colleague,
Alastair Macaulay, when it had its premiere in Salisbury last November. It
is now touring.
The new work is Red at the New End Theatre in Hampstead. The trouble is that
the author has already set such high standards that the immediate comment is
that Red is not quite as good as Jordan. There is the slight feeling of
having been there before.
In Red there are two characters, both of them women in a remand cell beneath
a Crown court and both of them charged with a murder of a kind. This may
seem an advance on Jordan in that there is an opportunity for dialogue as
well as narrative. There are certainly contrasts.
One of the women, Gerda, is white English upper middle class, aged 40. She
has not directly murdered her husband, but has not exactly discouraged her
rough young lover from doing so.
If you note a borrowing from Hester in Terence Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea,
you will not be alone. Gerda prefers sex to respectability. She is
immaculately played by Carrie Thomas, who keeps her make-up in place to the
last.
Gerda is also socially adept. Kay, her companion in the prison cell, is
black. When Gerda asks her where she comes from, there is only momentary
surprise when the answer is Essex, not somewhere in the Caribbean. Gerda
takes it in her stride.
Kay, played very strongly by Leonora Rogers-Wright, is more skilled in the
ways of dealing with judges and juries. She has picked up some of the lines
from Shirley Jones in Jordan: when to smile at the bench, when to cry and
when not and when to try to tell the truth.
The women talk to each other, or at each other, a lot. They recognise that
they are more or less in the same boat: social and ethnic differences are
irrelevant.
But there is no great dialogue, and in the end I concluded that there was
more variety in the monologue of Shirley Jones. Still, Ms Reynolds can
certainly write. Red, like Jordan, is directed by Fiona Buffini, sister of
Moira.
Continuing at the New End, Hampstead, until April 24. 071 794 0022.

FT  08 APR 94 / Arts: A Beauty to remember - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To stage Sleeping Beauty, or not to stage it? Directors of ballet companies
embarking upon this sublimest, supremest challenge should be on their knees
with the words 'Lord, we are not worthy' ever on their lips. But hubris and
chutzpah being what they are - and endemic in the dance world - companies go
ahead. They trim, alter and, damn them, re-interpret, and Beauty suffers.
So, by a nice twist of fate, do their dancers, who founder in the
choreography - Petipa is not to be mocked. So, alas, do audiences, who are
given dross instead of gold.
Now Scottish Ballet enters the lists with a new Beauty. Stacked against the
company are the facts that it does not have enough dancers to produce the
work as it should be seen, and, frankly, it does not possess enough dancers
with the schooling, the stylistic grace, to cope with Petipa. (I must
observe that such demands are ill-met by any troupe in this country.) On the
positive side, in this battle for classic order and dignity, is the fact
that Galina Samsova - whom we have much admired in Beauty - directs Scottish
Ballet, and is plainly not prepared to sacrifice the piece on the altar of
gimcrack production and artistic expediency.
There results a staging far better than we might dare hope. The text is
decent, given the concessions made to reduced numbers. Petipa's
architecture, his finest choreographic ideas, are honoured. The dancers are
learning from the demands made upon them, and Samsova has invited guest
artists to bolster her ranks. The standards of the company's orchestra (53
musicians) and conductor, Alan Barker, are notably good: Tchaikovsky is
safe. For her medium-size touring version, Samsova could not aspire to the
decorative splendours properly needed so, in an intriguing compromise, she
has commissioned sets from Patrick Kinmonth and costumes from Jasper Conran.
It is here that my worries are strongest. Kinmonth's permanent set is of
grey walls that can move to become various locales, with a vivid red bed as
a glaring accessory, and a series of receding portcullises as the magical
forest. Clever, elegant, this scheme becomes claustrophobic, and the
viewer's imagination is trapped. The idea is effective, but is, I suspect,
for another, less airy ballet. Conran's costumes are subtle - colours
unexpected, with fairies in sorbet-shades, courtiers in black and white,
busily patterned - skilfully cut and often dazzlingly conceived. Period is
well suggested, but these clothes do not always register strongly. The final
effect, though, is stylish: neither design nor ballet has been compromised.
Faced with the perils of Petipa's dances, the Scottish artists do of their
best: the troupe looks far more secure as an ensemble than when I reported
last year on their Anna Karenina. There are optimistic moments, and
variations when the school report reads 'Must do better', but if Beauty is
seen as a way of aspiring to classic decorum, then Scottish Ballet is on the
right path, and this justifies the staging.
What totally justified Wednesday evening's performance (which I saw in
Oxford's hideously uncomfortable Apollo Theatre) was the presence of Ludmila
Semenyaka as a guest Aurora.
Semenyaka has been one of the glories of Bolshoi Ballet seasons throughout
the world. In her performance as Aurora we see everything that the role
demands: noblest Petersburg schooling; an ideal physique, and a style light,
clear, harmonious; a grandeur that comes from the traditions of her
education as a pupil of Petersburg's greatest ballerine - Semyonova and
Ulanova; and that sense of classic form that is the mark of the rarest
performers in the academic style.
Her Aurora is a portrait of youthful charm, drawn with a simplicity and a
technical authority that only come when the role is fully understood. It is
utterly engaging and, ultimately, utterly mysterious. We see how pure the
dance is, with phrasing sprung from the score, with a dulcet mastery that
makes triple pirouettes in the first act solo seem the most natural and
happy expression of Aurora's delight. We sense, also, the long, long
perspectives of Semenyaka's art, which go back by way of her teachers and
coaches, and their teachers in turn, to Petipa's time, so that what she does
is not only right but inevitable.
It is extraordinary classical dancing, and extraordinarily beautiful. And it
was, on this occasion, sensitively judged for the confines of the stage and
the means of the staging itself. Semenyaka's partner was Marcello Angelini,
clean in style, well-mannered and attentive.
I must salute one other performance - that of Yurie Shinohara as Florine in
the Bluebird duet. To what can often seem a test of archness as much of
technical facility, Miss Shinohara brought wit, an enchanting freshness, and
a sense of joy, that were irresistible. It was most memorable dancing.
Scottish Ballet is at the Apollo Theatre Oxford until April 9; then plays
'Sleeping Beauty' in Newcastle (April 12-16), Hull (April 19-23), Edinburgh
(April 26-30), Inverness (May 4-7).

Friday continues to be one of the least tempting nights on television. Early
in the evening there is the brass final in the Young Musician Of The Year
contest which, given the standard in the semi final, ought to be splendid.
My own vote so far would go to trumpeter James Arnold (6.25 BBC2). Later on
the same channel the series From A To B: Tales Of Modern Motoring looks into
the arcane world of the company car. It seems that rear head restraints and
'badging' play major roles in determining pecking order (9.30).
Those aside, you are likely to have more fun listening to the radio. Radio
Five Live, which seems to have got away to a remarkably smooth start and to
be fulfilling its brief pretty well, begins a regular Friday programme
called Parkinson On Sport (7.35). Barnsley's famous son looks forward to the

FT  08 APR 94 / Arts: Dishonor with an honorable lady - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week ex-Avenger Honor Blackman is entertaining her admirers at the
Criterion with her one-woman show, Dishonorable Ladies. It is a
disconcerting event. Ms Blackman in maturity is very much the Colonel's lady
rather than Rosie O'Grady and the evening has the indelible air of a genteel
soiree at a fashionable spa at which a distinguished actress has been lured
out of retirement.
Ms Blackman's succession of 'femme fatales through the ages' would not
ruffle the wings of a butterfly. They come across as genteel ladies, better
at talking about romance than getting involved in anything so sticky as sex.
But Michael Crompton, who is directing, and John Watts, have served Ms
Blackman faithfully with material and anyone who enjoys anthologies will
feel comfortable here.
Some of the items are lost gems, like a sketch by the deeply unfashionable
Herbert Farjeon, a monologue for a 1930s gold digger rehearsing the evening
as she dresses to meet her date. Some are ill-conceived, like Ms Blackman
attempting the vamps of the silent movies. Some are plain weird, like the
excerpt from Elinor Glyn's novel Three Weeks, which must surely return to
print.
William Blezard is at the piano. He is the most diplomatic of men, for in
his day he accompanied both Dietrich and Grenfell. The evening brightens
with the musical numbers, in particular an updated version of Let's Do It,
with John Major and the Prince of Wales neatly caricatured, and Piaf's La
Vie En Rose. All in all, an occasion for those who like their passion
vacuum-packed.
At the Criterion until April 9.

FT  08 APR 94 / Arts: Market forces put sponsor rivals on clearer footing -
The difference in approach to arts funding by BT and Lloyds is fundamental
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is rivalry between BT and Lloyds Bank for the title of the UK's
biggest sponsor of the arts. BT, despite freezing its budget for 1994-95 at
Pounds 1.8m, wins so far.
The rivalry reflects a fundamental difference in approach to sponsorship. BT
concentrates money on the classic arts and does not include its modest
hospitality and marketing expenditure (probably about Pounds 200,000) in its
figures. Nor does it advertise its sponsorships.
Lloyds, with two sponsorship initiatives each in fashion and film, plus the
Young Musician of the Year competition which reaches its climax on BBC2
tomorrow, spends Pounds 2.4m, but this includes a substantial tranche of
advertising expenditure. Around Pounds 1.5m goes to the arts.
Lloyds wants public recognition and goes for events with certain, or likely,
television coverage. BT is more philanthropic, but market pressure is
forcing it to promote awareness of its generosity.
Lloyds Bank, which has heavily promoted the Young Musicians this year, will
this weekend run a campaign on Classic FM offering free CDs of the final to
the first thousand of its customers who phone in with the name of the
winner. This should boost viewing figures and reward the loyalty of
customers.
Lloyds will soon begin negotiations with the BBC to renew its contract for
the biennial event, which remains the Corporation's biggest lapse into
commercial sponsorship. Lloyds is inclined to sign up again, as long as the
BBC decides not to increase substantially its fee of Pounds 500,000.
By an odd chance, the two largest sponsors have taken it in turn to back the
Royal National Theatre's educational work. Lloyds supported it for five
years with its Theatre Challenge, and now BT has put up Pounds 400,000 for
the next two years with its BT National Connections Scheme. Leading
playwrights will be commissioned to create new works, or undertake
translations, for performance by young people.
Around 200 groups are expected to participate. Some will then go on to work
with 10 local theatres, such as the Traverse in Edinburgh and the Sherman in
Cardiff, and a few will progress in July 1995 to a celebration of youth
theatre on the RNT stage.
* The arrival of the Lottery next year is likely to have profound
ramifications on every aspect of the arts world, including corporate
sponsorship.
This week the Arts Council chose Jeremy Newton, chief executive of Eastern
Arts, to be its Lottery Director. He will take charge of the money raised by
the Lottery to be devoted to arts ventures.
Newton will have at least Pounds 70m a year to hand out for capital projects
for new arts buildings and improvements to existing structures.
This will be challenge money: arts organisations will be expected to
contribute some of the cash towards their planned developments. The obvious
source for such additional funds will be corporate backers, who have been
notoriously reluctant to back capital projects (with the exception of
Glyndebourne, which raised more than Pounds 30m from business for its new
theatre). They prefer to support new creative work which they can use for
hospitality or marketing spin-offs.
If companies are persuaded that they can best help arts organisations by
providing seedcorn cash for new building projects, there will be less
sponsorship money available for new productions, exhibitions, competitions
and festivals.
* National Power wants to make the piano competition it backs in London
every three years comparable to similar events in Moscow and Leeds. Sir
Trevor Holdsworth, chairman of National Power, a first-class pianist with
performances at the Festival Hall under his belt, is enjoying the
preliminary rounds for the follow-up event, scheduled for London this
September.
While it is facile to say that a company's sponsorship follows the
inclination of the chairman, or his wife, it is often true. But Sir Trevor
has a wonderful excuse: National Power backed the first World Piano
Competition in 1991 before he had any links with the company.
Last year, National Power launched a World Piano Series, which matches top
pianists to top orchestras at performances throughout the country, which are
used for corporate and staff entertainment.
National Power seeks no marketing payoff from its expenditure: it comes from
its 'good causes' as opposed to its charity budget. The Pounds 400,000 plus
National Power spends on the competition is the largest slice of this
budget, with scholarships on top of the Pounds 28,000 prize money, which is
shared between the four finalists.
* The National Gallery of Scotland has pulled off its biggest sponsorship
deal to date - Pounds 150,000 from Fondation Elf to make possible Monet to
Matisse: Landscape painting in France 1874-1914, which opens in Edinburgh on
August 11.
The French company's total support for the exhibition, including a gala
dinner, will be much higher. The deal was signed just in time. Elf, the
leading French oil company, is being privatised and seems certain to reduce
its contribution to culture.
Another important show, from the NGS, The Romantic Spirit in German Art
1790-1990, at the Royal Scottish Academy and the Fruitmarket, is supported
by Beck's.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Magnets have come a long way from the school physics laboratory. Thorn
Automation, of Rugeley, Staffordshire, has developed a portable traffic
analyser which uses magnets to detect the type of vehicle travelling along
the road.
The EdgeHog incorporates a magnet in a box secured to a post up to 1.5
metres from the road edge. As vehicles pass, the magnetic field they produce
is measured by the EdgeHog, enabling it to determine the difference between
cars, van and lorries - the main aim of many traffic censuses. By placing
two EdgeHogs two metres apart the speed of the vehicles can also be
measured.
Thorn Automation: UK, 0889 585151.
Magnets are also coming to the aid of companies with drinks vending
machines. The machines often get clogged up with deposits of scale,
particularly in hard water areas.
Water Technics, of Woking, Surrey, has adapted magnetic technology already
used in the processing industry to help keep vending machines in operation.
To prevent the scaling the water passes through the magnetic field created
by strategically-placed magnets. The magnetic forces prevent the calcium and
magnesium crystals sticking to each other and so being deposited.

<TEXT>
An inert fluid which is used as a dressing to treat burns is now being used
in the electronics industry to prevent the latest processor chips from
over-heating.
As consumers demand increasing power packed into smaller packages - from
laptop PCs to cameras - many microprocessors have had difficulty working at
their full capacity without overheating. Oasis has been developed by Aavid,
of Laconia, New Hampshire, to dissipate the heat.
Oasis incorporates a fluid developed by 3M which boils at between 56'C and
58'C and is intended for use where there is a minimal amount of space above
the microprocessor. As the liquid boils it vaporises and then is carried
away to a condenser where it turns back into liquid.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A company in Japan has shrunk the ubiquitous barcode to one tenth of its
normal size. Because the micro barcodes can be squeezed into catalogues or
directories instead of order numbers, the codes, along with their hand-held
scanner, could be used for ordering from catalogues or stock lists, or even
for phoning numbers directly from a phone book.
Developed by Neorex, of Nagoya, with its international development handled
by Foxmark International, of Tokyo, the micro barcode scanner incorporates a
specially developed lens which has to be placed in contact with the tiny
barcode but can read it even if the lines are not entirely clear. It can
also read the barcodes if they have been faxed.
The lens could be incorporated in a telephone handset for less than Pounds
30, enabling companies or consumers to read and then dial a number quickly
or transfer order information down the phone line to a central database.

FT  08 APR 94 / Technology: Back in business and up-to-date - Barclays Bank
Trust has spent Pounds 32m to cut costs and improve customer services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago, Barclays Bank Trust Company, a unit of Barclays Financial
Services, was caught in a vicious spending circle. For every Pounds 100 of
revenue, it was spending Pounds 90 on servicing its customers. Greater use
of computers in the company would have cut costs, but such investment was
not made because its earnings were thought to be too small.
But times have changed. This month, the company will start to reap the full
benefits of a restructuring programme. Its procedures have been redesigned,
its operations centralised and new systems introduced. Now, only Pounds 55
of every Pounds 100 goes on customer servicing. The total cost to the
business of this process re-engineering project, codenamed Meridian, was
Pounds 32m, of which Pounds 8m went on information technology.
Although its procedures were largely paper-based prior to the project, the
company scored highly in customer satisfaction surveys. People liked the
'quill pen' image. David Johnson, head of project management services at
Barclays Financial Services, part of Barclays Bank, said: 'It wasn't quite
copper-plate handwriting, but Dickens would have felt at home there.'
However, with the market for trust services (investment management,
taxation, executorship and trustee business) becoming more competitive,
Barclays had to act to maintain its position. 'Barclays was under pressure
to improve efficiency or let building societies, accountants and solicitors
cherry pick its most profitable customers,' says Johnson.
'The only way we could continue to offer the same level of customer service
at a competitive price was to use IT. So we started looking for
opportunities,' he says. The trust company, based in London, had eight
branch offices and 22 regional offices, most located near Barclays Bank
branches which referred business to them.
Barclays Bank Trust realised it could lower costs if it took back-office
administration away from these offices and based it in two or three centres.
This marked the beginning of Meridian which comprised: redesigning business
processes; deciding which jobs would be needed after the reorganisation;
automating the redesigned processes; and selecting new locations.
Planning took six months. One of the first tasks was to map the steps
involved in Barclays Bank Trust's work processes and assess how they could
be improved. A system from Digital Equipment called Stars was used to trace
information flows. This depicted processes in different colours depending on
whether they were paper-based or computerised. It showed the way the
business was organised and identified bottlenecks. Based on the redesigned
information flows and users' requirements, it was possible to define the
number and type of jobs needed after relocation.
Barclays Bank Trust then chose suppliers for the IT equipment, which
included an investment management system. The company initially ran into
problems, however, after spending Pounds 500,000 for a system that it said
did not function properly - it is now in litigation.
Barclays then chose a proven investment management package, Paladign, from
DST/Clarke &amp; Tilley of the US.
It has added other features in a bid to gain a competitive advantage. For
example, staff can now perform 'what if?' scenarios on customers' share
portfolios, to find out the most efficient way of handling their affairs.
To the user, the extra features look as if they are part of Paladign because
they are available through the same interface - Foss (front-end support
system). There are two versions of Foss, one for investment management and
one for executorship and trustee (with options for handling property, estate
accounts, old master paintings and other types of business).
Johnson believes that the combination of choosing a tried-and-tested package
and the add-on features has helped the company meet the project's deadline
of end-March 1994.
'If we had missed the deadline, a lot of employees who were relocating would
have had their lives messed up,' he says.
Paladign runs on an IBM AS/400 system based in Poole, Dorset. This sends
data to computers in the new back-office centres in Peterborough Business
Park (for investment management and taxation) and Northwich near Manchester
(for executorship and trustee work).
For Barclays Bank Trust clients, centralisation means that instead of
calling a regional office they are assigned their own service
representatives at the two new centres. If the contact is away, another
administrator can call up the relevant details on a computer screen.
The main back-office systems are linked electronically to Barclays
Stockbrokers (in Glasgow) and to its own London brokers, BZW. So orders to
buy or sell shares can be turned round more quickly.
Automation has other benefits: Staff can find out the state of a customer's
portfolio instantly and calculate capital gains liability quickly when an
order to sell is received.
Orders to sell shares can be carried out in three or four days instead of up
to 14 or 15 and require one piece of paper rather than up to 19.
Accuracy should increase because checks are built in to the software to
ensure compliance with financial regulations.
Sales and customer service in the regional offices could improve because
although there are fewer staff (down from an average of 40 per office to an
average of 10), they are freed from back-office processing.
Administrators can handle 450 clients instead of 200.
But for Barclays Bank Trust, the biggest benefit is the sharp improvement in
the cost/income ratio. Savings will be made from the closure of eight branch
offices and cutting the payroll from 1,200 to 750. Total cost savings have
been put at Pounds 12m a year, giving a payback period of around
two-and-a-half years.

Most technological achievements take years - if not centuries - to become
the subject of academic research. But a service to be launched to a wider
audience next Monday has already become part of a course at the University
of Central England in Birmingham.
Students studying the official and legal information course are looking at
the workings of Polis, a parliamentary online information system which will
be available internationally as Justis Parliament next week.
Justis Parliament, from Context, the information service company based in
London, will enable businesses, government departments, lobbying groups, the
media and academics to obtain information about what will happen in both
Houses of Parliament - standing committees, tabled questions, early day
motions and so on.
'Hansard is only a report of what has happened. Justis looks ahead,'
explains Michelle Green, marketing director of Context.
Whereas Polis is an online database service, available largely to members of
parliament, Justis Parliament combines CD-Rom technology with an online
service. This makes it considerably less expensive for the user.
A complete record of parliamentary events from 1979 to 1987 is stored on a
single disc which costs Pounds 250; a second Pounds 250 disc buys records
from 1987 to 1992. For the current parliamentary term from 1992, subscribers
buy a combination of CD-Rom and online services. An annual subscription of
Pounds 480 buys two discs plus the first 60 minutes of database search time.
Because the archival data is stored on CD-Rom, the time it takes to search
the database is reduced, Green points out, resulting in lower costs.
The service is available over the public packet switched phone network and
will be available on the Internet network later this year.

In a move aimed at bolstering its foreign exchange activities, Natwest
Markets has appointed Michael Cornford, 47, as head of global foreign
exchange.
He will fill the gap left by the promotion of Stephan Harris to the position
of group treasurer for the Natwest Bank group. Cornford leaves his position
as managing director, foreign exchange, at Swiss Bank Corporation in London
to take up his new post in May.
Cornford says his philosophy will be to 'deliver high value products and
services to a well focused client base'; clients require 'one-stop shopping'
delivered across time zones. But he adds that is 'coming to a first class
business where there is nothing broke that needs fixing'.

FT  08 APR 94 / People: Laurentian Financial Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After more than a year without a chief executive, Laurentian Financial
Group, of which the main element is a life assurance company, has appointed
Roland Ward to the post.
In the months following the departure of Paul Seymour, Ward and three
colleagues jointly ran the business, reporting record profits of Pounds 7.3m
in 1993. The board then decided to choose the chief executive from among the
four; remarkably, at present the other three have decided to stay with the
group. 'We have a very good relationship - it could have gone to any of the
others,' Ward says.
He sees a big task for Laurentian, and for the life industry in general, to
win the trust and confidence of the public; earlier this year Laurentian
Life was fined Pounds 70,000 by its regulators for serious rule breaches,
including a failure to ensure sales agents gave best advice to investors.
For Laurentian in particular, Ward also believes it will be important to
develop innovative products, in areas such as protection, since it cannot
compete with leading companies in the sector in terms of size.
He comes from a banking background, having been with bank of America before
becoming deputy chief executive of The Mortgage Corporation when it was set
up in the late 1980s. While there, he was approached by Laurentian, which he
joined in 1992 as group finance director. He is succeeded in that post by
Michael Tallet-Williams, finance director of Laurentian Life.

FT  08 APR 94 / People: Henry Cooke Lumsden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Adams is to leave Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester-based
stockbroking and financial services group. A former chief executive, he says
the parting is 'amicable', but is precluded from saying more.
Most members of the northern network of professionals are interpreting this
as the push after a rocky 1990s. First, Cooke's merchant banking arm -
Edington - was shut down by the Bank of England; in the general crisis of
confidence in small deposit-takers three years ago some local authorities
withdrew deposits, which damaged liquidity.
A successful receivership has so far returned 85p in the pound to
depositors, with at least another 5p due this year. This has helped save
both Cooke's and Adams' reputations, but the core stockbroking business
suffered badly from low trading volumes in the recession.
The market stirred just in time to avert serious redundancies, but a wounded
Cooke then had merger discussions with the Birmingham-based Albert E. Sharp.
These foundered, but Sharp now has a Manchester office, run by some former
Cooke's people - a thorn in Cooke's side.
Field Walton, a former Cazenove stockbroker, became chairman late last year.
Cooke has now been reorganised into divisions catering for private clients,
institutions, corporate finance and management of unit trusts and Peps, each
with its own chief. Adams was shunted sideways to become finance director.
His departure confirms people's suspicions this was not an entirely happy
arrangement. 'Once you have been the boss, it's difficult not to go on being
the boss,' Adams let slip to a friend.
He is 50 and on the look-out. Influential contacts include Joe Dwek,
chairman of Bodycote and his brother-in-law. He is also one of the leading
activists behind Manchester's emergence as a European regional financial
centre.

Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A chief executive who has demonstrated considerable flair in the running of
his own Tec has been appointed as the first full-time director of policy and
strategy for the 82 Tecs in England and Wales.
Chris Humphries, who has been chief executive of Hertfordshire Tec since
1991, is expected to take up the position in June. In effect he will be
chief executive of the Tec secretariat which supports the work of the Tec
National Council, a body which represents Tecs nationally, in particular in
their relationship to the government.
Responsibility at a national level for policy and strategy has until now
been handled in a part-time capacity by Richard Guy, the chief executive of
South and East Cheshire Tec and Business Link.
Humphries, 44, is expected to play a key role in negotiations between Tecs
and the government as well as interfacing between the several specialist
committees that develop Tecs' policies. He will report to Mike Bett, the
former deputy chairman of British Telecom, who has taken over as
non-executive chairman of the Tec national council in succession to Edward
Roberts.

FT  08 APR 94 / People: US/UK policy adviser joins BitC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cay Stratton, one of the leading architects of radical change in the
delivery of training in the UK, has joined Business in the Community.
BitC is undergoing a regular three-year review and a number of job titles,
including Stratton's, are yet to be determined. It is likely, however, that
Stratton will lead new initiatives by BitC to promote partnerships between
the public and private sectors.
Stratton, who was policy adviser to three successive employment secretaries
in the UK, returned to the US last year to become senior policy adviser to
Douglas Ross, assistant secretary at the Department of Labor. She returned
to the UK earlier this year.
In the late 1980s, Stratton was chief executive of the Boston Pic. Private
Industry Councils are employer-led organisations which involve the private
sector in education and training.
Norman Fowler, the then employment secretary, met her on a visit to learn
about Pics and US vocational training and in 1987 she accepted a one-year
post as his special adviser. She stayed nearly six, also advising his
successors, Michael Howard and Gillian Shephard.
Stratton was part of a small team which laid the foundations for the
government's current policies on training. This included setting up Training
and Enterprise Councils, which administer government-funded training and
promote local economic development.

FT  08 APR 94 / Management: The good and the bad of bigness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bigness used to be considered a virtue in business. But it has had a
decidely bad press of late. For more than a decade, pundit after pundit,
from Tom Peters to Harvard economist Michael Jensen, has sounded the death
knell for large companies.
The real world has appeared to bear them out: action by governments,
shareholders and managements themselves has broken up all sorts of
established dynasties, both sensible but unwieldy business monoliths such as
AT&amp;T, and illogical conglomerates such as ITT. Other big companies have
reacted by stripping themselves 'back to basics': concentrating on their
core businesses, and divesting or 'outsourcing' the remainder. A fashion has
even developed for voluntary demerger.
In the marketplace, lumbering giants, from IBM, Sears Roebuck and General
Motors to the American TV networks, have been overtaken by more sprightly
upstarts - Microsoft, WalMart, Toyota, CNN - and been attacked by hordes of
smaller innovators.
Small is now beautiful it seems - at least until, like Microsoft, you become
big enough to join the ranks of the bad and ugly.
In his new book, Global Paradox, John Naisbitt, the futurologist who made
his name with Megatrends, declares that 'the bigger the world economy, the
more powerful its smallest players'. He claims that 'we have moved . . .
from bigger is better to bigger is inefficient, costly, wastefully
bureaucratic, inflexible and, now, disastrous'.
As the events of the past few weeks have shown, this blanket judgment is at
best misleading and at worst dangerous. If big is bad, why is Lou Gerstner,
the new chairman of IBM, reversing his predecessor's strategy of breaking up
the company, and instead focusing on 'leveraging our economies of scale
across research, development, manufacturing, distribution and services,' as
he put it a fortnight ago?
If big is bad, why is Alex Trotman, Ford's new boss, accelerating the
integration of the motor company's design, engineering and manufacturing
operations across the globe? Why has BMW bought Rover? Why is Sir Colin
Marshall of British Airways pressing its American affiliate, US Air, to
clean up its act so that the two companies can move on to their next stage
of integration?
The answer is not that any of these people is blind to the frequent virtues
of smallness. It is that bigness is a much misunderstood and overabused
concept. In the words of Dawn French, a sizeable and hugely popular British
comedienne who has assumed the role of chief advocate for large ladies in
Britain - much more happily than Roseanne Barr in the US - bigness brings
'something extra, and it's not just flesh'.
In the wrong form, bigness can mean a business is fat, lumbering and
ineffective. But in the right form, it can mean it is vibrant, powerful and
agile.
One of the reasons why bigness has fallen into such disrepute is that its
more technical definition - scale - has been confused by many people with
scope and diversity. What was wrong with ITT and most other companies in the
1970s and 1980s was not that they were too large as such, but that their
scope was too broad - they were too diverse to be managed effectively. In
each of their various businesses, however, they were often too small. This
was certainly true of ITT's telecommunications interests, which had
inadequate scale to be competitive in the 1970s, and failed utterly to meet
the changed circumstances of the 1980s. Hence their sale.
Equally, AT&amp;T was too broadly spread within the US market - where it was
both a manufacturer and a monopoly service operation - but too small from a
global point of view. In the US it suffered from diseconomies of scope - and
also of scale - but in global terms it was of sub-optimal size. So, today,
is BA, and possibly still BMW.
In other words, big is both relative and - with all respect to French and
Barr - not necessarily broad.
Nor is big necessarily fat. Anyone who still equates the two should look at
Percy Barnevik's ABB, Lew Platt's Hewlett-Packard or Livio DeSimone's 3M.
Each is big in its chosen markets but exceedingly lean in the way it is
managed. The same applies to a growing number of large multinationals,
especially in the US but also in Europe.
Stripped of their superfluous businesses and activities, they are managed
increasingly like a collection of small businesses - but with the difference
that they also exploit scale economies in selected parts of their 'value
chain'.
For many, this means sharing various degrees of research, design,
development and purchasing across their businesses, and also aspects of
distribution and service. For others - rather fewer, since the critics are
right that large factories can be a handicap - it means harnessing economies
of scale in production. For almost all of them it means sharing managerial
skills, in particular through the common development of people. In each
case, bigness brings benefits.
The trick in this process is twofold. First, to recognise that the required
level of bigness varies not only between industries, but also between the
various businesses and value-adding activities within each industry.
The second, far harder, challenge is to achieve the requisite degree of
co-ordination or integration without falling foul of what management
professors call 'the cost of complexity' - what economists prefer to term
'unacceptably high transaction costs'.
That trick is what Ford claims to be performing in its gradual process of
global integration. It is what IBM must achieve if it is to justify
Gerstner's retention of so many businesses. Only then will 'Big Blue' cease
to be seen as bad and ugly, and instead join the ranks of the lean and
beautiful.

FT  08 APR 94 / Management: Revolution in toyland - William Dawkins reports
on a US discount retailer's success in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US trade officials considering economic sanctions to blow open Japan's
closed markets should reflect on the experience of Toys 'R' Us, the American
discount toy retailer.
Over the past two years, Toys 'R' Us has taken an independently estimated 4
to 5 per cent of Japan's Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.1bn) retail toy market, on
which, to its managers' surprise, it is almost breaking even.
It has, with a mixture of managerial nerve and political help from the US
government, destroyed a small but symbolic part of Japan's costly
multi-layered distribution system and been a leader in the price discounting
now sweeping across Japanese toy retailing.
Toys 'R' Us's experience has disproved the official US view that political
pressure is the only way to make progress in the Japanese market - though it
is useful - as well as challenged the belief of some European businesses
that the best way in is to tip-toe across the threshold over many years.
The US group has swiped market share from the department stores and small
corner shops that dominate retailing by offering up to 20 per cent discounts
 -admittedly helped by the dollar's fall against the yen - a wider product
range and extras like parking, a luxury for most Japanese shoppers. Annual
turnover per Toys 'R' Us store in Japan is Dollars 15m-Dollars 20m (Pounds
10m-Pounds 13.5m), roughly double the sales per store in the US and it
expects its overall Japanese sales to double this year.
'We wanted to make a statement and capture the minds of consumers. We felt a
modest entry would have been more hazardous to our health than a massive
move,' says Larry Bouts, president of the US company's international
division. He says Japan's recession has nurtured a fashion for value for
money.
Bouts' experiences have become a case study for other foreign retailers
thinking of moving into Japan, like UK retailer Marks and Spencer, Eddie
Bauer, a US retailer of outdoor lifestyle goods, and The Gap, a clothes
store.
Unsurprisingly, the US toy group met fierce opposition from small
shopkeepers when it was planning its arrival in the late 1980s, but their
political influence has waned with that of their political patrons in the
Liberal Democratic Party, thrown out of power last year for the first time
since 1955.
The progress of deregulation over the past 10 years, while slow, meant Toys
'R' Us also had consent, if not support, from an unexpected quarter, the
Tokyo government.
Toys 'R' Us knew it had to take a bigger financial risk in Japan than in
other foreign markets. It committed Dollars 100m to Japan in lease payments,
stock, working capital and training, even before it opened its first store
in late 1991. 'Several hundred million dollars' later, says Bouts, it has 16
stores stretching across regional Japan and plans to increase this to 24
this year, with an eventual goal of 100 stores.
The decision to hit the market on such a big scale is in line with Toys 'R'
Us's general approach. But Bouts felt it was especially right for Japan, a
lesson of the 'only modest success' achieved there by Pepsico Foods, his
former company.
Very high turnover per store was needed to cover costs which are, generally,
the highest Toys 'R' Us has encountered in any market. The only exception is
debt, made cheap by Japan's low official interest rates. Bouts estimates
that his Japanese prices are between 50-100 per cent higher than in the US.
Even so, his Japanese profit margins are 'much lower' than the average for
Toys 'R' Us's stores worldwide.
But a high proportion of Toys 'R' Us's Japanese costs are fixed - rent, for
example - so that further rises in sales should create sharp rises in
profit. 'We keep adding to fixed costs at a declining rate as we achieve
economies of scale . . . I have some warm feelings about our cost
structure,' says Bouts.
The other advantage of size is negotiating power, an important ingredient in
Toys 'R' Us's success in the US and Europe. Three quarters of its Japanese
stock is imported from the US, which gave the group enough volume to justify
setting up its own direct import company, to deliver straight from the docks
to its warehouses, the first foreign retailer to do this in Japan.
Toys 'R' Us makes direct imports elsewhere in the world, but this was
provocation to Japan's still powerful network of distributors. 'People said
we could not do it, but we insisted we needed control over our
distribution,' says Bouts.
In a second challenge to Japan's cosy distribution cartels, Toys 'R' Us
insisted on buying some of its Japanese-made stock direct from the
manufacturers. 'At first, most Japanese manufacturers said they would not
sell to us. But as the downturn started we became more in demand. They
needed large orders,' he explains.
Nintendo, the computer games maker, initially said it would only sell
through wholesalers. The wholesaler pays 60 per cent of the suggested retail
price and sells on to the next stage of the chain at 70 per cent, which then
adds another margin before selling to the shop. Nintendo's eventual
agreement, to sell to Toys 'R' Us at 70 per cent of the retail price, sent
'shock waves' through the toy industry, says Dean Perry, retail analyst at
Lehman Brothers in Tokyo.
Even Daiei, Japan's only national supermarket chain, has faced a struggle to
achieve direct buying. Yet Bouts believes the shift in balance of power from
manufacturer to retailer seen in the US and Europe is now taking place in
Japan. Evidence for that is a decline over the past five years in the
proportion of Japanese toyshops to stick to manufacturers' recommended
retail prices, from 70 per cent to just under 30 per cent, according to a
recent survey by the Fair Trade Commission. More than 80 per cent of the
shops surveyed attributed this to the impact of Toys 'R' Us.
US political pressure was useful, in that it inspired a Japanese government
decision to speed up approvals for the development of new shopping
complexes.
This was a result of the Structural Impediments Initiative trade talks with
the US, one of the several abortive attempts at bringing down the Japanese
trade surplus. Toys 'R' Us was even singled out as a lesson in US-Japan
trade relations by former US president George Bush, who opened its second
Japanese store on his 1992 trade mission to Japan.
However, even after this liberalisation, Bouts says it still takes three
times longer in Japan than in the US to get approval for a new store.
Toys 'R' Us was, however, pleasantly surprised at the understanding it
received from the Japanese government on other matters.
It agreed, for example, to allow Toys 'R' Us to send toys to foreign
laboratories to be tested for rigorous Japanese safety standards and to
scrap a requirement that foreign toys had to be retested every six months.
It is difficult to tell whether Toys 'R' Us has been a catalyst in the
changes in Japanese retailing or has simply cashed in on them. But its
experience does show that one part of the Japanese market is opening for
real. Other sectors might follow a similar pattern.

FT  08 APR 94 / The Property Market: The paradox in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rescue package unveiled last month for Credit Lyonnais, in which the
bank transferred FFr40bn (Pounds 4.68bn) of non-performing property loans
into a specially formed company, has highlighted a paradox in the French
property market.
The tactics used by French banks to deal with their property problems have
helped avoid a market collapse; but the same strategies have also been
blamed for a severe stagnation in the property investment market. A paltry
FFr5bn of investment deals were concluded in 1993.
The deep property recession that followed the heady 1980s left French banks
with severe difficulties. By the end of last year lenders had already made
provisions of about FFr70bn against their total exposure of some FFr450bn.
But most analysts believe that larger provisions will be necessary to bring
values down to more realistic levels.
Those institutions saddled with the property assets of defaulting clients
have sought to protect their balance-sheets; they have done this by
resisting the sale of property on the open market in a bid to crystallise
their losses. Most deals have involved swaps with other institutions or the
transfer of properties to specially created companies.
The Credit Lyonnais deal is a prime example. The bank has transferred
FFr40bn of non-performing property loans into a new state-controlled
company, with the government guaranteeing FFr18.4bn of the losses on these
loans for five years. Credit Lyonnais said that the decision to hive-off the
property assets was taken because it had found it impossible to estimate the
level of provisioning they required.
This practice, which has eased the pressure on banks to sell the property of
defaulting clients, is partly blamed for the stalemate in the investment
market. One reason why investors have held back is the scarcity of good
quality buildings at a realistic price.
'Such practices have perpetuated an artificial shortage of good investment
product; however, it is only fair to say that they were also instrumental in
the early stages of the downturn in preventing a market collapse,' said Mr
Robert Waterland of Jones Lang Wootton, property consultants.
For some dealers, the relief that France has avoided a property crash is
tempered by impatience at the slow pace at which the investment market is
emerging from recession.

FT  08 APR 94 / The Property Market: Nimble-footed likely to remain a step
ahead - Property shares have lost their lustre in a market beset by
uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Property shares have come back to earth with a bump. In the past two months,
they have lost more than a sixth of their value, outstripping the 10 per
cent fall in the stock market as a whole.
In 1993 the mood of optimism buoyed by hopes of a sustained recovery
prompted property shares to trade at a premium to assets. But the premiums
have proved short-lived. After starting the year on a premium to assets of
more than 25 per cent, property shares are now trading at a discount to
assets of about 3 per cent.
The turnround is not surprising: property shares have only traded at a
premium to assets once before in the past 20 years, in the run-up to the
1987 stock market crash. Historically property shares have traded at a
discount to assets in excess of 20 per cent.
This sharp re-rating of property shares marks a change of attitude towards
the sector. A new mood of caution hangs over property shares and - to a much
lesser extent - the property market itself.
Three main factors lie behind this development: the fall in the bond market
this year; the large number of new property issues and rights issues; and a
rash of disappointing results from quoted property companies.
The most significant of these factors is the performance of the bond market;
the fall in bond yields was the main factor driving last year's strong
recovery in property values. With the fall in the bond market this year, the
property market risks losing some of the momentum behind its recovery.
Views differ on the likely impact of the fall in bond values on property.
BZW, the securities house, says the decline in the bond market is likely to
result in a marked slowdown in the property investment market. It could even
lead to falls in the value of properties with high incomes but poor prospect
of rental growth; such properties are most sensitive to movements in bond
yields. BZW has scaled back its forecast of property asset growth this year
from 16 per cent to 10 per cent.
In contrast, some analysts believe that the impact of the bond market on
property has been exaggerated. Other factors, they say, will sustain a
property recovery. First, the volume of money which institutions, foreign
investors and property companies are putting into the sector will sustain
rising property values. Second, the promise of a resurgence in rental values
will encourage the market.
'We are getting close to rental growth for the first time in four years,'
said Mr Selwyn Jones of Credit Lyonnais Laing, a broker.
Regardless of such market sentiments, there is little doubt that the stock
market is now more discriminating in its appetite for property shares.
This loss of enthusiasm is largely attributable to the glut of shares being
issued by property companies. About Pounds 780m of new property issues,
rights issues and convertible bonds have been issued in the past two months.
With many more such issues in the pipeline, property companies will have to
price their shares more competitively to ensure success. This necessity has
been underlined by the failure of last month's public offer for Capital
Shopping Centres, a new property company specialising in out-of-town
shopping centres, which was only 14.4 per cent subscribed.
Yet another factor blunting the stock market's enthusiasm for property
shares is the batch of disappointing results recently produced by quoted
property companies. With the exception of Slough Estates, most of the
results have been below expectations.
The shares of the biggest companies have suffered particularly hard in the
market fall-out. The value of Land Securities, for instance, has fallen by a
fifth this year. The only large property company whose shares continue to
trade at a premium to assets is British Land, a reflection of the company's
high borrowing to assets ratio and strong management record.
But the star share performers have been those of smaller companies. Topping
the list is troubled Stanhope Properties, whose shares have risen by 39 per
cent in value this year on the back of the acquisition of a 29.9 per cent
stake in the company by British land.
Stanhope aside, there is a raft of second-tier companies that have either
improved their market value or suffered marginal falls in value this year.
Helical Bar, Burford Holdings and Capital &amp; Regional Properties, for
example, have largely withstood the downturn because some investors believe
they have scope to increase asset values through acquisitions, active
management or developments.
The relatively strong performance recorded by some of these smaller property
companies suggests that property companies' fortunes do not simply depend on
the movements of the market as a whole. By operating in specific niches
these more nimble companies should be able to outperform their larger,
slower-footed rivals.

FT  08 APR 94 / Councils cut total of student grants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities in England and Wales have halved the number of
discretionary grants they give to students in higher education since 1990,
says a report published today.
Discretionary awards, usually Pounds 2,000 a year for higher-education
students, do not directly affect undergraduates who reach the minimum
A-level examination requirements. But they do affect post-graduate work, and
several vocational courses including law.
Several local authorities have cut their budgets for discretionary grants to
help meet the strict government spending limits of the past four years.
Numbers in higher education have almost doubled during the same period.
According to the report, produced by the National Foundation for Educational
Research, potential students' chances of obtaining funds depend on where
they live.
It found that 12 of the 73 authorities surveyed for the report had made
increases of 20 per cent in real terms in their awards budgets, while 34
made decreases of the same magnitude.
Overall expenditure was projected to have decline by about 8 per cent in
real terms between the years 1990-91 and 1993-94, although the total number
of awards increased by about 20 per cent.
Mr Tim Boswell, further and higher education minister, said: 'It is a matter
of regret that local education authorities were not able to provide more
(discretionary grants).
'The overall position is by no means as gloomy as some had predicted but
there are striking differences between local authorities' policies -
differences it is hard to justify on general educational grounds.'

Company pension-scheme trustees have been urged to keep a regular check on
investment returns from additional voluntary contributions. Bacon &amp; Woodrow,
the actuaries firm which advises 700 companies on pension arrangements, made
the call as it published its 1994 AVC survey.
Trustees often spent little time choosing the AVC provider, it said, but the
decision could have a significant impact on the pension payable on
retirement.

FT  08 APR 94 / Sales of AZT fail to meet expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven years ago AZT was launched into a world alarmed at the prospect of an
Aids plague. Independent sales forecasts ranged up to Dollars 2.5bn a year.
But in the first six months of Wellcome's current financial year, AZT
brought in just Pounds 110m. It ranks 70th in the world's best-selling drugs
list.
Patients infected with HIV, but without Aids symptoms, are regarded as a
more lucrative market for the simple, if unpalatable, reason that they live
longer.
Mr John Robb, Wellcome chairman and chief executive, insisted that the
fortunes of AZT were vital for the company. 'It is our second
biggest-selling product and is very important for the company,' he said.
He said the company's strategy would remain unchanged: to pursue combination
therapy - the use of the drug in combination with others. The company has
just signed a deal with Glaxo, the UK's biggest drugs company, that gives it
the option to use an experimental drug called 3TC that seems to work well
with AZT in laboratory tests. The results of the trials nevertheless come at
an awkward time.
Last month Wellcome shares fell 8 per cent after it reported slower than
expected first-half sales growth and revealed that it was dropping
development of a new anti-herpes compound.
The company also announced plans to cut its UK staff of 5,400 by about 350
during the next 12 months, with further cuts to come in the US.
City analysts remain unconvinced both about the ultimate importance of the
drug and its growth prospects. They say AZT is significant to Wellcome but
argue that it is not central to the company's fortunes.

FT  08 APR 94 / Effective Aids drugs 'a long way off ': Doctors divided over
HIV treatment as study casts doubts on leading therapy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year between the preliminary publication of the Concorde trial results
and their final confirmation today has been a period of almost unrelieved
gloom for the estimated 12m people worldwide who are infected with HIV, the
virus that causes Aids.
AZT, the only established Aids drug, turns out to deliver no lasting
clinical benefit to people who are HIV-positive but not yet showing
symptoms. And worldwide expenditure of more than Pounds 1bn a year on Aids
research has produced a plethora of potential drugs in early stages of
development, but nothing likely to treat the infection effectively in the
immediate future.
The official conclusion of the three-year study by French and UK medical
agencies published in The Lancet today is a cautious statement that 'the
results do not encourage the early use of AZT in symptom-free HIV-infected
adults'. That leaves doctors free to prescribe the drug if they want to.
But Professor Ian Weller of London's Middlesex Hospital, the study's
principal UK investigator, said his advice would be not to take AZT until
symptoms appear. Other clinical trials have shown that the drug does then
delay progression of Aids.
'Our results show that any benefits of AZT are transient and they have
disappeared completely after three years,' said Prof Weller. 'A policy of
careful watching and waiting is just as good as writing that prescription.'
On the other hand, Dr Trevor Jones, research director of Wellcome, AZT's
manufacturer, insisted that 'the drug remains the best weapon we have to
slow the progress of the disease'. He added: 'The question is where in the
course of the disease you begin.'
Wellcome said patients should discuss early and late treatment with their
doctors, 'allowing the patient to make an informed choice'. But Dr Jones
believes early treatment is valuable because some benefit, even a transient
one, is better than taking no action against the virus.
Aids charities and patient groups yesterday accepted the conclusions. 'For
everyone living with HIV, these are very disappointing results,' said Mr
Nick Partridge, of the Terrence Higgins Trust. 'While other clinical trials
have shown some benefit from AZT for people diagnosed with Aids, this trial
has failed to find any added advantage in the early, long-term use of the
drug by those who are HIV-positive but have no symptoms of Aids.'
Yet, Mr Partridge said, many HIV-positive people would find it hard to
resist medication until symptoms appeared. Those who preferred to fight the
infection more aggressively should, instead of simply taking AZT, consider
joining one of the many clinical trials of experimental treatments.
The largest trials now in progress are assessing the effects of combining
anti-HIV drugs. Many researchers believe that the best long-term prospect
will be to prescribe a cocktail of two or more medicines. The combined
ingredients may make it harder for the virus to develop resistance to
several drugs at the same time.
An independent international trial, for example, has recruited 3,000
patients to test combinations of AZT with the two other drugs approved for
HIV therapy: Roche's Hivid and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Videx.
All three drugs are synthetic chemicals called nucleoside analogues which
work by mimicking natural building blocks of genetic material. When HIV
takes up a drug molecule, it stops reproducing.
The international pharmaceutical industry is also developing other ways of
fighting HIV.
A comprehensive survey by the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
listed a total of 103 Aids medicines in clinical trials at the end of last
year, 30 of which were aimed directly at HIV.
Other approaches include gene therapy - putting anti-viral genes into
patients' blood cells - and drugs to inactivate HIV by switching off its
genes. But such products are unlikely to be approved for general treatment
for several years.
'One of the lessons of Concorde is that pinning too many hopes on drugs
still in clinical trials increases the disappointment and disillusionment
felt when trial results highlight the limitations of therapy,' Mr Partridge
said. 'Above anything else, the Concorde trial has shown us how far away we
still are from effective long-term treatments for Aids.'

FT  08 APR 94 / Alarm over low take-up of pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost a fifth of employees who could belong to an occupational scheme do
not do so, according to a survey published yesterday by the National
Association of Pension Funds.
The 1993 survey, which covers almost 900 pension schemes and 4.4m active
scheme members, also discloses that 1 per cent of the total - about 44,000
people - had left an occupational scheme during the year covered by the
questionnaire.
It also showed that someone was three times more likely to leave a
public-sector scheme than a private-sector employer's scheme, even though
public-sector schemes tended to offer inflation-proofing of benefits.
Mr Tom Ross, vice-chairman of the association, expressed dismay at the
number of people not joining schemes.
'Occupational pension schemes are not ideal for everybody, but I wouldn't
think for a minute that they were unsuitable for most of that 19 per cent,'
he said.
The association said not all the 40,000-plus people who decided to leave an
employers' pension scheme last year would have done so to take out a
personal pension, but that they might have done so simply to economise on
contributions during a time of financial difficulty.
However, the selling of personal pensions to people still in an employer's
scheme - known as opting out - has been an area of great concern to City
regulators working to raise standards in the sale of private pension plans.
Although the number of cases is thought to be much smaller than the number
of people who have transferred lump sums out of occupational schemes they
have left, the assumption is that in almost all cases it would have been bad
advice to opt out of a current employer's scheme.
'That 1 per cent is not a number we should ignore, because in the vast
majority of cases, it is an action they should not have taken,' Mr Ross
said.
The survey showed that more than a quarter of pension schemes did not allow
someone who had left the scheme while remaining an employee to be
re-admitted.
The association emphasised also the continuing role for final-salary schemes
rather than money-purchase schemes. A final-salary scheme relates benefits
to an employee's remuneration on retirement, while in a money-purchase
scheme the benefits are determined by the contributions paid by an
individual member and according to age and sex.
During the survey period, eight schemes switched from being based on defined
benefits to being based on defined contributions, and only one switched the
other way, but 85 per cent of schemes covered by the questionnaire are still
based on final salary.
Mr Ross acknowledged, however, that insurance companies involved in setting
up pension schemes for small companies reported far more money-purchase
schemes than those based on final salary.

FT  08 APR 94 / Sales of AZT fail to meet great expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven years ago AZT was launched into a world alarmed at the prospect of an
Aids plague. Sales forecasts - not from Wellcome which developed the drug -
ranged up to Dollars 2.5bn a year.
But in the first six months of Wellcome's current financial year, AZT
brought in just Pounds 110m. In the world league table of best-selling
drugs, it is about 70th.
The main cause of the drug's mediocre performance is that it is not
prescribed to people infected with HIV who do not have Aids. Although
figures are difficult to confirm, it is widely accepted that fewer than 10
per cent of people with HIV are suffering from the disease at any one time,
though almost all will eventually contract it.
Asymptomatics - patients without symptoms - are regarded as a more lucrative
market for the simple, if unpalatable, reason that they live longer. The
Concorde study published today confirms that such patients have little if
anything to gain from taking AZT. It will not, therefore, be the
'blockbuster' Wellcome must have once hoped for.
Although the preliminary report of the trials, published a year ago, were
attacked by Wellcome, the company took a more emollient line yesterday.
Mr Trevor Jones, director of research and development, argued that the final
version of the report was essentially positive because it said there was
some transient benefit for asymptomatics. This, he said, allowed the choice
to use the drug to be made according to individual cases.
Mr John Robb, chairman and chief executive, insisted that the fortunes of
AZT were vital for the company. 'It is our second biggest-selling product
and is very important for the company,' he said.
He said the company's strategy would remain unchanged: to pursue combination
therapy - the use of the drug in combination with others. The company has
just signed a deal with Glaxo, the UK's biggest drugs company, that gives it
the option to use an experimental drug called 3TC that seems to work well

awkward time for the company. Last month its shares fell 8 per cent after it
reported slower than expected first-half sales growth and revealed that it
was dropping development of a new anti-herpes compound. The company also
announced plans to cut its UK staff of 5,400 by about 350 during the next 12
months, with further cuts to come in the US.
City analysts remain unconvinced both about the ultimate importance of the
drug and its growth prospects. 'Sales of this drug have stopped growing
because of Concorde,' said Mr Paul Krikler, analyst at securities house
Goldman Sachs. They say AZT is significant to Wellcome but argue that it is
not central to the company's fortunes. Another drug, the herpes treatment
Zovirax, has first-half sales of sales of Pounds 418m, up from Pounds 369m a
year earlier. Zovirax is in the world's top 20 drugs and has sales of more
than Dollars 1bn a year.
AZT, in contrast, has gone into a decline, said Mr Stewart Adkins of Lehman
Brothers. He forecasts current-year sales of it to fall to Pounds 218m from
last year's figure of Pounds 248m.

FT  08 APR 94 / Tecs chief ready for trouble: The councils' champion sees
them in a broader role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Bett, the non-executive chairman of the new national council
representing the 82 training and enterprise councils in England and Wales,
says he is accustomed to being at the centre of a storm.
The former deputy chairman of British Telecommunications takes the helm of
the council in the wake of reports criticising the running of Tecs, the
employer-led bodies responsible for administering government-funded training
programmes and fostering local economic development.
Mr Bett, who remains chairman of BT subsidiary Cellnet, says business
executives on the boards of Tecs have made a 'very brave effort' and should
receive greater public recognition.
'Tecs are not quangos,' says Mr Bett. 'These non-executive directors are not
paid. They are trying to do their best in something which is absolutely new.
At the same time they are all running their own businesses.'
However, he appears determined to act on criticisms when they appear
justified.
The national council is the successor body to G10 - a small group of Tec
chairmen who represented Tecs nationally, particularly to the government.
Mr Bett says that, as a former personnel director at the BBC and at GEC, he
was in the centre of various storms. 'I hope I have learned how to deal with
them,' he says. But he says he cannot yet say how he will handle
relationships between Tecs and the government.
He will spend two days a week on his new post, and has recruited a new
policy and strategy director 'who I will rely on to make sure that I learn,
and learn quickly'.
A member of the government working group on social security reform, he is
already concerned with the situation of unemployed young people.
He believes his experience at BT, where he was involved in the privatisation
process, could prove valuable for Tecs, which employ former civil servants
alongside people from the private sector. 'They are not oil and water,' says
Mr Bett.
A greater challenge for Tecs was one similar to that at BT when it started
substantial recruiting: to get all employees speaking the same corporate
language. 'It was like a Tower of Babel at BT with people having been
trained to approach their jobs in many different ways. But we spent time
developing a common language.'
He is confident that Tecs can blend the talents and attitudes of their
workforces into teams capable of improving industrial competitiveness.
'Tecs are here to stay, although that does not mean they will not evolve
from concentrating on the unemployed into stimulators of enterprise.'

FT  08 APR 94 / Audit reform to help small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies with assets of more than Pounds 1.4m must still obtain annual
audits of their accounts, according to details of the government's reform of
auditing requirements for small companies announced yesterday.
The government said last year that companies with a turnover below Pounds
90,000 would be freed from the annual audit requirement, while the rule
would be relaxed for companies whose turnover was less than Pounds 350,000.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that companies
satisfying these turnover thresholds would be automatically exempted.
But companies would not be exempted if their balance sheets exceeded the
Pounds 1.4m limit, or if they were public companies, part of a group
structure or subject to a statute-based regulatory regime.
Shareholders holding 10 per cent or more of a company's capital can veto the
exemption.
The accounts of companies whose turnover is between Pounds 90,000 and Pounds
350,000 must be verified by a 'compilation report' prepared by an
independent accountant and filed with their annual accounts at Companies
House.
This is less exacting than an audit but the report must be prepared by an
accountant or auditor registered with one of the following recognised
professional bodies: the institutes of chartered accountants in England and
Wales, Scotland and Ireland; the Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants and the Association of Authorised Public Accountants.
An estimated 500,000 companies across the country will benefit from the
changes, which have followed heavy lobbying by small business organisations.
Under the present law all companies, however small, are required to appoint
auditors and have their annual accounts audited.
The government intends to bring these measures into force in the summer by
regulations under the companies act.
Mr Hamilton said: 'We will see how the measures work in practice and
consider, in due course, whether any further changes might be appropriate.'
He said the changes were part of the government's drive to 'free businesses
from unnecessary burdens'.
He said these changes would 'be warmly welcomed by both small business and
the accountancy profession'.

three-day ceasefire, which ends at midnight tonight, appear to have been
dashed by Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein.
With Downing Street yesterday rejecting Mr Adams' latest request for direct
talks, and the IRA facing renewed calls from Dublin, nationalist politicians
and church leaders to prolong the ceasefire, the Sinn Fein president said he
believed it was 'unlikely, even logistically, for the IRA to extend its
suspension'.
With the ceasefire drawing to an end and fears rising of a return to
violence in the province, both sides were trying to hold each other
responsible for the deadlock in the peace process.
Downing Street last night formally rebuffed Sinn Fein's demand for direct
dialogue, denying that London had brought about a stalemate.
But its carefully crafted two-page letter was markedly less blunt than the
curt four-paragraph response it made to a previous letter from Mr Adams in
January. Yesterday's response, signed by a senior official, said any pause
in the movement towards peace was 'because of the continuing violence, and
Sinn Fein's failure unequivocally to renounce violence as a means of
achieving political ends'.
Downing Street also reiterated Mr John Major's pledge that the government
would be ready to enter preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein 'within three
months' in the event of a permanent end to violence and a commitment by Sinn
Fein to the democratic process.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday broke off his
holiday in Cyprus to say that an extension to the ceasefire was 'essential'
if the strong momentum for peace was to be maintained.
His message was repeated in a hard-hitting speech by Mr Dick Spring, Irish
foreign minister, who called the IRA ceasefire 'pathetically brief' and
called for it to be permanently extended.
Mr Spring used a conference in County Kerry to challenge republican leaders
to display 'vision and courage to build', rather than to destroy. He
insisted that the Downing Street declaration remained the only way forward
for political progress in Northern Ireland and that a renewal of violence
would 'not appreciably change the basic realities in the declaration'. He
said Sinn Fein's failure to specify its concerns over the declaration had
given rise to 'understandable worries' that the party's aim was to draw both
governments 'into a world of verbal mirrors and shifting goalposts' and to
enter political negotiations 'on a basis of armed conflict'.
Mr Spring also criticised unionist leaders for their 'dogmatic refusal' to
join talks, which he said they should do out of 'enlightened self-interest'.

FT  08 APR 94 / Lottery criminal checks planned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The National Lottery Office has found that a number of directors of
companies associated with bids to run the UK's national lottery have
criminal convictions that they failed to disclose, Raymond Snoddy writes.
All eight bidders yesterday received letters saying that some people had not
made the full and detailed disclosure required.
Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the lottery, who is expected to announce
the winner of the licence next month, has stressed the importance of probity
in all aspects of the lottery. Yesterday's letters do not specify which bids
involved directors with apparently undeclared convictions.
The lottery has asked all bidders for permission to approach all those
involved so that the information it has can be 'confirmed or negated'.
The lottery, to be launched late this year or early next, is designed to
raise money for five 'good causes' in equal proportion - the arts,
charities, a millennium fund, the national heritage and sport.

FT  08 APR 94 / Value of regulation regime attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK

<DATELINE>
   VENICE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Audit regulation in the UK is unlikely to prevent scandals and it benefits
neither large companies nor their auditors, two academics said yesterday.
The system of audit regulation set up since 1989 has raised audit standards
in small firms of accountants but has had no effect on the quality of audits
of larger firms, the academics said.
The findings came in a paper presented at the European Accounting
Association conference in Venice by Ms Stella Fearnley of the University of
Southampton and Mr Michael Page of the University of Portsmouth.
They said audit failures leading to corporate collapses arose from judgments
that the regulatory regime was not designed to address.
Small companies were paying a high price for regulation, some of which was
passed on to their clients. But the clients did not benefit.
The main beneficiaries of audit regulation were banks, the Inland Revenue
and creditors, which did not have to pay.
In a separate paper, three British academics argued that submissions on the
reform of auditing in the UK reflected the self-interest of the accountancy
bodies.

FT  08 APR 94 / Sharp increase in housebuilding starts welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of homes started by housebuilders continues to race ahead of
levels prevailing 12 months ago, according to separate figures published
yesterday by the government and the industry.
The Department of the Environment said builders in Great Britain started
work on 41,000 homes during the three months to the end of February - 5.6
per cent more than the 38,800 started during the corresponding three-month
period a year earlier.
The figures show that private-sector starts over the same period rose by
14.4 per cent from 27,800 to 31,800. However, starts made on homes for
housing associations fell from 10,300 to 8,800, reflecting continuing
reductions in government spending.
Housing starts and completions by local authorities, new towns and
government departments also remained at a low level.
Separate figures published by the National House Building Council, which
claims to register about 90 per cent of all new homes in the UK, show that
48,700 starts on new homes were registered with the council in the first
three months of this year.
The council said this represented a 19 per cent increase on the first three
months of last year and was the highest number of starts in any quarter
since the beginning of 1989. About 10,500 homes were being built on behalf
of housing associations.
Mr Basil Bean, the council's chief executive, said: 'Housebuilders have been
very active during the first quarter of this year.
'The first couple of months showed a considerable increase in new home
starts and March continued this encouraging trend, although at a slightly
lower level.'
He added: 'There is no sign of the upturn in the market faltering, and the
next few months are traditionally an important season in the home-buying
calendar. However, it will be interesting to see how the recent tax
increases affect the attitude of potential homebuyers.'

FT  08 APR 94 / Engineering and food boost output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff and ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Higher output from the engineering industries and a rise in food production
were the main influences behind the sharp rise in manufacturing output
between January and February.
The 0.6 per cent month-on-month increase meant that for the second month of
the year, manufacturing output remained well above the levels recorded in
the second half of last year.
In the three months to February it rose 0.8 per cent, and was 2 per cent up
on the same three months a year ago.
In the three months to February, output of the engineering and allied
industries - which has the highest weighting within manufacturing - rose a
seasonally-adjusted 1.6 per cent to stand 1.8 per cent up on the same three
months a year ago.
A particularly strong sugar harvest pushed food, drink and tobacco
production up a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in the latest three months
compared with the previous three-month period, although it was down 0.2 per
cent on the same period a year ago.
Most of the other manufacturing sectors also increased their production
levels. Output of wood and wood products - boosted by higher furniture
production - grew by 5 per cent compared with the previous three-month
period, while output of electrical equipment picked up 2.8 per cent. This
mainly reflected strong growth in production of computers but also of
telephones and related equipment, and domestic electrical goods.
The most notable falls were 2.9 per cent in the coke, mineral, oil-refining
and nuclear fuels industries; 2.2 per cent in the output of non-metallic
mineral products, covering products related to the construction industry;
and 1.8 per cent in the output of basic metals and metal products.
Oil and gas production surpassed its previous 1987 peak, increasing by 8.2
per cent on the previous three months. Compared with the same three months a
year ago it was 29.9 per cent higher. Coal production, by contrast,
continued to decline, dropping 14.9 per cent in the three months to February
compared with the previous three months, a reflection of the new
lower-volume contracts negotiated between British Coal and the electricity
generators.
Analysts were encouraged by the strong growth of investment goods. An
increase of 1.8 per cent in the three months to February on the previous
three months, compares with growth of 0.6 per cent for consumer goods and
0.1 per cent for intermediate goods.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Midland Global Markets, said the rise in
investment goods output was 'evidence that the recovery is shifting in
favour of industry, which is vital if consumer spending slows in the face of
tax rises'.
The Central Statistical Office said there had been a number of small
downward revisions to the latest figures. The manufacturing output index in
December was revised down to 95.6 from 95.7, while the January figure was
revised to 96.6 from 96.8.
The surge in North Sea oil and gas production which has helped underpin
industrial output lifted total UK primary fuel production in the three
months to February by 9.4 per cent, the Department of Trade and Industry
said, Robert Corzine writes.
Oil production in the period was 30.5m tonnes, up 25.8 per cent compared
with the same time last year. Natural gas output increased by 14.6 per cent,
while coal production was down by 28.7 per cent. The oil and gas rises
reflect the large number of new fields which came on stream last year.

FT  08 APR 94 / South leads race to beat VAT on fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Householders have paid out a total of Pounds 990m to electricity companies
and British Gas to avoid paying value added tax on future fuel bills. People
in the south of England have participated far more actively than others in
the race to beat the tax collector.
A final count among British Gas and electricity companies by the Financial
Times shows that 1.1m power consumers and 500,000 British Gas customers made
advance payments ahead of the VAT imposition on April 1.
The pre-payments will deprive the Treasury of at least Pounds 79m, since the
VAT will initially be levied at 8 per cent.
A precise figure is impossible to gauge because some of the pre-payments
cover more than a year and from April next year VAT on fuel will rise to
17.5 per cent.
Sweb, the electricity company serving the south-west of England, appears to
have the most financially conscious customers, with 9.3 per cent of
consumers paying in advance.
Generally the participation rate was high throughout the south, with
Seeboard, based in Hove, receiving advance payments from 7.4 per cent of
customers and London Electricity from 5.6 per cent. That compares with a
nationwide average for power and gas consumers of 4.3 per cent.
The lowest participation rate in Great Britain was 2.4 per cent by customers
of Northern Electric. In Northern Ireland, only 1.8 per cent of electricity
consumers paid in advance.
The participation rate among British Gas's 18m customers was also relatively
low, at 2.8 per cent.
The companies have markedly different policies on what to do with the
interest they make on the money they have received.
British Gas said it was difficult to speculate 'what the amount might be and
therefore to what use it might be put', although it added that it was
already involved heavily in community projects.
London Electricity said it had 'no plans at present to do anything in
particular with the money'. Norweb, serving north-west England, said it
would not treat the money in any special way.
However, Scottish Power said that none of the money would be added to
profits. It will donate all the interest generated from pre-payments to
'disadvantaged groups within our area, particularly those most likely to
have been affected by the introduction of value added tax'.
Midlands Electricity said that 'as a direct result of pre-payments' it would
give Pounds 500,000 to Neighbourhood Energy Action, a charity.
Most companies said they had incurred considerable expense in setting up the
infrastructure to deal with pre-payments. Southern Electric estimates this
at Pounds 700,000 leaving the net interest benefit after tax at less than
Pounds 1m in a full year. Seeboard said any surplus after costs would be
used to cut prices.

FT  08 APR 94 / Patten's warm reception fails to thaw Malaysian freeze:
Optimism on educational links has done little to improve the trade outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, this week became the first cabinet
minister to visit Malaysia since Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the country's prime
minister, announced a ban on British companies winning government contracts.
But his visit - to discuss expanding the already considerable educational
links between Britain and Malaysia - has not marked any relaxation of the
ban, imposed more than six weeks ago, in retaliation for unfavourable
reports in the Britsh press about Dr Mahathir and Malaysia.
British companies are failing to be shortlisted for contracts and face the
break-up of partnerships with local and other businesses.
The most serious blow has been to companies involved in a Pounds 2bn-plus
project to build an international airport outside Kuala Lumpur. Ajac, a
consortium of BICC, GEC-Marconi, Gammon and Trafalgar House of Britain and
Marubeni of Japan, carried out initial planning and won the design and
engineering contract for the airport.
The Malaysian works ministry has now disclosed that it is vetting 29
pre-qualification applications to bid for the airport's construction and
none of them is British.
John Laing had put in a preliminary tender for a MDollars 3bn (Pounds 753m)
terminal at the airport. It is believed to have withdrawn after its local
and foreign partners expressed fears that its inclusion could jeopardise
their chances.
The National Grid company was to have participated in a MDollars 1.6bn
project to install power transmission lines for Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's
semi-privatised electricity utility. Pressure from local partners is likely
to result in National Grid withdrawing.
Some companies have decided to carry on regardless. Up to 90 British
defence-related companies are due at an exhibition in Kuala Lumpur this
month even though the Malaysian defence minister has said there will be no
more purchases of arms and equipment from Britain.
A group of British oil industry experts recently gave a seminar to Petronas,
the Malaysian state oil company. Soon afterwards Petronas announced that
British companies would be excluded from future contracts in Malaysia.
One British executive based in Malaysia said: 'The longer it goes on, the
worse it gets. It seems we are just laying down and being kicked.'
Other companies are aware of the opportunities. Britain had hoped for a
share of a MDollars 4bn programme to equip the Royal Malaysian Navy with new
patrol vessels. During the past 10 days delegations from France and Sweden
have been suggesting collaborative work on the vessels. Similar delegations
are due from Germany and Australia.
Mr Patten said he had been 'heartened by the warmth of my reception'. He
added: 'There is an extraordinary atmosphere of friendliness.' He will take
an optimistic message back to London on the educational front, where
Malaysia needs British assistance.
But this week Dr Mahathir repeated that the British press must stop telling
'lies'. He added: 'We will not change our policy as long as this campaign
goes on. We will wait and see. We have plenty of time.'
The outlook for British companies remains grim.

FT  08 APR 94 / Power pool deal may save Pounds 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The electricity industry hopes to save more than Pounds 30m a year for
consumers as a result of a deal yesterday between National Grid, operator of
the transmission system, and electricity suppliers.
The agreement is aimed at reducing 'uplift' costs associated with the
running of the electricity pool, the wholesale market through which all
power is traded.
National Grid is to be given more incentives to find economic solutions to a
variety of problems tied to transmission infrastructure, circuit breaks, and
the need to call on expensive plant to ensure supply meets demand.
Uplift costs have risen sharply since the pool was set up in 1990, from
Pounds 260m in 1990-91 to an estimated Pounds 580m last year.
PowerGen, the generating company, estimates that the overall cost of uplift
in 1994-95 will show a reduction of about 5 per cent on 1993-94 as a result
of yesterday's deal.
Other industry estimates put the figure higher. Some said that up to Pounds
80m could be saved if National Grid were to maximise the earnings available
to it under the deal.
National Grid said yesterday that it was confident it could drive costs
down. Under the arrangements it has agreed a target for uplift costs of
Pounds 570m in 1994-95.
It will receive 30 per cent of any savings below this threshold to a cap of
Pounds 25m. It will be responsible for 20 per cent of excess costs over a
figure of Pounds 587m although losses will be restricted to Pounds 15m.
PowerGen said high levels of uplift in the first half of 1993-94 adversely
affected its margins. The incentives to control and reduce uplift would
benefit the company and its customers.
National Power, the other large generator, said it did not expect the scheme
to have any significant impact on its prospective profits in 1994-95.

FT  08 APR 94 / Court action on Polly Peck administrators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The administrators of Polly Peck International - accountants Mr Richard
Stone, Mr Michael Jordan and Mr Christopher Morris - were yesterday served
papers by the Turkish public prosecutor's office alleging improper behaviour
over a Dollars 96,000 payment made by a PPI subsidiary.
The public prosecutor's office said the case had been transferred to the
criminal court where it is expected to be heard in two months. Mr Stone and
Mr Jordan work for Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Mr Morris for Touche Ross.
The move by the Turkish prosecutor prompted strong protests from other
Coopers partners involved in the administration. They insisted the move was
simply part of the 'ongoing harassment' by Mr Asil Nadir, the former Polly
Peck chairman, in an effort to obstruct their efforts to act in the
interests of creditors.
Mr Chris Barlow, a Coopers insolvency partner, said: 'The idea that this
will stop us is ludicrous.'
The payment concerned was made by AN Graphics, a PPI subsidiary, to PPI
Holdings BV, an intermediate holding company within the group. The papers
served on the administrators allege it was improper and a breach of
fiduciary duty.
Coopers yesterday said the payment had been legitimately carried out under
Turkish law. 'This action has been initiated by Asil Nadir in order to
create further difficulties and delay the progress of the administration,'
it said.
'The Istanbul public prosecutors office fully investigated the same
complaint 14 months ago and subsequently held that no further action was
necessary.'
Coopers said the move had taken place at the same time as the administrators
had won an appeal in Ankara to take control of AN Graphics - a move opposed
by Mr Nadir.

FT  08 APR 94 / Average earnings rise by 3.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The upward shift in the annual increase in average earnings across the
economy to 3.6 per cent in January disguises wide sectoral variations from
 2.1 per cent in agriculture and forestry to 9.3 per cent in coal and coke,
Incomes Data Services, the pay analysis group, says today.
The sharp increases in coal and coke are because those left in the industry
are in the most productive pits with the highest earnings.
Earnings in services rose by 3.2 per cent, less than manufacturing at 4.7
per cent.
But within the service sector, pay in banking and finance rose by 5.6 per
cent, well above education and health services with 1.2 per cent, and hotels
and catering with 0.9 per cent.
Within manufacturing, the highest increase was recorded in motor vehicles
and parts, at 6.9 per cent - just ahead of metal goods at 6.4 per cent.
The modest overall increase in average earnings - from 3.1 per cent in
December to 3.6 per cent in January - was the first reversal of the steady
downward trend of the past three years.
The IDS report also shows that about half of the 4.7m women working
part-time in Britain pay no income tax or National Insurance. The Department
of Employment estimates that in April 1993 there were 2.6m women employees
earning less than the PAYE threshold of Pounds 66.25 a week. Of these, 2.3m
earned below the National Insurance lower limit of Pounds 56 a week.
IDS comments: 'If most of the new jobs in Britain give earnings below these
thresholds it is not good news for the chancellor.'

FT  08 APR 94 / Bidders attracted to Scots pits sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two companies yesterday announced the formation of a joint venture to bid
for the Scottish region of British Coal in a move which strengthens the
industry's belief that the corporation's assets north of the border may be
its most attractive.
Miller Group, a construction and mining company, and Ryan Group, a coal
producer, said their company Scotcoal would bid formally for the Scottish
region after publication in June by the government of information on British
Coal.
Several other companies have formed a consortium, Mining (Scotland), also
with the intention of making a bid. Mr David Cawthra, Miller chief
executive, said both Miller and Ryan saw Scotland as the main opportunity in
the privatisation of British Coal.
Mr Crispian Hotson, Ryan chief executive, said that unlike other areas of
the UK, demand for coal in Scot-land was growing, from 4.5m tonnes this year
to an estimated 7.5m in 1998. This was partly because of the strengthening
of the electricity interconnector between England and Scotland which will
enable the Scottish power companies to export south of the border.
Mr Hotson said he was also interested in Scottish coal because of its low
sulphur content and the extensive reserves at Longannet, the country's last
deep mine in operation.
Longannet produces coal at about Pounds 1.40 a gigajoule, the joint venture
estimates, against sale prices in contracts with Scottish Power and
Hydro-Electric of Pounds 1.50 falling to Pounds 1.30 in four years.
Ryan is also considering a bid for British Coal's north-east region in
association with Alcan, the north American aluminium company.
Mr Cawthra said Ryan and Miller had assets of about Pounds 100m. The two
companies currently mine more than 2.5m tonnes of coal a year in Scotland,
representing more than 40 per cent of British Coal's Scottish production.
The Scottish region is one of five being sold. Sales are expected to be
effected by early next year.

FT  08 APR 94 / BNP intends to build on poll win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The far-right British National party, which won its first local authority
seat in a by-election at Tower Hamlets in September, will contest eight
seats in the east London borough in next month's council elections.
Tower Hamlets has the most decentralised structure of any local authority in
Britain - it is divided into seven largely autonomous neighbourhoods. BNP
candidates are concentrated in two of the seven - Isle of Dogs and Globe
Town.
The party's September by-election success was in the Isle of Dogs, where it
appears to have successfully exploited concerns about housing among the
predominantly white population. BNP activists have campaigned hard in the
area to consolidate their position.
The divisions and recriminations in the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties,
which hold all other seats on the council, are illustrated in yesterday's
nominations.
Mr James Hunt, the Labour by-election candidate who resigned from the party
after losing the seat to the BNP, is standing in the Isle of Dogs as an
independent.
Mr Jeremy Shaw, who resigned from the Liberal Democrats during an inquiry by
the national party which found that some Tower Hamlets' Liberal Democrat
leaflets had pandered to racism, is one of several independent Liberals
standing against official Liberal Democrat candidates.
At Westminster Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat campaign chairman,
acknowledged that the independent Liberal Democrats might split the party's
vote in Tower Hamlets, David Owen writes. But he predicted the party would
keep control of the council.
If people did not agree with the way the party had handled things, they
should leave it, Mr Taylor said.
The 'overriding priority' in Tower Hamlets must be to stop the BNP from
getting elected, he added.

Promoters of a planned Dollars 280m (Pounds 190m) privately owned Indian
power station yesterday announced the approval of bank loans for the
project, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi.
They said it was the first new private sector electricity generating project
to secure full financial support.
GVK Industries, a diversified chemicals and property company, said that
construction would start in June on the 235MW project at Jegurupadu in
Andhra Pradesh.
The company is developing the scheme in partnership with ABB, the European
engineering combine, CMS Group, a US energy utilities company, and the
Andhra Pradesh state electricity board. The Asian Development Bank and the
International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, are also taking
equity stakes.
Other private sector schemes at an advanced stage of preparation include
plans by Enron, a US energy group, to build a Dollars 900m 695MW station at
Dhabhol in Maharashtra state, a 420MW scheme for Orissa, promoted by AES,
another US generating group, and plans for a 1,000MW plant at Vizag in
Andhra Pradesh sponsored by National Power of the UK and the Hindujas, a
London-based Indian business family.

over dumping rules

<TEXT>
US companies were assured yesterday that measures negotiated in the Uruguay
Round global trade accord are adequate to deal with dumping.
Mr Jeffrey Garten, US Commerce Department undersecretary, said yesterday
that the multilateral dispute settlement system would uphold 'well founded'
US dumping decisions, while ensuring protection for US exporters from unfair
dumping regimes abroad.
The support of companies is vital if the Uruguay Round pact is to win
approval in Congress, so Mr Garten, whose responsibilities encompass both
the promotion of US exports abroad and the administration of US anti-dumping
trade laws at home, sought to reassure them that he is 'an ardent supporter
of vigorous enforcement' of the US anti-dumping regime.
In a speech to the US Chamber of Commerce, he said the Clinton
administration supported 'the reasonable concerns of our exporters' about
the growing number of foreign dumping regimes. These would be disciplined
under the new World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
'We are drafting implementing language in such a way as to guarantee that
our laws are consistent with the letter and spirit of the Gatt Uruguay Round
agreement,' he said. 'We will be reviewing other countries' laws for
consistency with the agreement.'
Controversy has surrounded the US dumping regime as large exporters find
themselves increasingly under siege from 'copycat' anti-dumping laws abroad.
At the same time, many US companies see the regime as the last defence
against cheap imports.
There is pressure for more protective language in the Uruguay Round
implementing legislation, which must be approved by Congress. The
Labour/Industry Coalition for Trade (LICIT) claimed last month in a report
that while Gatt panels reviewing national anti-dumping laws 'are instructed
to defer to reasonable findings of fact and law of national bodies, it is
unclear that there is any way to ensure that they will'.
The report said the US failed to achieve a key objective in the Round:
strengthening international rules relating to anti-dumping. 'In many cases,
dumping margins can be expected to decline under the new rules. However, the
anti-dumping laws will remain usable by US industries - provided the
implementing legislation strengthens US law to the extent permitted under
the new agreement.'

A list of countries which the Clinton administration considers eligible for
free trade agreements with the US will be presented to Congress in the
summer.
Mr Jeffrey Garten, Commerce Department undersecretary, said yesterday that a
country's eligibility would depend on factors such as economic reform,
openness to imports, and protection for intellectual property rights.
He drew distinctions between such countries and those suitable to join the
North American Free Trade Agreement - requiring approval by both Canada and
Mexico. Chile's prospects were brightest, he said, and Argentina 'will merit
consideration in the very near future'.
On a recent trip to Latin America, Mr Garten stressed that free trade
throughout the Americas was still the Administration's ultimate goal. In the
meantime, the US was committed to a process of integration which was as
inclusive as possible, transparent - 'to encourage reformers' - and designed
to open trade, not to create exclusive blocs.

Thailand's largest cement and building materials conglomerate, Siam Cement,
has tentatively agreed to build a steel plant in a joint venture with Nippon
Steel and Mitsui &amp; Co of Japan, writes William Barnes in Bangkok.
The Dollars 580m (Pounds 395m) plant would supply up to 1m tonnes of
cold-rolled steel a year by 1997 to Japanese car-makers in Thailand and
south-east Asia's booming construction industries. Siam Cement is already
setting up a hot-rolled steel factory called Siam Yamato with Mitsui, Yamato
Kogyo and Sumitomo Corp.
Siam Cement and its prospective partners appear confident that Thailand's
Sahaviriya Steel Industry Co will not be able to make the government enforce
a 10-year protective ban on rival domestic competition for its new Dollars
504m hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel plant.
There is speculation the ban will have to be lifted shortly to comply with
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; at least one other group is
known to have asked for a steel-making licence.

FT  08 APR 94 / World Trade News: Modest recovery in E Europe foreseen - UN
body's report critical of western help in region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The countries of eastern Europe may experience a small economic recovery
this year after four years of slump, according to the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe. However, output in Russia and other parts of
the former Soviet Union is likely to continue to decline.
In its annual survey of developments in the region, the UN body says
aggregate output in eastern Europe could rise by a modest 1 per cent in
1994, the first year of growth since the collapse of the communist system in
1989.
Poland is expected to notch up another year of 4 per cent growth, with more
modest gains for Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and possibly Hungary. For
other countries in the region, the outlook is for continuing stagnation or
further falls in output.
The ECE believes total output in eastern Europe may have fallen by about 3
per cent last year, but this was less than half the 1992 rate of decline.
In Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States,
output plunged on average by some 13 per cent following a 20 per cent drop
in 1992. The depression has been greatly intensified by an additional 'trade
shock' caused by the collapse of trade between CIS members, the ECE says.
The UN body, which groups western and eastern European nations, the US and
Canada, has been consistently critical of the way western governments and
the main international financial institutions have handled assistance for
the process of transition from communist to market economies.
The latest report maintains that western help has been far less than either
expected or required, and western finance has flowed mainly to the most
successful countries with the highest incomes per head.
Private foreign direct investment into eastern Europe (excluding the CIS)
has amounted to less than Dollars 10bn since 1990, including flows of about
Dollars 3.5bn last year.
More than 90 per cent has gone to the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and
Poland, with 80 per cent going to the first two.
Official flows of assistance to eastern Europe totalled some Dollars 10.5bn
since 1990, the bulk of which has gone to the same four economies, it says.
Meanwhile, the CIS republics have attracted negligible amounts of private
investment and little official aid.
For the region as a whole, neither the volume nor the co-ordination of
international assistance 'has. . . been commensurate with the scale and
complexity of the problems to be overcome'.
Social hardship in the transition economies, including mounting
unemployment, continues to breed a dam-aging disillusionment with economic
reform, the survey adds.
The ECE calls for improved international co-ordination mechanisms to target
western assistance within coherent national programmes, combined with more
leeway for individual governments to follow political and economic
programmes for economic transformation that best suit their countries'
needs.

<TEXT>
Marubeni, the Japanese trading house, has agreed a wide-ranging tie-up with
a Chinese computer company to sell personal computers and other electronic
equipment in China and other parts of Asia.
The deal calls for Marubeni and the Legend Computer Group, one of the three
largest PC makers in China, jointly to develop, produce, market and service
personal computers, communications equipment and medical analysis systems.
Legend, based in Beijing, produces IBM-compatible PCs while Marubeni is the
second largest dealer of Apple PCs and the first in Apple software in Japan.
The Marubeni-Legend tie-up is a bold step by Marubeni to establish itself in
the Chinese market at an early stage.
The two will build up a sales network which will initially be based on
Legend's distribution network in Beijing, but which they hope to increase to
200-300 offices throughout China in three years' time.
The joint venture will begin by selling Apple's Macintosh desktop PCs, but
gradually expand their range to other PCs as well. The accord also calls for
the two to develop Chinese language software which could be marketed to the
large Chinese community in other parts of Asia.
In addition, Marubeni is also considering importing Legend's products into
Japan once they become more competitive.
Marubeni's move reflects growing Japanese interest in China's PC market,
which is expected to take off in the near future. Japanese trading houses in
particular are keen to play a role in this market by establishing
distribution networks.
US computer companies such as IBM, Compaq and Apple have moved quickly into
the Chinese market.
By contrast, Japanese computer manufacturers have been slow to take steps
into China, despite the advantage they have of sharing a written language
based on ideograms.
NEC, Japan's largest computer maker, sells workstations in China on an
individual contract basis and has joint ventures with Chinese companies in
pagers, optic fibre cable, semiconductors and telecoms equipment, but does
not sell PCs.
Toshiba says that it believes China is a promising market but has no plans
to set up an office there yet.
'Are we interested? Yes. But it's just now that the Chinese language systems
are coming out,' says Mr Mike Beirne at Fujitsu. 'There hasn't been a
market.'

<TEXT>
The promoters of a planned Dollars 280m privately owned Indian power station
yesterday announced the approval of bank loans for the project. They said it
was the first new private sector electricity generating project to secure
full financial support.
GVK Industries, a diversified chemicals and property company, said that
construction would start in June on the 235MW project at Jegurupadu in
Andhra Pradesh.
The company is developing the scheme in partnership with ABB, the European
engineering combine, CMS Group, a US energy utilities company, and the
Andhra Pradesh state electricity board. The Asian Development Bank and the
International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, are also taking
equity stakes.
The project follows two years of Indian government efforts to attract
private investment, including foreign capital, into the chronically
underfinanced electricity supply industry.
The government hopes the scheme will encourage the promoters of others. The
power ministry has received expressions of interest from 75 groups,
including 35 foreign companies, of which 22 were from the US, mainly from
generating companies.
However, only a handful have signed power purchase agreements - essential
pacts between the would-be generator and the customer, usually the state
electricity board.
Other private sector schemes at an advanced stage of preparation include
plans by Enron, a US energy group, to build a Dollars 900m 695MW station at
Dhabhol in Maharashtra state, a 420MW scheme for Orissa, promoted by AES,
another US generating group, and plans for a 1,000MW plant at Vizag in
Andhra Pradesh sponsored by National Power of the UK and the Hindujas, a
London-based Indian business family.

Israel yesterday sealed the occupied territories for an indefinite period,
banning Palestinians from entering Israel and East Jerusalem. Earlier, a
second Palestinian attack in 24 hours came - as Israel remembered 6m Jews
killed in the Nazi Holocaust.
Closure of the occupied territories cuts off tens of thousands of
Palestinians from their jobs. The move is intended to calm growing fears in
Israel that Islamic groups may carry out more attacks to avenge the massacre
of 29 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque in February.
In yesterday's attack, a Palestinian guerrilla of the Islamic Jihad group,
who lived in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, sprayed a bus stop with
gunfire at a busy intersection in the southern Israeli town of Ashdod. An
Israeli was killed and four wounded.
Extremist Islamic groups, now responsible for slaying eight Israelis in two
separate attacks, have warned they will step up their violent activities and
'continue in the path of blood and martyrdom'.
President Bill Clinton condemned the Palestinian attacks as 'acts of
terrorism' aimed at stopping the Middle East peace process.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation, in its first official comment, said
it regretted Wednesday's car bombing which left seven Israelis dead and
urged Israel to implement the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord as soon as
possible. But the US said last night it was not satisfied with the PLO's
reaction and expected Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO leader, to condemn the killings.
Despite intense domestic pressure Mr Yitzhak Rabin's government said it
would continue peace talks with the PLO in Cairo on Sunday, after observing
the annual Holocaust mem-orial day and the Jewish sabbath.
Hamas called on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza to stock food and
supplies for 'an atmosphere of real war which will engulf the Zionist
soldiers and enemy commanders in the coming days.' Hamas, which bitterly
opposes the Israeli-PLO peace agreement and wants to build an Islamic state
in the historic land of Palestine, said at least four more attacks were
being prepared.
Right-wing opposition leaders in Israel have demanded peace talks be
suspended and Mr Rabin resign.

FT  08 APR 94 / Israelis relive Holocaust fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
For many Israelis yesterday, the annual remembrance of the 6m Jewish victims
of the Nazi Holocaust had a special significance. Wednesday's killing of
seven Jews and the threat by the extremist Islamic Hamas movement to step up
'real war' against Zionists made the fears of some more real.
'It is a day we really feel the Holocaust is not the past but the present,
that it could be the destiny of this nation,' said Dr Ruth Firer, a
specialist in the teaching of the Holocaust in Israeli schools.
'Emotionally, every time violent events against Jews happen like this, all
our traumas and fears of survival come up.'
In a Holocaust memorial speech on Wednesday, President Ezer Weizman honoured
the victims of a suicide car-bomb in the northern Israeli town of Afula.
'Today, the eve of Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day, we paid a heavy
price because we are Jews, for our desire to live peaceful and independent
lives in the land of Israel. The historic cycle of blood continues.'
For two minutes at 10am yesterday, Israel came to an eerie standstill. At
the sound of sirens, drivers stopped their vehicles in the middle of the
streets, switched off their engines and got out of their cars. Along the
pavements Israelis halted, stood to attention and bowed their heads.
Nearly half a century after the end of the second world war, Jews remembered
the most psychologically powerful event in their history and the most
important driving force behind the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.
During the 24 hours' remembrance, government officials broke off peace talks
with Palestinians in Cairo to attend memorial events back home. Bars and
restaurants closed on Wednesday night. National and cable TV broadcast only
Holocaust films and documentaries.
For some Jews, the suffering of the Holocaust is a justification for the
Israeli repression of the Palestinians. 'If we had not had the Holocaust we
could not have thrown the Arabs out across the river to Jordan,' said Mr
Ronnie Iloz, a shopkeeper.
Others criticise the way right-wing politicians frequently exploit the
Holocaust and compare the Arabs to the Nazis in rhetoric depicting Jews as
victims surrounded by hostile forces.
'We have to be very careful not to let the Holocaust control our lives,
because we may lose our ability to change, to take risks and go through the
peace process,' said Dr Firer. 'We are now taking the biggest risk the
Jewish nation has taken in modern times, but politicians use the Holocaust
to terrify the people. We have to free ourselves from this trauma or we
won't be able to take this risk and go to the future with Arabs, hoping the
peace has a real chance.'
Global awareness of the Holocaust was lifted by the film 'Schindler's List',
which is playing to packed houses in Israel, and the opening last year of
the Holocaust museum in Washington has also raised the debate about the way
Jews see themselves.
Mr Eric Silver, an Israeli journalist and author, says: 'The Holocaust gives
a negative image of the Jew as a helpless victim and builds up Jewish
paranoia.'
The other question is whether the memories of Holocaust survivors are still
strong enough to be relevant. The recent release of Mr John Demjanjuk,
wrongly identified by several survivors as Ivan the Terrible of the
Treblinka death camp, raised calls in Israel to forget the past and may have
signalled the effective end of Nazi hunting.

A spate of murder and pillaging in Rwanda yesterday claimed the lives of Ms
Agathe Uwilingiyimana, the prime minister, and at least 11 Belgian United
Nations soldiers.
Rampaging troops are also alleged to have killed 17 Jesuit priests at a
religious centre, according to Radio France Internationale.
The murders follow the death on Wednesday night of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana,
president of the impoverished east African country, along with the president
of neighbouring Burundi. Rwandan diplomats claim the two men were
assassinated - their aircraft downed with rockets.
Fierce fighting was going on in the Rwandan capital of Kigali yesterday,
with the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) joining the fray and possibly
attempting to wrest power from the army.
UN officials said Rwanda's woman premier was abducted by presidential guards
shortly after she left her home in Kigali. The soldiers disarmed her UN
guards and in the confusion she escaped and took refuge in a UN compound.
The presidential guards broke into the compound and dragged her away. The UN
was later informed she was dead.
In Washington, President Clinton said Ms Uwilingiyamana had been 'sought out
and murdered' by Rwandan security forces.
A UN official said presidential guards earlier disarmed 13 Belgian
peacekeepers sent to investigate the presidents' crash at the airport. 'We
have now recovered 11 bodies. Two are still unaccounted for. They were dead
from bullet wounds. You can call it an execution,' the UN spokesman said.
It was not clear if the presidential guards were acting under orders from
some authority or were rogue elements. The Belgian troops were part of the
2,500-strong, 20-nation UN mission.
Three Rwandan cabinet ministers are believed to have been abducted, also by
the presidential guard, and Radio France Internationale said at least one
had been killed.
Gen Habyarimana and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi died as they
were flying back from regional peace talks in Tanzania. All on board their
aircraft were killed, reportedly including two Burundi ministers, five
senior Rwandan officials including the army chief of staff and the
aircraft's French crew.
For years both Rwanda and Burundi have seen brutal clashes between Hutu and
Tutsi ethnic groups.
The killing of the two presidents has immediately derailed Rwanda's
UN-sponsored peace process, already under strain.
A three-year civil war waged by the Tutsi-led RPF ended with a peace
agreement last year. But President Habyarimana, a Hutu, who took power in a
1973 coup, has caused some anger by delaying formation of a national
government under a power-sharing deal with the RPF.
Even before Gen Habyarimana's assassination, Rwanda was tense. Two
government ministers had been hacked to death. The bankrupt government was
weighed down by a drought and by an influx of 400,000 refugees from tribal
killings in Burundi.
Gen Habyarimana's death has left a power vacuum in Rwanda. Army troops,
presidential guards, gendarmes and rebels were all reported to be involved
in violence in Kigali.
In Nairobi, Mr Habi Mana, the Rwandan ambassador, blamed the death of the
two presidents on the rebel RPF. 'The plane was blown up by a Soviet-made
Sam-7 missile, which have been used by the RPF in the past,' he claimed.
'The Rwandese army has no Soviet military equipment.'
But the RPF denied it was involved in the attack. 'The plane was shot down
from the airport base, which is controlled by the gendarmerie. The area is
heavily guarded and totally out of bounds to the RPF,' Mr Paul Dusaidi of
RPF said in New York.
Diplomats believe Gen Habyarimana may have been the victim of a power
struggle between rival military factions.
Belgium, the former colonial power in both Burundi abnd Rwanda, said after
an emergency cabinet meeting last night it planned to protect its nationals
in Rwanda, but gave no details.
The UN Security Council last night denounced the violence in Rwanda, but
took no decision on whether to leave UN peacekeepers in place.

Mr Li told Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, that while French
business was welcome it must be more competitive. Mr Balladur's four-day
mission to China is aimed at opening a new chapter in relations after the
two sides agreed to put behind them a row over French arms sales to Taiwan.
But unlike a high-profile selling mission to China last November by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Mr Balladur's aims are more modest and
include refurbishing political relations between fellow permanent members of
the United Nations Security Council.
Mr Balladur's arrival in Beijing was overshadowed by a widening
international argument over China's detention of Mr Wei Jingsheng, its most
prominent dissident, for interrogation over alleged breaches of parole and
'new crimes'. The episode has provoked sharp exchanges between Beijing and
Washington and further complicated President Bill Clinton's decision, due in
the next few months, on renewal of China's low tariff access to US markets.
China yesterday firmly rebuffed US criticism over Mr Wei's detention with a
foreign ministry spokeswoman saying it was 'inappropriate for any foreign
country to make irresponsible remarks on this matter'. Earlier the State
Department said in Washington that 'the United States very much regrets
China has taken this step'.
Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, who is with Mr Balladur in
Beijing, in an interview with the French daily Liberation was sharply
critical of China's human rights behaviour. China's economic development, he
said, would eventually 'render the system of repression untenable'. He
described human rights progress since the June 1989 massacre of
pro-democracy activists as 'insufficient'.
French business had hoped Mr Balladur's mission would ease market access
after a recent chill prompted by a 1992 deal by the previous French
government to allow sale of 60 Mirage fighters to Taiwan.

A spate of murder and pillaging in Rwanda yesterday claimed the lives of Ms
Agathe Uwilingiyimana, the prime minister, as well as three Belgians acting
as military observers for the United Nations.
The murders follow the assassination on Wednesday night of Gen Juvenal
Habyarimana, president of the impoverished east African country.
A UN official in the capital Kigali said the premier was killed near the
presidential palace.
UN headquarters in New York said a number of other observers in the UN
Assistance Mission to Rwanda (Unamir) were missing.
Gen Habyarimana and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of neighbouring Burundi
were both killed when their aircraft was shot down as it was preparing to
land in Kigali. The presidents were flying back from regional peace talks in
Tanzania.
Two other Burundi ministers, five senior Rwandan officials including the
army chief of staff and the French crew of the presidential jet were also
believed to have died on the aircraft.
The killings have derailed Rwanda's UN-sponsored peace process, already
under severe strain. A three-year civil war waged by the rebel Rwandan
Patriotic Front (RPF) ended with a peace agreement last year. But the
president, who took power in a 1973 coup, had angered much of the population
by delaying the formation of a national government which included a
power-sharing agreement with the RPF.
Even before Gen Habyarimana's assassination, Rwanda was tense. Two
government ministers had been hacked to death. The bankrupt government was
weighed down by a drought and 400,000 refugees from tribal killings in
neighbouring Burundi.
Gen Habyarimana's death has left a power vacuum in Rwanda. Army troops,
presidential guards and gendarmes were yesterday reported to have gone on
the rampage in Kigali. Residents said they could hear sporadic gunfire and
mortar bombs exploding.
The UN headquarters in Kigali was reported to have come under mortar fire.
The world body has 2,500 UN peacekeepers stationed in Rwanda. The turmoil in
Rwanda has spelled another blow to the beleaguered UN peacekeeping missions
in Africa.
In Nairobi Mr Habi Mana, the Rwandan ambassador, blamed the killings on the
rebel RPF. 'The plane was blown up by a Soviet-made Sam-7 missile, which
have been used by the RPF in the past. The Rwandese army has no Soviet
military equipment,' he said.
The RPF denied it was involved in the attack. 'The plane was shot down from
the airport base, which is controlled by the gendarmerie. The area is
heavily guarded and totally out of bounds to the RPF,' Mr Paul Dusaidi of
RPF said in New York.
Diplomats believe Gen Habyarimana was the victim of a power struggle between
rival military forces.
Burundi was reported quiet yesterday, despite the loss of its second
president from the Hutu tribe in less than six months. President Ntaryamira
had been appointed in January to replace Mr Melchior Ndadaye, Burundi's
first democratically elected president, who was murdered after less than 100
days in office.
Mr Ndadaye's assassination by Tutsi paratroops triggered a bloodbath in
Burundi. In Rwanda, the killing of a Hutu president was used as an excuse to
delay the country's slow march to democracy. President Habyarimana, also a
Hutu, feared sharing power with the Tutsi-led RPF.

The building of tension on the Korean peninsula and the possibility that
North Korea is developing nuclear weapons have stirred deep private concerns
in Japan that are masked by a public calm.
Reports of a North Korean warning that if the country had a nuclear weapon,
it would be aimed at Japan rather than at South Korea or the US, have
produced either silence or cryptic responses from Japanese government
officials and the media.
Reasons for the uneasy silence are the sensitivities towards a large Korean
community in Japan and a reliance on the protective shield of US forces that
makes it difficult for many Japanese to discuss openly the possibility of a
military crisis on their doorstep.
'It is a very sensitive issue,' Ms Mayumi Moriyama, member of Japan's upper
house and a former chief cabinet secretary, said earlier this week. 'As we
are much closer and have a very close relationship with them, it's very
difficult to discuss it openly.'
Bureaucrats and politicians alike have been reticent on the subject. The
report that North Korea's ambassador to India had stated his country's
weapons would be aimed at Japan produced the response that the foreign
ministry was trying to confirm the comments.
'We are taking the matter very seriously but we do not want unwittingly to
arouse the emotional temperature by making comments,' one official said - a
standard line by foreign ministry officials. Officials are avoiding comments
that could be interpreted by North Korea as Japanese aggression or that
could upset Korean residents in Japan.
North Korean officials claim that they suspect Japan's nuclear motives, but
Pyongyang has refused to allow full inspections of its nuclear sites,
prompting international concern that it is developing nuclear weapons.
The lack of official Japanese comment has meant that fears of developments
on the Korean peninsula and to what extent the country is prepared for the
worst have been fed largely on speculation, educated or otherwise.
Japanese newspapers have reported this week that an unnamed government
official had commented cryptically on the need to review Japan's defence
programme in the light of the North Korean situation.

Israel sealed off the occupied territories for an indefinite period
yesterday, banning all Palestinians from entering Israel and East Jerusalem
after a second Palestinian attack in 24 hours came as the country remembered
6m Jews killed in the Nazi Holocaust.
The move cuts tens of thousands of Palestinians from their jobs and followed
a warning by extremist Islamic groups, responsible for slaying eight
Israelis in two separate attacks, that they would step up their violent
activities and 'continue in the path of blood and martyrdom'.
President Bill Clinton condemned the Palestinian attacks as 'acts of
terrorism' aimed at stopping the Middle East peace process. The Palestine
Liberation Organisation, in its first official comment said it regretted
Wednesday's car bombing which left seven Israelis dead and urged Israel to
implement the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord as soon as possible.
Despite intense domestic pressure the government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime
minister, said it would continue peace talks with the PLO in Cairo on Sunday
after observing the annual Holocaust memorial day and the Jewish sabbath.
Israel's closure of the occupied territories was intended to calm public
fears of more bloody attacks by Islamic groups seeking revenge for the
February massacre of 29 Arabs by a Jewish settler in Hebron.
In the southern Israeli town of Ashdod, a Palestinian guerrilla of the
Islamic Jihad group, who lived in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip,
yesterday sprayed a bus stop at a busy intersection with gunfire, killing an
Israeli and wounding four.
Hamas called on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza yesterday to stock up
on food and supplies and prepare for 'an atmosphere of real war which will
engulf the Zionist soldiers and enemy commanders in the coming days.' Hamas,
which bitterly opposes the Israeli-PLO peace agreement and wants to build an
Islamic state in all the historical land of Palestine, said at least four
more attacks were being prepared.
In Israel, right-wing opposition leaders have called for a suspension of the
peace talks and the resignation of Mr Rabin.

Prospects for a negotiated resolution of South Africa's political crisis
receded last night after the African National Congress called for withdrawal
of the powers of the KwaZulu 'homeland' government.
There were signs of a further clampdown yesterday when troops of the
newly-formed National Peacekeeping Force were deployed for the first time in
townships near Johannesburg. A BBC correspondent saw 40 of the distinctive
light blue vehicles of the force move into east Rand townships.
The force was formed two months ago by integrating elements of the South
African Defence Force, the ANC's armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), and the
armies of black homelands, and has been plagued by ill discipline. MK
members are to start assembling next week for integration into the new South
African armed forces, said Mr Siphiwe Nyanda, MK chief of staff.
The ANC said it would 'not surrender to attempts to blackmail the people of
South Africa into accepting postponement of the elections through the
creation of a climate of rising violence and terror.'
The statement will do little to improve the mood at today's meeting between
President FW de Klerk, ANC leader Mr Nelson Mandela, Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.

FT  08 APR 94 / Indochina's 'golden gate' reaches the outside world: New
bridge is a powerful symbol of the region's reintegration into south-east
Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To call the new bridge across the Mekong River 'the golden gate to
Indochina', as does General Chatichai Choonhavan, Thailand's former prime
minister, is a pardonable exaggeration.
The 'Friendship Bridge' across 600m of muddy water between Thailand and Laos
is an unremarkable concrete structure, but the ceremonial opening of the
bridge today is a powerful symbol of Indochina's reintegration into
south-east Asia.
Built with Australian aid at a cost of Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.2m), the
bridge is the first to span the 2,400km-long stretch of river between the
Chinese border and the Mekong Delta of southern Vietnam. It is unlikely to
be the last.
A region once notorious for wars, opium-growing and poverty is now eagerly
developing trade, industry and tourism as it races to catch up with the
other fast-growing economies of Asia.
The bridge linking Vientiane, the capital of landlocked Laos, to the
northern Thai town of Nong Khai is only the most visible aspect of this
process. Roads, ports, airports and railways are being improved, and it
becomes easier by the month to travel in the three countries of Indochina -
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos - and move between them and their Asian
neighbours.
'It's a regional bridge,' said Mr Michael Mann, Australian ambassador to
Laos, during a recent visit to the new bridge. 'It links Singapore to
Beijing. . .I believe that in ten years' time you'll think nothing of
sending a package by trucking company from Kunming (capital of the
south-western Chinese province of Yunnan) to Kuala Lumpur.'
A bridge across the Mekong near Vientiane was mooted in the 1950s, and the
Japanese made the first detailed plans in the 1960s, but the wars between
Indochina's commun-ists and the US and its allies made such projects
impossible, particularly since the US was using Thailand as a base during
the fighting.
Communist victories in 1975 did not bring lasting peace to Indochina. In
Cambodia, the extremist Khmer Rouge murdered and starved to death an
estimated 1m people, provoking the Vietnamese to invade the country in 1978
to install a new government.
Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed government then had to prosecute a war against
Khmer Rouge and royalist guerrillas along the Thai border. Laos, meanwhile,
was isolated and forgotten, although rebels based in Thailand continued to
harass the communist regime. As recently as 1988, Thailand and Laos fought
each other in a border dispute in which hundreds of soldiers were reported
killed.
It was only from 1986 onwards that the communist governments of Vietnam and
Laos began to reform their economies along free-market lines.
In 1989 Gen Chatichai, who was then prime minister, adopted his policy of
transforming Indochina 'from a battle field into a market place'.
Construction of the bridge began in 1991, a month after the signing of the
Paris accords that outlined a peace settlement for Cambodia.
Since then, Vietnam and its much smaller neighbour Laos have attracted
billions of dollars in foreign investment applications and seen their
economies grow at about 8 per cent a year.
The US has allowed the International Monetary Fund and other multi-lateral
organisations to assist Vietnam, and in February Washington finally lifted
the US trade embargo against Hanoi that dated back to the Vietnam war.
Cambodia remains the odd man out in Indochina. The United Nations
successfully organised an election last year and a coalition government took
power, but the Khmer Rouge leaders reneged on their agreement to participate
and are still fighting the authorities from their jungle strongholds along
the Thai frontier. Foreign investors remain understandably cautious.
Yet even the much-feared Khmer Rouge guerrillas seem unable to resist the
wave of economic development sweeping across south-east Asia. Ignoring their
own leftist propaganda, they have enthusiastically embraced the free market.
They are stripping Cambodia of its assets and selling rubies and logs to
Thai traders; they have even sold the forests where they used to hide from
government troops. Last month, government forces captured the Khmer Rouge
headquarters at Pailin, some eight miles from Thailand.
Faint voices can be heard in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia warning of the
dangers of the kind of obsessive and uncontrolled pursuit of wealth which
has devastated Asia's natural environment, destroyed local cultures,
encouraged prostitution and corruption, and widened the gap between rich and
poor.
There are fears, for example, that property developers will ruin the
boulevards of Hanoi, now lined with elegant French colonial villas, and that
increased vehicle traffic generated by the bridge will disrupt the peaceful
atmosphere of Vientiane, where water buffalo graze in the town centre.
But neither Laos nor Vietnam nor Cambodia have much chance, or desire, to
avoid the juggernaut of Asian economic growth. The bridge is a symptom, not
a cause, of the increasing integration of Indochina with its neighbours. As
Radio Vientiane announced in a recent broadcast: 'Laos will finally have a
way to connect with the outside world.'

Australia is forecasting a fall in its unemployment rate to below 10 per
cent by the end of this year.
Mr Simon Crean, employment minister, made the prediction following the
release yesterday of official statistics showing unemployment rate dropping
to 10.3 per cent in March, the lowest monthly figure in two-and-a-half
years, from 10.6 per cent the previous month.
This is the seventh consecutive month Australia has recorded growth in
employment, with nearly 160,000 jobs created since August last year.
The release of the figures coincided with the publication of a report by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which says
that Australia's unemployment rate will remain at around 10 per cent for
another two years.
Mr Crean said OECD's view of Australian jobs was based on surveys conducted
in August last year when unemployment rate was above 11 per cent. The sharp
turnround in December made the report look too pessimistic.
The report recommends further labour market reform, suggesting that
Australia should 'make a decisive break with the award system', in which
wages are centrally negotiated between unions, employers and the federal
government. It also suggests that wages for youth, the long-term unemployed
and unskilled job seekers may be too high.
Market analysts are cautious about the jobless trend. The so-called
participation rate, which reflects the number of people actively seeking
jobs, has remained flat during the last three months. The rate is bound to
rise again as the economy recovers, thus getting the unemployment rate to
less than 10 per cent more diffi-cult.
While the OECD is not very optimistic about jobs, it predicts the Australian
economy will grow 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent through 1994 and 1995, with
only a slight rise in inflation. The economy registered 4 per cent growth in
1993.
The OECD also predicts a much-awaited recovery in business investment. It
rules out huge increases in current account deficits in the short term.

The confessed assassin of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential
candidate of Mexico's governing party, has claimed he acted alone and not as
part of a conspiracy, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
Mr Mario Aburto denied the special prosecutor's account that he conspired
with six other men to assassinate Mr Colosio at a Tijuana campaign rally
last month. He said he did not know the other men charged with the murder,
according to testimony released by lawyers.
Mr Aburto's statement adds to pressure on the special prosecutor to release
more evidence implicating the other six suspects.
An official familiar with the investigations said Mr Aburto's statements did
not surprise the prosecutors, and that under the circumstances it was
expected that Mr Aburto would keep silent.
The prosecutor's conclusion that Mr Colosio was the victim of an organised
plot has led to wild speculation over who may have ordered his killing.
Press speculation has centred on members of Mr Colosio's own party, drug
traffickers, or unknown political groups.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund has sharply raised its growth forecast for
the US economy this year amid gathering signs of US economic strength,
according to international monetary sources, Reuter reports from Washington.
But the Fund, in a draft version of its semi-annual World Economic Outlook,
has cut its growth forecasts for most other big industrial nations, as
Japanese and continental European economies have been slow to revive.
The sources, who declined to be named, said the IMF now expects the US
economy to show growth of some 3.8 per cent this year. That compares with
the 2.6 per cent rate foreseen by the Fund just last September and well
above the official Clinton administration forecast of 3 per cent.
The new forecast partly reflects a surge in US growth late last year that
has carried over into 1994. The US economy soared 7 per cent in the final
quarter of last year, its fastest pace in nearly 10 years.
However, the IMF now expects the Japanese economy to grow by a meagre 0.7
per cent this year, instead of expanding by 2 per cent, as it forecast in
September. It believes that Japan may need to take further action to pump up
its economy.
The Fund has also reduced its growth forecasts for most European countries
in the Group of Seven, adding that some may need to cut interest rates
further to boost their economies.
The IMF now expects Germany's economy to expand by 0.8 per cent this year,
instead of by 1.2 per cent, Britain's by 2.5 per cent, rather than 2.8 per
cent, and Italy's by 1.1 per cent, instead of 1.7 per cent.
The growth forecast for France was left unchanged at 1.1 per cent, while
that for Canada was trimmed to 3.5 per cent from 3.8 per cent.
The forecasts, which are still subject to last minute revisions, are due to
be made public on April 20.

<TEXT>
The White House is exploring ways of nominating Senator George Mitchell to
the Supreme Court while retaining his services for the rest of the political
year as Senate majority leader, in a move likely to face political
opposition.
Mr Lloyd Cutler, the president's legal counsel, said this was 'legally
possible' but carefully added: 'Whether it would be politically possible, I
don't know.'
Justice Harry Blackmun, whose retirement was announced on Wednesday, is
willing to stay on until the end of September, when the current Court term
expires, or until a replacement is installed. Senator Mitchell last month
said he would not seek re-election to the Senate in November.
One option is to nominate Mr Mitchell, an indispensable congressional
manager of the administration's domestic agenda, but to delay a confirmation
vote by the full Senate until the last days of the legislative session in
October. Another is to push through his confirmation earlier but for him to
delay taking the oath of office as a Justice until after the autumn recess.
An early warning of the arguments against such a move came in a New York
Times editorial yesterday, which sniffed that 'a delayed appointment. . .
suggests that the Court has a lower priority than the partisan needs of the
White House.'
It took President Bill Clinton nearly three painful months last year to come
forward with the nomination of Mrs Ruth Bader Ginsburg to fill the previous
Court vacancy. He is committed to a speedier process this time.
Mr Mitchell, who said he would consider any offer to serve on the Court,
should have few problems winning the endorsement of his colleagues, though
the right wing will rake over his record. Though a lawyer by profession and
a former federal judge, he would be the first practising politician to sit
on the bench since the retirement in 1969 of former Chief Justice Earl
Warren, who was previously governor of California.
The potential political problems of his nomination, however, means that
other candidates are under active consideration. Mr Bruce Babbitt quickly
withdrew, saying he wanted to remain as secretary of the interior, but Judge
Jose Cabranes from Connecticut and Mr Drew Days, now the solicitor general,
have emerged as leading alternatives.
Both have excellent legal reputations and both would add the ethnic
diversity to the Court that Mr Clinton has pursued in other appointments.
Judge Cabranes is of Hispanic origin, hitherto unrepresented on the highest
bench, while Mr Days, previously law professor at Yale, is black and would
balance the conservative judicial opinions of Justice Clarence Thomas.
A third female Justice also remains a possibility, to join Justices Ginsburg
and Sandra Day O'Connor. The New York Times editorial yesterday particularly
commended Ms Judith Kaye, chief New York State judge.

FT  08 APR 94 / Menem set for second term in Argentina: Sunday's poll is
likely to pave way for necessary change in country's constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina's President Carlos Menem is set to be the main beneficiary of next
Sunday's elections for a constituent assembly to rewrite the country's 1853
constitution. The principal item on that assembly's agenda is to eliminate a
clause forbidding incumbent presidents succeeding themselves.
A decisive victory for Mr Menem's Peronist party on Sunday will virtually
ensure he fulfils his overriding ambition - winning a second term as
president. Polls predict the Peronists will take 43-45 per cent of the vote,
crushing the main Radical opposition party, which is expected to get 24-26
per cent.
The outline of the proposed new constitution is already clear. The two
parties agreed the main elements in in Congress last December and limited
the assembly's deliberations but barring amendments not mentioned in the
resolution.
In addition to allowing the re-election of the incumbent president, the term
of office is to be reduced from the present six to four years. If Mr Menem
wins next year's presidential elections, which looks certain at the moment,
he will govern Argentina until 1999, when he will be 69.
In other reforms, part of the president's duties will be carried out by a
cabinet chief, a sort of prime minister who can be removed by Congress with
a simple majority vote. The opposition hopes this will reduce the
president's powers, but Mr Menem has warned he will not cede significant
powers.
The 48-member Senate will be increased by half and the 24 new seats
allocated to the opposition.
The president's right to rule by decree will be restricted. He will be
forbidden from issuing them on tax, criminal law or electoral issues.
A council of jurists will select judges and oversee management of the
judiciary. At present, judges are selected by the executive and approved by
the Senate.
The supreme court is responsible for the management of the judiciary. This
is intended to strengthen the court's independence.
The opposition will appoint the head of the national audit bureau, which
monitors government spending, and it will be subordinated to Congress. The
current, toothless audit bureau is part of the executive.
The constitutional reform is a triumph for Mr Menem's formidable political
skills. He needed the backing of his old rival, Mr Raul Alfonsn, the former
president and now Radical leader, to win the two-thirds majority vote in
Congress to start the reform process.
He achieved this by threatening to call a plebiscite last November. Mr
Alfonsn feared defeat would destroy the Radicals and divide the country. He
decided to open secret negotiations with Mr Menem but demanded, and won, a
purge of supreme court justices as a gesture of good faith.
Mr Menem has a positive poll rating of 47 per cent, despite growing economic
hardship and widespread disgust at government corruption. Argentina has a
tradition of strong leaders and voters see no alternative to Mr Menem.
Furthermore, they are content to see a successful government continue in
office. However, the elections have aroused scant interest. Pollsters are
predicting the lowest voter turnout since the 1930s.
Mr Menem has become Argentina's strongest leader since Juan Peron was
president in 1946-55. He has amassed greater personal power than the nine
generals who ran the country intermittently between Peron's fall and the
return of civilian rule in 1983.
However, Mr Menem owes much of his popularity to the successful
market-oriented policies if his economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo. The
Radicals' ineptitude and the strong Peronist party machine have also helped
him.
The new constitution promises a continuation of 'Menemismo', rather than the
creation of strong, independent institutions Argentina needs to consolidate
its economic reforms.
'In the short and medium term there will be no change in the accumulation of
power in Menem,' says Mr Rosendo Fraga, a political analyst. Key amendments,
such as reform of the judiciary, require passage of enabling legislation
through Congress, which is controlled by the government, he points out.

FT  08 APR 94 / Mexican says he acted alone in assassination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The confessed assassin of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential
candidate of Mexico's governing party, has claimed he acted alone and not as
part of a conspiracy.
Mr Mario Aburto denied the special prosecutor's account that he conspired
with six other men to assassinate Mr Colosio at a Tijuana campaign rally
last month. He said he did not know the other men charged with the murder,
according to testimony released by lawyers.
Mr Aburto's statement adds to pressure on the special prosecutor to release
more evidence implicating the other six suspects, and to find the people who
hired them.
So far the authorities have largely based their suspicions on a video and
photographs that appear to show the suspects helping Mr Aburto gain access
to Mr Colosio, witnesses who saw the suspects talking together before the
crime, and some inconsistencies in their testimonies.
An official familiar with the investigations said Mr Aburto's statements did
not surprise the prosecutors, and that under the circumstances it was
expected that Mr Aburto would keep silent.
The prosecutor's conclusion that Mr Colosio was the victim of an organised
plot has led to wild speculation over who may have ordered his killing.
Press speculation has centred on members of Mr Colosio's own party, drug
traffickers, or unknown subversive political groups.
Three of the men charged by the Attorney-General's Office were hired by Mr
Rodolfo Rivapalacio, a local official of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, to control crowds at the campaign rally in Tijuana
where Mr Colosio was killed. Mr Rivapalacio has been charged with indirect
involvement in Mr Colosio's killing. A fifth man has been detained, and
authorities are looking for the sixth.

Strikers in Paris yesterday brought the metro, bus and suburban railway
systems to a virtual halt and caused massive traffic jams. The morning
rush-hour saw tailbacks totalling 230km, and hundreds trying to cram on to
the few trains running. Strikers were protesting against the planned
transfer of responsibility for the RATP metro/bus and SNCF suburban railway
systems from the central government, which subsidises them by FFr5bn a year,
to the Ile-de-France region, comprising Paris and the surrounding area.
Ile-de-France said yesterday there was no question of privatising the public
transport system, but workers fear it will introduce competitive tenders,
demand productivity increases and raise fares to replace the government
subsidy.

the union's fortunes and its relations with the Socialist government are at
a low ebb. A little-known unionist from Andalucia, Mr Candido Mendez,
appeared well placed to take over the leadership at the end of the union's
four-day congress on Sunday, as the chosen successor of the veteran Mr
Nicolas Redondo. However, Mr Mendez faces a challenge from the more
combative Mr Manuel Fernandez, head of the UGT's powerful metalworkers'

Poland's centre-left ruling coalition yesterday suffered a setback in a
political tug of war with President Lech Walesa when it failed to muster the
two-thirds majority needed to overrule the head of state's veto on a wage
control law. The coalition's trade union deputies, in an effort to see wage
rise limits eased, voted with the opposition Solidarity trade union against
the government. President Walesa has argued that the law, designed to
replace regulations limiting pay rises in state sector enterprises, would
enable the government to extend controls to the private sector. The
government will propose a modified wage law to parliament today to replace
the state sector regulations. In their absence, some 6,000 state enterprises
have the freedom to raise wages, but few are likely to do so since they lack
the funds.

German unemployment dipped below the psychological barrier of 4m in March,
boosting hopes that the west German economy is gradually emerging from
recession. Unadjusted unemployment in western Germany fell by 0.3 per cent,
from 2.74m to 2.64m, taking the unemployment rate to 8.5 per cent of the
labour force. In eastern Germany, unemployment fell by 0.5 per cent, from
1.3m to 1.26m, or 16.8 per cent of the workforce. Seasonally adjusted
unemployment in west Germany rose by 20,000 to 2.57m in March, but this was
a slower rate of increase than in March last year when seasonally adjusted
unemployment rose by 40,000 over the previous month. However, Mr Bernhard
Jagoda, the president of the Labour office, said the March fall in
unadjusted unemployment reflected 'the usual spring pick-up,' adding that
economists expected the jobless total to rise a further 400,000 by year end.

Italy's Northern League and the neo-fascist National Alliance - members of
the right-wing alliance which won last week's election - held a surprise
meeting yesterday to discuss federalism, the principal issue which divides
them. Senior League politicians said Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the
federalist League, and Mr Gianfranco Fini, secretary of the National
Alliance, had not talked about the post-election political crisis. Earlier
this week, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, leader of Forza Italia, the third member of
the victorious pact, suspended talks with his allies on forming a government
after seven days of squabbling. He will wait for Italy's president to name a
prime minister later this month before renewing negotiations.
The League said yesterday's meeting was a positive step, if only because the
National Alliance - which favours a more centralised state  - had agreed to
discuss federalism. Mr Fini, however, said federalism was only acceptable as
part of a presidential regime.

FT  08 APR 94 / Mitterrand and Balladur agree N-missile policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, appears to have struck a
compromise with President Francois Mitterrand on the country's future
nuclear weaponry that could head off the development of 'smart' atomic arms
and early resumption of nuclear testing, as many government backbenchers
have been demanding.
A meeting on Wednesday of France's defence council, called to finalise the
government's framework law on military spending over the 1995-2000 period,
decided that the entry into service of the planned long-range M5 nuclear
missile should be delayed from 2005 to 2010.
Mr Mitterrand has championed the M5 missile, France's version of the Trident
submarine missile with a range of nearly 8,000km, to maintain France's
traditional deterrent strategy of threatening any attacker with massive
retaliation. By contrast, a growing number of conservative backbenchers,
particularly from Mr Balladur's own Gaullist RPR party, fear the M5 will
swallow up resources which they believe would be better used in developing
smaller, more 'useable' weapons in the face of growing potential threats
from the third world. But, in return Mr Mitterrand seems to have won Mr
Balladur's agreement to prolong the life of France's land-based nuclear
deterrent with the launch of a study into how an interim missile - the
6,000km-range M45, which is to be fitted to new French nuclear submarines in
1996-97 - might be deployed early in the next century, when the life of the
existing S3 missiles runs out.
A traditionalist in nuclear strategy, Mr Mitterrand has always believed that
keeping land-based rockets in their silos on the Plateau d'Albion, a
sparsely-populated mountain area north-east of Avignon, is essential to
deterrence, because any attack on it would cause such damage that the
attacker would know he would face massive retaliation.
Mr Mitterrand faced down an attempt in 1986 by the previous conservative
government, led by Mr Balladur's party rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, to abandon
fixed land missiles in favour of mobile missiles, then in vogue in the US
and the former-Soviet Union.
This Mitterrand-Balladur compromise could reduce the need to resume
underground nuclear testing, which Mr Mitterrand put under a moratorium in
April 1992 in the face of opposition.

FT  08 APR 94 / Russian government in state of disarray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government is displaying disarray at the highest levels,
resulting in serious misunderstandings and even panic both within its own
ranks and abroad.
A disputed presidential order on the establishment of Russian bases in the
territories of the former Soviet states was yesterday the most recent of
three incidents within a month which demonstrate either great
disorganisation or malign meddling, or both, within the top administrative
structures of the state.
These were, in reverse order:
The official notification by Tass, the state news agency, of a decree said
to have been signed on Wednesday by President Boris Yeltsin, establishing 30
military bases in neighbouring states, including Latvia  - a decree whose
existence was denied yesterday by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister.
A statement on March 31 by Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the presidential press
secretary, that Mr Yeltsin would not be ready to sign the Nato-inspired
'Partnership for Peace' plan for six or seven months - which was flatly
denied the next day by Mr Kozyrev, saying it would be signed later this
month.
The publication last month of a 'coup plot' caused investigations of top
ministers and is supposed to be the subject of continuing investigations.
The disarray becomes more obvious as pressure increases on the Russian
president.
The Federation Council, or parliament's upper house, refused on Wednesday to
confirm the resignation of Mr Alexander Kazannik, who left his post as state
prosecutor in February in protest against pressure from Mr Yeltsin not to
agree to the freeing of those jailed for their part in the parliamentary
coup last October.
Mr Yeltsin says he will continue to regard Mr Alexei Ilyushenko as the
acting state procurator, while the upper house points to the clause in the
new constitution which gives it the right to appoint and release
prosecutors.
The confusion over the bases came when Tass put out a statement on Wednesday
that the president had signed a decree on the establishment of military
bases, including in Latvia. The Latvian government immediately went into
emergency session, and a statement saying that the decree was in 'sharp
contradiction' to agreements between Russia and the Baltic state was read
out on TV by Mr Georg Andreevs, the Latvian foreign minister.
Yesterday, Mr Kozyrev denied that the decree existed and likened it to the
coup plot. He said it was a 'provocation'.
However, Mr Kostikov said that the decree did exist, but that 'technical
problems' with its phrasing had given the wrong impression to the Latvians,
and that apologies had been made. He said the base referred to was Skrunda,
a radar installation which both sides have agreed will be rented by Russia.
A similar announcement was made by the defence ministry.
The issue of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltics is a highly
emotive one on both sides. The Estonian government yesterday accused Russian
negotiators of reneging on their word to withdraw troops from its territory
by August 31 - saying Russia had demanded that Estonia pay social security
to the ex-servicemen and provide houses for the returnees in Russia.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
French industrial production fell 0.2 per cent in January from December,
after falling 1 per cent in December from November, according to seasonally
adjusted data from the national statistics office, INSEE. However, output in
the building and public works sector, which is not included in the
industrial index, rose by 8 per cent in January from December, returning to
the levels seen before a sharp drop in December. Manufacturing output rose
1.2 per cent in January, while farm output fell 3.6 per cent and energy
output dropped 2.4 per cent. However, INSEE said some figures for output of
consumer and semi-finished goods had had to be estimated because of delays
in collecting data after a new survey questionnaire was introduced to bring
France into line with European norms.
West German industrial orders rose 3.1 per cent in February, from January,
and 3.2 per cent from a year earlier.
Russia produced 24.8m tonnes (5.85m barrels a day) of crude oil and gas
condensate in March, excluding the output of joint ventures, down 18 per
cent from 30.1m tonnes a year earlier, but 10 per cent up on the 22.3m
tonnes produced in February.
Denmark's GDP will grow 4 per cent this year in real terms, compared with 1
per cent last year, the Federation of Danish Industries forecast.

FT  08 APR 94 / Premier blamed for run on escudo

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's prime minister, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, was being blamed
yesterday for provoking an attack on the escudo by speculators. Analysts
said the speculation would either significantly weaken the currency or delay
economic recovery by forcing up interest rates.
Efforts by the Bank of Portugal to protect the escudo yesterday pushed up
overnight interbank money market rates to 100 per cent from about 10 per
cent before the currency crisis began 10 days earlier. Dealers warned the
turmoil on Portugal's foreign exchange and money markets was likely to
continue.
The central bank measures lifted the escudo to Es101.2 to the D-Mark
yesterday from a low of Es104.3 on March 30 but at the cost of threatening
the government's policy of cutting interests rates to help the economy move
out of recession.
'The monetary authorities are faced with a choice between allowing the
escudo to weaken or sacrificing their declared policy of lowering interest
rates to stimulate investment and economic growth,' said Mr Joaquim Gomes,
an analyst with Midas Corretora, a Lisbon broker.
Mr Cavaco Silva was widely blamed for triggering the attack on the escudo by
forecasting that inflation would fall to between 4.5 and 5 per cent in 1994,
from 6.3 per last year, and that the central bank's money market absorption
rate could be lowered 200 basis points to 7 per cent.
'The markets took the prime minister's forecast as a clear policy statement
on interest rates but found his inflation forecast over-optimistic,' said a
Lisbon-based foreign exchange dealer. 'Portuguese, Spanish and British banks
began to speculate massively over the prospect of a weaker escudo.'
The same perceived rift between a government apparently willing to sacrifice
the escudo to help kick-start the economy and a central bank firmly
committed to exchange-rate stability helped provoke two devaluations of the
escudo during the European currency crises of 1993.
Dealers said the central bank had also fuelled speculation by allowing the
escudo to become the weakest currency in the exchange rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System, when it had previously always maintained it above
the peseta.
The Bank of Portugal began defending the currency last week by spending
massively from its foreign currency reserves to buy escudos, taking the
unusual step of officially announcing its intervention. As a result, the
escudo began to recover against the D-Mark and the central bank changed its
tactics by increasing its money market intervention rates as banks sought to
move back into escudos.
The central bank has been injecting about Es400bn a day into the money
markets this week at rates of 13-14 per cent, compared with 10 per cent
previously - but only for banks constituting obligatory reserves.
Non-resident banks wanting to move back into escudos are being heavily
penalised by having to pay 40-100 per cent interest for funds on the
interbank market.
Mr Miguel Namaorado Rosa, chief economist with Banco Comercial Portugues,
forecast the escudo would shortly move back to its pre-crisis level of about
Es102.5 to the D-Mark and that short-term interest rates would also
gradually decrease to their previous level.
But although the escudo may recover, analysts agreed that by showing such
optimism over interest rates, the prime minister had ensured that no
reduction could now take place and had consequently damaged prospects for
recovery.

FT  08 APR 94 / Ukraine faces confusion after elections

Ukrainians return to the polls on Sunday for the final round of their first
post-Soviet parliamentary elections. Judging by the first round of voting
last month, turnout will be high despite the fact that precious little
clarity is likely to result from the effort.
The voting threatens to usher in a disorderly mix of opposing factions to
replace the old guard of red barons and factory bosses.
As in the first round, there will be sharp regional divisions between
roughly equal blocs of opposing western nationalists and eastern communists
and support for a large non-aligned, amorphous centre. The two most likely
results, according to a western diplomat in Kiev, are 'a leftist majority if
the independents ally with them, or you'll have a Poland with 35 different
parties and an absolutely incoherent picture'.
As no obvious coalitions have yet begun to form, the composition of the new
parliament could be a recipe for legislative deadlock on critical issues,
from nuclear weapons and market reforms to alignments with Russia and the
west. Of the 79 MPs who have already won their seats outright, their
political orientations break down into neat thirds: 27 Communists and
Socialist victors from Russian-oriented east Ukraine; 24 national-democrats
and market reformers from west Ukraine; and 28 non-aligned independents.
In choosing among the more than 700 candidates competing this weekend to
fill the 450-seat parliament, Ukrainians will be faced with very different
choices. In the west, nationalist-democrats, who strongly support Ukrainian
statehood as a part of Europe proper, are largely competing against each
other. The handful of ultra-nationalist contenders are more preoccupied with
creating a centralised, unified state for 'Ukrainians only' than with the
economy.
In the east and centre, communists, who would like to resurrect the old
Soviet Union, are running against pro-Russian centrists supporting economic
union of the Moscow-led Commonwealth of Independent States. In 12 districts
within the ailing coal mining region of Donetsk, communists are directly
competing against one another. The regionalisation of politics is a measure
of the lack of a national vision. 'There is no clear national consensus and
(President Leonid) Kravchuk has provided no leadership on this,' said the
western diplomat.
Nevertheless, the continued surprise of these elections has been the large
voter turnout. This has made it probably impossible for Mr Kravchuk to
declare the elections invalid and rule by presidential decree, as he has
said he wanted to.
After the parliament is elected, the main issue on the national agenda will
be whether early presidential elections will take place in June as agreed,
or if the unpopular Mr Kravchuk will be successful in his attempt to
postpone them and stay in power to 1996.

FT  08 APR 94 / Bosnian city divided by fear: Edward Mortimer and Laura
Silber report on Mostar's uneasy peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mehmet Muratovic shook with sobs as he walked from Moslem-held eastern
Mostar towards his four-year-old grandson whom he had not seen in nearly a
year although they had been separated only by a few streets of shattered
buildings.
It was 10 am yesterday in the no man's land separating the Moslem and
Croat-held parts of Mostar, the regional capital of southern
Bosnia-Hercegovina, which until six weeks ago had witnessed some of the most
ruthless fighting of the Bosnian war.
In May last year the Bosnian Croats, until then allied with the Moslem-led
Bosnian government against the Serbs, stepped up their drive to form their
own ethnically pure Croat state, of which Mostar was to be the capital.
But government forces dug in on the east bank of the River Neretva, and
managed to hold a strip of the city centre on the west bank, despite the
continuous Croat shelling which destroyed all of Mostar's bridges, including
the historic 16th century one which gave the city its name.
But thanks to the agreement, signed in Washington on March 1, the fighting
has now stopped. Yesterday's tearful reunion of 25 divided families, the
first of its kind, was a small step towards the federation which Moslem and
Croats have agreed, under strong US pressure, to establish. The Muratovics
were among carefully sifted residents of each side who were allowed a
two-hour meeting with relatives in a UN tent, encircled by barbed wire.
No man of military age could be included and no Bosnian citizen was allowed
actually to cross from one side to the other. Although under the agreement,
Moslems and Croats are now supposed to be allies and fellow citizens, the
Croat authorities insisted on these stringent rules.
Peering furtively from the ruins of an apartment block on the eastern side -
the nearest he was allowed - a Bosnian soldier gestured at his elderly
mother to hold back her tears. Until one month ago, Croat forces were still
rounding up Moslems living in western Mostar, firing on them as they were
expelled across frontlines. Possibly for fear of suffering a similar fate,
six western Mostar residents who had obtained permission for the visit
yesterday failed to show up, causing evident distress for their relatives
who waited for them in vain. Only those named on a pre-approved list were
allowed to take part in the visit. Even small children had to be subjected
to a careful body search by UN police.
The inhabitants of eastern Mostar looked thinner and wearier than their
relatives from the opposite bank. Owing to the Croat siege, the eastern side
has been without water and electricity since last summer. Restoring
utilities to the city is the most urgent task facing Mr Hans Koschnick, the
former mayor of the German port of Bremen, who has been name by the EU as
interim administrator of the city, an arrangement which is to last two years
under the terms of the Washington agreement. Mr Koschnick, a social
democrat, is expected to arrive on April 18.
Commander Esad Humo, who headed the defence of the mainly-Moslem eastern
bank, said the last time he stood at that devastated spot was a year ago,
when under enemy fire, he drove a lorry to form a frontline barrier. The
families had to make their way around the rusted remains of this lorry,
loaded with rubble from which thistles and spring flowers had now sprouted.
General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN forces in Bosnia, is due in Mostar
today - his first visit since he arrived in the country in January. 'It's
six weeks too late in my opinion,' said British brigadier Jerry Hulme, head
of the regional office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. But, he
added: 'I am looking forward to seeing how my old pupil is getting on,'
(Brig Hulme was formerly an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley).
Until now, Gen Rose has focused mainly on the conflict between Moslems and
Serbs, elsewhere in the country. Yesterday at Sarajevo airport, he tried
unsuccessfully to bring Serb and Moslem commanders together in peace talks
near Sarajevo. His peace effort there may yet prevent him from going to
Mostar.
Brigadier Hulme is concentrating on making the family reunions in Mostar a
daily occurrence. That will go on until the two sides feel confident enough
to restore free movement throughout the city, he said, as he walked back to
the east bank, across the mangled remains of a bridge installed a year ago
to replace one destroyed when the war erupted in 1992.

FT  08 APR 94 / Crimea confrontation looms closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tension is rising in Crimea, the Ukrainian region with a Russian majority.
The peninsula's president has sharply attacked Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the
Ukrainian president, and reports in Moscow speak of more Ukrainian troops
being moved into the area, writes John Lloyd.
Mr Yuri Meshkov, elected as head of the Crimean 'state' on a ticket of
closer union with Russia, said in a statement read on TV on Wednesday night
that 'Ukraine is being led by the most dangerous government . . . in
Europe'. An apparently well-sourced report in the Moscow daily, Sevodnya,
yesterday claimed that extra troops and intelligence officers were being
drafted in to bring the strength of Ukrainian divisions there to over
50,000.

FT  08 APR 94 / Barclaycard offers rebates to win business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclaycard is offering rebates of up to Pounds 150 to credit card holders
who transfer outstanding debts from other cards.
The move by Britain's largest credit card issuer illustrates the
increasingly fierce competition in the market. Barclaycard already accounts
for one-third of the 27m cards in issue in the UK.
Previously, only smaller credit card issuers - especially those trying to
break into the UK market - have offered rebates or lower interest rates on
balances transferred from another card.
Competition in the card market - where spending through credit and debit
cards totalled almost Pounds 50bn in 1993 - stepped up noticeably last
autumn when Vauxhall Motors, a subsidiary of General Motors, launched a
British version of the GM card available in the US. Just over 300,000 GM
Visa and Mastercards have been issued so far in the UK.
Ford then joined forces with Barclaycard to issue a branded card, in what
was seen as a direct response to the GM card. It became available from the
beginning of this month.
Only yesterday, another non-traditional competitor entered the market when
Texaco, the oil company, announced it would be issuing a Visa card jointly
with the Bank of Scotland.
In addition to the new entrants, financial institutions such as Save &amp;
Prosper have been trying to expand their existing small customer bases by
offering lower interest rates. Clearing bank issuers such as Barclaycard
have also lost some business to cards which do not charge an annual fee.
Barclaycard's rebate offer, promoted this week in a press advertising
campaign, credits a new or existing customer who transfers a balance from
another card with 5 per cent of the outstanding balance. The maximum rebate
is Pounds 150, which would be paid on transferred balances of Pounds 3,000
or more.
Mr Richard Reay-Smith, Barclaycard chief executive, said the cost of the
offer was not being subsidised by existing card holders, since it came from
within the recruitment budget. Cross-subsidy - the so-called 'free ride'
received by customers who pay off their bills each month - was one of the
factors cited by banks when they introduced annual fees.
The new Texaco Global Visa card will carry no annual fee for the first year.
In subsequent years the Pounds 10 charge will be waived if annual spending
exceeds Pounds 2,000. The Texaco card's annualised percentage rate of 20.5
per cent is in the lowest quartile for credit card interest rates.
Like many cards, including Barclaycard, the Texaco card will have an
incentive scheme based on the amount spent. Its use at a Texaco service
station will earn double points.
Mr Reay-Smith said Barclaycard had no plans to waive its annual fee of
Pounds 10, regardless of how much the card was used. He added Barclaycard
was not intending to reduce the APR of 20.7 per cent (or 21.9 per cent on
average spending when the annual fee is taken into account).

FT  08 APR 94 / Council tax bands for 2m homes may be wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two million properties in England and Wales may have been placed in the
wrong council tax band, the National Audit Office says today.
Its figures suggest that 10 per cent of households are paying the wrong
level of tax, with 900,000 homes overvalued, and 1.1m paying too little. The
figures are based on a survey of the real purchase prices of 12,000 banded
properties which changed hands about three years ago - the date on which
valuations were based.
The NAO figures appear to support the 914,000 claims to change bandings
which had been lodged by the formal deadline at the end of November. Only
261,000 cases had been settled by the end of February.
According to the report by Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and
auditor-general, the Valuation Office - an agency accountable to the
Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office - is aiming to have
cleared up 730,000 claims by the end of this year, 21 months after the
households concerned first started paying council tax. The remaining 184,000
properties will be dealt with 'as quickly as possible' in 1995, says the
report.
An incorrect banding can cost a household as much as Pounds 200 a year. The
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy says the average tax
for band G homes in England (valued between Pounds 160,000 and Pounds
320,000 in April 1991) is Pounds 967, while occupants of band H homes
(valued over Pounds 320,000) must pay Pounds 1,161.
Bandings are more accurate for cheaper houses, but mistakes at this level
can also be expensive for households. The difference in council tax between
bands C and D, the two most common bands covering houses valued between
Pounds 39,000 and Pounds 66,000, is Pounds 64 on average.
Sir John also found that competitive tendering for valuers' contracts had
saved the Valuation Office between Pounds 3.9m and Pounds 4.5m in England
alone.
The council tax was introduced in April last year to replace the community
charge, or poll tax. The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation, the
professional organisation for valuers, said mistakes had been made due to
the tight one-year schedule for setting bands. It said: 'The main priority
was to replace the poll tax as quickly as possible.'
In a separate development, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary,
yesterday confirmed that three Labour-controlled councils -
Langbaurgh-on-Tees, Sheffield, and Slough in Berkshire - will be required to
reduce their council tax levels by cutting budgets.

FT  08 APR 94 / Output rise signals strong recovery: Figures suggest
broad-based revival - Production growth brings inflation warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery in British industry strengthened decisively in February, as
robust manufacturing growth helped push overall production back above its
pre-recession levels.
The index of industrial production - which covers manufacturing and the
energy and water sectors - rose to 100.7 in February, its highest level
since a 102.1 peak in June 1990. In the three months to February the index
was 0.6 per cent higher than in the previous three months, and up 3.7 per
cent compared with the same period a year ago.
Buoyed by healthy performances from the engineering and food sectors,
manufacturing output rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent on the month,
well ahead of market expectations for a 0.4 per cent rise. This followed
January's increase of 1 per cent.
In the three months to February, output rose 0.8 per cent against the
previous three months, to stand 2 per cent up on the same period a year ago.
Signs of a clear revival in industry will hearten the government as new
taxes on individuals - most of them effective this month - threaten to slow
consumer spending, currently the strongest element of the economy.
The Treasury said yesterday's figures were 'entirely consistent' with
recovery across a broad front, and that it was particularly encouraged by a
pick-up in output of goods used for industrial investment.
According to calculations by the Central Statistical Office, manufacturing
output is now rising at an annualised rate of about 3 per cent.
But yesterday's news of accelerating output was accompanied by a warning on
inflation. A report from Income Data Services, a research company, said the
majority of pay rises this year were ahead of the current inflation rate of
2.4 per cent.
IDS said that 'a modest upward shift in pay settlements has been under way
since the start of the year' with some firms paying higher bonuses and
offering more overtime to staff.
On the London stock market, dealers took the view that the manufacturing
output figures reduced the chances for a further cut in interest rates.
However, a 2.5-point drop in the FT-SE 100 share index to 3,129.0 yesterday
reflected a general weakness in the US stock market rather than fears that
UK lending rates have reached their low point.
According to the figures, much of the recent strength in manufacturing is
due to higher output of investment goods rather than consumer goods.
Investment goods output rose 1.1 per cent in February after a 4.1 per cent
increase in January. In the three months to the end of February, it was 1.8
per cent up on the previous three months, boosted mainly by a sharp rise in
the output of electrical goods.
By contrast, consumer goods output rose 0.4 per cent in February, after a
0.1 per cent increase in January. It was up 0.6 per cent in the latest three
months, with a drop in car production offset by rises in output elsewhere.
Analysts said the official figures finally confirmed the optimism of recent
industrial trends surveys by the Confederation of British Industry and
others.

FT  08 APR 94 / European groups plan replacement jet for Concorde: Companies
seek aid for Pounds 10bn project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Europe's three leading aerospace groups are to join forces in a feasibility
study for a supersonic passenger aircraft to succeed the Anglo-French
Concorde.
British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France and Germany's Deutsche Aerospace
(Dasa) hope that their study will lead to the production of an aircraft for
the second half of the next decade.
They will be seeking cash aid from national governments and from Brussels
for the project, which is estimated to cost the makers as much as Dollars
15bn (Pounds 10.20bn) for a maximum demand of 1,000 aircraft. One company
said the project, the European Supersonic Research Programme (ESRP), needed
Dollars 100m a year in initial investment.
Two of the three companies, BAe and Aerospatiale, designed and built the
existing Concorde. While that project was loss-making and abandoned with
only a handful built, the aircraft has proved a success story for British
Airways, which operates seven of the 100-seat aircraft.
The normal Concorde return fare between London and New York is more than
Pounds 5,000 and the airline takes more than Pounds 150m a year in ticket
revenues from its small fleet. Concorde is limited, however, to North
Atlantic routes because of its 3,720 miles range.
Since the aircraft's development in the 1970s, the growth of Asian economies
has created a market linking Europe and east Asia and across the Pacific,
which requires an aircraft with greater range.
The outline specification for the ESRP calls for an aircraft with a range of
6,200 miles, seats for 250 passengers and a speed of Mach 2, twice the speed
of sound.
BAe said that if the project went ahead, an aircraft could be flying by the
second half of the next decade.
'We want to keep Europe's lead in supersonic passenger aircraft,' the
company said.
The ESRP companies would share research costs equally in the project, which
would focus on materials, engines, systems and aerodynamics, according to
Dasa, the loss-making Daimler-Benz subsidiary that holds the German stake in
the European Airbus.
The three companies have been part of an international aircraft development
study group embracing US, Japanese, Italian and Russian companies, Dasa
said. But the trio has now decided to press ahead with its own design.
BAe said it spent less than Pounds 5m on pre-feasibility study research last
year. It has been in discussion with the UK Department of Trade and Industry
about assistance for the new project.
It said that research for the engine for a Concorde successor was 'a
parallel project' involving the UK company Rolls-Royce, one of the world's
three main manufacturers of commercial aero engines. Spin-offs from the
project could include technology for use in future subsonic passenger
aircraft, Dasa said.

FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (1): Producers in
compliance - at a price / Paint protects much of the modern world against
the environment and adds colour to life, but is itself an environmental
problem.  Paintmakers have already responded, but eco-friendlier coatings
are not always better, and their cost may be more than buyers will be
willing to pay

There is a new assertiveness about the environment in the paint industry.
Four years ago there was palpable fear at the industry's conferences about
what tighter environmental controls were going to do to profitability and,
in some cases, survival. Today, the industry is fighting back.
It is not that the industry is full of companies bent on profit at the cost
of pollution. Rather, its most reputable members have spent millions on
compliance with new laws, and in developing new and greener products.
They are now looking for compromise in an age of politicised
environmentalism, when the goal posts have tended to be moved farther away
as industry has achieved new standards demanded of it.
As gains get more expensive as you go on, is there a point where enough has
been done for most practical purposes? The greenest possible paint may well
cost more than anyone can afford.
Dr Manfred Hopp, head of BASF Lacke &amp; Farben, Germany's biggest paintmaker,
asserts: 'We are squeezed between two laws. There is the law of the land,
which imposes ever-stricter environmental controls at increasing cost. Then
there is the law of supply and demand, which determines what our customers
are willing to pay.
'If our customers will not pay more - and they won't, especially in a
recession - something has to give. So we have to make savings in costs. This
means using more technology and fewer people. It means lost jobs. This is
one of the costs of environmental control which people have yet to fully
realise.'
In BASF's case, it was 300 jobs in Germany last year, on top of DM80m on
environmental compliance in the last three years and DM250m in the last ten.
Dr Hopp says: 'None of this spending has made us more profitable, but it has
been necessary for survival. There is no choice if you want to go on
operating. It's to be or not to be.'
Given that paint factories themselves are tightly controlled, the main
pollution issue for the industry is the emission of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) when the solvents used in paint evaporate.
Pollution is caused not by the paint industry, but its customers. Is the
industry therefore its customers' keeper? Competitive paintmakers know they
have to be: if a customer is faced with abatement costs to comply with
anti-pollution laws, an environmentally-friendly product that obviates the
need is going to have an edge in the market.
VOC emissions are being rightly regulated because they break down in
sunlight to form some of the constituents of acid rain and smog. The paint
industry's response has been to develop water-based coatings or put more
solids - pigments and resins - in the formulation.
Except for decorative emulsions used indoors on walls and ceilings,
'water-based' does not necessarily mean 'VOC-free' - 'green equals
reduction, rather than elimination,' says Mr Rod Watters, vice-president of
the US paintmaker, PPG.
Mr Herman Scopes, chief executive of ICI Paints, explains: 'Water is a
rotten solvent for paint. Customers' concerns are always with prices and
value for money. They are not interested in paying a premium just because
something is environmentally friendly. That is a bonus. The product has to
be good in its own right. You will only sell it if it does the job.'
Mr John Bernie, director of the industry-funded but independent Paint
Research Association, says inferior performance has been the bane of
water-based paints.
Some can be vulnerable to wet weather. Most do not last as long, requiring
earlier repainting of the surfaces they are supposed to protect. In
contrast, VOC solvents help the film spread and not sag or flocculate, while
producing a protective gloss water cannot usually achieve. Paint companies
have nevertheless solved many of the problems, greatly reducing VOC content
of most paints. In ICI's case, research started 15 years ago. Mr Scopes
claims its star product, which it developed for painting cars during
manufacture and has now redesigned for repairing automotive coatings, is
still the most technically advanced, although all competitors offer 'me too'
versions.
Ms Moira McMillan, director of the British Coatings Federation, says the UK
government's target of reducing VOC emissions by 30 per cent by 1998 is fine
in big markets like automotive paints, but difficult for medium-sized
engineering companies with correspondingly-sized paint shops. They will rely
on their suppliers for compliant coatings.
Paintmakers such as Kemira of Finland, Beckers of Sweden and Akzo Nobel,
which became the world's largest paint company when the Netherlands and
Scandinavian coatings businesses merged in November, have all spent large
sums developing water-based general industrial paints or buying rights to
the technology.
Sales growth - which they need to get their money back - will depend on
customers' readiness to change, but Mr Neville Petersen, the new chief of
Courtaulds Coatings, also confirms that 'a lot of customers are saying until
we have to change our systems, we are not going to. That's fine, but we have
to be ready for it when it happens, even if it means spending a lot of money
up front.'
In Courtaulds case, the bill this year will include Pounds 36m for a new
European resins development and manufacturing plant at Silvertown, in
London.
Ironically, therefore, the industry needs more regulation to force sales
growth of its compliant products, but worries if it can afford to go
further. Dr Hopp says many years of stability are needed to allow the
industry to recoup research and development costs, rather than be expected
to keep breaking new ground.
Mr Louis McCulloch, senior partner of James Consulting, an independent
specialist on paint, says: 'There is a danger in people getting too hung up
on environmental issues when other issues need addressing.
'Europe is in recession. Markets are down and there are mounting cost
pressures. The environmental issue is a long-term one. The immediate issue
is survival. I hope sense is prevailing. Environmental considerations are
important, but commercial considerations must not be lost.'
Dr Frank Rose, ICI's chief medical officer and an expert on safety, says:
'In the 1980s a lot of energy went into confrontation over regulation and
how to resist it. In the last few years, the industry has demonstrated
change.
'It's now in the interest of big companies to show leadership, especially
now people are being more cautious about putting pressure on if it causes
extra cost and loses jobs.'
Mr Herman van Karnebeek, director of Akzo Nobel, thinks big companies suffer
because they are easy targets for regulators, while small paint companies
are often let off the hook by local authorities fearful about jobs being
lost if they shut them down.
Large German paint companies have encountered similar prejudice, with small
operators sometimes treated leniently on the orders of local political
leaders who fear a backlash.
Mr Karnebeek says: 'The industry should set up its own means of policing
itself and needs to get organised on a European scale. Big companies should
have some leverage over supplies. Suppliers should also take a responsible
position.'
He wants controls harmonised, with universal standards of enforcement. This
is already a problem in Britain, says Ms McMillan, because different local
authorities interpret the same criteria differently against identical plant.
Harmonisation in timing new controls is also needed. Mr Roger Walters, who
runs Euramax, a UK coil coater, says British enthusiasm to enforce lower VOC
emissions ahead of other EU countries will force premature investment in old
abatement technology, giving EU competitors an edge if current trials of a
lower-energy catalytic conversion system prove viable.
The question is whether the industry's new assertiveness - and its record of
improvement - will help carry such arguments.

FT  07 APR 94 / Teamsters in first big strike for 15 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Picket lines went up across the US yesterday as the once powerful Teamsters
union launched its first big strike in 15 years against 22 road haulage
companies, but little immediate effect was felt on deliveries.
Mr Ron Carey, Teamsters president, called about 75,000 members out on strike
after talks broke down over the haulage companies' plan to use more
part-time workers and to send more goods by rail.
'We have no other choice but to strike,' Mr Carey said.
The companies targeted by the Teamsters' strike, which belong to a
negotiating consortium called Trucking Management Inc, handle about half of
all consolidated road freight in the US - single truck loads made up by the
haulage companies of consignments that on their own make up less than a full
load.
They include companies such as Consolidated Freight-ways, ABF Freight
Systems, and Roadway Express, which have faced increasing competition in
segments of their market from parcel delivery companies such as UPS.
The strike is most likely to affect deliveries of manufacturing components,
small finished goods and non-perishable groc-eries, but is not expected to
constrict food supplies, since most supermarket chains have their own truck
fleets.
The trucking companies currently ship between 5 and 15 per cent of their
freight by rail, but had proposed a new contract allowing up to 35 per cent
to move by rail. They also wanted a quarter of the work in their terminals
to be done by part time workers, giving them more flexibility to deal with
peaks in demand.
For the Teamsters, the strike is a critical test. Mr Carey was elected
president in 1991 as the leader of an effort to clean up the scandal-ridden
union, which had been operating under a federal court order as part of a
settlement of allegations stemming from its close links with organised
crime. Three of Mr Carey's six immediate predecessors went to prison, and
two others were the objects of criminal investigations when they left
office.
His leadership has been called into question, however, and the union's
finances, especially its strike fund, are in poor shape. Members last month
voted against an increase in union dues but the Teamsters have secured a
Dollars 50m loan guarantee from the AFL-CIO, the US labour union federation.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The state of Maine has been forced to back down in its fight against drink
boxes, the rectangular laminated packages made by companies such as
Tetra-Pak and Combibloc, George Graham reports from Washington.
Governor John McKernan this week signed a bill repealing Maine's three and a
half year ban on the drink box, which is more difficult to recycle than
aluminium cans or glass bottles and which the state feared would fill up all
scarce landfills. But the boxes have proved a hit with consumers, who buy
around 4bn of them in the US each year.
Maine's state legislature decided in 1990 to ban the boxes, but last month,
after years of industry pressure, it reversed itself. Packaging companies
have agreed, in exchange, to help municipalities set up recycling
programmes.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (11): 'The kind of
financing which is of little interest to banks' - A look at an institution
specialising in shipping finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is more to the Danmarks Skibskreditfond (DSK) than has yet met the
foreign investor's eye, according to Mr Bo Jagd, the fund's managing
director. Or - as he says while trying not to sound too boastful - 'We can't
find a bank in Europe which has a bigger shipping finance portfolio than we
have.'
'We are a household name here at home, but we are hardly known anywhere
else,' Mr Jagd says, but he predicts that this will soon change. So far the
fund, a specialist bond-issuing mortgage institution providing long-term
finance for ships, has been funded entirely in the domestic market, but he
expects that within the foreseeable future it will go into direct dollar
financing.
The DSK is a substantial institution by Danish standards. Its DKr47bn
balance sheet and DKr39bn loan portfolio ranks it alongside Giro Bank, which
is the country's fifth largest bank. But the DSK is in the business of
long-term finance. Typically, it provides 14-year loans matched by funding
with a 14-year maturity - a kind of financing which is of little interest to
banks.
Loans are provided for new building of ships and conversions of ships at
Danish shipyards for Danish and foreign owners, and to Danish owners for the
acquisition of new ships and second-hand tonnage, as well as for the sale,
to foreign owners, of Danish ships.
The substantial loan portfolio reflects the fact that Denmark boasts a large
commercial fleet and a substantial shipbuilding industry. There are two big
shipping companies: A P Moller Maersk, which is one of the world's biggest,
probably best-known for the Maersk Line (one of the world's two biggest
companies in container-carrying liner shipping); and the Lauritzen group,
which is especially prominent in refrigerated cargo transport.
Moller owns the Odense Steel Shipyard, the only yard in Europe which has
built and delivered double-hulled super-tankers. Lauritzen owns the Danyard,
in Jutland, which recently won a big order to build a series of gas carriers
for the American group Stolt Nielsen (the finance was arranged by the DSK).
The third important shipyard is the Burmeister &amp; Wain Shipyard in
Copenhagen.
The DSK loans are secured by first priority mortgages up to 60 per cent of
the fund's evaluation of the vessel. Over this level additional security is
required. The fund has a conservative lending policy and keeps tight control
over exposures.
This shows up in the accounts. Bad loss provisions in 1993 were DKr62m, or
about 0.6 per cent of lending. The DSK made a net profit of DKr221m in 1993;
up from DKr202m in 1992. Its equity to assets ratio at the end of last year
was 11.1 per cent - although this key figure does not have the same
significance for the fund as it does for a bank, Mr Jagd says, because the
DSK is not subject to the BIS capital adequacy rules.
The conditions under which the fund operates are changing rapidly. Not only
have shipbuilding subsidies been reduced by the European Union, but also
there is a strong push by the OECD's member states to abolish subsidies
altogether.
This, and the fact that interest rates have fallen, means that an increasing
proportion of ship financing is being carried out on market terms. In the
case of Denmark, much of the fund's borrowing since the 1970s has taken the
form of index-linked bonds. There was a strong domestic demand for these,
which obviated the need to market DSK bonds abroad.
Funding by index-linked bonds is being phased out, however, and Mr Jagd says
that the fund is increasingly interested in marketing its normal mortgage
bonds abroad - as well as planning to introduce dollar funding instruments.
The DSK bonds, in contrast to many of the Danish mortgage bonds, are
non-callable bullet bonds. This gives them a structure with which foreign
investors are familiar. They resemble treasury bonds, but, typically, carry
a spread over treasury bonds of about 40 basis points.
'If a foreign investor wants a Danish element in his porfolio, he can obtain
a better yield from us than from treasury bonds,' Mr Jagd says, but he
concedes that the fund's bonds are not as liquid as treasury bonds.
In the past, the fund has done considerable business in swapping loans into
floating rate dollars - which is a logical step, as ships are dollar assets.
The next step, Mr Jagd adds, is to go into direct dollar financing,
motivated partly by the fact that there is a limit to how many investors are
prepared to do dollar swaps on loans of such long maturities.
In fact the fund has already made its first venture into dollar financing, a
six-year loan on a bilateral basis. The time for more ambitious dollar
financing is approaching, probably as a private placement, he says. 'But
there is no hurry. Institutions which change too fast have too often ended
up in trouble, so we are changing cautiously.'

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (12): Trying to come
out on top - Profile of Topdanmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Denmark has experienced two disasters in which insurance groups Hafnia and
Baltica, have collapsed as a result of injudicious investments by their
holding companies. There remains a question mark against the future of a
third group, Topdanmark (Top), which has landed itself with a similar
problem.
Mr Henning Birch, Top's chief executive since 1985, resigned on March 26,
joining Hafnia's and Baltica's former managing directors, Per Villum Hansen
and Peter Christoffersen. He was succeeded by Mr Kaj G. Schou, formerly head
of Top's accident insurance business.
Top's future is of interest outside Denmark. It is a participant in Eureko,
the European insurance partnership which includes the UK's Friends
Provident, AVCB of the Netherlands, Wasa from Sweden, and Occidental of
Portugal. Top has a 12 per cent stake in Eureko, which in turn has owns 30
per cent of Topdanmark.
Top's other big shareholder is the Danish mutual group, Tryg Insurance, with
about 19.5 per cent. Last autumn Tryg announced that its stake in Topdanmark
was for sale, but there were indications last week that Tryg may change its
mind following Mr Birch's resignation.
Topdanmark's serious error was the acquisition, in 1989, of the Jutland
regional bank, Aktivbanken, for DKr1.4bn. It turned out to house a cupboard
full of skeletons; since 1989 the bank has cost Top another DKr1bn in
losses.
The chairman of the supervisory board, Mr Oluf von Lowzow (whose titles
include Lord-in-Waiting and Master of the Royal Hunt) has blamed the extra
provisions on 'misunderstandings' on the part of the supervisors - an
allegation promptly and emphatically rejected by Mr Eigil Molgaard, the
chief supervisor himself.
Tryg's managing director, Mr Alf Duch-Pedersen, has also publicly questioned
the value of the Eureko investment, which cost Top about DKr500m. But in
1993, according to Topdanmark's accounts, the group made a profit of DKr46m
from Eureko.
The costs of the investment in Aktivbanken pose a serious problem for
Topdanmark: it has to refund about DKr1.5bn of long-term debt in 1995 and
1996.
At the annual meeting of shareholders in May, Mr Lowzow is expected to spell
out the group's plan for getting itself off a potentially dangerous hook.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (9): Drift of trade to
London causes concern - An official commission, scheduled to report this
summer, is considering reforms of the stock exchange in line with the EU
financial services directive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
There is increasing international interest in Danish securities, both bonds
and equities, but there is a catch viewed from the Danish perspective.
More and more of the trade in Danish securities is taking place in London.
Accurate statistics are hard to come by, but in some periods about half the
turnover in Danish bonds appears to have taken place outside Denmark, as
well as a considerable share of the trade in the most liquid equities.
The Nationalbank (Central Bank) is clearly concerned at the trend, asserting
in its 1993 annual report, published in March, that without reform of the
market, 'there is a risk that the Danish securities market will become of
declining significance in the (face of) strengthening international
competition ...'
One of the reasons why trade is taking place in London, in the bank's view,
is that non-residents cannot trade over the Copenhagen Stock Exchange unless
they are physically present in Denmark.
The bank recommends a general liberalisation of legislation covering this
aspect of the financial markets, to include the right for non-residents to
trade on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.
Reforms of the Stock Exchange are currently being considered by an official
commission, due to report this summer, with a view to the implementation of
the EU's investment services directive in 1996.
There is a lively debate taking place between the various interested parties
 -the big banks, the independent brokerage houses, the big bond-issuing
institutions, and the institutional investors - on what changes are needed.
One of the problems, said Mr Eigil Pedersen, partner in investment bank
Gudme Raaschou, and a former chairman of the Association of Danish Stock
Brokers, is that the set-up in Copenhagen currently favours the two big
banks.
They account for about 60 per cent of the transactions, and for trade in the
very liquid securities, but there are a lot of illiquid securities, both
bonds and shares. 'We want to keep this market alive,' he says.
He has been looking at reforms of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, which faced
a similar problem of trade going to London, but has managed to reverse the
trend by changing the structure of its own market, allowing non-resident
brokers to trade over the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and by establishing
separate wholesale and retail markets.
Making changes is a difficult process in Copenhagen, where the Stock
Exchange and its related institutions, the Securities Registration Centre
and the Guarantee Fund for Options and Futures, operate under legislation
which gives the Stock Exchange a monopoly. The supervisory boards of the
institutions, in principle self-owning, are appointed by the Ministry for
Industry.
The present set-up means that the Stock Exchange mixes commercial with
administrative and regulatory tasks. 'We think it is a necessary condition
for a stock exchange to function as a market place that it must be run on a
commercial basis,' said Mr Kai Struwe, secretary-general of the Association
of Danish Stockbrokers. But he agrees that, as Denmark does not have the
London market's tradition of self-regulation, the debate on freeing the
Stock Exchange to function on a strictly commercial basis will be a
difficult one.
Copenhagen now offers trade in a full range of derivatives, as well as in
bonds and shares. A future on the 3-month Cibor, introduced last autumn,
added a money market derivative to a selection of stock options and futures
based on benchmark bonds and the KFX index of the 10-most traded shares. A
feature of Copenhagen is that all these instruments are traded on a single
exchange.
The Danish market was the first in the world to abolish paper securities and
introduce a fully electronic book entry and settlements system, starting
with bonds in 1983 and shares in 1988. Electronic registration of foreign
securities has been possible since 1989. Automatic trading systems were
introduced in 1987, Decentralised trade - from broker's offices - became
possible in 1988 and the floor of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange was closed
in 1989.
Technically-speaking, the system has worked extremely well, but not every
one is satisfied with the rules of the system. It embodies an extreme degree
of transparency, with a 90-second requirement between making a deal and
reporting to the Securities Centre. This, said Mr Struwe, exposes a dealer
who has a big position as he or she has no way of getting out of the
position without the entire market knowing that he must. Some trade may have
gone to London simply because there is greater degree of anonymity.
The Copenhagen market is dominated by bonds. 'We are one of the most
exciting markets in Europe,' said Mr Struwe. A substantial share of the
benchmark treasury bonds are traded internationally. Last year the
introduction of 30-year mortgages attracted international investors and on
April 6 a 30-year treasury bond was launched.
The Copenhagen equities market is relatively small, and only around five per
cent of the shares listed in Copenhagen are held by non-residents. In the
other Nordic countries somewhere between 20 and 30 per cent of the shares
are foreign-owned.
Interest in Danish equities may be picking up, however. The Dollars 3bn Tele
Danmark privatisation issue taking place in April, 85 per cent of which is
expected to be sold internationally, will introduce a new and liquid share.
The DKr1.7bn international issue by Unidanmark in February was a further
sign of the times. It was the first time that a Danish bank has launched an
international issue, Mr Thorleif Krarup, Unidanmark's chief executive
pointed out, and the issue, at market price, was oversubscribed four times.
Mr Krarup was particularly encouraged by the considerable interest in the
issue in France and Germany in addition to the UK and the US.
'If Danish companies make a systematic effort, they can make Danish shares
more interesting and more liquid,' is Mr Krarup's conclusion.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (10): New ways to earn
money - Profile of Gudme Raaschou
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The name of Gudme Raaschou has been appearing increasingly often, as
co-manager or adviser on prestige Danish equity funding issues such as last
autumn's privatisation issue by Giro Bank and last month's Copenhagen
Airport privatisation issue.
The emergence of the Raaschou name (pronounced - approximately -
'Ross-coo')is the story of a traditional brokerage business which saw the
writing on the wall when the comfortable monopoly enjoyed by brokerage
businesses in Denmark was shoved aside in 1985 and banks were allowed to set
up their own brokerage subsidiaries.
The competition became even rougher when the country was plunged into a long
recession after 1986 and the markets collapsed. When the Danish Stock
Exchange went electronic in 1985 there were 54 registered broking companies.
Now there are only 26. The market is dominated by Danske Bank's and
Unidanmark's broking operations (since January 1 this year the banks no
longer have to operate brokerage in a subsidiary company), and only a
handful of independent brokers have survived.
'When the market collapses, either you need a rich uncle or you find new
ways of earning money,' says Mr Kaare B. Dullum, managing director of
Raaschou. 'We did the latter. We had to have new business in order to ride
out the storm. Brokerage alone would not keep it going.'
Mr Dullum and his partners at Raashou, Mr Eigil Pedersen and Mr Knud J.
Strange, mapped out a strategy to turn the traditional broking business,
founded in 1925, into a combined investment bank and broking group.
Mr Dullum played a key role in the transformation process. He arrived at
Raaschou in 1985 from Novo (now Novo Nordisk), the pharmaceuticals group
where, as finance manager, he pioneered the first international equity issue
in modern times by a Scandinavian company.
The position which Raaschou has tried to exploit is its independence, by
virtue of its ownership, of other market participants. It is not committed
to any particular source of funding and its own financial involvement is
typically limited.
As organised today, Raaschou operates on the brokerage side in Danish shares
and bonds and foreign securities. Its investment bank operations include
portfolio management, corporate equity finance and international capital
markets (non-equity borrowing), and advice and consultancy in all these
fields.
The two sides of the business complement each other. 'We are always in the
markets, so we know what is going on,' says Mr Dullum. Raaschou has raised
about DKr10bn over the past two years - 'which is quite a lot for a little
company.'
Typical amounts raised are in the DKr300m-600m range. A considerable
proportion of the money raised by the company has been for non-Danish
Scandinavian companies. This side of the business is expected to become
increasingly important.
Raaschou has just recruited Sweden's Mr Hans Cavalli-Bjorkman to the
supervisory board. Mr Cavalli-Bjorkman is a former chief general manager of
Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank; his base is in Malmo, just across the straits
from Copenhagen. He is a strong advocate of closer business and economic
relations between the southern Swedish and Copenhagen regions. A board
member of many of the big local Swedish companies, Mr Cavalli-Bjorkman is
sometimes referred to in the Swedish media as the king of Malmo. Raaschou
has made something of a coup.
Raaschou is now earning about half its income from investment banking, and
the change from brokerage to investment banking was not always smooth. 'It
was not always easy to balance out the dips in brokerage earnings with
earnings from investment banks. We had a few sleepless nights along the
way,' says Mr Dullum.
In the process, the company has undergone a complete change. Almost all the
staff have changed since 1985. The education level is much higher, Mr Dullum
says - a necessary requirement for a company which has made its mark in
several complex mergers and acquisitions and corporate restructuring
operations as well as capital market issues.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (13): Prague offers diversity
 -The hotel market in eastern Europe is struggling to catch up with demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the collapse of communism in central and eastern Europe, Prague has
been one of the most popular destinations for visitors to the region.
But while the huge influx of visitors has been good news for local tradesmen
and commerce, it has caused overcrowding at favourite sight-seeing spots
such as Charles Bridge and Prague Castle, and suitable accommodation has
been both more difficult to find and more expensive.
The flow of tourists seems to have slowed this winter, though it may pick up
again in the spring and summer, and it has been easier to book a hotel room.
Scarcity of accommodation, however, means that prices remain high even in
comparison with other European capitals, and the quality of service has yet
to catch up with prices.
Luxury class international hotels include the Forum, just two metro stops
away from Wenceslas square; the new Atrium, which is slightly off the centre
but boasts extensive business facilities; the Intercontinental, not far from
Old Town Square; and the Jalta, on Wenceslas square.
All these hotels are, broadly, 'modern' buildings, except for the Jalta
which has been completely refurbished with pleasant rooms overlooking the
square. The Jalta is less formal and staff tend to be more friendly.
Hotels continue to charge foreigners several times more than the local
residents for the same room - an unacceptable hangover from former communist
days when westerners were seen as a source of easy money.
For those who do not wish to pay Dollars 200 or more per night, there are a
few smaller hotels on the Mala Strana side of the river. Alternatively, if
you are planning to stay for a week or longer - and having a telephone or
someone to take messages while you are out is not absolutely essential - bed
and breakfast in a private home will be cheaper. The Czech tourist office
should be able to provide you with a list of accommodation, but it is
important to remember that you will need to do your own shopping for basics
and that few people speak English in local shops.
The quality and speed of service varies considerably even among the more
expensive hotels, confirming the old adage that paying more does not
necessarily mean better treatment. It is best to be patient.
Prague has quickly adapted to some less appealing western traits, and petty
crime and thefts have risen considerably in recent years. Don't leave a car
with a foreign number plate parked on the street at night, but use the hotel
car park or one of the few car parks near the city centre. (The latter are
expensive, but your car will be safe.) Street parking in the centre of town
is almost entirely limited to permit holders, so choose your spot carefully,
otherwise your car could be clamped - and possibly towed away. It will take
time and the payment of a fine to get it back.
The large hotels usually have their own taxi service.
These tend to be more expensive than a cab hailed in the street, but if you
do not speak Czech they are your best bet. Taxi ranks in the city centre,
such as the one on Old Town Square, should be avoided, as drivers sometimes
refuse to switch on their meter and substantially overcharge. Local radio
cab companies such as AAA are reliable. You may get a battered old Skoda for
the ride, but the drivers tend to be more friendly and honest.
There is a good clean airport taxi service which will bring you to the
centre of Prague in about 40 minutes, depending on traffic, for less than
Kcs500. The choice of duty-free goods at the airport is limited and you can
pay only in hard currency, so if you plan to take goods home, they are best
bought while in town.
Czech cuisine is not for the faint-hearted and tends to be heavy. There are
some reasonable white wines, though the local beer is by far the best drink.
There is a wide choice of restaurants offering a mixture of Czech and
international food around the centre.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (12): More than just a place
to sleep - Property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US company said recently that Russian property law was in such disarray
that it had no idea who owned the hotel it was running in Moscow. Hotel
companies in the US and western Europe usually know who owns their
establishments; the difficulty is finding investors who want to own them.
The established patterns of hotel ownership in the US and Western Europe
were severely disrupted by the fall in property prices in the late 1980s and
early 1990s. Hoteliers and investors are now having to establish different
strategies for financing hotel acquisitions and new buildings.
Mr Paul Slattery, a London-based leisure analyst with Kleinwort Benson, says
the relationship between US hoteliers and property investors used to be
stable. American financial institutions regarded hotels as a worthwhile
investment. They would buy the bricks and mortar and give a hotel group a
contract to run the establishment.
The US financial institutions employed hotel experts and analysts, some of
whom became well-known figures in the travel industry. Other, smaller
investors also became involved in hotel property ownership, which provided
them with tax advantages in the US.
The frenetic pace of hotel building, however, meant that the supply of hotel
rooms in the late 1980s began to outstrip demand. The economic downturn, the
drop in hotel occupancy and the fall in property asset values combined to
make the hotel industry a far less attractive proposition.
Mr Darryl Hartley-Leonard, president of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation of the
US, says: 'Business in the 1980s was based on the beliefs that inflation
would increase and demand would grow with supply. Both were violated.'
The Marriott Corporation of the US illustrates the dilemma. Marriott's
strategy during the 1980s was to build hotels and then sell them to limited
partnerships which used the start-up losses as tax write-offs. A combination
of changes in US tax laws and falling property prices put an end to this
strategy in the late 1980s. Marriott responded by selling off some of its
operations, such as airline catering, fast foods and restaurants.
Then, at the end of 1992, Marriott announced it was splitting itself into
two companies. One, Host Marriott, would specialise in owning property
assets; the other, Marriott International, would run hotels. After a year of
dealing with the protests of bondholder groups, the split was formalised in
October last year.
Mr Stephen Bollenbach, Host Marriott's president and chief executive
officer, says the split has had a positive effect: analysts and institutions
who follow his company are now specialists in property rather than leisure
and understand the prospects for his business better. Host Marriott's share
price has risen sharply since the beginning of the year.
At the end of last year, Inter-Continental Hotels, owned by the Japanese
Saison group, announced it was following suit. By the end of this month,
Inter-Continental should also have formalised the formation of two companies
 -one managing hotels and the other owning properties.
Hotel groups in Europe faced a slightly different problem. European hotels
were smaller and there were fewer large chains. Many hotels were family
owned. European hotel groups which wanted to expand and did not want to
invest in new property assets said they hoped to acquire management
contracts. Someone else would buy the hotels; they would run them.
Mr Slattery of Kleinwort Benson says the traditional structure of a
management contract was that the managing company would receive a fee
calculated as a percentage of turnover, say 3 per cent, and, typically, 10
per cent of gross operating profit.
The difficulty for those companies seeking management contracts is that
investors in property assets are no longer prepared to bear the risk alone.
Mr Hartley-Leonard says bluntly: 'The pure management contract has gone.
People investing in hotels want to know that the operator is committed to
them.'
Mr Peter George, group chief executive of the Ladbroke group of the UK,
which owns Hilton International, says there are exceptions to this in the
developing world. Where the local government believes the presence of a
Hilton hotel, say, would increase the attraction of the country to investors
and business travellers, it might be prepared to take ownership of the
property and ask the Ladbroke subsidiary to manage it.
In other parts of the world, however, companies investing in hotel assets
are demanding that the operating company takes a partial equity stake or
guarantees specific rates of return to the owner.
But who are these brave individuals who are prepared to invest in hotel
assets? In Asia, where there is still a need for new hotels, Mr Slattery
says there are property groups and wealthy individuals interested in
building or owning hotels.
There are also companies with an interest in buying European hotels. When
the debt-laden Ciga group, an Italian-based luxury chain, went on sale
recently, there were at least three serious bidders: Host Marriott, Forte of
the UK and ITT Sheraton of the US, the eventual winner.
The Forte bid was particularly interesting. Forte originally offered to take
over the management of Ciga for Pounds 33m in cash. Forte also agreed to
insert some of its own luxury hotels, with a value of about Pounds 125m into
a Ciga operating company.
When it became clear that other bidders were offering more cash, Forte
teamed up with the Quantum Fund, owned by Mr George Soros, the US investor.
Together they offered Pounds 270m. Although the bid was topped by ITT
Sheraton, Mr Slattery believes the Forte/Soros combination is an example of
the new sorts of financing arrangements that hotel companies will now be
examining.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (10): It is hard to beat a
way into Moscow - The hotel market in the former Soviet Union is struggling
to catch up with demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON

<TEXT>
When a couple of cleaning ladies launched a Dollars 10m law-suit against a
leading western-managed Moscow hotel for their allegedly unfair dismissal,
their tale joined the list of horror stories the western business community
likes to tell about the hazards of investing in Russia.
'This country is crazy, you know . . . the judge will probably award them
the money,' said one western construction executive. 'Oh, no, they won't.
The judge is simply waiting to be paid off not to,' said another western
entrepreneur, involved in tourism.
The ladies apparently hit on the amount of Dollars 10m through a
mistranslation of the conditions of a strict merit system. This had been
introduced by the Radisson group, which manages the hotel in question, and
said that employees were free to determine the size of their bonuses.
The story also points up the particular difficulties facing western
companies involved in building, refurbishing, and managing hotels in Russia.
Despite being one of the Russian capital's favourite hotels for western
visitors, with more than 85 per cent occupancy, the Radisson-Slavyanskaya
Hotel shares many of the difficulties facing hoteliers in Russia.
The advantages of a western-managed hotel such as the Radisson are also
clear: with demand for quality rooms outstripping supply in Moscow, such
hotels command a seller's market, despite the gradual encroachment of some
degree of competition as new projects are - painfully - completed.
The rewards to be made by those who have succeeded in beating their way into
the market are increased by the considerable obstacles to others entering
the market.
Apart from a primitive legal system, ill-adjusted to the complexities of
market economics, problems include ambiguous property rights, and consequent
difficulties in raising finance for new projects. In the case of the
Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel, the question of who actually owns the building
remains the subject of competing claims among successor state and semi-state
organisations to Intourist, the former state monopoly.
In addition, the authorities' powerlessness to enforce their own rules may
be illustrated by a railway workers' relaxation club still standing on the
grounds of the hotel, despite an order for its demolition by the mayor's
office in late 1992.
A major factor slowing down the building of new hotels, as well as the
refurbishing or rebuilding of Moscow's decrepit old hotels is the difficulty
raising finance for Russian projects - partly because of the absence of a
system for lenders to register their legal charge, and of a legal system
capable of enforcing their rights.
Endless rows over the ownership, financing, and management of the decrepit
Hotel National, on a prime site just opposite Red Square, have meant it is
still under scaffolding more than two years after work started.
Some Moscow city government officials had promised Rogner, the Austrian
construction group, a crack at managing the hotel in compensation for
payment delays for the renovation.
This in turn has clashed with a contract signed by other Moscow authorities
with Marriott, the US hotel group, for it to manage the hotel. Other bits of
Moscow's byzantine city administration have decided to hold a tender to
select yet a third western company.
But after just two years of market reforms, some progress is being made
towards more transparent decision-making, and time is likely to cure many of
the worst problems of Russia's infant capitalism.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (11): Sentiment in Warsaw -
The hotel market in eastern Europe is struggling to catch up with demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The quality of Warsaw hotels is uneven at best, but the city presents the
sentimental traveller with an unrivalled opportunity to relive most post-war
eras, as the Polish capital slipped from Stalinism in the 1950s to the
political and cultural thaw of later years, and on to the entrepreneurial
free market present day.
Few remember, for example, that the fin de siecle Polonia near the main
railway station, now catering to the rougher end of the market, was once -
in 1945 - home to the entire diplomatic corps in a rubble-strewn city still
waiting to be rebuilt.
That reconstruction resulted in the stern Stalinist interiors of the
Warszawa hotel - ideal for those wanting to indulge in Le Carre spy
fantasies - and the down-at-heel Grand, originally built in the 1950s, for
bureaucrats coming into Warsaw ministries to arrange for allocations of
ever-scarce resources.
The Grand remains a handy place to await tardy decisions from the
privatisation ministry next door - recognised as such by SG Warburg, a
faithful government adviser which appears to have rooms there, as offices,
for the duration.
Next comes the 19th century Europejski with its faithful clientele and low
prices which help to make up for the lack of refurbishing needed to enhance
its potential as a provider of old world charm.
Across the road stands the Bristol Hotel, once as shabby as its neighbour,
but it has been relentlessly restored by Forte. Now it holds pride of place
as the classiest and most expensive of the city's hotels.
Long gone, though, are the days when the bars in both these hotels were home
to the rebellious intelligentsia and the communist party liberals, as well
as to the foreign press reporting the 1956 liberalisation, when Poland was
the 'merriest barracks in the Soviet camp'.
The foreign loan-financed investment boom of the 1970s saw the building of
the Forum Hotel at the busiest intersection in Warsaw: an upright shoe box
design, devoid of charm. It seems invariably to host package tours of
elderly Polish Americans and young Israelis all intent on seeking their
roots.
The Victoria Inter-Continental, convenient for the finance ministry and
within view of Warsaw's chunky opera building, was also built at that time
and still attracts a steady stream of bankers and businessmen.
Marriott came to the city five years ago. This will be forever linked to the
early days of Poland's free market reforms, when it catered to western
businessmen eager to take advantage of opportunities then opening up, and
the publicly funded advisers - ironically called the Marriott brigades - who
then streamed into the country.
At the same time, a few hundred yards away, the Holiday Inn, finished in
1988 just a few months before the Marriott, housed (as it still tends to do)
the local businessman taking advantage of similar opportunities.
Later additions to the hotel scene lack lustre. The Sobieski, sited on the
way in from the airport, has a colourful exterior but suffers from a lack of
air conditioning in the summer. And the Mercure, a French Accor group
project, has yet to acquire a character.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (8): Rescuer holds key
to future - Ownership of Baltica remains to be decided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For more than a year the ownership structure of Baltica Forsikring,
Denmark's biggest insurance group, has been shrouded in uncertainty. Because
of this, Mr Hans Ejvind Hansen, chief executive, has been forced to design
short to medium-term strategies for the company and to restrict his focus to
basic insurance operations so as to sharpen Baltica's domestic competitive
edge.
The insurer was saved from collapse last year by a complex rescue package in
which Den Danske Bank, Denmark's largest bank, emerged as Baltica's biggest
shareholder with a stake of 32 per cent. However, DDB's stake in the company
is more than 50 per cent when taking into account a 24 per cent shareholding
held by Gefion, Baltica's former holding company, whose main creditor is
DDB.
'We all know that Den Danske Bank holds the key to our future but we have to
try to maximise our attractiveness to potential investors so that all
possible solutions to our ownership can be kept open,' Mr Hansen said
recently.
Baltica owns 27 per cent of its own shares, having been given limited
dispensation from Danish rules which do not allow insurance companies to own
more than 10 per cent of their own shares.
Both of these shareholdings will have to be sold within the next two years
because of the Danish rules, but it would be hardly surprising if DDB was
given a political green light to take over Baltica, although concern over
DDB's dominance of the domestic financial market makes this solution
problematic.
The bank has said that it intends to clarify its intentions for Baltica
during the first half of this year, but Mr Hansen, who is also a former DDB
deputy chief executive, is less than optimistic that the company's ownership
structure will be decided within this time frame.
Given the recent turmoil within the company and, within the Scandinavian
insurance industry, Baltica's employees have learned to shrug off rumours
about their future. 'Their morale has been surprisingly high, considering
they have been through so much. I tell them it is business as usual and not
to stop making decisions,' Mr Hansen said.
Possible future ownership plans have ranged from the company becoming
independent, to DDB acquiring Baltica, to Codan - the Danish subsidiary of
the UK's Sun Alliance - acquiring part of the business, to Skandia, Sweden's
biggest insurer, becoming the new owner.
The Scandinavian insurance industry is still recovering from a series of
dramas which took place nearly two years ago and which saw several big
participants in Storebrand and Denmark's Baltica and Hafnia driven to near
collapse.
Acquisition by Codan seems rather ambitious given that the former is in the
throes of absorbing Hafnia, which it took over last year. A move by Skandia
to acquire a big Baltica stake appears less far-fetched but the company has
indicated its intention to retrench back to domestic business and expressed
some reservations over expansion. Danish politicians have also indicated a
preference for a domestic company to own the country's biggest insurer.
A senior DDB executive said recently that given the bank's ambitions within
the insurance industry, it would not be unnatural for DDB to acquire
Baltica. Mr Hansen says: 'We could see a solution whereby Baltica's shares
were redistributed among a number of institutional investors, domestic and
foreign, or one in which Den Danske Bank took us over. Because there are so
many possibilities it makes it difficult to establish a strategy for the
company which could cope with them all.'
His patience over Baltica's future ownership structure is wearing thin. 'I
have told DDB that it would be beneficial if a rapid solution was found, and
I will not repeat it,' he said.
Baltica's chief executive hopes also to benefit from the merger between
Codan and Hafnia, its biggest competitors. 'The results of Hafnia's primary
business have not been among the most flourishing in the country. Now that
it has taken the company over, Codan has to find a common policy and premium
strategy for the old Hafnia and Codan and to increase premiums by as much as
we have.
'Codan is an important competitor - though Baltica is bigger - and we hope
to be able to profit from the difficulties that relate to all mergers. Our
problem is that we do not earn enough from our direct insurance, but
compared with our competitors we are the best in the country.'
Meanwhile, Mr Hansen, who earlier took charge of reducing DDB's employees by
15 per cent before coming to Baltica last April continues to forge ahead
with tightening the operations.
Baltica's 1993 results are due to be published on April 7, but may be
delayed until later in the month, according to Mr Hansen, owing to a couple
of issues which have yet to be resolved. However, he said the company's
performance in direct insurance was weaker last year than in 1992 when the
group suffered a net loss of DKr445m, primarily due to an extraordinary
charge of NKr655m against accounts.
Baltica, nevertheless, has reduced costs by 10 per cent in the past year
partly through staff reductions of the same magnitude, and steps are being
taken to achieve a further 10 per cent cost reduction by 1995.
'We hope to present significantly improved results for the first half of
1994 and I am confident that the results for the whole year will be a
substantial improvement over 1993. We should also be able to achieve a
reasonble profit in 1995 barring unforeseen circumstances,' he said.
Last year Baltica increased its premiums by 10 per cent from 1994 - it was
the first such increase in more than eight years. 'We are trying to define a
new business idea which means concentrating on direct Danish insurance,
cutting out associated business, and forming strategic alliances. The three
main pillars of our strategy include premium increases, cost reductions and
retrenchment of our business scope.
'We have retrenched our activities - both geographically and professionally
but we will maintain operations in New York and London while winding down
the business in Australia. Balta, our business in Lithuania, has been sold.'
Mr Hansen said that if Baltica had had a huge portfolio of securities and
bonds it would have been somewhat cushioned from its earlier financial
troubles. 'As part of our restructuring we took more than 27 per cent of our
own shares in the form of treasury stocks as payment for taking over a
corresponding level of debt from our holding company which was DKr2.2bn.
When we had to pay back this debt we were forced to dispose of our
securities and bonds and we have not rebuilt the portfolio,' Mr Hansen
explained.
'Although we have the handicap of not having a big securities and bond
portfolio ..we have a reasonably sound insurance business - whereas Codan
has a big bond portfolio and the challenge of building a reasonable non-life
insurance business from the ruins of Hafnia,' Mr Hansen said.
Baltica has to live from its basic insurance business which is not easy in
the very competitive Danish insurance market, according to Mr. Hansen. The
company has a surplus policy, according to which it takes out as reserves
allocations a surplus every year which is based on a percentage equivalent
to what the policyholders are paid, plus a margin of 2.2 per cent. This
means when shares and bonds increase Baltica under-performs, but when they
decline in value the company over performs.
'This provides a stable and important income from our 1991 investment in
Statsanstalten (the state's pensions and life insurance group), which is of
great importance for our position in the market,' Mr Hansen said.
Nevertheless, Mr Hansen admits he has to operate within a very constrained
environment, given the outstanding questions over Baltica's ownership
structure. 'We have no choice but to sharpen the edge of our basic
business.'

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (7): Three biggest
groups back in the black - The country's distinctive mortgage credit system
has survived a turbulent economic period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Securitised mortgages have been a feature of Denmark for two centuries and,
'no mortgage bondholder has ever lost his money in the 200 years the system
has existed'.
So says Mr Lars Rohde, a member of the management board of Realkredit
Danmark (it changed its name from Kreditforening Danmark in 1993), one of
the two largest mortgage credit finance groups.
The Danish mortgage system is unusual. Virtually all mortgage financing is
done through the bond-issuing institutions. These were until recently
self-owning associations of borrowers, but they have now been converted into
limited companies.
The holding companies in the mortgage groups, however, continue to be owned
by the borrowers. The companies are not listed on the Stock Exchange but the
bonds they issue are.
Mortgage bonds account for around half of the turnover in bonds on the
Copenhagen Stock Exchange. The system functions efficiently because it is
supported by an infrastructure of a kind which does not exist in many other
countries. There is an official property registration and mortgage debt
registration system (covering not only loans issued by the mortgage
institutions but also private mortgage notes, known as 'pantebreve').
This infrastructure means that there is a quick and legally simple means of
reclaiming property if the owner defaults on mortgage payments.
Ownership is always known, and there are no privileged liabilities which are
unregistered and therefore unknown to the lending institutions, as Mr Rohde
explained.
Funding and loans by the mortgage credit groups are matched: 30-year loans
are matched by 30-year bonds. There is no mismatch, 'which gives the system
stability', says Mr Rohde.
Nevertheless, the mortgage finance institutions are just emerging from a
turbulent period, on which Mr Rohde's judgment is: 'We survived.' The
combination of moving from high to low inflation in the late-1980s and the
recession which began in 1987 had as dramatic an impact on the mortgage
credit institutions as it did on the banks. As commercial and residential
property prices collapsed, the level of defaults and executive auctions
assumed a scale which was as bad as anything experienced in the 1930s.
There was no question of the mortgage institutions going bust, but at the
peak of the crisis a situation was reached when it appeared that the
institutions would no longer have the capacity to make new loans. Drastic
action was called for to put the institutions back into shape.
Realkredit Danmark has cut its staff by 35 per cent since 1989, tightened up
its credit policy to avoid new losses, and increased the margin (between
what it actually raised and what it lends to the householder) on its loans.
The other institutions have carried out similar programmes.
Last year brought relief. The three largest groups were back into the black.
Realkredit Danmark turned a 1992 loss of DKr1.28bn into a profit of
DKr1.47bn. Nykredit moved from a very small profit of DKr46m to a profit
DKr1.32bn.
They continue to carry very high - by the standards of mortgage credit  -
loss provisions of around 0.7 per cent of lending, but property prices have
begun to recover and the economy is turning up, so the groups expect the
level of bad loss provisions will at last begin to fall.
Falling interest rates in 1993 opened the way for mortgageholders to convert
loans carrying coupons of nine to 11 per cent to loans with coupons of six
and seven per cent, which brought on the mortgage companies enormous
pressure of business.
The launch of a new series of 30-year bonds with a six per cent coupon was
also popular with the markets and created a series of highly liquid
securities in which there was a substantial foreign interest. From the point
of view of foreign investors, however, mortgage bonds carry a number of
disadvantages, compared with treasury bonds.
The mortgage bonds are not bullets, which is the kind with which foreign
investors are familiar, and they are callable. On the other hand they carry
a spread of up to 100 basis points (it varies considerably according to
conditions in the markets) over treasury bonds.
A further problem is that mortgage credit groups have not yet been rated by
the international rating agencies, which is often a requirement before the
big institutional investors will consider buying an institution's
securities. In the meantime, the mortgage institutions are becoming
interested in international funding, which reflects the general
globalisation of the Danish financial sector.
The Danish institutions used to be subject to a rule that krone assets had
to be matched by krone liabilities, but this straitjacket has been removed.
The Danish institutional investors, who take up the bulk of the mortgage
bond issues, are diversifying into foreign securities, says Mr Rohde, 'so we
have a natural desire to broaden our funding base by selling
internationally.'
At home, the mortgage credit institutions are meeting competition from the
banks. Den Danske Bank and Uni-danmark both set up mortgage credit
subsidiaries last year, which enables them to keep funds within the group
which would otherwise have moved to the old-established mortgage credit
groups, or, as Mr Rohde less kindly puts it: 'They have cannibalised their
own lend ing.'
Current legislation does not allow the mortgage credit institutions to reply
in kind by setting up banks themselves, although the insurance companies,
for example, are allowed to operate banks as subsidiaries, and do.
The mortgage credit institutions are now pressing for a change which will
put them on a competitive footing with the banks and insurance companies.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (6): A shortage of customers
persists - Hotels across Europe have suffered in the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Ciga, the debt-laden Italian luxury hotel chain, went on sale last
year, potential buyers were almost crushed in the rush.
Forte, the UK hotel group and an early front-runner, admitted defeat when it
decided the sums being offered were more than its shareholders would be
willing to bear. Mr Stephen Bollenbach, president and chief executive
officer of Host Marriott of the US, another unsuccessful bidder, says he was
extremely disappointed not to have captured the chain - which lost L195.43bn
last year. The winner, ITT Sheraton of the US, paid more than L900bn for
Ciga, a sum which left the hotel industry gaping with astonishment. What did
all the potential buyers see in a company in such a parlous financial state?
Ciga's properties are certainly prestigious; they include the Grand in Rome
and the Danieli in Venice. But not only is Ciga a financially troubled
group; it also operates in a severely depressed market.
Most European hotel markets are suffering from a shortage of customers. Mr
Michael Ball, sales and marketing director of Utell International, which
handles reservations for hotels around the world, says: 'The economic
outlook for Germany, Spain and Italy must remain at best questionable.'
Hotels in France have suffered in the recession. Mr Bryan Langton, chairman
of Holiday Inn, says that while the volume of business in Germany has not
dropped, 'we're seeing dramatic pressure on room rates of the sort we saw in
the UK when it went into recession'.
The UK, and London in particular, is seen by several hotel groups as the
only bright spot in an otherwise gloomy market. But a recent survey by the
Horwath hotels and leisure consulting group throws into question how robust
the UK recovery really is.
Mr Geoff Parkinson, a Horwath director, says the performance of hotels in
England last year was 'patchy and inconsistent'. The survey, conducted in
association with the English Tourist Board, found that average room
occupancy last year was 48 per cent, the same as in 1992 and well below the
figure of 57 per cent achieved in 1989 and 1990.
In London, which some people in the industry believe is achieving better
results than the UK provinces, occupancy actually deteriorated last year. It
was down to 56 per cent, compared with 57 per cent in 1992. The capital's
luxury hotels - those charging more than Pounds 85.50 a night - achieved
annual occupancy of 65 per cent: reasonably healthy but still no higher than
1992. The last quarter of 1993 was particularly disappointing for this
category of hotel.
The lowest priced hotels in London - those charging less than Pounds 56 a
night - suffered a fall in occupancy to 52 per cent from 57 per cent in
1992.
The only encouraging sign in the London market was hotels that charge
between Pounds 56 and Pounds 85.50 a night. Their occupancy rose to 57 per
cent last year from 53 per cent in 1992. But even this compares with a
figure of 71 per cent in 1989.
Mr Parkinson did see some cheer in the survey results. He says: 'What the
figures do show is that the slide in occupancy, which took place in 1991 and
1992, has stopped. First indications are that 1994 will begin to show an
improvement.' He warns, however, that low occupancy had led to a decline in
achieved room rates. This 'leaves little margin for re-investment -
something which, for many hotels, is now becoming urgent.'
If this was the trading picture in Europe's healthiest market, why are some
investors still so keen on buying hotels? Mr Paul Slattery, a hotels analyst
with Kleinwort Benson, believes that one needs to look beyond the current
European economic downturn.
In the UK, he believes that hotel-using companies are likely to retain the
system of strict cost controls they developed during the recession. They
will increasingly book rooms through large hotel reservations organisations.
Despite the current French recession, Mr Slattery is optimistic about the
longer-term outlook for the country's hotels. France's expanding national
chains of retailers and financial services companies will generate increased
business for hotels around the country, Mr Slattery believes. He adds that
France's privatisation programme will increase hotel use too;
newly-privatised groups will be hungry for business, sending their employees
travelling to win new contracts.
Mr Slattery argues that the longer-term outlook for German hotels is also
cheerful. The country's economy is heading for a period of restructuring.
The manufacturing sector will have to increase productivity and reduce wage
costs to compete internationally, but the service sector will grow,
generating increased demand for hotel rooms.
Mr Roger Garland, executive vice president of Four Seasons Hotels, the
Toronto-based luxury hotels groups, argues that too many of Europe's
prestigious establishments are unsuited to the needs of the modern business
traveller.
He says: 'There's a significant opportunity to build modern,
highly-efficient hotels in the European market. If you look carefully at any
European market, you'll see hotels with a lot of style but which are badly
run.'

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (9): Budget brands spell
growth - Asia's deluxe hotel market is at saturation point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH WILKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asian hotels are considered the best in the world. They collect most of the
accolades and awards to prove it. Their facilities and service levels are
second to none; the envy of hotels outside the region.
But future growth in this burgeoning region will come less from the deluxe
category of hotel and more from the moderate three and budget four star
hotel. Quite simply, the big cities of the region, from Bangkok and Hong
Kong to Jakarta and Singapore, are at saturation point with deluxe hotels.
Supply exceeds demand and room rates are soft in much of the region. In
Singapore, Bangkok and Jakarta it is a buyer's market. Hong Kong remains an
exception: rates appear to have hardened.
Many of the big hotel operators have a two-prong strategy: to move on to
secondary and even tertiary cities with their top-of-the-line brand in a bid
for market share - Surabaya is 'flavour of the month' in Indonesia, for
example - and to introduce a budget brand in either the important or
secondary sites - or both.
The Shangri-La hotel group is typical. It is doubling in size in the next
six years; all new hotels concentrated in the Asia Pacific region. A
Shangri-La hotel opened in Taipei in March this year, the tallest in the
city, followed by another in Jakarta. Surabaya will open before the end of
the year. To augment its main line brand in Singapore, it is opening a
three-star Traders brand property there early next year.
'Traders hasn't got momentum yet, but it will be an important thrust in
certain destinations,' says David Hayden, chief operating officer of the
group. 'The future is in three or four star in Asia.'
At present the Shangri-La Traders brand only exists in China. It is in
Beijing, adjacent to a Shangri-La hotel in the downtown area. Its success,
as a no-frills product, has spurred the group to expand.
Fuelling the growth in more budget-priced properties is the growth in
numbers of the regional businessmen and women, Taiwanese and Chinese in
particular. Of the two countries, China seems the main attraction for the
development of more cost-conscious hotel expansion. With China fitfully
awakening, expected to become a centre of economic growth as an export power
and a market of 1.2bn potential consumers, hotel investors are queueing up.
The whole of IndoChina is also ripe for hotel investment, although Vietnam,
followed by Cambodia, heads the wish list of investors, rather than Laos or
Myanmar (formerly Burma). US President Clinton's recent lifting of trade
sanctions between the US and Vietnam has opened the floodgates for American
investment and Japanese investment will not be far behind. InterContinental
is set to announce a deal in Cambodia's capital, Pnom Penh.
Sheraton, the large American hotel chain which has 45 properties throughout
Asia, is ready to expand in the region. While it is pushing ahead with its
Sheraton brand - there will be openings in Kuala Lumpur in 1996, and a
second site in Bangkok - it is developing a four-star brand for Asia,
specifically for China. 'They will service the growing indigenous population
of businesspeople,' says a spokesperson.
Omni, the Asian four-star hotel operator, is also expanding into China. By
the end of next year it will open an Omni Marco Polo hotel in Xiamen, Fujian
province, in southern China, an old trading port and strong secondary city
halfway between Hong Kong and Shanghai.
'It's an old Taiwanese homeland, so there's high Taiwanese investment,'
explains Michael Hobson, vice president, sales and marketing, of Omni Asia
Pacific, talking about the financing of the project.
Omni's three hotels on Kowloon side, Hong Kong, are part of the Harbour City
Complex which has restaurants, offices and 1,000 shops. Likewise, its newest
property, in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, which opened in February this year,
is also a mixed use project. The group is also looking for a suitable site
in Hanoi, a city in desperate need of more, good hotels. At present the
Metropole, a Sofitel-managed hotel, is the only western-style hotel in the
city
Choice, the US mid-market hotel operator, is pushing ahead with budget
accommodation in Asia, with the biggest thrust in Thailand. There is a
serious lack of 'dependable accommodation below the five-star luxury level'
there, claims Brendan Ebbs, senior vice president of Choice's International
Division. Six budget Sleep Inn hotels are on the drawing board for Thailand,
while its Quality (three star), Comfort (two/three star) and Clarion (four
star) brands are already represented in nine properties in Thailand. The
opening of a Clarion resort this summer at Trang, near the Malaysian border,
makes 10. The chain will open its first hotel in China: a Clarion, near
Shanghai, this summer.
Other budget hotel groups operate in the region. Southern Pacific Hotels is
opening a three-star property, the Ancol Travelodge, in Jakarta in October
this year (dubbed 'the Disneyland of Indonesia' by spokesperson Bob James):
a 310-room city resort located near the harbour. It will be marketed as a
gateway to the 1,000 islands.
In Kuala Lumpur, Southern Pacific is augmenting its current hotel with the
opening, this December, of Travelodge Apartments, seeking to take advantage
of the long-stay market in the city. The apartments will be located in the
former race course site, being developed as a commercial centre called the
KL City Centre.
In a similar venture, Westin, the US chain, will open an all-suite hotel in
Bangkok early next year 'for the person who doesn't have to make a statement
 -the discreet traveller,' explains Dennis Johnson.
It seems that, at long last, the business traveller on a tight budget to
Asia will soon have a wider choice of hotels.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (7): Feeling at home - North
America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine coming home after a hard day at work to a round of cocktails in your
sitting room, then lighting a fire in the hearth and relaxing, looking out
over a garden courtyard.
Perhaps later in the evening you order the week's groceries by telephone,
and fix a light supper. In the morning the day's newspapers will be
delivered free to your door, and you look forward to sharing a
cooked-to-order breakfast, also free, with your neighbours.
If this does not sound exactly like home, that is because it is increasingly
the way US hoteliers make travellers feel at home away from home. Do not be
deceived by the perks, because this treatment is considered 'limited
service', and can be far less expensive than full-service hotels. For
business travellers required to make long sojourns at a single location this
trend is particularly good news, because rock-bottom prices become even
lower for extended stays.
A large part of this trend is the proliferation of 'all suite' hotels, which
offer separate living and sitting rooms, and often a mini-kitchen. This
arrangement is a boon to women business travellers who appreciate having a
separate bedroom and meeting area, and to families who can take advantage of
fold-out couches in sitting rooms and 'kids stay free' policies to trim
vacation costs.
After 11 years of consecutive losses, the US hotel industry made a profit in
1993, thanks to aggressive cost-cutting and a turn to no-frills properties
catering to travellers' budgets and comfort in equal measure.
Recovering from record Dollars 5.2bn in losses in 1991, the US hotel
industry is clawing its way back. Mr. Bjorn Hanson, chairman of the National
Hospitality Consulting Group from the international consulting firm Coopers
&amp; Lybrand, says that big debt restructuring, tax relief, and significant
reductions in management costs have earned the industry some breathing room.
He estimates that debt restructuring alone will save the industry some
Dollars 2bn a year. But he believes that return to profitability will not
result in significantly more hotels, but in smarter marketing strategies.
His data show that for each dollar of revenue, a hotel earns 75 cents profit
per room. In food service, a hotel makes only 18 cents profit on each dollar
of restaurant income.
As a result, new hotels, mostly in suburban locations, are leaving out
in-house restaurants and the lobby bar, and asking guests to visit nearby
restaurants for dinner.
The savings are so great to the hotels that management usually throws in a
complimentary breakfast for guests' convenience, and in some cases a free
afternoon cocktail hour.
The strategy is catching on quickly. Smith Travel Research reports that
nearly 50 per cent of new hotel rooms which opened in the US in 1992 were
suites, appealing to the more up market traveller and another 14 per cent
were moderately-priced limited service hotels.
Large US hotel chains, still operating flagship full-service properties, are
diversifying under separate brand names into all-suite, all-suite
extended-stay, and economy class reduced-service chains. Often the big
operators are buying existing hotels and coverting them to the suite
concept, with substantial cost savings.
The leader in the suite hotel concept is Embassy Suites, with 109 properties
in 31 states, and international hotels under development in Bangkok,
Thailand and in Mexico.
Owned by Memphis-based Promus, Embassy Suites caters to upscale business and
leisure travellers. Two-room suites, two telephone lines, mini-kitchens,
free breakfast and cocktails are standard at the properties, which are
priced according to location but average between Dollars 99 to Dollars 115
per night.
Other expanding all-suite chains include Guest Quarters Suite Hotels, and
Crown Sterling Suites. The extended-stay segment of the all-suite hotel
market is dominated by Residence Inns, property of international hotelier
Marriott.
Residence Inn offers studios with 50 per cent more room than the normal
hotel room, and at least 75 per cent of the rooms include fireplaces. Free
breakfast and cocktail hour and free local telephone calls are standard,
while services like grocery shopping, meal delivery, and laundry are also
available. Marriott has 179 of these properties scattered around the US.
Promus is also competing for the long-term visitor, with its Homewood Suites
offering similar amenities. The industry's definition of 'extended stay' is
five or more nights.
However, Marriott research shows that the average stay is 13 nights, and
that international visitors stay an average of 26 nights at its Residence
Inns. Prices range from Dollars 75 to Dollars 105 per night and are lower
for longer stays.
The US has a proliferation of budget motel chains, often strung out under
the glare of freeway lights close to airports and suburban shopping areas.
However, a new generation of economy hotels has arrived. These generally
have the benefits of new construction, with spacious rooms, key-card
security, and cheerful lobbies where generous free breakfasts are served
buffet-style to guests.
Owned by the larger hotel chains, these properties usually allow children to
stay free; allow three or four adults to stay at a two-person rate; and
offer special price packages for senior citizens. Managed to appeal to
low-budget business travellers and leisure travellers on their way to
vacation destinations, these hotels are typically priced between Dollars 40
and Dollars 50 per night.
Marriott's Fairfield Inn and Promus's Hampton Inn hotels are typical of this
class. Both these chains were started in the mid-1980s. Hampton Inn now has
376 hotels in 44 states, while Fairfield Inn has more than 130 properties in
37 states.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (8): Star chefs are in a
transfer market - Nicholas Lander investigates the phenomenal rise to fame
of the hotel restaurant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Edwardian gourmet, Colonel Newnham-Davis, gastronomic correspondent
of the Pall Mall Gazette before the first world war, were to return to
London today he would not be too surprised at the location of some of the
capital's finest restaurants. Eighty years ago he was accustomed to dining
in splendour at the Savoy, the Ritz, Claridges or the Berkeley. These hotels
still prosper, but if Newnham-Davis were to pick up the 1994 Michelin Guide
he would see that, in the gastronomic league table, their dining rooms have
been surpassed by other hotel restaurants. Two of London's three two star
Michelin restaurants are in Forte-owned hotels - Chez Nico at the Grosvenor
House and the restaurant at the Hyde Park.
The third, Le Gavroche, supplies meals to the bedrooms upstairs at 47 Park
Street, part of the Demeure hotel group. Of the 11 one star Michelin
restaurants in London, five are in big West End hotels - the Capital, the
Connaught, the Oak Room at Le Meridien, Piccadilly, the Four Seasons at the
Four Seasons hotel, and the Oriental at the Dorchester.
This phenomenon of the impressive hotel restaurant is not confined to
London.
Monte Carlo boasts the Hotel de Paris (where the chef is Alain Ducasse);
Washington DC has the Watergate (chef Jean-Louis Palladin); San Francisco
has Postrio in the Prescott Hotel (chef Wolfgang Puck). Dallas is home to
the Mansion on Turtle Creek (chef Dean Fearing).
In France, the country's most highly-esteemed chef, Joel Robuchon, has moved
out of his own restaurant, Jamin, to take over the kitchens and restaurant
at Le Parc Victor Hugo, another Demeure hotel.
The most surprising thing about this transformation has been the speed with
which it has taken place.
Hotel dining rooms used to be, with one or two exceptions, dull and
uninviting - and almost invariably empty. They stood as necessary but
uncared-for appendages to supply the much more profitable banqueting suites
and room service to the bedrooms.
In 1971, when 27 hotels opened in London as a result of the bedroom building
subsidy granted by the then Labour government under the premiership of
Harold Wilson, just two hotels were renowned for the excellence of their
food: the Connaught and the Savoy.
The Savoy's head chef, Silvano Trompeto, was the only well-known hotel chef.
Hotels in those days had dining rooms, not restaurants; and many
newly-opened hotels in the 1970s opted for 24 hour coffee shops, followed
the American fashion.
David Levin was the first to challenge this.
He opened the Capital Hotel in Knightsbridge which, in the French tradition,
he called 'a restaurant with rooms' rather than a hotel with a dining room.
Across Hyde Park, hotel restaurants were given another shot in the arm by
the arrival of Anton Mosimann at the Dorchester - where he was actively
promoted by the controlling McAlpine family.
In 1974, Michelin produced its first red guide to the UK. Awarding stars to
hotel restaurants immediately identified the chefs.
For the first time, diners went to eat Michel Bourdin's food rather than
simply to dine at the Connaught - just as they went to discover what Peter
Kromberg was cooking at the Inter-Continental, or Bernard Gaume, at the
Hyatt Carlton.
Competition between the hotels was established, and the fires further
stoked, by annual appearancesin Michelin.
All the hotels needed was a separate kitchen for their prestigious new
restaurants and cash to buy the culinary stars. As with top footballers,
chefs are in a transfer market.
When Bruno Loubet decided to leave the Four Seasons hotel, having won a
Michelin star for his cooking, the hotel was able to replace him with
Jean-Christophe Novelli, who had won his own star in Hampshire.
Forte did the same thing twice, importing Nico Ladenis (and his two Michelin
stars) into the Grosvenor House, and Marco Pierre White (and his stars) into
the Hyde Park Hotel.
As international business hotels vie for column inches around the world, and
for local custom, a distinctive restaurant has become essential; as
important - although possibly for opposite reasons - as a swimming pool or
exercise rooms.
Michelin made it possible for all the hotels to compete, by making it clear
 -albeit as one of its many unwritten rules - that when a chef won a
Michelin star, that star was transferable. Hotels have adopted varying
tactics to keep their restaurants in the news. International Hotels' St
James Court boasts three different cuisines - Chinese, Provencal and
international - under one roof. It has just put on an Austrian food
festival, with one of that country's top chefs.
Over in Piccadilly, Le Meridien boasts a Michelin-starred chef in David
Chambers, but the hotel flies in Michel Lorain, a three star Michelin chef
in Joigny, France, as consultant and inspiration for its seasonal menus.
What has united international hotels and top chefs most closely, however,
has been the recession and the Gulf War. The consequent fall in conspicuous
consumption has forced hoteliers to try to make every inch of their
buildings pay. Chefs such as Ladenis, White and Robuchon, who prospered
during most of the 1980s, have been persuaded to sacrifice their
independence for the opportunity to continue cooking with such expensive
ingredients as foie gras, lobster and truffles.
For the chef, the association with a top hotel has also often brought with
it a well-oiled publicity department only too keen to promote his name, his
cookery books, and even his range of conserves.
Over the past five years the big transformation in London hotel restaurants
has been brought about via an association with a top chef. It has been an
expensive process and one whose heavy investment - in personnel,
refurbishment and new crockery - may not yet be showing a substantial
return.
An alternative strategy, pioneered by Bill Kimpton in California, may hold
the solution for London's hotel restaurants in the future. His company,
Kimco Hotel &amp; Restaurant Management Company, now manages restaurants in 17
different hotels where it pays the hotelier a rent and a percentage of the
takings.
This arrangement has so far proved extremely successful for both the hotels
and restaurants. It would come as something of a shock to Colonel
Newnham-Davis.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (6): Funds for starters
 -Venture Capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The speciality of Mr Michael Mathiesen, a young Danish venture capitalist,
is making young companies grow, and despite his youth - he is only 34 - he
already has several successes to his name, writes Hilary Barnes.
In terms of the capital available, Mr Mathiesen's operation is minute, but
he thinks that the size of the capital available is less important than the
concept of venture capital which he is introducing to Denmark, arguing that
many venture capital companies have not been a success because their
starting point has been wrong.
Mr Mathiesen began his career when, not yet out of business school (which he
never completed), he founded a company, Dataco, in 1985 to produce a local
area network gadget, which enabled firms to network computers made by
different manufacture. In 1990 Dataco was sold for DKr400m, with a sizeable
proportion of the proceeds going to Mr Mathiesen.
He subsequently set up a venture capital company 2M Invest. Among 2M
Invest's other owners are the large, trade-union controlled pension fund,
the LD Fund, and the Association of Danish Engineers' Pension Fund.
The object of 2M Invest is to provide seed-funding to new companies, but
before he set the company up Mr Mathiesen first took a close look at how
venture funding works in the US and why it does not work well in much of
Europe.
The problem with European venture capital companies is very often that they
do not know enough about the industries in which they are investing, he
says.
Second, the venture capital companies often have large sums of money
available, but limited management resources. A gap develops between the
venture capitalists and the companies they are supposed to be nurturing,
with the venture capital managements trying to keep an eye on far too many
companies.
The fact that the venture capital companies - and it applies with even
greater emphasis to pension funds - often have very large sums of money
available also means that they do not have time or resources to invest in
small companies, so seed-funding of promising new companies becomes a
neglected area.
With 2M Invest, Mr Mathiesen aims to overcome these problems.
The company only invests in companies in the information technology industry
'because that is what we know about.'
Moreover, its managers 'all bear the scars of industrial experience,
otherwise the companies do not respect us'.
The portfolio, currently four companies, will be limited to 10 or 12
companies, so that each manager is supervising the progress of only three or
four companies and there is time to do more than just look at the financial
data.
'We blame other venture capital companies for not being close enough to the
companies, so we must be,' he said.
Other criteria for 2M Invest's investment are that the target company must
own or partly own its technology; the technology must have a global appeal;
and must be on the brink of a rapid growth in sales.
2M Invest expects to take companies from the start-up phase to a turnover of
Dollars 30m-40m, at which point they would become the target for
acquisitions or go public.
The companies in its portfolio now include three Danish and one American.
The Danish companies are:
Scanview, which manufactures image setters and scanners for the graphics
industry. It was founded in 1990. Turnover last year was about DKr100, and
budgeted turnover for 1994 is DKr175m. Mr Mathiesen sees Scanview as a
candidate for a Nasdaq listing in a year or two.
Hypercom is a Danish-British company set up in 1992 to produce and develop
software and hardware for multimedia broadcasting, a company which, Mr
Mathiesen believes has 'gigantic potential'.
Hypercom is providing the software for a new service by which CNN will
distribute Reuter financial news, using a teletext application enabling the
news to be received on a personal computer.
Exatec was founded in 1987 and has a turnover of DKr280m.
The company is part trading company in electronic components, part
development company with a team of design engineers who develop special
components for applications by electronics companies. A turnover of around
DKr600m within three years is predicted by Mr Mathiesen.
The American company, RadioMail, is a joint venture between its American
founder, Mr Geoffrey Goodfellow, Motorola and 2M Invest.
RadioMail provides the software for a wireless-based electronic mail system.
Using a pocket computer and a two-way wireless device, which come in a
zip-up case about the size of an airport paperback, users in America can
send and receive messages and documents from anywhere to anywhere at any
time.
The first RadioMail service base in Europe will be opened soon in the
Netherlands. RadioMail won the Mobile Advance of the Year prize at the San
Jose, California, Mobile '94 exhibition in March. With only 35 employees to
date, RadioMail, says Mr Mathiesen, has an exciting future.
Finally, through a second investment company, Eastern Business Investments,
Mr Mathiesen last year set up a company in St Petersburg, Russia. It
manufactures metal components for export to western Europe, with the sales
and marketing function taking place from Copenhagen.
The Russian company was opened just a year ago, and the Russian production
and Danish marketing concept is working, said Mr Mathiesen.
'The company is beginning to fly,' he says.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (4): Points scored -
Jyske Bank discloses more than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jyske Bank, the Jutland-based bank which ranks as the country's fourth
largest with assets of about DKr56bn, has long enjoyed the role of
provocateur, never losing an opportunity to score verbal points off the big
Copenhagen-based banks.
It has done it again this year. It has defied the recommendations of the
Bankers' Association and the Finance Supervisory Authority by disclosing
much more information about the bank in its 1993 annual report than the
supervisors recommend or other banks disclose.
Jyske's action has not met with universal acclaim, and some of the wind was
taken out of its sails by Unidanmark, which when it launched its
international equity issue in February had to disclose more information in
the prospectus than would have been required by an issue directed at
domestic investors).
There was just a touch of sour grapes in the comment from a senior manager
at Den Danske Bank, who pointed out that much more extensive disclosure
practices by the Swedish banks had not helped either them or their investors
to foresee the difficulties which the Swedish banks met in 1991-92.
The problem is not so much a general desire to restrict disclosure, however,
as the argument that the banks should first agree on what to disclose and to
ensure that the criteria for the information disclosed means that like can
be safely compared with like.
The problem is a long-standing one, and the Bankers'Association and the
Supervisory Authority are still working towards acceptable definitions and
standards.
Information which is not normally disclosed by Danish banks includes the
size of non-performing loans, the size of the contingency reserve (the sum
of past loss provisions after deduction of realised losses), lending by
business sectors, and a detailed analysis of credit policy and market risks
arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange gyrations, share
price movements, and liquidity risks.
'I'm blowed if I can see why we shouldn't tell our own shareholders and
customers as much as Unibank has to tell foreign investors,' said Jyske's
chief executive, Mr Kaj Steenkjaer, when he presented his bank's 1993 annual
report at the bank's headquarters in the mid-Jutland town of Silkeborg.
The report contains all the above information and more and he received an
accolade on the same occasion from the bank's biggest shareholder, the
representative of the ATP National Labour Market Pension Fund, for its
efforts to improve the transparency and informative value of its own
accounts.
Jyske demonstrated the courage of its convictions by increasing disclosure
at a time when it is still carrying heavy loss provisions, rather than
waiting for a year when everything looked wonderful.
Like all the banks, the bottom line improved last year. Jyske made a profit
of DKr429m compared with a 1992 loss of DKr919m. Loss provisions were cut to
DKr844m from DKr1.26bn in 1992, while realised and unrealised gains on
securities added Dkr708m to 1993 profits against a loss of DKr7m in 1992.
The bank's capital adequacy ratio is strong, with tier one capital at 8.1
per cent of risk-weighted assets and its total capital adequacy ratio at
10.9 per cent.
But non-performing credits, which were under one per cent of loans and
guarantees in 1989, climbed to 4.10 per cent from 3.4 per cent in 1992.
Loss provisions were still a relatively high 2.2 per cent of loans and
guarantees, though down from a peak of 3.1 per cent in 1992. We also now
know that Jyske Bank always has DKR2bn in liquid assets on hand to meet
day-to-day needs, or about five per cent of deposits.
At the end of last year it had liquid assets on hand to cover a period of 12
weeks in a worst-case situation, when no deposits were renewed. The message
seems to be clear: there's no need to rush.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (5): Technology helps
build bridge to the future - Profile of Laan &amp; Spar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For five years Mr Peter Schou has been preparing Laan &amp; Spar, a medium-sized
Danish retail bank, for a listing on the Copenhagen stock exchange.
The delay has been necessary first, to convert the bank to a limited company
from a self-governing institution. This was done in 1990 through a closed
issue of shares bought by 131 investors, including trade unions, pension
funds and other institutional investors.
The share issue was followed by a far-reaching transformation of Laan &amp; Spar
into a direct bank. To increase productivity distribution channels have been
changed. Three of nine branches have been closed and earlier investments in
information technology fully utilised. As a direct bank, L&amp;S' target
customers - white collar workers and academics - have been given access to
the bank by telephone, telefax, mail and later via modem.
Because of the bank's high interest margins, the bank realised that the new
distribution channel had to provide better prices than that of competitors
to attract new customers, even though it would be impossible to offer the
new discount pricing scheme to all existing customers.
The new distribution channel has made it possible for L&amp;S to make its system
more efficient. At the same time, the bank's line of products has been
reduced to create greater simplicity and transparency. Corporate customers
were excluded from the bank's targeted customer base.
Last year L&amp;S introduced a new service channel through diskettes. These
include application forms for loans, an interest rate survey of the top 37
banks, covering a period of four-years for all main products, information on
the costs of changing banks, personal tax calculation programmes and a
personal budget programme.
The diskette is run on a standalone personal computer and is distributed
free to existing and potential customers. Later this year in August, L&amp;S
plans to introduce Denmark's first home banking system on diskette.
Before the bank's transformation, the bank's profitability and capital base
were weak. Mr Schou has introduced a very tight risk management policy
permitting only limited currency dealing - foreign exchange currency is
limited to buying/selling of travel currency - and interest risks.
A structure was designed around the corporate leadership which would
implement the bank's changes. 'The cornerstone should be participative
management. The organisation itself should develop the process and changes
on a continuing basis,' Mr Schou explains.
This strategy was very successful and the profitability of L&amp;S allowed the
bank to facilitate the change in its ownership structure the following year.
'The average interest margin has been lowered to three per cent from 10 per
cent and, at the same time, distribution, production, credit and sales costs
have been reduced. This has led to bigger volumes and increased
profitability.' Mr Schou explains.
L&amp;S' capital base grew by more than 100 per cent through the closed share
issue, the company's name was changed and the direct bank concept was
launched publicly. The bank's new owners have indicated two main intentions:
to achieve as big a return as possible on the capital which they invested
and to maintain a decisive influence over the bank after it became listed on
the stock exchange.
Last year the bank's old programme and the new direct programme were merged
into a slimmed direct programme. At the same time the reduced number of
branches transformed into local direct banks which could attack their
regional markets while offering the same prices as the regional branches.
In 1873 Discount and Advance Payments Bank, as L&amp;S was earlier known, failed
in its first attempted launch on the stock exchange. According to Mr Schou,
a small circle of civil servants sought to benefit from attractive market
conditions to raise capital for lending activities directed towards their
peers.
The result was dismal. The bank attracted just DKr40,000. Seven years later
it merged with a thrift society. This month, L&amp;S expects to raise an
estimated DKr130m to add to the bank's reserves and to see its first trading
day on May 6 on the Copenhagen stock exchange.
Until 1960, the level of the bank's activity was relatively modest and it
did not experience any real growth until during the period 1960-88 when it
achieved assets of DKr1.4bn and was ranked number 42. Following the
management change and restructuring of the bank, L&amp;S has improved its
ranking to number 14 and its assets have grown to DKr4bn.
The first move by the new management team which took over following the
retirement of Mr Schou's predecessor as chief executive in 1988 was to
attempt to turn L&amp;S around. But this coincided with the start of a
recession. 'The missing profitability and capital base clearly showed that
everything had to be changed,' according to Mr Schou.
But the turnaround had to be undertaken in steps for it would have been
impossible for L&amp;S to attract fresh capital until profitability and
productivity could be documented over a period of a number of years.
Although a few of the bank's competitors have sought to imitate L&amp;S none
have managed to offer the same mix of distribution entities. The imitations
are purely telephone banks, he maintains.
'Laan &amp; Spar sees the mix of branches and the centrally-placed direct branch
as a bridge to the future. We believe that customers below 50 years of age
will get used to the direct bank (concept), while customers beyond 50 years
of age will be reluctant to become direct customers,' he said. The most
profitable private customers remain however, those older than 50.
This year L&amp;S' distribution and production systems are being trimmed further
and efforts have been directed towards quality improvements while
maintaining price competitiveness.
Earlier this year the bank's competitors introduced new fees, but L&amp;S was
able to maintain its four year-old fee level due to the success of its
streamlining concept.
The bank has budgeted for a 1994 pre-tax profit of DKr52.7m against DKr62.5
in 1993. The decline is mainly attributed to an increase in costs due to
expansion of production capacity and a fall in net interest income due to a
drop in interest levels from 1993 to 1994.
L&amp;S future strategy is to maintain its ability to convert large investments
in information technology into cost reductions, to continue to attract,
maintain and develop motivated and committed employees, to maintain its
ability to listen to its customers and the capability and quality of the
management in managing a company undergoing changes.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (5): Gender goes on the
agenda - The needs of women travellers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH WILKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Female business travellers are finally being treated like their male
counterparts and not as either inferior or non-existent guests.
Compared with 10 years ago, hotels are responding more positively to the
lone woman guest - and the woman host in hotel restaurants. Discrimination
still lingers, however, particularly with older staff, but examples are few
and far between in the mid-1990s.
It has been a long haul. Hotel amenities have slowly improved for women.
Hair dryers are the norm. There is better lighting; bathrobes; skirt
hangers; ironing boards; door spy holes and door chains. (These benefit the
male guest, too.)
But lobbying by the female travellers' sorority was not only about
amenities. Staff attitudes and certain procedures were also criticised.
Security issues were central. Allocating women rooms at the end of long,
dark corridors, for example, or reception staff loudly calling out room
numbers at the check-in desk, were two worries. Technological advancements -
such as plastic, numberless, computer-driven key cards presented in discreet
folders, and the disappearance of the key display behind the counter - have
helped reduce the latter concern.
At first, those few hotel operators bothered enough to take action went too
far, giving women special products and treatment which only served to
alienate those the hotels were trying to reach. (Ironically, Crest's  - now
owned by Forte - 'female rooms', called Lady Crest, were requested more
frequently by male guests than by their target customers.)
The Victoria and Albert hotel in Manchester offers a ladies' wing monitored
by video cameras and equipped with panic buttons. Women do not want to be
singled out for special treatment; this can be patronising. What they want
is equal treatment in service and courtesy offered - and not to be ignored.
'The thing which really annoys me about hotels is that I always get the room
with the longest walk to the lift and, in a restaurant when I'm entertaining
a man, unless you make it clear that you're the host, the waiter inevitably
presents the bill to the man,' says Julia Clark, a public relations
consultant.
Hotels are now at least finding out what female travellers want. Surveys
abound - most of which conclude with what women have been saying all along:
'Treat us the same.' One such survey was undertaken by Hyatt Hotels &amp;
Resorts earlier this year. 'Women don't want preferential treatment, they
want just the same recognition as men,' explains Jim Evans, senior vice
president, sales and marketing, for Hyatt Hotels Corporation.
The survey highlights the fact that extra security is important, and so are
services such as extended room service hours and valet service, a choice of
informal venues where women can enjoy a drink without feeling
self-conscious, and the request for better in-room amenities. 'Many of these
services are also appreciated by male business travellers, so additional
services are added because of, but not specifically for the female business
traveller,' says the survey.
American businesswomen travelling in the US have a better time of it; US
hotels woke up to this new market sector years ago. Women now account for an
astonishing 40 per cent of the total US travel market (Hyatt reckons a more
conservative 25-30 per cent) and, on a global basis, a figure of about 25
per cent - and growing fast. By the year 2000, only six years away, it is
estimated that women will represent half the business traveller market. In
the UK, American Express reckons the women's market share is nearly 20 per
cent of all travellers.
In a hotel market hit by recession, travel suppliers are putting gender on
the agenda. Smaller, less impersonal, 'boutique' hotels, many managed by
women, or with a higher proportion of female management, have eased the
problem. So has women's improved confidence; they are more likely to be
vocal - and to vote with their feet.
Restaurants, often the domain of older staff whom changes in society may
have passed by, remain an area of concern.
Most have not had the experience of treating women on an equal footing and
prove impervious to change. Ramon Pajares, general manager of the Four
Seasons Inn on the Park hotel in London, stresses that older staff need more
training. It is commonplace for a woman dining alone to be given the worst
table in the house - next to the lavatory or the kitchen door. No wonder
most women take room service and an in-room movie for their evening's
entertainment.
The emergence of hotel executive floors has alleviated this to an extent;
the better ones offer complimentary canapes in a small, friendly lounge area
 -a far better option than being snubbed in a public restaurant.
Wine waiters are good at snubbing women - they tend to offer the wine to the
male guest to taste, although the female host has just ordered it.
Similarly, there is still a tendency to give the bill to the male guest,
although it was the woman host who asked for it - and, finally, to return
the credit card, clearly bearing the name of the female owner, to her male
guest.
But if this is the last hurdle, then female business travellers have at
least made progress.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (2): Forget the rudimentaries
 -Paul Taylor investigates developments to attract the business traveller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advances in portable computing and mobile telecommunications over the past
decade mean that many business travellers now arrive in the hotel lobby
carrying a shoulder-bag of high tech gadgets including notebook PC, modem
and perhaps even a cellular telephone.
Large hotel chains on both sides of the Atlantic recognise that many guests
are no longer satisfied with rudimentary centralised business facilities
such as front desk telex machines, aged photocopiers and outdated
switchboards.
At the very least, many business travellers now expect a business centre
furnished with the latest telecommunications, printing and PC equipment. And
some are demanding at least some of these facilities in their rooms.
In the 1990s, when productivity and efficiency are corporate bywords, an
increasing number of travelling businessmen and women are sending a clear
message to hoteliers that they will no longer tolerate bed-side telephones,
cramped desks, inadequate lighting and inaccessible power sockets. Today,
they expect to be able to turn their hotel rooms into offices capable of
communicating directly with the outside world.
The Hyatt Hotels group is one of the chains which has acknowledged and
responded to this demand. Earlier this year, Hyatt announced that all 85 of
its US and Canadian business hotels would provide its 'Business Plan'
facilities by the end of March.
Hyatt's business plan facilities include facsimile machines in every guest
room, and business equipment including desktop computers, laser printers,
photocopiers and office supplies accessible 24-hours-a-day, on every
Business Plan floor.
In addition, Business Plan guest rooms feature large desks, a desk telephone
with computer hook-up and enhanced lighting. The desk lamp even has a power
outlet on its base so that guests do not have to dive under the desktop to
find a socket to plug in their portable PC power adapters.
Hyatt charges its Business Plan guests an extra Dollars 15 a day on top of
room rate for the additional facilities - which also include complimentary
local 800-number and credit card telephone access. If the programme proves
successful, it will be extended to Hyatt hotels overseas.
The Chicago-based hotel group developed the business plan after a telephone
survey of 500 business customers revealed that 72 per cent feel more
'pressure to produce' on business trips than they did five years ago. 58 per
cent said they spent 'more time working in their hotel rooms than they did
five years ago.'
Other international hotel groups have also begun to respond to these
pressures. In the UK, all six Inter-Continental and Forum hotels have
recently added an extensive range of new products and facilities aimed at
the international business traveller.
These include state-of-the-art business centres, voice mail systems and
other advanced telecommunications facilities such as mobile telephone hire.
For example, last year the George Inter-Continental in Edinburgh installed
what it claims is the most advanced telephone system in operation in any
Edinburgh hotel. Facilities include two telephone lines in each guest room,
enabling in-room facsimile services, the allocation of individual private
telephone numbers for incoming calls to guests, automatic checkout from
guest rooms, and a sophisticated television messaging system.
However, the most extensive refurbishment, totalling Pounds 9.5m, is taking
place at the Churchill Inter-Continental in London. It includes installation
of a new Club Inter-Continental 'executive floor' modelled on a concept
introduced by Inter-Continental in the Pacific/Asia region two years ago.
Guests staying on the Club floor (which was officially opened at the
Churchill earlier this month) have their own swift check-in/check-out
facilities on the floor. Multi lingual staff are available to assist with
business and travel arrangements.
Each Club floor guest room features a dedicated fax/modem line in addition
to an international direct dial telephone line - fax machines are available
on request and are supplied in all suites. Transatlantic travellers in
particular will appreciate the dual 110/220 voltage power sockets in each
room.
By providing such specialised business facilities, hotels hope that they
will retain a competitive edge over their rivals and continue to attract the
all-important business traveller. Features such as extra telephone lines and
in-room facsimile machines certainly provide the business traveller with
added convenience. Others make hotel bedrooms more 'office-friendly'.
Nevertheless, technology is already helping the seasoned traveller overcome
many of the limitations of less well-endowed establishments.
For example, portable high-speed fax-modems - including some which plug into
the credit-card sized PCMCIA slots on the newer notebook computers - now
enable portable PC users to send and receive facsimile message directly from
their screens via a standard telephone line.
If secure voice-only telecommunications are required, then the business
traveller will soon be able to use one of the new pan-European GSM-standard
digital cellular telephones to make a telephone call almost anywhere in
Europe.
Where hard-copy paper print-outs are required, lightweight high quality
portable printers are now available, as are notebook PCs with in-built
ink-jet printers - such as, for example, those from Canon - and portable
facsimile machines.
But despite miniaturisation, squeezing all this gear into a shoulder-bag -
let alone operating it - can require considerable skill and cunning, and
lifting the bag may still require weight-training.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (3): 'Come back and see us' -
Repeat business has become a high priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As competition has intensified in the hotel market, so also have the
hoteliers' efforts to retain their existing customers. Loyalty programmes
have become an integral part of the international hotel industry's
operations.
More attention to service, room rate discounts, special packages and
subsidised restaurants have always been a part of the industry to a greater
or lesser extent.
But the ferocity of the recession has focused attention on what may have
once been considered marginal extras, and many chains have now attempted to
quantify these into a package designed to retain customer loyalty.
The basic tenet of all the programmes is that the more frequent the stay,
the higher the reward for the customer. Airline flights, car hire,
restaurant meals, and sporting facilities were the main benefits originally
offered to encourage repeat business. All of these items are now included in
the large number of loyalty packages employed by the luxury hotel chains.
And in the drive to make the programmes more 'personalised', intrinsic
services such as newspapers delivered to rooms, room upgrades, cheque
cashing, express reservations and check-in have become prerequisites.
Marriott, the big US international hotelier, was a pioneer of loyalty
programmes. Its Honored Guest Award scheme - begun in 1983, now with 5m
members worldwide - is typical of the genre.
Members earn points during each Marriott stay which can be exchanged for
travel awards. And in line with recent developments, the hotel has joined
with a variety of associated organisations to make the programme more
attractive: British Airways, Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA and USAir
are some airlines included. Car rental, cruise ships and associated hotel
groups are also involved.
It is a similar story at Holiday Inn Worldwide: its Priority Club has a
membership of 4m. Mr Ken Pierce, vice-president for Worldwide Frequency
Marketing at the company, says that one positive benefit has been the huge
amount of information and feedback from their most frequent customers. 'The
customers now have a reason for telling us exactly what they want, simply
because they now have an incentive for returning.'
'Loyalty programmes work for the very frequent traveller, and for the hotels
there is evidence that they do build some degree of loyalty,' says Mr Rik
Danielson, managing director, sales and marketing, at Forte. 'But there is
no evidence of them stealing market share.'
Mr Pierce agrees. 'Marriott's launch in the US did initially give it an
advantage, but now everyone's doing it and the advantage has slipped away.'
He adds: 'Whether it's a zero sum game is a subject of hot debate in the
industry. You can reach a level of parity, but the programmes give an
organisation the chance to maximise its strengths.
'In the case of companies such as Holiday Inns, we capitalise on being in a
large number of locations, against a smaller or regional operator. And there
are other situations where our huge distribution ability gives us the
advantage.'
Mr Danielson worries that too much time and effort might be put into loyalty
programmes at the expense of other services. 'The industry battlefield is
loyalty programmes, there's no doubt about that. But the question we must
keep asking is: are we spending too much on these at the expense of basic
services? Another flaw with these programmes is that they are designed only
to keep customers, not to entice new ones.'
Despite these misgivings, most industry executives agree that loyalty
programmes are here to stay. Mr Pierce believes the future will see
competition between programmes intensifying.
'The programmes are likely to become more focused as databases grow in
detail. This will lead to a shift in advertising as less expenditure is put
into broad advertising coverage and more into individualised schemes.'
He also believes that partnerships between hotels and other organisations,
to attract and retain customers, will grow and incorporate a whole new range
of retail groups.
Mr Danielson foresees fewer customers at the top level, but a sector of
customers who are more selective. 'What makes today's customers different is
that they really expect to receive value for money,' he says.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (4): Smaller venues work
better - Christopher Price finds that conferences provide a safety net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While discounted room rates and empty beds have become the norm during one
of the industry's worst downturns, conferences have emerged as a vital part
of many hotels' financial well-being.
As a result, many hotels are expanding their facilities and increasing
investment in an attempt to win a bigger market share. The importance of the
conference business should not be underestimated. For a primary business
centre hotel, industry estimates put earnings from conference business at
between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of total revenues. (Those in the
industry stress that these revenues are additional and do not displace other
sources of income.)
They are particularly important out of season, and one of the main
developments has been in the type of venues required. 'Meetings used to be
held in very large venues in big gateway centres,' says Ms Cam Cooper,
vice-president of conference sales at Holiday Inns. 'Now the trend is
towards regional and secondary market meetings.'
Mr Rik Danielson, managing director of sales and marketing at Forte, says
the demand for conferences - and for a wider variation in venues - is partly
the result of advances in information technology. 'Training and information
conferences have become the important way to re-tool for the 1990s.'
While demand has, in the words of one hotel company executive, been 'solid'
during the recession, there are signs that the recovery will give the
conference trade a further boost. Meridien Hotels, the French-owned
international group, reports a doubling of conference inquiries in the past
year, and a similar rise in converted bookings. Two-thirds of the
confirmations are in Europe.
Mr Danielson believes this is also because conference organisers put more
emphasis on quality than on getting reduced prices. In a recent poll of
organisers conducted in the US, the most important requirements from hotels
were also the most basic: good-sized well-fitted meeting rooms, basic
materials such as projectors and stationery, and efficient service. The
package price was well down the list.
Not surprisingly, hotels are concentrating their efforts on improving their
service, while at the same time trying to keep ahead of the opposition. All
the big international hotel chains have moved to coordinate their conference
business.
For example, Holiday Inns has introduced its Conference Network system which
aims to underline the group's consultancy role.
Videoconferencing is one area being given much attention, as are more basic
items such as en suite fax and video facilities in all meeting rooms.
Incentive travel is another source of additional income allied to the
conference business. Travellers are often participants in VIP packages and
receive corresponding service. 'Consequently the hotels enjoy the revenue
from banquets, gala dinners and special themed events taking place under
their roof,' says Ms Sarah Webster, executive director of the UK-based
Incentive Travel and Meetings Association, 'plus all the extras from room
service'.
However, there are some elements of concern in the industry. The number of
venues offering meetings facilities has grown significantly and, despite
reports of growing demand, some hoteliers privately tell an opposite story
of intensifying competition and consumers beginning to shop around for the
best deals.
The growing trend to hold shorter meetings is undermining the lucrative
accommodation spin-off.
Running costs are also high, and there are worries that a rash of special
package deals introduced by some of the large chains to fight off smaller
more flexible - and cheaper - rivals, may become the norm.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (2): Big banks
reluctant to pick up the tab - An official commission of inquiry is due to
report later this year on bank rescues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Danish commercial and savings banks have usually been able to absorb
banks which have run into serious trouble without much fuss and without
losses to depositors or other creditors but the process has gradually become
more difficult.
After a long recession and pressure on their own earnings, the big banks are
now reluctant to take over banks which are heading for bankruptcy because of
incompetent management.
As Mr Poul J. Svanholm, chairman of Den Danske Bank's supervisory board (he
is chief executive of the Carlsberg Brewery group as well) told Danske's
annual general meeting of shareholders in March: 'It is unacceptable for our
shareholders if we have to pick up the tab for losses incurred by
incompetent managements at other banks.'
Danske is strong enough to pick other banks off the floor, but it already
has a one third share of the domestic market. Apart from the question of
losses to its shareholders, it does not feel that it should grow larger by
acquisitions, said Mr Knud Sorensen, its chief executive. Unidanmark, is no
more anxious to take over ailing banks than Danske, says Mr Thorleif Krarup,
chief general manager.
Since 1984, according to Mr Eigil Molgaard, director general of the state's
finance industry supervisory authority, a total of 51 banks has ceased to
exist.
Most have been absorbed by other banks. Only four have gone bankrupt. In no
case did depositors lose their money, but in the cases when banks went
bankrupt, stock and bondholders did.
There were two notable bank closures in 1993, and the events which led to
the closures did nothing to improve the prestige of the banking world with
the general public. The two banks were Himmerlandsbanken and Varde Bank. At
Himmerlandsbanken, serving the north Jutland town of Hobro, most of the
assets were taken over by Spar Nord, the north Jutland savings bank, while
the rest of the bank went bankrupt.
Varde Bank, based in the west Jutland port of Esbjerg, was the country's
10th ranking bank with assets of about DKr12bn.
It is being wound up after most of its assets were taken over by Sydbank,
the south Jutland savings bank. Both banks tried to strengthen their capital
adequacy ratios by selling bonds to their local customers, many of whom did
not realise that a bank bond carries a degree of risk which is not
associated with mortgage or treasury bonds.
The bondholders have lost their investments (so have the shareholders). The
government reacted by ruling that in future banks may not lend money to
their customers to buy bonds in the customer's own bank. As Sydbank took
over more liabilities than assets from Varde Bank, Varde Bank had to pay
Sydbank for the acquisitions. This required loans to Varde Bank by the
Central Bank. The Central Bank loans to Varde Bank-in-liquidation total
DKr4bn.
In return for the Folketing's (Parliament's) approval of the rescue plan for
Varde Bank, the government agreed to set up an official commission with a
directive calling on it to set out models by which in future the banking
sector itself will finance the liquidation of troubled banks.
The commission is not expected to report until later this year.
In the meantime, an important change has been made in the rules governing
the banks' and savings banks' Depositor Guarantee Fund, which may help to
smooth the way for bank liquidations.
The fund, which is financed by the banks themselves. guarantees that no one
with net deposits in a bank of under DKr250,000 will lose money if a bank
goes bust. Hitherto, the fund has only been able to guarantee depositors
against loss.
The change in the fund's rules now enable the fund to issue guarantees or
funds to provide for the ordered winding up of a bank, if this would be
cheaper for the fund than having to meet claims from depositors after a
bankruptcy. The banks feel strongly, as Mr Knud Sorensen, chairman of the
Banker's Association, says, that whatever conclusion the official commission
into bank rescue methods arrives at, it must avoid setting up a system with
a built-in safety net.
'A bank must be able to go bankrupt. The risk must exist, and it must be
clear to managements and supervisory boards, and they must be prepared to
take the necessary steps to prevent their bank from collapsing. If the risk
is removed, we shall see banks doing some stupid things, to the detriment of
the banking sector as a whole and in the last resort to the detriment of the
state budget,' he said.
He would support a strengthening of the powers of the Supervisory Agency. He
thinks, for example, that it may be necessary to give the supervisors powers
to dismiss the management and supervisory board of a bank which is heading
for bankruptcy and where the management is not doing enough to stop the rot.
The debacle at Himmerlandsbanken had other consequences as well. Spar Nord
was convinced (and so was the public when Spar Nord published a telefax
which it received from the government) that it was promised a DKr173m
tax-write off for taking over most of Himmerland's assets.
When the terms of the deal slipped out, accountants pointed out that while a
tax write-off is legal and correct when one company takes over another
company in its entirety, a write-off, such as the one Spar Nord is claiming,
is not legal when only part of the assets of a company are being acquired.
The possibility that the government had committed a breach of the law of the
land prompted a right-wing populist politician, Mrs Kirsten Jacobsen, of the
Proess Party, to start a hue and cry against the tax minister, Mr Ole
Stavad, a Social Democrat, who approved write-off.
Mr Stavad's political life is still in the balance, but the government was
able to postpone a show-down with the opposition. It set up a commission of
inquiry into who said and knew what during the weekend in August when Spar
Nord extracted the write-off from a government desperate to avoid a
bankruptcy and all the complications for local business which this would
have caused.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (3): Prudent lending
policy pays off for shareholders - Profile of Danske Bank

<TEXT>
Both of Denmark's largest banks, Den Danske Bank and Unidanmark, are the
result of the merger, in 1990, of the country's six largest banks into two
domestic giants.
But there the similarity ends. Unidanmark (a merger of Privatbanken, the
savings bank, SDS, and Andelsbanken) has been plagued by heavy losses. The
bank is now recovering under the management of Mr Thorleif Krarup, brought
in from outside in late 1992, and after a highly successful international
equity issue this spring it has been well-placed to take advantage of the
coming upswing.
Danske (a merger of Danske Bank, Copenhagen Handelsbank and Provinsbanken),
on the other hand, has emerged from the recession years as the biggest,
strongest and most profitable of the larger banks. Danske's assets at the
end of 1993 were DKr356bn compared with Unidanmark's DKr242bn. Danske made a
net profit of DKr2.4bn in 1993 to Unidanmark's DKr885m.
Even more striking is a comparison of profits over the entire recession
period, 1987-1993.
Danske made profits of DKr5.7bn, while Unidanmark made losses of DKr2.6bn.
Danske's equity capital peaked at DKr22.5bn in 1989, slipping to DKr20bn in
1993. Unidanmark's peaked at DKr18.6bn in 1989 and was down to DKr11.5bn at
the end of last year.
The difference lies in their respective lending policies. Danske (when it
was known as Landsmandsbanken) collapsed in 1920 and had to be rescued by
the state. It appears to have been permeated by a conservative ethos ever
since.
This has shown up in the loss provisions as a percentage of loans and
guarantees, which peaked at just over 2 per cent in 1990 and fell to 1.4 per
cent in 1993. Unidanmark's peaked at 4.5 per cent in 1992 and were down to
2.7 per cent in 1993.
With a 35 per cent share of the domestic market (measured by assets), Danske
does not wish to become larger - except by organic growth - according to its
chief executive, Mr Knud Sorensen. But the bank is not, therefore, without
ambitions. Mr Sorensen electrified listeners at a banking conference held in
Copenhagen recently by business newspaper Borsen, when he declared:
'With regard to new business areas, insurance and mortgage credit, we see no
reason why, over a period of years, we should not obtain a market share
which is equivalent to our share of the banking market.'
Mr Sorensen says that by this he also meant organic growth, and he was not
intending to say that Danske plans to take over the Baltica insurance group,
although he does not rule that out.
If other buyers for Baltica cannot be found, Baltica may land in Danske's
unwilling lap.
Barring acquisitions, Danske has a long way to go to win a one-third market
share of either insurance of mortgage credit. Its market shares in accident
insurance, life and pension assurance and mortgage credit are still under 1
per cent.
Nevertheless, the bank's insurance and mortgage credit operations (it has
two wholly-owned insurance companies, a life and accident company, as well
as a general insurance company jointly owned with Codan) are a sign of the
times. Danske - together with the other larger banks - is meeting
competition for its customers' money by offering customers the opportunity
to do insurance and mortgage financing with the bank.
(The insurance companies, of course, are doing the same, setting up banks in
order to attract savings accounts from their insurance customers.)
Mr Sorensen's lecture was an interesting expose of the bank's basic approach
to business - a contribution to the growing literature which takes exception
to the strategic planning approach to business management.
'The world is unpredictable, forecasts are usually wrong,' said Mr Sorensen.
'Instead of plans, which can never be kept, we try to maintain a permanent
preparedness to meet change . . . to react constructively to unexpected
developments, exploit opportunities which suddenly appear.'
But, he went on, there is only one form of growth that interests the bank:
growth in profitability, with net profits as a return on capital of about 10
per cent as a desirable level.
The bank achieved a return on equity last year of 13 per cent - 'But I am
afraid to say that in 1994 and the immediate years to come we cannot expect
to obtain a return of anything like the same level,' he said. 'A given level
of business, including the number of branches and staff, is in principle
only desirable if it brings a satisfactory return on the capital which our
shareholders have made available to us,' he added.
It may sound routine to Anglo-Saxons, but it sounds notably hard-headed to
Scandinavian ears, where the interests of shareholders are often balanced
against those of the employees and the community at large.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (1): Service now worth having
 -While recovery in the hotel market has been patchy, the message of the
past few years is clear: hotel guests are demanding better service for less
money. Even when the world economy has fully recovered, this trend is likely
to survive

<TEXT>
During the 1980s, hotels around the world treated their guests so lavishly
that people joked that the next treat would be a BMW on your pillow.
By the early 1990s, hotel executives had stopped smiling and so had their
guests. The Gulf War was followed by recession in the US and Europe. Hotel
room rates fell, managers in many businesses lost their jobs, other feared
they would do so, and everyone started cutting their travel expenses.
Hotel business has now picked up in North America, London, and in much of
Asia, where the downturn had not been so severe. The question hotel
executives are asking is whether their guests will return to the
free-spending habits of the 1980s, or whether their behaviour has changed
for good.
Mr Peter George, chief executive, of the Ladbroke Group of the UK, which
owns the Hilton International chain, believes that hoteliers should not lose
sight of the principles of supply and demand. Hotel rates have been
depressed because rooms have been empty. When rooms are full again, rates
will rise, he says.
Mr Darryl Hartley-Leonard, the British-born president of Hyatt Hotels,
believes, however, that hoteliers need to be aware of a more fundamental
change. It is not just that hotel guests have been unable to afford
additional luxuries over the past few years. Even when they have more money
in their pocket, they will not want those luxuries, he believes.
In a speech to a conference three years ago, Mr Hartley-Leonard recounted
the BMW joke, and admitted that Hyatt had been as responsible as any other
organisation for the hotel excesses of the 1980s.
He said: 'The excesses of the 1980s have become socially unacceptable. We
simply need to wake up and take advantage of new times. 'Less is more'
doesn't mean quality has to deteriorate. It means that when you serve a
Bloody Mary, you don't have to serve a vegetable garden on top of it. Hyatt,
as much as any company, was responsible for growing that vegetable garden.
It seems that all of us kept piling more and more on to the customer until
it became crude.'
Three years on, Mr Hartley-Leonard believes the reaction against hotel
excesses will continue after an upturn in business.
'What happened in the US and what is happening in many parts of the world is
that an element of conservatism is coming in. In the 1970s and 1980s matters
got out of control. We created an unstable business environment. That has
caused a rejection of waste. Anything that is reminiscent of the excesses of
the 1980s is rejected as inappropriate,' he says.
Mr Michael Stajdel, senior vice president for marketing and strategic
planning at Inter-Continental Hotels, agrees, arguing that the change in
hotel guests' attitudes mirrors developments in sectors such as retailing.
Customers are not necessarily looking for the cheapest offer but they are
considering their purchases more carefully.
Mr Stajdel says: 'I don't think any consumer today shops the way he or she
used to. We have all changed the way we shop in the supermarket. I look at
the labels, the freshness of the goods, and at the overall cost.'
Mr Stajdel, who is based in London, believes hotel guests will pay for
services, if they believe they are worth having.
So what services do hotel guests value? Hyatt's research shows that while
hotel guests want choice, they do not need an excessive amount of it. They
expect hotel restaurants to have enough staff to ensure they can be served
promptly. Indeed, they want to spend less time in the restaurant than in the
past. Offered a choice between a wine list with 100 bottles on it and one
with 30, Hyatt says its guests opt for the smaller list.
There are some new services that hotels need to introduce because guests
constantly ask for them. Because 63 per cent of calls to its housekeeping
departments were for an iron and an ironing board, Hyatt decided it was
simpler to put these items in every room.
Hotels in North America, Europe and Asia agree that hotel guests want less
hassle and more time in which to work. Business travellers are expected to
do more work on their trips than ever before and they are even prepared to
pay extra for an environment which enables them to work more efficiently.
This has led to the appearance in hotels of a service which airlines have
been selling for years: special business sections for those prepared to pay
for them.
Business floors in hotels appeared in Asia some years back. Mandarin
Oriental, the Hong Kong-based hotel group, has such floors at its
establishments in Singapore, Manila and Jakarta, where guests have their own
check-in and check-out facilities and lounges, as well as facsimile machines
in every bedroom.
Inter-Continental, which also has business floors in Asia, has now begun to
introduce them in Europe. The first was in Frankfurt, and the second is in
London.
Mr Stajdel describes the floors as having 'the ambience of a private club.
It's intimate and clubby. There's a complimentary continental breakfast, a
business centre, and a library with reference books and magazines.' Guests
pay Dollars 25-Dollars 30 a night extra for the privilege.
Mr Stajdel admits that one of the incentives for introducing business floors
is that small, intimate 'boutique' hotels had been taking business away from
the large chains. He argues that business floors provide guests with the
intimacy and service of a small hotel, while still providing access to
facilities only available in a large establishment, such as a choice of
restaurants and a fitness centre.
Even those hotel guests not paying to stay on the business floors have
higher service expectations. Mr Hartley-Leonard says that they now want
efficient business services rather than lavish gifts, and they want messages
delivered on time and access to telephones and facsimile machines.
If hotels are to deliver these services while still achieving acceptable
levels of profits, they need to turn to technology to help them to do so.
Technology can help to reduce the amount of time that travellers waste in
hanging around.
At Hyatt's hotels at O'Hare airport in Chicago and in Atlanta, the company
has been testing automated check-in machines which, if successful, will be
introduced throughout North America. Mr Hartley-Leonard says the machines
are not designed to replace the reception desk, but to provide an
alternative for guests who want simply to collect their keys and go straight
to their rooms.
The device looks like a bank's automated teller machine. A guest with a
reservation inserts a credit card. Check-in information appears on the
screen, the guest taps a series of Yes or No buttons, and the machine
dispenses a room key.
Guests can also check out of the hotel by inserting a credit card into the
machine, which shows the expenses they have incurred during their stay and
prints out a copy of the bill.
Some people might regard the hotel checking-in machine as providing too
impersonal a welcome after a long trip. Mr Hartley-Leonard argues that the
same was thought about automatic cash dispensers. In time, these caught on.

FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of Danish Banking and Finance (1): Rescued by sound
ratios - The financial sector is changing, but Danish bankers can look back

has not had to step in

<TEXT>
The financial services sector in Denmark is in the throes of change.
Competition is intensifying as a result of the liberalisation sweeping
through the sector in Europe; the banks are moving into insurance and
mortgage credit business; the insurance companies are operating their own
banks; and there is tough competition from foreign banks for corporate
banking business.
Yet, while the challenges are the same as elsewhere in the region, Danish
bankers can look back on the last few years with satisfaction.
Losses have been incurred as a result of the recession and the collapse in
property prices, but unlike in other Nordic countries, the government has
not had to step in with rescue packages for any of the big banks.
The country's banks have been able to avoid the crises experienced elsewhere
in the region because of their unusually strong solvency ratios. As a result
of these, while the banking sector as a whole has suffered losses not
significantly different from the loss ratios in other Nordic countries, it
has been able, with a few exceptions, to sustain the burden.
'The worst appears now to be over,' says Mr Knud Sorensen, who in addition
to being chief executive of Den Danske Bank is chairman of the Bankers'
Association.
Last year the banks and savings banks together made a profit of DKr6bn
compared with a 1992 loss of DKr11bn. There was a similar improvement in the
performance of the rest of the financial industry, including the insurance
companies and mortgage finance institutions.
This performance took place against the background of a stable but slack
economy. The GDP growth rate in 1993, according to preliminary estimates,
was well under 1 per cent and demand for bank loans declined slightly. But
the economy is also showing underlying strengths. Inflation last year was
only about 1.2 per cent, and the current balance of payments account showed
a surplus of DKr34.7bn, or about 3.9 per cent of GDP. Furthermore, the
budget deficit is among the lowest in Europe.
The main cloud on the banks' horizon has been a disagreement, arising out of
the collapse of a small bank, which has soured the normally good relations
with the government. As a result future attempts to rescue banks which are
in trouble could be made more difficult.
Sparekassen Nordjylland (Spar Nord), a Jutland savings bank, claims that in
late-night negotiations last August the government promised it a tax
write-off of DKr173m in return for its taking over most of the assets of a
small, local bank, Himmerlandsbanken, which had run into difficulties. The
legality of the write-off was subsequently questioned, leading to
allegations by Spar Nord that the government had reneged on the promise. The
case is currently the subject of a commission of inquiry being held in
public in Copenhagen.
Yet, while the financial performance of the banks was better last year,
their performance was supported by very large realised and unrealised
capital gains arising from the increase in bond and share prices in Denmark
and from substantial earnings from currency turbulence last summer.
'Without these special circumstances, return on equity capital would have
remained weak and insufficient in the long run to attract the new capital
needed for expansion,' says Mr Sorensen.
The problems appear to be especially difficult for a group of middle-sized
regional banks. These lack the strength to compete with the largest Danish
banks or with foreign banks, argues Mr Bjarne Jensen, a former banker who is
now an independent consultant on the banking industry.
The difficulties are illustrated by the weak performance of four such banks
in recent years: Midtbank, which serves north-west Jutland; Sydbank, serving
southern Jutland; Amagerbanken, a Copenhagen bank; and Aktivbank, serving
east Jutland and wholly owned by insurance group Topdanmark.
As Mr Sorensen points out, the challenge which these and other banks,
including the strongest, face is how to get their core earnings (excluding
windfall profits of the sort earned in recent years) up to a more
satisfactory level, and how to reduce costs.
'Even with the most favourable conceivable development in the economy, costs
in the financial sector are going to be higher than is warranted by future
earnings potential.'
In an attempt to cut costs, reductions in staff and in the number of bank
branches are already being implemented. Attempts to strengthen income are
focusing on customer fees, with most of the larger banks announcing new
charges for bank transactions this spring. But, as Mr Jensen points out,
this is a delicate balancing act for the banks. Fees could easily reach a
level at which customers stopped using the banks' own plastic charge card,
the widely-used Dankort, and switched to credit cards.
Yet, while the banks have avoided serious problems up to now, and can
concentrate on building for the future, the same has not been true for
another important Danish financial sector, insurance. The industry is still
recovering from the blows inflicted on it when the country's then two
largest insurance groups, Baltica and Hafnia, collapsed in 1992-93 as a
result of ill-judged ventures by the two groups' holding companies.
Hafnia had been trying to gain control of Baltica and, together with
Norway's UNI Storebrand, of the Swedish insurance company, Skandia.
When the value of the strategic share investments which Hafnia made in these
two companies fell dramatically in 1992, Hafnia Holding's equity capital was
wiped out. Baltica's problems arose from property investments and high-risk
property-related lending by Baltica Bank, which was wound up last year.
Hafnia Holding filed for bankruptcy last year, and its insurance and other
operations were taken over by Codan, controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance,
which thereby became the country's largest company in accident insurance.
Baltica was restructured with the assistance of Den Danske Bank, but in the
meantime Baltica Insurance is left with an ownership problem.
Following last year's reconstruction, Danske owns 45 per cent of the capital
of Baltica: the former Baltica Holding (now known as Gefion) holds 32 per
cent; and Codan 14 per cent. Danske is currently trying to find a Danish or
foreign buyer or buyers for its own and Gefion's holdings. If these efforts
fail, Danske itself may have to take on the full ownership of the group.
Intense competition between Hafnia and Baltica in the late 1980s, until
1992, created a problem for the entire insurance sector. 'Competition meant
that premiums did not rise between 1988 and 1992, but indemnities did,' says
Mr Bent Knie Andersen, chief executive of insurance company Alm. Brand, and
chairman of the Association of Danish Insurance Companies. This year, at
last, there has been a general 10-15 per cent increase in premium prices.
'This is not pleasant for customers,' he says, 'but in the long run they,
too, are better off if the insurance companies are sound.'
Like the banks, mortgage credit institutions were hit by the recession and
falling property prices, but they recovered strongly in 1993. They play a
much bigger role in Denmark than in most countries, financing most mortgages
with bonds issued on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.
The two largest mortgage credit institutions, Nykredit, (assets DKr417bn),
and Realkredit Danmark, (assets DKr382bn), are not only larger than Den
Danske Bank, (assets DKr356bn), but among the largest mortgage credit
institutions in Europe. They are, however, meeting stiff competition from
the banks, which have started their own mortgage credit companies, while
they themselves are not permitted to open banks.
This may be one of the next structural reforms to take place.

FT  07 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in ICI recovered from recent weakness, improving 16 to 802p, as some
of the gloomier analysts appeared to be taking a more benign view of the
company.
Hoare Govett, a former company broker which has been consistently bearish,
argued that stabilisation in mainland Europe and a firmer base to the sector
might render ICI slightly more attractive.
Although he stressed he was not yet changing his stance, Mr Martin Evans of
Hoare said: 'Given anecdotal comments from the European chemical industry. .
. (ICI could) . . . surprise both internal and external observers by the
magnitude and momentum of the response to better trading conditions.'
Encouragement from a strong overnight performance on Wall Street fuelled
interest in the high profile debut of House of Fraser. The confidence that
fed into the UK market from New York encouraged institutions to take larger
positions in the new stock.
The shares closed at a premium of 6 1/2 to their issue price of 180p and
turnover of 22m shares was the second heaviest in London.
However, the initial performance of the largest flotation this year did no
more than match market expectations considering the favourable trading
conditions. And some analysts were slightly disappointed at the volume
traded.
Much of the business was conducted by SG Warburg, the company broker, and
most of the buying came from UK institutions.
Anticipation that Boots would sell its pharmaceutical division prompted
active trading in the stock. Interest was sharpened by Boots' appointment of
Credit Suisse to handle a future unbundling of the drugs arm. UBS was a keen
buyer of the stock. The shares added 12 at 519p in a turnover of 3.5m.
Confirmation by Associated British Foods that it was in talks to sell its
Baker's Oven chain of bakery outlets to Greggs pushed the AB Foods shares up
6 to 583p in thin turnover. Greggs was unchanged at 743p.
International conglomerate Hanson slipped 4 to 265p, with one US brokerage
said to have been an active seller.
Pharmaceutical group Glaxo improved 12 to 618p after recent underperformance
as the shares responded to earlier strength on Wall Street and the company
confirmed that Serevent, its anti-asthma treatment, went on sale in the US.
Media and leisure conglomerate Pearson languished after one investor sold a
block of 1.8m shares at 621p, well below the market price.
Analysts said the shares had outperformed the FT-SE-Actuaries All-Share
Index by more than 40 per cent over the past year in spite of recent falls,
and investors had used last week's purchase of Software Toolworks as an
opportunity to take profits.
Pearson closed 7 easier at 631p with 5.2m shares traded, unusually high for
the stock.
The oil sector passed what one specialist described as its first real
post-Opec test, with most oil issues moving ahead strongly after a resilient
performance by crude oil prices, which held comfortably above the Dollars 14
a barrel level.
Oil major British Petroleum rose 7 to 357p on turnover of 14m amid talk of
good US demand, while Shell Transport, after Hoare Govett reaffirmed its
positive stance on the stock, gained 9 at 671p.
Lasmo continued recent good performance, the shares adding 5 at 129p on 10m
dealt, after support from the UK and US.
Retail bank National Westminster, the worst performer in the FT-SE 100
relative to the FT-SE-Actuaries All-Share Index during the last quarter,
improved 7 to 476p amid talk of substantial switching out of Barclays. The
latter settled 3 firmer at 536p.
SG Warburg spearheaded a general advance by the merchant banks, closing 21
ahead at 778p, helped by the rally in markets in recent sessions.
Engineering group GKN put on 14 at 555p after Kleinwort Benson turned
positive on the stock. Several other brokers also bought the stock on a view
that the acquisition of Westland Group will enhance earnings.
Volume in aerospace and motor components group Lucas Industries jumped to
8.1m and the shares moved 4 ahead to 193p after Credit Lyonnais Laing
reiterated its buy recommendation. The broker was also a buyer of British
Steel -  3/4 up at 141 3/4 p on turnover of 9.3m - following a visit to the
company.
Hard hit Fisons rose 3 to 132p with the help of a buy recommendation from
BZW.
Bid speculation returned to Brent International as the shares gained 3 at
118 1/2 p. The improvement marked a 20 per cent rise in the troubled
chemical company's share price since its low just after announcing a reduced
dividend and profits in early March.
Good results off the field for Manchester United made up for recently lost
ground. The shares rallied 15 to 675p.
Hotel group City Centre added 3 at 82p on well-received figures.
Elsewhere, Stakis was heavily traded as nil-paid stock from the recent
rights issue came on to the market. There were rumours that the Stakis
family had unloaded large blocks of equity, with one lump of 5.6m shares
said to have been placed at 80 1/4 p. The ordinary shares finished the day
firmer at 80 1/2 p in volume of 6.5m. Turnover in the nil-paid soared to
20m, with the price adding  1/2 at 8 1/2 p.
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel bounced 4 to 509p as market watchers
pondered the implications of a reported tussle over certain aspects of the
underwriting of its impending rights issue.

FT  07 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bid talks power Hogg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News from Hogg Group, the insurance broker, that it is in discussions with a
number of potential bidders triggered another strong burst of buying
interest. Dealers said they expected an opening shot of around 210p in a
bidding auction for Hogg and that an eventual take-out price for the group
would be in the region of 250p a share. Hogg shares finished 23 stronger at
205p.
There was widespread speculation as to the identities of the other companies
involved in talks with Hogg. Inchcape, which held takeover talks with
another UK insurance broker, CE Heath, last year, was seen as a possible
bidder, as was Heath, JIB Group and Hambros Insurance Services.
There was also talk that a number of US companies might be interested in
Hogg, principally Aon Corporation.

FT  07 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recovery in stock index futures which began on Tuesday continued
yesterday, although the lead futures contract closed off the day's peak
after a poor opening in the US markets, writes Joel Kibazo.
The Liffe June contract on the FT-SE 100 started at 3,140, up 13 from its
previous close, and moved steadily forward over the next few hours. Buying
was mixed, coming from both independent traders (locals) and the large
institutions, and June climbed to its peak of 3,156 over lunchtime.
Light profit-taking saw the contract surrender some of the earlier gain, but
it was the decline on Wall Street that led to increased selling of June in
the last hour of the session.
June finished at 3,133, up 6 from Tuesday's closing level but at a 7-point
discount to its fair value premium to cash which stands at around 6 points.
Volume was 15,265 lots.
The Liffe FT-SE Mid 250 contract ended at 3,777, up 17 from its previous
close, on substantially improved turnover of 217 trades.
However, business in the Liffe traded options was dull and volume fell to
29,165 contracts from Tuesday's 37,197. The total included 14,071 lots dealt
in the FT-SE 100 option and 4,090 done in the Euro FT-SE 100 option.

FT  07 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains cut back before the close
of trading - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market extended its recovery yesterday, although shares closed
well below the best of the day as Wall Street failed to carry through its
overnight strength into the new trading session. Market strategists sounded
somewhat cautious of applauding the equity rally, pointing out that the
first day of the new financial year in the UK brought a sharp increase in
trading volume which appeared to be grounded in tax-related deals.
A further shaving of interest rates at the money market repo auction in
Germany, together with a firm performance from sterling, encouraged interest
rate optimism. Gains in UK government bonds also buttressed confidence in
the stock market and little attention was paid to the rise in annualised MO
money supply last month.
But the final reading on the FT-SE 100 Index of 3,131.5 for a gain of 15.3
was well below the day's peak and did not even match the first reading on
the index, which opened some 26 points up in response to the Dow's overnight
rise of 83 points. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which includes a range of second
line stocks, put on 15.1 at 3,778.1.
The early strength also reflected a substantial buy programme which appeared
to be related to year-end tax trades and originated from a large US
investment bank. Lines of stock, across both the Footsie and FT-SE Mid 250
ranges, were sold on Tuesday night by investors seeking to establish a tax
loss for 1993-1994. At the opening of the market yesterday, many of these
stocks were rebought in deals which lifted the Seaq trading total sharply.
Boosted by these tax-related deals, Seaq business for the day jumped by
nearly one-quarter to 944.2m shares. But traders said business died away in
the middle of the session, although reviving towards the close when both US
Federal bonds and Wall Street turned easier. The Dow Industrial Average was
14 points down when London went home for the day, leaving UK traders to
watch New York markets closely for a lead to this morning's London opening.
London was somewhat slower than some continental European markets to respond
to the improvement overnight in sentiment on Wall Street. Analysts of the UK
market pointed to lingering uncertainties over the outlook for domestic base
rates. Hopes for an early cut in rates to counterbalance the tax rises to be
implemented this month appear threatened by the likelihood that the US
Federal Reserve will tighten credit policy again soon, as well as by
political uncertainties in the UK.
However, market confidence steadied yesterday. Hoare Govett, the UK
securities house, dismissed last week's rumours that a repeat of the 1987
crash was in the offing, noting that the 'pendulum of market sentiment' has
swung from one extreme to the other since the beginning of the year.
In particular, Hoare urges that the yield ratio of bonds to equities has
remained relatively stable at around 2.1, compared with more than 3.3 at the
time of the 1987 crash. 'The two episodes have been entirely different,'
said Hoare.
US dollar strength helped the multi-nationals, with the pharmaceutical
sector in good form. Across the wider range, the stress was again on
manufacturing sectors, and consumer stocks continued to lag behind as the
market focused on sectors more directly linked to UK economic recovery.

FT  07 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slightly firmer after
calmer session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices finished mixed yesterday as orderliness returned to the
equity markets after a string of routs and Tuesday's powerful recovery,
writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 4.32 firmer at 3,679.73, while
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.24 off at 448.05. The Nasdaq composite shed
only 0.23 at 750.72 after retracing most of its lost ground during the
afternoon. New York SE volume was 302m shares.
After the previous day's 82-point surge by the Dow - its biggest gain since
December 23, 1991 - investors appeared uncertain about the market's next
step. Most analysts were convinced that Tuesday's surge was only a pause in
a long term retreat triggered by February's shift to a tighter monetary
policy.
As a result, the morning's activity was directionless. The blue chips nosed
in and out of positive territory, and smaller-capitalisation stocks showed
weakness as profit-takers capitalised on Tuesday's powerful advance on the
Nasdaq.
A measure of urgency returned at midday as the price of the benchmark
30-year government bond, which had been showing a slim loss during most of
the morning, lurched downwards. Stocks quickly fell in line with the bond
action, but share prices stabilised before another broad sell-off could
develop. Later in the afternoon, the long bond trimmed its loss, allowing
blue chip stocks to reverse course and move modestly higher.
The day's only economic input was news of the March performances by US motor
vehicle manufacturers. Total sales came in at an annual rate of 7.5m
vehicles, suggesting the sector was holding on to its newfound vigour.
General Motors, a Dow industrial component, gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars
59. The stock received an additional boost from a 'strong buy'
recommendation by JP Morgan. Chrysler firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 54 7/8
and Ford Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 60 7/8 , as their sales data were in line
with expectations.
Caterpillar resumed its leadership of the blue chips, surging Dollars 3 7/8
to Dollars 120 1/8 . JP Morgan advanced Dollars 2 to Dollars 62 1/2 .
Notable losers included United Technologies, down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars
64 3/8 , and General Electric, off Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 97 5/8 . Near
the close, GE said its first-quarter earnings would come in at the high end
of estimates. The announcement helped the stock trim its loss on the day.
Promus, a hotel and casino operator, fell Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 37 1/2 on
heavy volume of 2.1m shares. The plunge came on news that voters in Missouri
had rejected a proposal to allow slot machines in riverboat casinos.
Canada
Toronto closed solidly higher in moderate trading after the market continued
to recover from its recent tumble.
The TSE 300 composite index added 40 points at 4,313.3 and advances
outnumbered falls by 515 to 291 after volume of 69.7m shares valued at
CDollars 755m.
The rise adds to Tuesday's 43-point gain, which came on the strength of
rallying bond prices and a steadier Canadian dollar.
Mexico
Equities fell sharply in early trading in reaction to an increase in
domestic interest rates, but later rebounded to leave the IPC index a net
26.37, or 1.18 per cent, up at 2,260.52.
The interest rate on the 28-day treasury bill, or Cetes, was lifted by 2.68
percentage points to 14.31 per cent in the central bank's weekly auction,
its highest level since late 1993.
South Africa was closed yesterday for a public holiday.

FT  07 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei further improves
as regional markets rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The sharp upturn on Wall Street and the yen's slight retreat against the
dollar moved the Nikkei 225 average moderately higher yesterday, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index added 133.53 at 19,696.74 after a day's low of 19,636.33 and high
of 19,878.28. Institutional investors and foreigners were seen buying, while
the overnight advance on the Chicago futures market also prompted
arbitrage-linked purchases.
Technical selling ahead of tomorrow's option settlements eroded some of the
gains.
Traders said some investors were still nervous about fluctuations on the New
York stock market, while the domestic political situation also kept some
people away. The opposition Liberal Democrats have been heightening calls
for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to clarify his dealings with Sagawa
Kyubin, the trucking company alleged to have loaned him Y100m.
In the latest twist of events, Mr Hosokawa was quoted as saying he wanted to
resign on Tuesday, causing an uproar within the coalition and the opposition
parties.
Volume rose to 340m shares from 223m, with increased participation from
overseas investors returning to the market after the Easter holidays.
Advances led falls by 743 to 285, with 144 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 11.58 at 1,600.41 and the
Nikkei 300 put on 1.91 at 292.99. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
3.47 to 1,310.81.
Some speculative favourites gained ground on individual buying: Sumitomo
Coal Mining moved ahead Y48 to Y903 and Honshu Paper Y40 to Y788.
Machinery makers, seen as laggards recently, were firmer. Okuma rose Y21 to
Y821 and Amada Y60 to Y1,160. Textiles were also higher, Toyobo adding Y19
at Y470 and Toray Industries Y30 at Y695.
Continued concern over its call rate rise hit Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, which declined Y6,000 to Y900,000. Earlier this week the cabinet
raised worries over the possible negative impact of the planned rise in a
number of public utility rates on the sluggish economy.
Foreign selling hurt Fuji Photo Film, which weakened Y50 to Y2,130. Some
high-technology issues were lower on profit-taking, with Sony losing Y10 at
Y5,990.
Toyota Motor receded Y10 to Y1,990 and Honda Motor declined Y40 to Y1,660.
In Osaka, the OSE average closed 277.36 higher at 21,963.79 in volume of
17.6m shares. In spite of the rise in the index, Aoyama Trading, the men's
suits retailer, shed Y200 to Y5,390 on profit-taking.
Roundup
Wall Street's overnight rally provided the impetus for sharp rises in
markets throughout the region.
HONG KONG rallied sharply on a technical rebound, although profit-taking
pulled prices off the day's highs. The Hang Seng index ended 204.40, or 2.3
per cent, up at 9,234.31, having been 346 points ahead at the morning peak.
Blue chip property shares closed mixed after being propelled by strong
bargain hunting early in the day. SHK Properties rose HKDollars 1.50 to
HKDollars 54.50 and Cheung Kong added 25 cents at HKDollars 39.75.
AUSTRALIA moved firmly ahead at the opening, the All Ordinaries index
testing the 2,100 resistance level for the first time in a week, before the
market edged back to finish 34.1 higher on the day at 2,084.1.
BHP surged 38 cents to ADollars 16.74 and CRA gained 28 cents at ADollars
16.76, while News Corp pulled back from a day's high of ADollars 9.37 to
close 3 cents ahead at ADollars 9.15.
SINGAPORE was broadly higher, although late profit-taking left prices off
their peaks as an uncertain mood continued to prevail.
The Straits Times Industrial index gained 54.08, or 2.6 per cent, at
2,115.57.
KUALA LUMPUR rose 2.7 per cent, the composite index adding 25.20 at 964.51,
although doubts were expressed about the rally being sustained.
TAIWAN traded higher as demand by domestic trust funds for electronics
issues intensified in late business, on expectations of good results to
come, although interest in other sectors was limited.
The weighted index rose 60.88 to 5,481.86 in turnover that expanded to
TDollars 50.02bn.
MANILA surged at the close on a technical rally which took the composite
index 47.33, or 1.8 per cent, higher to 2,680.01, although volume was very
low.
SEOUL continued the technical advance which began on Monday, although
trading remained slow in the absence of fresh factors. The compos-ite index
closed 2.57 stronger at 863.04.
NEW ZEALAND rebounded from Tuesday's low for the year, the NZSE-40 capital
index moving forward 73.49, or 3.6 per cent, to 2,122.66.
BOMBAY was mildly higher on speculative demand triggered by hopes that
foreign investors and Indian mutual funds would soon return as buyers. The
BSE 30-share index finished 30.57 firmer at 3,842.72.
KARACHI bounced, prompting expectations of a further rise today. The KSE
100-share index gained 19.83 at 2,432.90.

Staff.
PARIS kept on the positive track with a rise in the CAC-40 index of 27.97,
or 1.3 per cent, to 2,128.22.
Activity was concentrated mainly in oils, as investors reacted to the rise
in the price of crude and suggestions that some US investment funds had been
switching aggressively out of other sectors.
Elf Aquitaine gained FFr16.40 at FFr394.40 and Total FFr9.20 at FFr316.50.
The shares had been under pressure since reaching 1994 highs early in
February: Elf has slipped by 8.6 per cent and Total by 10.5 per cent.
Suez, which pleased with its return to profits in 1993, improved FFr9.30 to
FFr323.60; Alcatel rose FFr9 to FFr673 ahead of results, released after the
close, which came in much as expected.
FRANKFURT showed some enthusiam for laggard stocks, and more for the
currently fashionable cyclicals, as the Dax index rose 32.91 to 2,191.20 on
the session, before drawing back to 2,184.89 after hours.
Turnover was reported as thin after Tuesday's DM6.7bn. Among the laggards,
Allianz, the insurer, acknowledged a small cut in repo rates and hopes for a
discount rate cut next week as it advanced DM62 to DM2,665 for a two-day
gain of DM112. In the same sector, Munich Re went ex-rights worth DM299 a
share, and rose a net DM79 to DM2,980.
In construction, said Mr Matthias Welticke of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf,
Hochtief and Holzmann may have caught the eye of funds looking for recent
underperformers, and ready to place their first-quarter inflow. The shares
moved ahead DM32 to DM1,092 and DM40, or 4.5 per cent, to DM925
respectively.
In carmakers, BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen all had respectable gains but they
were outperformed by Bayer and Hoechst in chemicals, the former enjoying the
second day of a big buy order as it rose DM11.30 to DM393.10 after a rise of
DM8.60 on Tuesday.
AMSTERDAM built on Wednesday's good performance with major international
stocks pulling ahead.
The AEX index finished up 7.41 or 1.8 per cent at 412.81.
The day's activity was helped by the bounce in Wall Street overnight, as
well as a solid gain by Royal Dutch which has lost some 9 per cent in value
since its year high at the end of January. The shares closed up Fl 5.20 at
Fl 193.70, with traders putting the gain down mainly to short covering,
while it was also seen to be tracking the performance in London of Shell,
lifted by the general improvement in sentiment for oil stocks.
MILAN overcame some early nervousness to resume its advance although Mr
Silvio Berlusconi broke off talks on a new government with his right wing
allies. The Comit index finished 7.99 higher at 732.52.
Mr Nicolo Braendli at Akros Sim in Milan commented that investors remained
confident a right-wing government could be formed. He said that hugely
liquid domestic funds continued to buy while foreign investors, still
focusing on an improving economic and corporate outlook, were refraining
from taking profits after the market's recent surge.
Construction stocks had a good day on hopes that a new government will boost
building and public words. Italcementi rose L520 or 3.4 per cent to L15,801,
Cogefar added L74, or 3.5 per cent to L2,221 and Calcestruzzi put on L853 or
6.8 per cent to L13,355.
Telecommunications saw a rare day of profit-taking: Stet retreated L38 to
L4,748 and Sip L33 to L5,797.
ZURICH was propelled higher by a strong financial sector, the SMI index
adding 22.9 at 2,830.2.
CS Holding bearers, the most active issue, rose SFr9 to SFr634 after news
that the group had raised its stake in its CS First Boston investment
banking affiliate, in response to a request from small shareholders. SBC
registered put on SFr6.50 at SFr210 and Winterthur registered firmed SFr20
to SFr700.
Brown Boveri moved forward SFr21 to SFr1,203: the heavy engineering group
said it had won a Dollars 150 power plant order from Iran.
MADRID's general index rose another 3.13 to 322.16 as Tuesday's favourites
maintained their appeal.
Repsol rose Pta125 to Pta4,345 in line with oil stocks around Europe, and
Telefonica another Pta50 to Pta1,780 in spite of a debate on tariffs, and
the implementation of Spain's policy of opening up its telecommunications
sector to an expected wave of foreign competition.
ISTANBUL rose a further 7.7 per cent as the market continued to react
favourably to the government's economic measures, announced late on Tuesday.
The composite index added 1,358.21 at 18,859.18.
However, while equities strengthened the currency weakened further against
the dollar. The Turkish lira was effectively devalued by 28 per cent on
Tuesday as the government announced its three-month austerity package, and
yesterday the dollar climbed TL7,500 to end at TL39,500 on the interbank
market.

FT  07 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Argentina lives through trial by fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina has been one of the worst performing Latin American equity markets
so far this year, living through its first trial by fire in international
financial markets since making the currency convertible, and adopting a
fixed exchange rate three years ago.
In March, when the central bank spent a record Dollars 725m - 5 per cent of
its reserves - to defend the peso, the Merval share index fell 16 per cent.
This week the Merval index has remained volatile in line with international
markets, losing some 8.5 per cent on Monday but recouping 4 per cent the
following day.
The unrest in international markets has demonstrated the fragility of
funding for Argentina's 1994 external deficits, forecast at Dollars 10bn to
Dollars 12bn. Recently low international interest rates, and strong demand
for private company debt issues, may not bridge this gap painlessly.
The turmoil has underlined the precariousness of regulation with brokerages
not closely supervised. Analysts believe that trading losses will wipe out
first-quarter earnings at listed banks such as Banco Galicia and Banco
Frances.
The recent sacking of Mr Martin Redrado as president of the independent CNV
securities commission accentuated another troubling feature. He questioned
terms under which the government negotiated with US investment banks Merrill
Lynch and CS First Boston to sell shares worth Dollars 720m held by
pensioners in privatised oil group YPF.

FT  07 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rally continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fairly small cut in the German repo rate yesterday helped the dollar and
sterling maintain a firmer tone on foreign exchanges, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency was also helped by a story in the Washington Post newspaper
saying that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to change short-term interest
rates until financial markets had calmed.
The Bundesbank cut the repo rate by three basis points to 5.73 per cent  -
in line with market expectations following tighter money market conditions
recently.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.7151 against the D-Mark from DM1.7071 on
Tuesday. Sterling rose slightly against the US currency to finish at Dollars
1.4678 from Dollars 1.4638. It was also higher against the D-Mark, ending
nearly two pfennigs up at DM2.5173 from DM2.4987. The dollar finished New
York trading at DM1.7150.
Elsewhere in Europe the D-Mark was generally firmer after a range-bound
trading session. The Belgian franc was barely changed after the central bank
lowered rates by 10 basis points to 5.95 per cent.
The Italian lira weakened following signs of dissension among the Freedom
Alliance coalition which won last week's election.
The Washington Post story quoted Fed officials as saying that rates would
not be moved until markets had stabilised and the impact of the fall in
share prices and rise in long-term interest rates had been assessed.
Although higher US rates - nobody is suggesting they will fall - should be
dollar positive, the market appears to have reasoned that interest rate
stability will also favour the dollar as it will calm US equity and bond
markets, encouraging capital inflows.
Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, said the improved
performance of the dollar and sterling - a reversal of last week's move -
indicated a possible 'return to looking at fundamentals rather than looking
at inflation'.
Analysts, however, questioned the durability of these moves, saying they
depended on a sustained recovery in the stock and bond markets which was by
no means assured.
Mr Mark Geddes, treasury analyst at Midland Global Markets, said he remained
negative on sterling in particular, which had 'risen on the dollar's
coat-tails more than anything else'. He added that it was 'difficult to find
anything that might go right either on the political or the economic side
for sterling'.
However, Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said there
were other factors supporting sterling. These include a shrinking negative
interest differential, versus the D-Mark, and a reasonable yield premium on
sterling bonds over D-Mark bonds.
Mr Norfield added that these premia should attract capital inflows. He said
econometric estimates also suggested that the pound was fairly valued 'in
the mid-DM2.50s'.
Short sterling futures also continued their recovery, the June contract
finishing three basis points firmer at 94.50. The December future was 12
basis points up at 94.03. The Bank of England, meanwhile, put Pounds 592m
into the discount market, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 750m.
German call money remained fairly tight after the Bundesbank surprised the
market by withdrawing a net DM1.8bn from the banking system yesterday. Rates
were in a fairly wide range from 5.85 per cent to 6.05 per cent, slightly up
from Tuesday's 5.80/6.00 per cent. Opinion seems to favour rates moving
higher.
There was little movement in the futures market, the June Euromark contract
ending three basis points off at 94.54.
The recent woes of the Turkish lira continued yesterday, the currency
falling by 25 per cent against the US currency to trade at TL40,000 per
dollar, after Tuesday's close of TL32,000, before recovering slightly to
TL39,500.
The central bank set its official dollar rate at TL39,933, up from TL32,053
on Tuesday. The bank, which effectively devalued its official dollar rate by
28 per cent on Tuesday, calculates the rate as the average dollar offer of
10 banks on the interbank market at 1200 GMT.
The lira was weakened by falls in overnight money rates, at 90 per cent
against 120 per cent when trading opened. Analysts said that now that the
bank had decided to devalue, it was predictable that speculators would try
to drive the currency lower.
In Portugal, the escudo stabilised as the central bank persisted with its
policy of high interest rates. The currency finished at Es101.3 against the
D-Mark, up from Es101.8. The bank again injected funds into the money market
at 13 per cent and 14 per cent, compared to a previous rate of 10 per cent.
Mr Miguel Beleza, governor of the Bank of Portugal, told TSF radio that he
believed his strategy would allow key lending rates - such as banks' prime
rates - to continue falling.
The Belgian franc finished at BFr20.60 against the D-Mark from BFr20.61
before the trimming of rates. Analysts said Belgium had sufficient margin
over Germany to cut rates.

FT  07 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US agricultural exports
forecast to more than double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Agricultural exports from the US could more than double by 2005 to Dollars
8.7bn as a result of the Gatt deal, according to a report by the US
Department of Agriculture.
By 2000, the report expects US farm exports to rise by Dollars 1.6bn to
Dollars 4.7bn, bringing higher prices and increased income for producers.
Subsidised farm exports will begin to be replaced by the free market under
the Gatt deal, changing world wheat markets fundamentally, the report says.
'Removal of subsidies will increase prices, dramatically for some countries,
and reduce world trade in the first years of the agreement.' After that,
world income will rise leading to an increase in demand.
One of the important conclusions of the USDA's analysis is that the Gatt
deal will be good news for world agriculture by raising income worldwide,
which will lead to higher demand for farm products and an increase in
prices.
World prices will rise by 2 to 3 per cent for wheat and 7 to 8 per cent for
feedgrains by 2005, the report predicts. US wheat output will rise and
exports will be 150m to 200m bushels more than they would have been without
a Gatt agreement. US farm incomes could rise by Dollars 1.3bn in 2000 and by
as much as Dollars 2.5bn in 2005. This would help offset spending on farm
support, reducing outlays by an estimated Dollars 2.6bn in 2005. And
export-related employment in agriculture could rise by 190,000.
The deal will encourage countries to keep open their markets for farm
products. Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, explained recently to the
House of Representatives committee on agriculture: 'Perhaps even more
important for the future is the discipline the Uruguay Round will apply to
countries that might otherwise choose the direction of closed markets,
production-inducing internal supports, and subsidised exports.'
He said this gave a signal to large US trading partners that remained
outside Gatt - China, Taiwan and the nations of the former Soviet Union.

FT  07 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hungarian land law infuriates
the business community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A new land law passed yesterday by the Budapest parliament severely limits
foreign investment in Hungarian agriculture, one of the country's
traditionally strong sectors.
The act, although it does not affect existing holdings, bans new purchases
of land by foreign individuals and companies. It allows non-Hungarian
investors to lease no more than 500 hectares and then only for 10 years in
general.
The business community has reacted furiously to the new legislation.
'Foreign investment in the agricultural field is dead as a dodo,' said Mr
Adam Batthyany, head of Batthyany Securities and one of the largest private
landowners.
Officials in the agriculture ministry have also been critical of the
government's policy and included the limits on foreign land ownership under
duress.
An infusion of foreign capital and know-how had been widely seen as one way
to restore Hungarian agriculture to its former health. Hungary was the
eastern bloc's largest agricultural exporter but drought, loss of markets
and confusion over property rights caused output to fall 17 per cent in 1992
and a further 5 per cent last year.
Foreign purchases of land are, however, unpopular among a rural constituency
whose support is crucial to the conservative coalition's chances at next
month's elections and political calculations have proved decisive.
The discriminatory elements of the land act would be incompatible with
Hungarian membership of the European Union, for which Budapest formally
applied just last week.
The government said that the measures would apply only to the interim period
leading up to EU accession and until Hungarian land prices, currently a
fraction of western rates, reach 'realistic' levels.
Nevertheless, Hungary's policy is in general to harmonise domestic
legislation with EU directives in advance of membership and the land act
breaks with that practice.

FT  07 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese copper cuts expected
after Gatt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's copper industry will permanently close between 200,000 and 300,000
tonnes of annual smelting capacity - roughly one quarter of its present 1.2m
tonnes - as a result of its government's agreement to reduce tariffs on
refined copper imports, analysts suggest.
'This is a major sea change in the copper business,' says Mr John Champagne,
industry adviser to the US government during the negotiations on the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'The Japanese smelters will no longer be the
power in the industry they are today.'
At present Japan imposes a tariff of Y15,000 (Dollars 145) a tonne on
imports of refined copper, equivalent to about 8 per cent on the present
price. As part of the Gatt Uruguay Round to be ratified on April 15, over
the next five years this will reduced in stages to Y9,700. Then in 1999 the
tariff will be changed to 3 per cent a tonne.
Mr Champagne points out that the change to an ad valorem tariff is important
in that the cost will reduce as world copper prices fall. 'The protection
the Japanese smelters will have in future will reduce when they need it the
most - when copper prices are low and the margins for treating raw materials
are under pressure.'
The present tariff barriers have enabled Japan to build up one of the
world's strongest copper smelting and refining industries even though it has
no copper mines. The tightly-knit Japanese copper smelting cartel, known in
the industry as the Japanese Smelter Pool, dominates the world market for
copper concentrate (an intermediate material), importing about two thirds of
all the concentrates traded internationally.
This dominant position gives Japan a disproportionate influence in the
financing of new copper mines anywhere in the world because owners usually
need a contract with the Pool before they can obtain finance.
The tariffs give Japanese producers a protected base from which to export
aggressively to third countries and allow Japanese smelters to offer higher
prices in global markets for copper scrap and concentrates, which are
imported duty free to Japan.
Mr Champagne, president of Magma Metals, part of the MagmaCopper group, says
that, while the Gatt compromise fell short of the US industry's goal of
removing all duties and other trade barriers on refined copper, it was 'an
important step to reduce distortion of the world copper market and will
benefit all copper consumers in Japan'.
He suggests that, 'while a loss of duty protection may hasten the closure of
some obsolete Japanese smelter capacity, it will not threaten the entire
industry. The more efficient plants will survive'.
Mr Champagne points out that the US has taken second place as a supplier of
copper to Japan behind Chile, a country that enjoyed a considerable
advantage from GSP (Generalised System of Preferences) status, which permits
tariff-free imports from developing countries under certain circumstances.
'If it were not for the Japanese duty, US exports might have been higher
still and quite possibly Chile's would have been less,' says the Magma
president.
Apart from being a reliable supplier of high-quality copper, the US could
deliver from its west coast ports to Japan in only two to three weeks,
compared with six weeks from Chile.
Analysts suggest that the Japanese smelters will not wait until the last
moment to rationalise capacity and expect closures in the next two or three
years. Top of the list of potential casualties, they say, is Dowa Mining's
55,000-tonnes-a-year smelter at Kosaka, which has very high transport costs
because of its inland site. They also mention the possibility of Mitsubishi
closing its Onahama smelter (250,000 tonnes) and of Nippon Mining shutting
one of the two furnaces at its Saganoseki smelter (180,000 tonnes).
World shortages of copper concentrate and scrap, as well as reduced economic
activity in Japan, are forcing the Japanese smelters to cut output in the
first half of this year. Dowa says it will cut by 10 per cent, compared with
the second half of 1993, to 9,846 tonnes a month; Nippon Mining by 14 per
cent to 24,000 tonnes a month; Mitsubishi by 12.4 per cent to 21,300 tonnes
a month; and Sumitomo by 9.9 per cent to 94,200 tonnes a month. All four
companies also intend to reduce lead and zinc output in the first half.

FT  07 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Disease slashes cotton crops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two years of disease and pest damage have slashed cotton output in Pakistan
and China by a third and thrown into question forecasts of world production
over the next decade.
According to the International Cotton Advisory Committee, an association of
exporting and importing countries, there is danger that the leaf curl virus,
now infecting Pakistan, will spread to North India and Central Asia during
the next few years.
Pakistani production has already fallen by 40 per cent over the past two
seasons, generally the result off the virus and other pests for which no
effective deterrent has been discovered. With the decline in cotton and its
impact on the textile industry, Pakistan's GDP could fall by more than 2 per
cent this year, the ICAC said in its March-April Cotton Review.
Declining yields and rising output costs could reduce planted acreage in
1994-95. 'The use of resistant varieties and a third year of experience with
the leaf curl virus could lead to marginally higher yields,' the ICAC said.
Pests and disease are reducing the harvest in China. Production in 1993-94
is 600,000 tonnes less than consumption. According to the ICAC, the problem
appears to be 'of a long term nature and will necessitate shifts in the
location of cotton production and changes in agronomic practices in the
affected areas'.
Double cropping cotton with wheat, which provides a year-round habitat for
bollworm and aphids, may have to stop. Prices are also being pushed up by
prices for competing crops.
World cotton production in 1993-94 will be 1.3m tonnes less than the
previous year and nearly 2m tonnes less than consumption projections for
1994-95. 'It is possible that average prices in the 1990s will be higher
than the 1980s, and that the 76 per pound average of the 1970s might be the
norm of the current decade as well,' the report said.

higher - Market Report
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE and COCOA futures strode higher yesterday
afternoon after wavering in the morning.
Short-covering helped the May coffee price to a fresh high of Dollars 1,425
a tonne before closing Dollars 30 up at Dollars 1,414. 'With no coffee
coming onto the market at the moment, perhaps someone has just decided to
buy,' suggested one trader.
Cocoa prices were also stronger, but in routine volume. The May position
gained Pounds 12 to Pounds 881 while near July rose Pounds 11 to 900 stg.
Traders said it was 'trying to consolidate'.

FT  07 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil holds on to price gains as
market 'ignores fundamentals'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices yesterday held on to most of the gains made earlier this week
when a rally sparked by the entry of hedge funds into the oil futures'
markets caused the price of the benchmark Brent Blend to rise by more than
Dollars 1 a barrel.
In late London trading yesterday Brent Blend was Dollars 14.25 a barrel.
Last week prices fell from the Dollars 14 level to around Dollars 13 in the
aftermath of the Geneva meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
Many traders believe the market over-reacted to Opec's decision to forego a
cut in output in favour of rolling over the present production ceiling of
24.52m barrels a day until the end of the year.
The latest price strength was evidence that it was experiencing a 'guilt
syndrome' for taking such a negative initial view of the Opec decision,
according to Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at brokers Smith
Barney in London.
Other analysts said the latest price swings ignored market fundamentals,
which continue to point to plentiful supplies and relatively weak demand in
the second quarter.
Mr Vahan Zanoyan of the International Petroleum Finance Company in
Washington said 'there was no justification for the Dollars 1 a barrel
rally,' which he said was 'unrelated to the reality on the ground'.
He cited especially weak demand in Asia and the prospect of greater Russian
exports with the return of good weather at the country's main oil ports as
factors maintaining downward pressures on prices. In addition a Reuters
survey yesterday of Opec production suggested that the organisation's March
output exceeded its ceiling by 500,000 barrels a day.
Mr Zanoyan said the hedge funds now constituted a technical factor in the
market. They could prove particularly volatile if they 'liquidated their
position at a time when weak fundamentals are baring their teeth,' he added.

FT  07 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries stage recovery in quiet trading
session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasuries recovered from early weakness yesterday in a quiet,
technically-driven session following Tuesday's powerful rally.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/32 lower
at 87 27/32 , with the yield rising to 7.249 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was  1/32 better at 99 15/32 , to yield 5.394 per cent.
An uneasy calm descended as the session opened. Bonds showed modest gains in
early activity, as dealers followed through on the previous day's buying
spree, which propelled prices higher and pushed down yields after a
fortnight of relentless selling pressure.
By mid-morning, the market's efforts to adjust to its turbulent ride began
to take a toll. The early activity petered out, and the longer end of the
maturity range slipped into negative territory.
The downward drift followed a report in the Washington Post that the Federal
Reserve would wait until the financial markets steadied before raising
interest rates for a third time.
Near mid-day, the long bond suddenly dropped by nearly a point, but when a
broad sell-off failed to materialise, prices crept back to near their
opening levels.
In view of the market's volatility, the afternoon recovery was encouraging.
Traders were also pleased that prices held up after news of strong March
sales by US motor vehicle manufacturers, which suggested the possibility of
mounting inflationary pressures.
UK gilts opened firmer yesterday, encouraged by the overnight gains in US
Treasuries and a firmer pound. However, they fell back in the afternoon in
tandem with a weaker opening in the US.
The June contract of the long gilt future on Liffe went as high as 108 31/32
, but lost most of the day's gains by the late afternoon when it fell to the
day's low of 107 5/8 . It then picked up to 107 13/16 for a gain on the day
of just  3/32 .
Dealers said there was still no evidence that the buyers' strike was over in
the gilts market, despite the improvement in market sentiment since the long
Easter weekend. Indeed, one dealer reported that multi-currency funds were
selling gilts in favour of US Treasuries.
The release yesterday of stronger-than-expected money supply data for March,
which could indicate that retail sales were healthy last month, did not have
a great influence on the market.
The February data showed that UK institutions were net sellers of gilts for
the second month running to the tune of Pounds 338bn but that overseas
investors made net purchases of Pounds 1.5bn, the highest monthly figure
since August.
In addition, the figures indicated that the Bank of England gave only
limited support to the gilts market in February, with unofficial purchases
of up to Pounds 250m.
German bunds failed to make significant gains after the Bundesbank cut its
repo rate by three basis points to 5.73 per cent, in line with market
expectations, since the cut was effectively neutralised by a unexpected net
drain of DM1.8bn from the banking system.
The market had expected the Bundesbank to add a net DM2bn to DM4bn, so the
net drain pushed call money to around 6.15 per cent from around 5.80 per
cent.
The June contract of the Bund future on Liffe traded between a high of 97.36
and a low of 96.86 during the day and in the late afternoon it was quoted at
96.97, up 0.13 point on the day.
Italian government bonds remained volatile yesterday following the
announcement late on Tuesday that Mr Silvio Berlusconi had suspended talks
on the formation of a new government. Dealers said that investors were still
wary of committing themselves to the market until the political situation
improved.
The June contract of the Italian government bond future on Liffe traded
between a high of 113 and a low of 111.95 during the day. By the late
afternoon, it stood at 112.20, down 0.65 point on the day.
French government bonds ended off the day's highs ahead of today's auction
of OATs. The Treasury has said it will sell between FFr18bn and FFr20bn OATs
due April 2004, February 2004 and October 2025. The Bank of France's
monetary policy council also meets today, but dealers said that a cut in the
5.90 per cent intervention rate was unlikely.
The June contract of the notional 10-year French government bond future on
the Matif came off the day's best level of 123.92 to trade at 123.78 in the
late afternoon, down 0.12 point on the day.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Bonds: Finland surprises with FRN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international bond market sprang back to life with the launch of a
handful of large deals in a range of currencies yesterday.
However, in spite of the apparent resurgence in new issue activity,
syndicate officials complained that investors generally were slow to take up
the new deals as market conditions remain fairly unsettled.
The Republic of Finland continued the trend for floating rate paper, tapping
the market with a Dollars 1.5bn, five-year floating rate note.
The bonds will have a coupon of three-month Libid, and will be priced at
99.68 to give a yield of five basis points below three-month Libor. Based on
yesterday's Libor figure of 4 per cent, for example, that would mean a yield
of 3.95 per cent, although the actual coupon level has not been set yet.
The size of the deal took the market by surprise, and the issue was seen by
some syndicates as being quite aggressively priced - particularly since the
borrower is not considered to be in line for a credit-rating upgrade in the
immediate future.
'It (the pricing) could have been more generous by a couple of basis
points,' said one floating rate note specialist.
Goldman Sachs, the lead manager, noted healthy demand for the issue from
investors in east Asia, including central banks and government agencies. The
bonds are due to break syndicate today.
Attractive swap opportunities once again lured a couple of borrowers into
the Eurolira sector, with the Kingdom of Sweden increasing its new issue to
L150bn from L120bn due to strong demand.
Sweden's issue is structured in a similar fashion to the recent L170bn deal
from Bank Austria, in that the bonds have a 10-year maturity but are
callable after a specified time - in this case, three years.
BCI, the lead manager, quoted a yield-to-redemption of 9.33 per cent, and a
yield based on a three-year maturity of 9.64 per cent, using a late
afternoon price of 98.70.
BCI said that demand came mainly from Italian domestic institutions.
Elsewhere in Europe, borrowers tapped the French franc and D-Mark sectors
with fairly substantial issues, in spite of the continuation of difficult
underlying market conditions.
Province of Quebec issued FFr5bn of 10-year bonds, which were priced to
yield 65 basis points over the French government bond.
The spread widened out slightly to 66 basis points while the price of the
bonds fell back from a re-offer price of 98.63 to 98.25 by late afternoon -
which meant that the bonds were trading outside fees.
One of the joint book-runners pointed out that Province of Ontario is keen
to diversify its funding programme, and had swapped the proceeds.
In the D-Mark sector, Commerzbank Overseas Finance launched a DM500m,
five-year deal which was aimed primarily at retail investors in Germany,
Switzerland and the Benelux countries.

Continued volatility in the financial markets ensured another month of heavy
trading volume on the world's futures exchanges.
The total volume of contracts traded on Liffe in the first quarter of 1994
grew 115 per cent compared with the first quarter of last year, while volume
on the Matif increased by 83 per cent.
In Chicago, the US's two largest futures exchanges had their best month ever
during March, with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) trading 22.5m contracts
and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) 22.2m.
The CME this year has begun counting expiring options, options exercises and
mutual offset trades with Singapore as volume, inflating its turnover data.
In the first quarter, the CBOT's volume was 57.9m contracts, up 38.9m from
the first quarter of 1993. The CME's first-quarter volume was 54.7m
contracts. Due to its new counting methods, accurate year-ago comparisons

Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Russia are the most attractive of
the eastern and central European markets for long-term investment and
expansion, according to a survey of international investors and professional
advisers published yesterday.
But Slovakia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Estonia and Romania are seen as
'tomorrow's stars for regional development', according to Central &amp; Eastern
European Investment: 1994 Research Report, which compiled its report from
questionnaires completed by 213 international organisations.
Joint ventures remain the most common corporate investment vehicle, with
comparatively little acquisition or greenfield investment in the region. But
survey participants point to several problem areas.
'The lack of any secure, workable banking infrastructure was cited as a
major drawback to investment,' the report says. In addition, the lack of
reliable auditing services locally deters investors from making local
acquisitions, while 'the pervasive command economy mentality' poses
difficulties for those involved in advising on privatisations.

the bank said, Reuter reports from Karachi.
Allied, with an authorised capital of Rs500m (Dollars 16.5m) and paid-up
capital of Rs272m, is Pakistan's only bank owned and managed by its
employees. It was privatised in September 1991. The employees' allied

<TEXT>
Colonial Mutual Life Assurance, the Australian financial services group, has
raised the likelihood of de-mutualising following a strong result in
calendar 1993.
The group announced a 260 per cent jump in net earnings to ADollars 701.3m
(USDollars 501m) from ADollars 194.5m and a 31 per cent increase in reserves
to ADollars 2.13bn from ADollars 1.62bn.
Mr Peter Smedley, managing director, said the improved performance was
helped by last year's bull share market, a restructuring of the business,
and a focus on cost reduction, cutting group expenses by more than 18 per
cent.
Mr Smedley said the group had appointed an internal review team to examine
future capital needs, advised by S. G. Warburg.
He said the review would examine growth options, including changing the
group's mutual structure through which it is owned by policyholders.
Mr Smedley indicated that the group was unlikely to remain a mutual, raising
the possibility of a capital raising and the introduction of conventional
equity.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Eli Lilly set to benefit from
new heart drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The biggest clinical trials yet conducted for Centorx, a new heart drug to
be marketed by US company Eli Lilly, show it helps up to 35 per cent of
patients, according to results published today in the US and tomorrow in the
UK.
US and European approval and launch of Centorx are likely during 1995.
More than 350,000 patients a year are potential recipients of Centorx, said
Mr Robert Califf of Duke University Medical Centre, one of the authors of
the two papers.
Annual sales will be up to Dollars 150m a year, according to Dr Jonathan
Gelles, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder, securities house, and further
applications for the drug are being studied.
Similar products are being developed by Merck, the biggest US drugs company,
Roche, of Switzerland, and Cor Therapeutics, a northern California
biotechnology company, said Dr Califf.
Centorx was developed by Centocor, a US biotechnology company in which Lilly
has a near 5 per cent stake. The marketing rights to the drug reverted to
Lilly when another of Centocor's drugs, the sepsis treatment Centoxin,
failed to make it through clinical trials more than a year ago.
The success of the drug is important to Centocor. The failure of Centoxin
pulled its stock market capitalisation down to just over Dollars 200m from
Dollars 1.2bn in August 1992. It has now recovered to Dollars 500m.
The clinical trial results, published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine and in Saturday's The Lancet, show that Centorx improves the
success rate of a common procedure called coronary angioplasty, in which a
small balloon is used to widen a partially blocked artery.
Angioplasty is cheaper than either of its two main alternatives: bypass
surgery and treatment with the drug TPa. TPa is the most successful product
from Genentech, another biotechnology company, say doctors from the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, writing in the New England
Journal of Medicine today.
The clinical trials studied the effects of the drug in 2,099 patients. They
indicate that the drug cut the failure rate of coronary angioplasty in high
risk patients to 8 per cent from 13 per cent after 28 days and by slightly
less over six months.

<TEXT>
Charles Schwab, the San Francisco-based retail broker, has confounded gloomy
predictions for stockbrokers' first-quarter profits. It indicated that its
earnings per share had risen by 10 per cent in the period, to 66 cents.
Schwab, which specialises in low-cost dealing services, added that the
amount of share trading it handles had not fallen in recent weeks, despite
the decline in US stock and bond prices, and that volumes continue to be
'robust'.
In January, Mr Charles Schwab, chairman, warned that first-quarter earnings
were unlikely to match the exceptionally strong first three months of 1993.
But yesterday, Schwab said full figures to be published later this month
would show net income of Dollars 39m, or 66 cents a share, against Dollars
35.4m, or 60 cents, in the earlier period.
Schwab handled an average of 33,000 trades a day during the quarter, up from
29,700.
The company's shares jumped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 28 3/4 on the news,
before falling back to Dollars 28 by late morning in New York.

<TEXT>
Corning, the US glass and high technology manufacturer, matched market
expectations in the first quarter of the year with a 12 per cent rise in
underlying earnings per share.
The advance came from the optical fibre and cable business, as well as
environmental substrate. This more than offset what Mr James Houghton,
chairman, called 'a significant loss of revenues' in its clinical testing
business.
Net income rose to Dollars 58m or 28 cents a share from Dollars 49.8m or 26
cents (25 cents before a one-off item) the year before. Sales advanced to
Dollars 949m from Dollars 817m, with half the growth due to the acquisition
of Damon in the second half of last year.
The contribution from joint venture companies doubled to Dollars 16.5m.
It reported a strong performance from Dow Corning, the joint venture company
at the centre of a global breast implant settlement which last quarter
caused Corning to take a Dollars 203m charge against profits.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: CS Holding lifts voting stake in
CS First Boston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CS Holding, the Swiss financial group whose interests include Credit Suisse,
has lifted its voting stake in the investment bank CS First Boston to more
than 75 per cent.
The increase, from 68.5 per cent, takes the group closer to its objective of
gaining outright ownership of the investment bank, which is in the middle of
a worldwide reorganisation.
However, a number of institutional investors, led by Metropolitan Life, the
US insurer, has rejected an offer from CS for the remaining voting shares.
CS said yesterday that it had bought the shares previously held by five of
the investment bank's 12 institutional shareholders.
The largest seller was Mitsui Trust and Banking, which had owned 1.8 per
cent. Three of the others were Japanese life companies and the fifth was a
European investment manager, CS said.
The purchases lift the group's interest in the investment bank's voting
shares to 75.7 per cent from 68.5 per cent, and in the non-voting shares to
63.2 per cent from 59.8 per cent.
The Swiss group said that its intention generally was to own all of the
shares in its subsidiaries, though it believed that it was beneficial for
the employees of an investment bank to have an economic interest in their
business.
Employees of CS First Boston are thought to own around 19 per cent of the
company's non-voting shares.
The offer to buy out the remaining shares followed an approach from some of
the institutional holders, who had expressed a desire to sell, CS said.
Metropolitan Life, which owns 9.9 per cent of the voting stock, and Crescent
Diversified, an investment vehicle which holds 5 per cent, were among those
that turned down the offer, details of which were not released.

<TEXT>
America West Airlines, the last big US airline still in Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, yesterday said it had won its creditors' agreement to
an amended reorganisation plan aimed at bringing the company out of
bankruptcy by early autumn.
The scheme will deliver effective control of the company to the same
investment group that brought Continental Airlines out of bankruptcy last
year and which owns 28 per cent of Continental.
The reorganisation plan incorporates a co-operation agreement between
America West and Continental, under which the two airlines will work
together in a number of operational and marketing areas - for example,
sharing flight codes on the same routes and merging their frequent-flyer
programmes.
Mr Bill Franke, America West's chairman, said the benefits of this alliance
would be worth at least Dollars 40m a year to America West. But he stressed
that the airline would remain independent, along with its separate Phoenix
hub and headquarters.
The reorganisation is backed by a consortium called Am-West Partners. This
is led by Air Partners, the investment group that brought Continental out of
bankruptcy.
One of Air Partners' principals is Mr David Bonderman, Continental's
non-executive chairman.
Other investors in AmWest Partners are Continental itself; Mesa Airlines, a
regional carrier based in New Mexico; and Fidelity Investments, a specialist
in bankruptcy rescues.
AmWest Partners will invest up to Dollars 244.9m in return for a 33.5 per
cent stake in America West. The unsecured creditors, who rejected an earlier
plan offering them 45 per cent of the company, will now get 59.5 per cent;
current shareholders will get 5 per cent; and GPA Group, a secured creditor,
will get 2 per cent.
Although this structure appears to leave AmWest Partners with a minority
stake in America West, some of its shares carry more votes than the other
shareholders', giving it more than 70 per cent of the votes.
Continental Airlines, which froze employees' pay and then cut it while in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, said it was resuming pay increases  - but
also said it would cut 1,000 jobs from its workforce of 43,000 over the next
few months.

<TEXT>
Swissair, Switzerland's shareholder-owned national airline, announced
Wednesday that its net group profit fell 48 per cent in 1993, to SFr59m
(Dollars 40.9m) from SFr113m in 1992, AP-DJ reports from Zurich.
It also said it would pass its dividend on the 1993 results.
As previously reported, the company posted a first-half 1993 group net loss
of SFr65m. Swissair indicated a month ago that full-year 1993 group results
would be positive.
At the airline level, 1993 net profit fell 68 per cent to SFr6.7m from
SFr20.8m in 1992. The company blamed fare erosion and said it would ask
shareholders to agree to omit a dividend. Last year, the airline paid a
dividend of SFr10 a share, down from SFr20 the year before.
Group cash flow from operations rose 10 per cent in 1993 to SFr518m from
SFr471m in 1992. Group revenues rose 3 per cent to SFr6.4bn from SFr6.2bn.
Group operating profit rose slightly last year to SFr216m from SFr214m in
1992.
Swissair also announced an offer to minority shareholders in its Balair-CTA
charter airline unit to swap their shares for shares in Swissair and cash.
Swissair said the offer will use Swissair shares which the company already
has in reserve.
The company will offer one Swissair registered share plus SFr79 in cash for
five Balair-CTA shares, and one registered share and SFr112 in cash for six
Balair-CTA participation certificates. Based on closing prices of March 31,
the offer represents a 23 per cent gain for shareholders and a 31 per cent
gain for owners of participation certificates, Swissair said.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Judge hits at AT&amp;T's McCaw
takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A US Federal judge has raised objections to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's
planned Dollars 12.6bn takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications, though he
left open the door to eventual approval of the deal.
The ruling came from district judge Harold Greene, who oversaw the 1982
anti-trust legal settlement under which long-distance phone operator AT&amp;T
spun off its seven local telephone companies into separate businesses, known
collectively as the 'Baby Bells'.
Judge Greene, who still monitors the settlement, ruled on Tuesday that
AT&amp;T's plans to buy McCaw, the largest cellular telephone service company in
the US, violated the 1982 pact, since this prevented AT&amp;T from buying the
'stock or assets' of any Baby Bell company. McCaw jointly owns with Baby
Bells cellular networks in several large cities.
However, Judge Greene left open the possibility that he would eventually
approve the deal, saying the 1982 agreement could be modified to permit this
 -provided AT&amp;T showed it was in the public interest.
Analysts said the ruling was unlikely to derail the takeover, but it could
delay its completion, due over the summer.
AT&amp;T said it would move quickly to state its case and was confident it could
win a waiver and complete the merger on schedule.
Analysts pointed out that as a last resort, AT&amp;T and McCaw could choose to
sell their interests in the cellular networks which prompted this week's
ruling.
Judge Greene was responding to objections to the McCaw deal raised by
BellSouth, the largest of the Baby Bells, which is a partner with McCaw in
some cellular licences.
BellSouth is using the case not so much to block the McCaw deal as to argue
before Judge Greene that the Baby Bells should be allowed to enter the
long-distance telecommunications market, in view of changes in the
communications industry over the past decade.
They were barred from this area when they were spun off from AT&amp;T.
Legislation before Congress would allow them into long-distance after a
delay of several years.
Mr Joseph Nacchio, president of AT&amp;T's consumer long distance business, said
his units, True Rewards and True USA Savings, were winning back customers at
a rate which was above internal expectations, Reuter reports from New York.
Mr Nacchio told the agency that AT&amp;T's first-quarter earnings would have
favourable news from the consumer long distance unit.
Last September, shortly after becoming president of the consumer long
distance unit, Mr Nacchio said his first goal would be to stop the loss of
market share.

<TEXT>
General Electric, the US conglomerate, said its earnings during the first
quarter of the year were 'at the high end of analysts' estimates', which it
said ranged from Dollars 1.45 to Dollars 1.50 a share.
The announcement marked an attempt by the industrial giant to scotch rumours
that its financial services businesses, which have been one of the main
engine of profits growth in recent periods, had suffered from rising US
interest rates.
In particular, market speculation centred on possible losses at Kidder
Peabody, the group's Wall Street brokerage house.
The concerns hit GE's share price during the day, pushing it down Dollars 2
1/4 at one stage to Dollars 96 5/8 . The shares staged a partial recovery
later to close at Dollars 97 5/8 .
In a statement, GE said that first-quarter earnings at both Kidder and GE
Capital Services, its financial services unit, would be 'excellent'. Dennis
Dammerman, the group's senior vice president in charge of finance, also said
that GE continues to expect record earnings for 1994 as a whole.
Kidder has had a patchy record in recent years and has been consistently
less profitable than its main competitors, leading to frequent speculation
that GE was looking to sell the business. Last year, though, operating
profits jumped to Dollars 439m from Dollars 300m the year before.

business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, has in effect left the leveraged
buy-out business, reflecting a need to conserve capital once it becomes a
free-standing company later this year.
Lehman said that four of the five managing directors in its merchant banking
business were leaving to set up their own firm, called Cypress Capital, 'by
mutual agreement'.
The four had been behind a Dollars 1.25bn, so-called 'merchant banking' fund
at Lehman, backed jointly by the bank and investment institutions, which
backed leveraged buy-outs and other private equity investments.
The investment bank said that it has no plans to raise another fund. This is
believed to spring in large part from a need to conserve capital.
American Express, which plans to spin off the bank by the end of June, has
been forced to back a Dollars 1.25bn recapitalisation of Lehman to enable it
to obtain a single-A credit rating.

<TEXT>
Mr Frank Lorenzo's ATX Corp is to appeal against a US Transportation
Department decision denying it a certificate of fitness to operate an
airline, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Lorenzo blamed trade union
influence for the rejection.
The department, in its rejection of ATX's bid to start up a short-haul,
low-fare East Coast airline, cited Mr Lorenzo's record of safety and
regulatory compliance problems.
His application was fought by airline unions, who charged him with driving
two of his former carriers, Eastern Air Lines and Continental Airlines, into
bankruptcy.
Mr Steve Kolski, ATX president, said that 'the decision to turn down ATX was
made by the department as a political pay-off to organised labour with total
disregard for the law, consumers' interests, or the rights of private
investors to start their own business'.
Mr Randolph Babbitt, Air Line Pilots Association president, said that
'justice has been done, and the public interest has been protected'.

<TEXT>
Cummins, the world's leading manufacturer of diesel engines, has issued an
optimistic assessment of its first-quarter performance, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
The Indiana-based company said earnings in the three months to the end of
March would 'meet or perhaps exceed' its results in the fourth quarter.
On an operating basis, Cummins generated a profit of Dollars 52.6m, or
Dollars 1.42 a share, in the final reporting period of 1993.
The estimate conformed with the forecasts of most analysts. Mr Gary McManus,
of Kemper Securities in Chicago, projected operating earnings of Dollars
1.60 a share, based on sustained demand for heavy-truck engines and
accelerating growth in the mid-range market.
The company added that its first-quarter revenues should reach the same
level as in the final 1993 period, when it reported sales of Dollars 1.12bn,
a 10 per cent year-on-year gain.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Learning to live with low prices
 -Changes are in store for the US oil industry, as Amoco chairman Larry
Fuller explains to Robert Corzine and David Lascelles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US oil industry is only now getting to grips with the prospect of a
prolonged period of relatively low oil prices, according to Mr Larry Fuller,
chairman and chief executive of Amoco, the fifth-largest US oil company.
He said that until recently US oil companies did not have to contend with
the same competitive pressures that forced other sectors, such as consumer
electronics and telecommunications, to undergo radical structural changes.
Mr Fuller, who announced a restructuring of Amoco last month, said the
sector had grown accustomed to rising oil prices and had been slow to react
to recent falls.
His restructuring aims to eliminate unnecessary levels of management. 'I
want to put less distance between the chairman and the shop floor,' he said.
The new structure will make its three operating companies - production,
refining and chemicals - leaner business units. A small corporate centre
will be created and some services now provided by Amoco staff may be
transferred to outside contractors.
Amoco looked outside the oil industry for a model, and is creating a
structure similar to that of Xerox.
Mr Fuller, who was in London to brief UK employees on the plan, declined to
say how many jobs would be affected, although there will be 'fewer people on
the payroll a year from now than there are today'.
He described low oil prices as 'self-correcting' and said there were signs
of strengthening gasoline demand in the US.
Low prices are not only causing companies to restructure, he said, but are
also likely to trigger a broader realignment in the industry.
Amoco's criteria in assessing any merger or takeover target include
'opportunities for rationalisation, complementary geographic coverage,
people skills and the state of the balance sheet when you've finished'.
But Mr Fuller noted that 'driving out duplication' as a result of mergers or
takeovers can 'take years'.
He said additional government incentives would be needed if companies were
to develop the smaller North Sea fields which are likely to be discovered.
Amoco is one of the larger gas producers in the UK sector of the North Sea,
which he said is 'somewhat less attractive' as a result of the government
removing tax breaks on exploration.
Gas also figures highly in Amoco's plans worldwide. In the US, high demand
has kept gas prices firm despite downward pressure on oil; the same is
happening in the UK.
Mr Fuller said Amoco will focus more on selling gas directly to users and
consumers. It is also keen to expand into power generation, and willing to
build and operate power stations in rapidly growing markets in Asia and
Mexico.
Unlike many other integrated oil companies, Amoco's chemical operations have
remained profitable - partly because of its lack of exposure to Europe,
where chronic over-capacity, exacerbated by recession, has led to widespread
losses.
Even so, Amoco made only Dollars 300m on chemicals last year, compared with
more normal levels of around Dollars 600m. But capital spending this year of
about Dollars 250m on chemicals will focus on fast-growing markets in Asia,
a move which analysts say should help boost the division's profits.
The company's upstream international strategy includes participation in a
consortium of western companies negotiating with the Azerbaijan government
to develop offshore reserves in the Caspian Sea.
Those talks have been partly held up by the government's indecision over
whether it or the national oil company should hold the Azeri stake in the
project, according to Mr Fuller.
The project is also waiting a decision on an export route for the oil. Mr
Fuller believes two pipelines will be built, one through to a Russian port
on the Black Sea and one to the south, possibly to Turkey.
'That would make a lot of economic sense,' he said, as one of the main
markets for Azeri oil is likely to develop in Turkey and neighbouring
countries.'
Amoco is also involved in Russia, where unresolved legal and tax issues
continue to hamper Western companies.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Novell appoints Frankenberg
president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Novell, the leading US computer networking software company, has appointed
Mr Robert Frankenberg, a senior Hewlett-Packard executive, as president and
chief executive to succeed Mr Raymond Noorda, who is retiring.
The appointment puts to rest concerns about management succession at Novell.
Mr Noorda, 69, had said last year that he planned to hand over the reins to
a new chief executive, but seemed in no hurry.
The issue became more pressing last month when Novell announced aggressive
expansion plans with the acquisition of WordPerfect, a leading word
processing software company, and Borland International's spreadsheet product
division.
The acquisitions will take Novell into the applications software market and
place it head to head with Microsoft, the world's largest software company.
Mr Frankenberg, 46, who has spent his 25-year career at Hewlett-Packard,
most recently heading the company's personal computer group, is seen as a
solid choice to lead Novell. His broad experience in software, information
systems and personal computing makes him well suited to the task, analysts
said.
'I have worked very closely with Novell over the past four or five years, at
HP,' said Mr Frankenberg. 'I am very excited about the merger with
WordPerfect. It was pivotal in my decision to join Novell, because it gives
us the opportunity to create a new era of network applications and make
those the natural way to use computing.'
Mr Noorda, who has shaped Novell into one of the largest and most
influential companies in the software industry over the past 12 years, said
he would remain chairman.
With the appointment of Mr Frankenberg, Novell has dissolved its 'office of
the president'. The company's senior executives will now report to the new
chief executive.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: CMB posts 14% decline in profits
for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CarnaudMetalbox (CMB), the Anglo-French packaging group, yesterday announced
a 14 per cent fall in net profits to FFr835m (Dollars 143.22m) for 1993 and
expressed caution about prospects for the current year.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, chairman, described 1993 as a tough year. 'In half of
Europe, currency translations reduced our profits by about 10 per cent
compared with 1992. In the other half, packaging markets suffered the worst
decline in about 20 years. Pricing pressure was severe everywhere,' he said.
Mr Hintz added that pressures on prices and volumes resulting from the
impact of recession remained severe. As a result, he said, 'we have to
remain cautious about projecting any meaningful profit improvement for the
year, at this stage'. The group decided, however, to maintain the dividend
at FFr4 per share.
According to Mr Hintz, the decline in the group's performance in 1993 had
been limited by cost-saving measures, restructuring and the benefits of
acquisitions. These included Anchor Hocking, a US food packaging group, and
food-can companies in Hungary and Finland. In the group's health and beauty
division, the group acquired Zeller Plastik, a manufacturer of plastic
closures.
The acquisitions represented a 4 per cent contribution to last year's sales
of FFr24.34bn, a 2 per cent decline on the 1992 figure. Excluding currency
effects, sales rose by a similar proportion. The total cost of last year's
acquisitions was FFr2.5bn, although the increase in group debts was limited
to FFr982m through the disposal of non-strategic businesses and solid cash
flow.
Operating profits fell by 16 per cent, or by 10 per cent if currency effects
are excluded. CarnaudMetalbox said the decline in profits was entirely the
result of particular difficulties in the European beverage cans market, weak
demand in Germany and specific problems in Asia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading Swedish commercial bank, has
announced the sale of Banque Scandinave en Suisse (BSS) for more than SKr2bn
(Dollars 250m). The buyer is the Sandoz Family Foundation of Lausanne.
SE-Banken declined to reveal precise terms for the deal, but said it would
have a 'significant positive' effect on earnings and a 'limited positive
impact' on its capital ratios.
BSS, a private Swiss bank specialising in fund and asset management, made a
SFr22m (Dollars 15.2m) profit last year and had total assets of SFr1.3bn as
at December 31 1993.
Mr Lars Isacsson, SE-Banken chief financial officer, said the sale was part
of the group's programme to concentrate on core activities. Earlier this
year the bank sold three subsidiaries within the Finans-Skandic group to GE
Capital as part of the strategy.
Mr Isacsson said SE-Banken intended to remain involved in fund and asset
management, but the emphasis would be on the Nordic area. 'Banque Scandinave
en Suisse developed a less Scandinavian flavour,' he stated, adding that its
importance to the group had diminished as European integration had
progressed. The bank intends to retain a private bank in Luxembourg to serve
international clients.
SE-Banken has owned a stake in BSS since 1964 when the operation was set up
in partnership with other Scandinavian banks. At the start of this year it
held 79 per cent of the bank before buying the outstanding shares from the
Northern Trust Corp of the US a month ago.
The Sandoz Family Foundation was set up in 1964 to maintain a 10 per cent
voting stake in Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-biggest private sector bank, is expected
tomorrow to announce plans to raise additional capital through a private
placing of American Depositary Receipts in the US.
Daimler-Benz, the country's largest industrial concern, may also unveil
further details of its previously-announced capital increase following
today's meeting of its supervisory board.
According to German newspaper reports, Dresdner will become the first German
financial institution to take the US route, aiming to raise around DM1.3bn
(Dollars 760m)
Bank officials said that any capital measures would be unveiled by Mr Jurgen
Sarrazin, chairman, at tomorrow's annual press conference to review last
year's results and the future outlook.
Mr Sarrazin is also expected to announce an increase of at least DM1 on
1992's DM12 dividend.
Full details of the plans at Daimler, which is expected to cut its payout,
are likely to be revealed at its press conference next Tuesday.
Mr Gerhard Liesen, finance director, said recently that he was aiming for a
capital increase this summer to bring in around DM3bn.
While a Dresdner ADR placing would not involve the bank in greater financial
disclosure - as was the case with Daimler when it was granted a full listing
on the New York Stock Exchange last year - the plan underlines growing
eagerness among German companies to gain greater access to the world's
largest capital market.
Analysts have raised their expectations of German banks' results following
Deutsche Bank's announcement last week of a 16 per cent increase in
operating earnings. One observer said yesterday Dresdner could announce a 25
per cent improvement at the operating level for 1993.
Expectations of Daimler's 1993 results are far lower - the nine-month result
was a DM2bn loss according to US accounting rules, and Mr Edzard Reuter,
group chairman, recently forecast a net profit DM600m for the full year,
according to German methods.
However, with much of its restructuring costs behind it or provided for, and
new Mercedes-Benz car models reported to be selling well, Mr Reuter is
expected to present a far brighter picture of prospects for this year and
next at Tuesday's press conference.
Although he has said the group could afford to hold its 1993 payout at DM13,
Mr Reuter has been dropping hints that an unchanged or higher dividend would
be unsuitable while the workforce was suffering the effects of job cuts and
other rationalisation measures.

Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank, is restructuring its
international management team as part of the new strategy being implemented
by Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman.
Mr Peyrelevade, who last month announced details of the loss-making bank's
FFr44.9bn (Dollars 7.7bn) govern-ment-backed rescue deal, has created new
positions at the top of its operations in the UK, US and Japan.
Mr Bernard Darmayan, former head of Credit Lyonnais' currency activities in
Paris, takes charge of its UK business. Mr Robert Cohen becomes head of its
US operations and Mr Bernard Mignucci adopts the same role in Japan. Both Mr
Cohen and Mr Mignucci were previously general managers of Credit Lyonnais in
those countries.
Meanwhile Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, whom Mr Peyrelevade replaced last autumn as
chairman of Credit Lyonnais, yesterday appealed to the Conseil d'Etat, the
government body, to challenge the legality of his dismissal last week as
chairman of the Credit National banking group.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Alcatel Alsthom holds up but
sees profits falling

<TEXT>
Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, yesterday confirmed his
forecast of a fall of between 10 and 20 per cent in net profits this year,
but said he was very optimistic for the medium and long term.
Announcing stable net profits of FFr7.06bn (Dollars 1.21bn) for 1993, Mr
Suard said that the French energy, telecommunications and transport group
had the necessary technological and international strength to resume profits
growth, although the timing of recovery would be determined by economic
conditions in its principal European markets.
'We are seeing the first encouraging signs arising from our technological
efforts,' said Mr Suard.
The Alcatel chairman said he was confident that a FFr15bn contract to supply
high-speed trains to South Korea would be finalised shortly. The group is
also expected to regain control of Framatome, the state-owned nuclear power
station group which is in the process of privatisation.
For 1994, however, Mr Suard forecast a difficult year.
Mr Suard described the 1993 performance as 'very favourable given the
economic environment.' Net debts were reduced to FFr7.25bn from FFr20.52bn,
largely as a result of cash flow of FFr16.61bn.
Sales during the year slipped to FFr156.33bn from FFr161.68bn. Europe
remained the biggest market, accounting for 72 per cent of sales, while Asia
accounted for 11 per cent of turnover. All of the group's divisions suffered
a decline in sales, with the exception of the batteries division.
Operating profits also declined in most activities, falling from FFr9.5bn to
FFr8.37bn in the telecommunications division and from FFr2.67bn to FFr2.25bn
in the cable operations. GEC-Alsthom, however, the transport and engineering
company which is jointly owned with GEC of the UK, raised operating profits
from FFr3.58bn to FFr4.17bn.
Net income was also constrained by a FFr2.5bn restructuring charge, compared
with a FFr3.2bn charge taken in 1992. Mr Suard said that the board was
proposing an increased dividend of FFr15 per share, compared with FFr14.50
for 1992.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Suez sees summer sale for
Victoire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suez, the French financial and industrial holding company, hopes by early
summer to conclude the sale of Victoire, its insurance business, Mr Gerard
Worms, chairman, said.
Victoire has been for sale since last autumn when Suez, which on Tuesday
announced a return to the black with a net profit last year of FFr1.6bn
(Dollars 270m), took full control of the company by acquiring the minority
shareholding previously held by Union des Assurances de Paris.
Mr Worms said that 'several European companies' had expressed interest in
Victoire, which is valued at FFr18bn in Suez's accounts. He added that
bidders had been asked to submit detailed offers over the next few weeks. A
number of prospective purchasers, including BAT Industries, the UK
conglomerate, have already withdrawn from negotiations.
The Victoire sale forms part of an aggressive programme of asset disposals
by Suez. The group, which has financial and industrial interests, has been
rationalising its activities.
Mr Worms said Suez envisaged a future dual role as a financial services
conglomerate and a majority shareholder of other businesses.

AP Moller, the shipping and oil and gas group, increased pre-tax profits to
DKr2.91bn (Dollars 434m) last year from DKr2.29bn in 1992, while net profits
increased to DKr1.98bn from DKr1.53bn.
Turnover at the shipping business, Tankers &amp; Liners in Partnership, rose to
DKr24.1bn from DKr19.5bn and net profit to DKr1.45bn from DKr1.05bn.
Turnover in Oil and Gas Partnership, which is engaged in production of oil
and gas from the Danish area of the North Sea, increased to DKr3.47bn from
DKr3.3bn and net profit to DKr134m from DKr127m.
An increase was proposed in the dividends paid by the twin parent companies,
D/S Svendborg and D/S 1912, both listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.
The dividend from D/S 1912 goes up to 52.5 per cent per DKr1,000 share from
45 per cent, and from D/S Svendborg to 75 per cent from 60 per cent, with
the total up at DKr224m from DKr178m.
Group assets increased to DKr43.2bn from DKr38.1bn and equity capital to
DKr19.3bn from DKr17.6bn. The preliminary report described the results of
Maersk Line, which operates container-carrying services, as satisfactory.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Change of strategy helps Cerus
reduce net losses to FFr251m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cerus, the French holding company controlled by Mr Carlo de Benedetti, the
Italian industrialist, achieved a sharp reduction in net losses last year,
to FFr251m (Dollars 43.05m) from FFr1.55bn in 1992
The group said the improved performance reflected its strategy of focusing
on industrial activities and cleaning up its finances. Mr de Benedetti said
the company was 'in a position to prepare for take-off again'.
The reduction followed reduced losses at its banking operations and a solid
contribution from Valeo, the French vehicle components group in which Cerus
holds a 30 per cent stake.
Losses at Dumenil Leble, the group's banking operation, fell to FFr363m from
FFr1.34bn. Cerus said that its management had been 're-centred' in France,
Luxembourg and Belgium and that the bank's principal risks had been
resolved. Cofir, the group's financial operation, contributed profits of
FFr26bn, despite difficult conditions in Spain.
A much larger contribution, of FFr206m, came from the group's investment in
Valeo, despite the downturn in the European vehicle sector. Cerus described
Valeo's prospects as 'particularly promising' and said its participation
would remain at the centre of the group's strategy.
In addition to curbing group losses, Cerus also achieved a sharp reduction
in debts, partly through the sale of assets. Net debts, according to the
group, were FFr108m at the end of last year, down from FFr1.45bn at the end
of 1992.

FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: From motorway to runway - National Express
plans to expand its airport side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tonight a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 will descend through the cloud over
Leicestershire and make its final approach to East Midlands, the regional
airport owned by a company better known for coach travel than transatlantic
flights.
When the aircraft taxis to a halt it will be unloaded and refuelled by
sub-contractors working for National Express Group, the long-haul coach
operator.
The group regards the nightly arrival from Newark, New Jersey, as testimony
to its success in diversifying from road travel into airport operations.
Less than a year since National Express acquired the airport from its
council owners, its Pounds 27.1m investment has been transformed from a
non-core activity into an integral part of its on-going business.
Its importance to National Express was underlined last month when the coach
operator unveiled a 36 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.3m
(Pounds 6.8m) for 1993. Of that total, the airport contributed Pounds 2.2m
after just five months as part of the enlarged group.
Those profits were boosted by the arrival of a number of new carriers,
including United Parcels Services, the US express mail business, which last
summer decided to move its cargo operations from London Stansted to East
Midlands. Growth, meanwhile, in charter and scheduled traffic has
underpinned a 10 per cent increase in passenger numbers to 1.37m.
By comparison, National Express's core long-haul coaches business struggled
to take off last year. Passenger journeys on its UK express coach business
fell by 6.6 per cent and turnover declined by 3.25 per cent to Pounds 92m.
Although the group is confident coach travel will bounce back, it believes
profits would be enhanced further by an enlarged airport portfolio.
'The vision now is to expand the airport side. I would expect us to have one
or two more airports by next year, but we're being very selective,' says Mr
Ray McEnhill, chief executive.
The gamble for National Express is whether it can repeat the success of East
Midlands at other airports. Mr McEnhill believes it can by adopting the same
criteria which last July persuaded it to acquire the Leicestershire hub.
National Express was attracted to East Midlands by its existing charter and
cargo business and its location next to the M1 motorway. Such criteria rules
out a number of airports - many of them no more than enlarged aerodromes -
and narrows the group's target range to a few sites, most of them
council-owned.
Mr McEnhill's bargaining position for such airports has been strengthened by
government policy.
Public spending rules prevent local authorities from borrowing on the open
market to fund airport expansion and - facing cash constraints elsewhere -
several councils are said to be considering disposals.
'We've examined five or six likely sites and it won't be long before we
select our target,' Mr McEnhill says.
His attention is thought to centre on Bristol Airport, owned by the city
council, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.9m in the 12 months to March
31 last year and saw passenger numbers increase by almost a third to 1.1m.
National Express may consider an investment in Birmingham International,
which is selling shares to fund an ambitious expansion programme, while
airports at Coventry and Southend could also attract its interest.
The group's ability to bid for such sites has been enhanced by the terms on
which it acquired East Midlands. It funded that transaction with Pounds
17.5m of medium-term debt, a Pounds 3.75m rights issue and cash reserves,
and still emerged with a strengthened balance sheet.
The reason is simple. The airport's council owners sold the site at a Pounds
10m discount to its Pounds 37m book value, and it has since been revalued at
Pounds 55.1m.
National Express would like to repeat the exercise with other councils and
is prepared to fund such acquisitions by either returning to the market or
increasing gearing from current levels of 22.5 per cent.
Industry trends have also played a part in persuading the coach group that
runways offer better profit potential than motorways.
While revenues from express coach travel have declined, regional airports
have seen demand climb steeply. Their popularity has increased with mounting
congestion at London's two main hubs and pressure on tour operators to offer
more diverse departure points.
Cargo carriers such as UPS, meanwhile, have been persuaded to move from the
south-east by the promise of unrestricted night flights and easy access to
the motorway network.
Encouraged by the increased activity, National Express has decided to invest
up to Pounds 3m on extending the East Midlands runway and enlarging the
apron space - enabling the airport to handle the largest fully-laden
aircraft.
According to Mr McEnhill, these developments will see National Express
emerge as a broadly-based transport group in which coach operations
complement aviation activities.
'We make no secret of our desire to be an airport operator - it could
account for more than 50 per cent of our profits in the near future.'

FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: B Matthews buys NZ lamb business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bernard Matthews, the turkey products group, yesterday announced its first
foray into red meat production with the purchase of a New Zealand lamb
business.
In its third acquisition in 12 months, Matthews is paying an undisclosed sum
for state-owned Advanced Foods, which has supplied lamb roasts to the UK
company since 1985. It is believed the price is less than the Pounds 3.9m
net asset value attributed to Advanced Foods.
Mr David Joll, Matthews' managing director, said the acquisition would open
new markets to the company's more familiar turkey products. About 50 per
cent of Advanced Foods' sales are outside Europe, to markets such as North
America and Japan.
Matthews is expected to invest about Pounds 2m in expanding the business and
will introduce lamb products through its distribution outlets in France and
Germany this year.
Advanced Foods, owned by the New Zealand Meat Producers Board, was created
in 1985 to produce lamb products using technology licensed from Matthews.
Last year Advanced Foods made profits of less than Pounds 1m on sales of
Pounds 15m. Mr Joll said the purchase was expected to make a small
contribution in the current year.

FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs put Pittards in loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pittards reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.81m for 1993 after
restructuring and closure costs of Pounds 8.3m relating to its withdrawal
from clothing leather production, writes Jean Marshall.
There were profits of Pounds 853,000 for 1992, restated for FRS 3.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 114.6m (Pounds 100.6m) with Pounds 100.5m coming
from continuing operations.
Before provisions, operating profits on continuing activities were Pounds
3.1m (Pounds 4.7m). The pre-tax result was after net interest costs of
Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 2.11m).
Losses per share came through at 35p against earnings of 0.7p but a dividend
of 1p (2p) is proposed for the year.
Mr David Macdonald, chairman, said that wool sheepskin prices, which had
been volatile during the early months of 1993, rose sharply in the second
half and had continued to rise in the first quarter of 1994.
However, the chamois division, although still lossmaking, performed
appreciably better in the second half, he added.
So far this year the group's factories had operated at virtually full
capacity.
In addition, there was an improving proportion of higher margin products in
the sales mix.
Net borrowings at the year-end were slightly lower at Pounds 15.3m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
George Wimpey is to reinforce its position in UK quarrying with a move to
full ownership of Wimpey Hobbs, its west country and Wales quarrying
company.
The move involves Wimpey's purchase for Pounds 7.5m of the remaining 20 per
cent interest in Wimpey Hobbs held by Hobbs Properties, a family owned
company.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, said full ownership improved the group's
flexibility significantly. 'We will be able to complete the merger of our
two UK businesses - Wimpey Hobbs in the south and Wimpey Asphalt in the
north - giving increased opportunities for rationalisation and investment,'
he said.

FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Friendly Hotels advances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the anticipated improvement in trading conditions did not
materialise, Friendly Hotels managed to achieve increased turnover and
profits in 1993.
On turnover up from Pounds 29.6m to Pounds 32.4m, pre-tax profits for the
year to December 26 came out at Pounds 2.61m.
That compared with restated profits of Pounds 374,000 for 1992, although the
company said the advance was rather more modest when compared with the
pre-FRS 3 figure of Pounds 2.54m.
Earnings per share were 6.3p (9.5p losses) and a final dividend of 3.5p is
recommended, maintaining the total at 5.7p.
Two new hotels were opened towards the end of last year, and were 'trading
encouragingly' in 1994, the company said.
In September Friendly raised some Pounds 10m through a rights issue,
reducing net borrowings to Pounds 30.1m and gearing to 37 per cent.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Irish Life shows 12% embedded
value rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Irish Life, Ireland's largest fund manager in the life and pension market,
reported a 11.9 per cent increase in embedded value from IPounds 494m to
IPounds 553m (Pounds 531m) in 1993 - broadly in line with market
expectations.
In calculating the embedded value - the financial yardstick which measures
the net present value of current and future surpluses expected to be
generated from business currently on the company's books - the company has
moved from a 15 per cent to a 12 per cent discount rate policy. This is in
line with the fall in money market rates.
Pre-tax profits edged ahead to IPounds 41.9m (IPounds 41.6m). Premium income
increased by IPounds 99m - or 16.6 per cent - to IPounds 697m, with the
strongest growth occurring in Interstate, the US subsidiary, where premium
income grew by 48 per cent to IPounds 115m. Investment income rose by 26 per
cent to IPounds 309m.
In the group's core Irish market, individual single premium sales - which
had dropped sharply in 1992 to only IPounds 55.7m - staged a recovery and
rose 64 per cent to IPounds 91.3m, although this was still well down on the
1990 level of IPounds 141m.
This sector has suffered through competition from low-tax savings products
in the Irish market.
Overall premium income in the Irish market grew by 11 per cent to IPounds
455.5m, but market share slipped by two percentage points to 25.7 per cent.
The UK division saw premium income rise 21 per cent to IPounds 105.7m, but a
fall in new business is anticipated in 1994, as the distribution network is
overhauled and cost-cutting measures are implemented.
The company also announced that it is to acquire another US subsidiary, the
Boston-based First Variable Life, for between Dollars 50m and Dollars 55m
(Pounds 37.6m).
The company is licensed to sell unit-linked products throughout the US and
has assets of Dollars 350m.
Total funds under management at the year-end jumped 34 per cent to IPounds
6.45bn.
Earnings per share rose from 10.54p to 10.88p. The final dividend is
increased to 6.12p for a total up 8 per cent to 9.12p (8.44p).
COMMENT
With the aftershocks of the 1992 currency crisis now behind it, strong
growth in the US and an overhaul of its operations under way in both the
Irish and European markets, the group is beginning to deliver on the
expectations that had been created at its flotation three years ago. An
increase in embedded value of IPounds 70m looks possible this year, and if
goodwill of IPounds 100m is added for the value of cost savings and new
business anticipated, then the current share price of 207p looks cheap by UK
standards.

Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual insurer, has confirmed that KPMG Peat
Marwick has lost the job of auditing its accounts because of the policy
pursued by partners in KPMG Peat Marwick Thorne, the UK accountancy firm's
Canadian partnership, over a property transaction.
The dispute has thus broken a relationship going back in one form or another
to the early 1900s, and generating more than Pounds 1m in fees for the
auditors last year.
In Standard Life's annual report, Mr Scott Bell, group managing director,
said that Price Waterhouse would be proposed as the new auditors.

FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rothmans, Vendome to join indices -
Indications would put companies in Mid 250 index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rothmans and Vendome Luxury Group will be included in UK stock market
indices next year under a rule approved yesterday by the FT-SE Actuaries
Share Indices Committee.
Shares in the two companies, formed last October through the reorganisation
of the tobacco and luxury goods empire, had initially been excluded from the
FT-SE indices, although Dunhill, their former incarnation, had been
included.
On current indications Rothmans would be included in the Mid 250 index,
while Vendome could be on the borderline of the Mid 250.
The two groups each have a complex corporate structure, with one UK company
share and one foreign company share traded in 'stapled units'.
Only the UK company share is eligible to be included in the UK indices, and
the problem lies in determining the proportion of the stapled unit accounted
for by the eligible company.
The companies' weightings in the indices will be based on the percentage of
the total assets which the eligible company is entitled to, calculated from
the audited accounts.
After Rothmans and Vendome lost an appeal to have their shares included last
December, a working party was set up to look at the question of the
treatment of such complex cross border structures in the indices.
An adviser to the two companies, who was involved in pressing for their
inclusion, said yesterday of the committee's decision that he was 'happy
they have changed their thinking.'
However, he thought there could still be subjectivity in the value given to
companies in indices if they had significant intangible assets.
Under the new rule, SmithKline Beecham units will remain in the indices.

FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Merrydown cuts workforce by 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merrydown, the specialist Sussex-based cider maker, is to reduce its
workforce by 15 per cent at an estimated cost of Pounds 300,000. It has also
appointed a new finance director, Mr Stephen Burke, formerly acquisitions
manager with Dunhill, the tobacco and luxury goods company.
The announcement follows a profits warning in February and the departure of
Mr Michael O'Driscoll, finance director, in March.
Mr Richard Purdey, chairman, said 30 of Merrydown's 195 employees had been
made redundant. The sales force has been cut from 25 to 14, with the
regional sales network being axed and the remainder concentrating on key
accounts such as supermarkets.
The company said cost savings from the measures were expected to amount to
more than Pounds 1m. In the year to March 1993, pre-tax profits were down to
Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 1.9m).
Merrydown's shares were unchanged yesterday at 149p, compared with a peak of
405p in October 1990.

FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 21m Swedish purchase for Siebe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Siebe, the international controls and engineering group, is to become
Europe's leading control valve producer following its acquisition for Pounds
21m of Sweden's NAF Group.
Mr Allen Yurko, Siebe's chief executive, described the acquisition as a
'perfect fit' from a geographical, product, and market sector point of view.
NAF makes industrial control valves, actuators and positioners, and is
particularly strong in the pulp and paper industry, where Siebe has limited
exposure. It also sells to the energy sector.
The company is debt free and has been consistently profitable. It has a 25
per cent market share in the Nordic countries, where Siebe has yet to
develop a presence.
About 80 per cent of NAF's sales are in Scandinavia, and Mr Yurko said: 'One
of the key strategies here is to add the full range of Foxboro Eckardt
products into the Scandinavian market.'
Siebe invested some Pounds 110m last year in expanding its controls division
through the acquisition of three new companies, Eckardt, Eberle and Schmidt.
Analysts expect similar bolt-on acquisitions to follow, as Siebe broadens
its range of products and markets.

FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: New FT-SE index rule on stapled units
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following announcement was made yesterday by the FT-SE Actuaries Share
Indices Steering Committee.
The Committee has today approved a new rule governing the treatment of
stapled units.
The effect of the new rule is that SmithKline Beecham Units will remain a
constituent of the FT-SE Indices and that Rothmans and Vendome Luxury Group
will be eligible for inclusion in the FT-SE Indices at the end of 1994.
The weighting of the SB Units in the indices will, based on information
provided by the company, remain unchanged, although subject to annual review
following the publication of the company's audited accounts beginning in
1995.
The weighting of Rothmans and Vendome will be determined by the UK Indices
Committee in December this year after the publication of the audited
accounts of the two companies and reviewed annually thereafter.
Rothmans and Vendome have informed the Steering Committee that under the new
rule, they believe approximately 30 per cent of the market value of the
Rothmans Units and approximately 10 per cent of the market value of the
Vendome Units would be eligible for inclusion in the indices. These
proportions may change when the audited accounts of the two groups are
finalised.
A stapled unit is a unit which comprises shares in two separate companies
(often of different nationalities) which are twinned in the form of a single
indivisible unit for the purposes of trading and for which a single price
exists for the unit rather than the underlying shares.
A share index is calculated from the share prices of its constituent
companies each weighted to account for the company's relative importance in
the index. In the FT-SE Indices, the weighting factor is derived from a
company's issued equity share capital.
The problem posed by multinational stapled units, for a UK index, is
determining how much of the combined unit's capitalisation is attributable
to the UK company. Once this is done, the required weighting can be
calculated.
The new rule provides a way of arriving at this weighting. The weighting of
a UK company, traded as part of a stapled unit, will be based on the equity
share capital where this matches the attributable earnings and dividend
flows.
Otherwise, the economic value of the eligible (UK incorporated and tax
resident) company will be assessed by comparing the asset values of the
eligible and ineligible companies within the unit.

<TEXT>
Hogg Group, the medium-sized insurance broker, confirmed yesterday that it
had 'received preliminary approaches from a number of parties which may or
may not lead to an offer'.
HSBC Holdings last week announced the acquisition of a 6 per cent stake  -
worth about Pounds 6m - in Hogg Group, prompting speculation in the City
that a takeover bid was in the offing.
Mr Anthony Howland-Jackson, chairman and chief executive of Hogg, said HSBC
had shown interest in the past but that no formal approach had been made
recently.
Yesterday's announcement prompted further upward movement in Hogg's shares
which closed up 23p at 205p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Associated British Foods yesterday confirmed that it was in talks about the
possible sale of its retail outlets to Greggs, the chain of bakers.
AB Foods said a further announcement would be made 'within the next four
weeks'. Meanwhile no other details would be released.
One analyst said the sale could raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m for
AB Foods, but it was hard to estimate as there was little information about
the portfolio of shops.
While the deal would be a small one for AB Foods, it could double the size
of Greggs.
AB Foods shares rose 6p yesterday to 583p, after a 18p rise on Tuesday when
the deal was widely rumoured. Greggs were unchanged at 743p.
Greggs, which is based in Newcastle upon Tyne, has 500 shops, while AB
Foods' chain totals 495 shops, mostly trading under the Baker's Oven name
and concentrated in the south-east.

FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Telegraph pays directors Pounds 2.72m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Directors of The Telegraph newspaper group received total emoluments of
Pounds 2.72m in 1993, up from Pounds 1.51m the previous year.
A large part of the increase represented a one-off Pounds 480,000 payment to
Mr Daniel Colson for his work in connection with the group's investment in
John Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper group, where he is chief
executive.
That bonus made Mr Colson the highest paid director in 1993, receiving
Pounds 692,000.
Mr Conrad Black, chairman of The Telegraph, received an increase from Pounds
148,000 to Pounds 237,000. In addition, The Telegraph pays two thirds of the
cost of Mr Black's office at Hollinger, The Telegraph's parent, and pays
Hollinger for other services, such as advice on acquisitions. These costs
totalled Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 813,000).
During 1993, The Telegraph and Hollinger combined to take a 18.7 per cent
stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper publisher.

FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: City Centre up 15% as customers increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An increase in customers helped City Centre Restaurants, which owns the Deep
Pan Pizza and Garfunkels chains, lift profits for 1993 by almost 15 per
cent.
The pre-tax line rose from Pounds 11m to Pounds 12.6m on the back of a 6 per
cent increase in turnover to Pounds 95.2m (Pounds 89.6m).
Mr Bruce Johnston, chairman, said that covers had risen by 5 per cent in the
final quarter, with the week between Christmas and the new year particularly
strong. However, the average spend per customer remained flat.
London had been buoyant in the first part of this year, he said. More than
40 per cent of the group's 165 restaurants are within the M25 motorway.
Mr Johnston said he hoped that this week's tax increases would not dampen
the improvement once people opened their pay packets at the end of the
month.
The group opened eight new branches during the year, and now has 99 Deep Pan
Pizza restaurants and 47 Garfunkels. It is planning to open at least 10 more
this year.
The main focus would continue to be the pizza chain, where the average spend
is Pounds 5 a head. Outlets were now being sought at out-of-town cinema and
leisure complexes where people could park without being clamped, Mr Johnston
said.
In order to benefit from the growing consumer interest in ethnic foods, the
group is aiming to increase the rate of openings at its 10-strong chain of
Chiquito Mexican restaurants. It is also planning further Caffe Uno pasta
restaurants after successfully converting two of its outlets last year.
Capital expenditure for 1993 totalled Pounds 8.2m. The group ended the year
with net cash up from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 14m; net interest receivable
was Pounds 672,000 (Pounds 574,000).
Earnings per share rose from 3.99p to 4.52p. A final dividend of 1.33p is
proposed, lifting the total for the year from 1.57p to 1.78p.
Mr Phillip Kaye, the founder of the group who retired as chief executive
last October, is retiring as an executive director on June 30, but will
continue as a non-executive director.

FT  07 APR 94 / Astra bolstered in Japan afterlifting stake in drugs partner
</HEADLINE>

Astra, the Swedish drugs group, has finalised a SKr1.8bn (Pounds 154m) deal
with its Japanese partner Fujisawa, strengthening its position in the
world's second largest pharmaceuticals market.
The agreement lifts Astra's stake in Fujisawa-Astra to 90 per cent, from 51
per cent, and gives it full management control.
The Swedish group will also buy back the product rights for its local
anaesthetics business from the Japanese group. Fujisawa will retain 10 per
cent of the venture and support it with manufacturing and distribution
services.
Astra, one of the world's fastest growing pharmaceuticals companies, said
the move was designed to bolster the position of its anti-asthma drugs in
the Japanese market in the second half of the 1990s.
'Our partners were reluctant to invest in the development of new inhaled
anti-inflammatory asthma agents such as Pulmicort,' it stated.
Pulmicort, Astra's second biggest selling drug with 1993 sales of SKr2.96bn,
has yet to be launched on the Japanese market.
The drug, with its Turbuhaler inhaling device, will be filed for approval in
Japan next year, and other anti-asthma products will be filed later.
Mr Hakan Mogren, Astra president, said: 'Astra has substantially increased
its influence over Fujisawa-Astra. We will now transfer local clinical
research on Pulmicort Turbuhaler and other anti-asthma agents to this
company.'
Astra will continue to buy its local anaesthetics from Fujisawa, but by
gaining the marketing rights it will get a higher share of profits.
Sales through Fujisawa-Astra amounted to SKr1.9bn last year. The figure
includes two-thirds of Astra's Japanese sales of Losec, the anti-ulcer agent
which is the world's second biggest ulcer drug after Glaxo's Zantac. Losec
has between 5 and 6 per cent of the Japanese market.
Analysts said the deal with Fujisawa would give Astra greater control over
its Japanese operations, but added that it might be moderately dilutive in
the short-term.

FT  07 APR 94 / Smash-up delay on 'information super-highway': The
implications of two abandoned US telecommunications deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With two juggernauts lying smashed at its side, the road to America's
'information super-highway' is looking increasingly bumpy.
On Tuesday, Southwestern Bell, the large Texas-based local
telecommunications group, announced that it was abandoning a plan to invest
Dollars 1.6bn for a 40 per cent stake in the cable television operations of
Cox Enterprises, a private media group.
Just six weeks ago Bell Atlantic, the Philadelphia-based phone group, and
Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), the largest US cable company, said they were
calling off a Dollars 22bn merger which Mr Raymond Smith, Bell Atlantic's
chairman, had once hailed as 'a model for communications companies in the
next century'.
The idea was that large telecoms and cable companies - which are potential
rivals in developing the information superhighway, a network offering
interactive multi-media entertainment and services - would do better to form
partnerships to pool their respective expertise. Cable companies are good at
providing entertainment services, while telephone companies have much
greater expertise at routing two-way communications traffic.
The collapse of the deals suggest that the introduction of multi-media
services will proceed more slowly than its most visionary proponents have
been suggesting and will not involve many full-blown mergers between
telephone companies and cable networks.
That said, America's leading phone and cable companies remain committed to
pouring billions of dollars into the development of an information
superhighway.
Both Bell Atlantic and Southwestern Bell have blamed the unravelling of
their deals on the Federal Communications Commission, the government agency
which oversees the communications sector, and on 1992 legislation which
ordered tighter regulation of cable TV prices after public criticism of
escalating rates charged by these essentially monopolistic companies.
In February, the FCC, under its new chairman, Mr Reed Hundt (a Clinton
administration appointee) ordered cable companies to cut by 7 per cent the
charges to consumers for a basic package of television channels. Bell
Atlantic and Southwestern Bell say the resulting reduction in cable
companies' cashflow undermines the financial assumptions on which their
deals were based.
Rate re-regulation has certainly increased financial uncertainty in the
cable industry, and diminished the immediate financial attractions of the
sector to the local telephone companies, which are themselves heavily
regulated and want to get into less controlled businesses.
However, analysts suspect that there is more to the collapse of the two
deals than can be laid at the FCC's door. Certainly, in the case of Bell
Atlantic/TCI, sharp differences in culture between the staid telephone
company and the free-wheeling cable operator appear to have played a role,
as well as Wall Street anxiety over the cost of the deal to Bell Atlantic.
If the information superhighway offers telephone companies as glittering a
financial future as industry leaders claim, should not they be willing to
ride out a short-term dip in cable cashflow?
The problem is that no one knows just how profitable, or when, multi-media
services will prove for the companies that provide them. It is far from
certain that consumers will actually want the services, ranging from movies
on demand to inter-active home shopping and computer games.
These factors suggest that while telephone companies will continue to press
ahead with capital investment in multi-media networks of their own, they
will proceed more gingerly with involvement in the cable industry, making
either small acquisitions in areas where they do not offer a phone service,
or joint ventures. One such route has been pioneered by Southwestern Bell,
which in January became the first regional phone company to buy a cable
system outright, paying Dollars 650m for two systems in the suburbs of
Washington DC, It where the number of homes taking a cable service is high.
Another route was pioneered last year by US West, the Denver-based phone
company, which spent Dollars 2.5bn on a 23 per cent stake in Time Warner's
cable TV and entertainment business.
Time Warner is planning to roll out a much-vaunted multi-media field trial
to 4,000 homes in Florida, but the launch date has been postponed from this
month to the autumn because of technical difficulties - a delay which raises
additional questions about the speed at which the information highway will
be built.

FT  07 APR 94 / Man Utd profits up 65% at half time: Shares recover from
worries about form on the pitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester United yesterday shrugged off disappointment at its inconsistent
form and suspension of star players by unveiling a 65 per cent increase in
first-half profits.
The Premier League leaders saw pre-tax profits grow from Pounds 4.62m to
Pounds 7.6m in the six months to January 31, as the club benefited from
greater stadium capacity and success in cup competitions.
Sir Roland Smith, chairman, said the team's style of play - which has
propelled it towards the league title and FA Cup semi-finals this season -
had encouraged large attendances at Old Trafford, where a new stand has
increased capacity by more than a third to 44,500.
The announcement prompted a 15p increase in the share price to 675p -
reversing losses following recent defeats and representing a 75 per cent
gain on the 1991 flotation price.
Capacity crowds and higher merchandise sales fuelled a 50 per cent rise in
operating profits to Pounds 6.6m in the first half, the period in which the
club plays most fixtures and makes more than 60 per cent of its profits.
Gate receipts rose 68 per cent to Pounds 10.68m, while merchandise turnover
jumped threefold to Pounds 6.66m.
Together, they underpinned a 75 per cent increase in total turnover to
Pounds 22.8m.
Although contributions from television contracts, sponsorship and conference
facilities also improved, the club said it was concentrating efforts on
further developing its merchandise division.
Those efforts include an agreement with Manufacturers Life of Canada to
offer financial services including Peps and life assurance.
The balance sheet, meanwhile, was strengthened by a Pounds 2m increase in
the transfer fee reserve to Pounds 3.25m, which the club said would be used
to acquire new players before the July year-end.
Mr Robin Launders, finance director, said the club had also negotiated new
deals with kit sponsors Umbro and club sponsors Sharp. The negotiations are
thought to have centred on the team's prospects in Europe, where it could
qualify for either the European or UEFA Cup and, should it win the FA Cup,
the Cup Winners' Cup.
'We reckon on making at least Pounds 2m if we qualify for the European Cup,'
said Mr Launders.
Earnings per share rose from 25.8p to 43.2p before switching funds to the
transfer fee reserve, and 26.8p afterwards.
An interim dividend of 6.5p (6p) is declared.

J Sainsbury, the UK food retailer, is joining three continental European
groups to form one of Europe's largest retailing partnerships.
Other members of the group, to be known as SEDD, are the family-owned
Esselunga, Italy's third largest retailer; Docks de France, one of France's
biggest grocery groups; and Delhaize 'Le Lion', Belgium's largest
supermarket operator.
Mr Michael Morgan, Sainsbury's director of international buying, said the
partnership was not just a buying group, but a 'multi-functional' alliance.
'This will be a strong pan-European association of leading and respected
companies, a group that could benefit many people.
'If we go into something like this, we will not be keeping one hand behind
our back. There has got to be a relationship of trust and mutual respect,'
he said.
He said all members would exchange knowledge in areas such as information
technology and systems. There could also be co-operation in marketing and
distribution. Sainsbury's partners might benefit from its expertise in
developing own-label products.
The four groups together exert considerable buying power, but Mr Morgan said
that while buying would be 'co-ordinated', it would not be centralised.
He added that manufacturers would also gain from the partnership, with the
opportunity eventually to launch products in four markets simultaneously.
Mr Morgan said the groups, which all retain a strong family influence, were
'culturally alike'. There were, however, no plans to strengthen the
relationship, for example through cross-ownership of shares.
Sainsbury began informal contacts several years ago with Esselunga and
Delhaize, but it was the development of links last year with Docks de
France, which operates the Mammouth hypermarket chain, which led to the
decision to formalise the partnership. The UK company and Docks de France
are to open a jointly owned off-licence in Calais at the end of this month.
As growth opportunities within home markets diminish, analysts expect more
European retailers to be pushed into forming alliances. Argyll, the UK's
third largest grocer, is already a member of the European Retail Alliance
(ERA), with Ahold of the Netherlands and France's Casino.

FT  07 APR 94 / SBC ruffles feathers in Eurotunnel camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A row involving Eurotunnel, its financial advisers and Swiss Bank
Corporation (SBC) took a surprise turn yesterday with a ban on a senior SBC
executive taking part in Eurotunnel's proposed Pounds 600m-Pounds 750m
rights issue.
SBC is financial adviser to Transmanche Link (TML), the construction
consortium which built the Channel tunnel. The dispute over SBC's role in
the rights issue threatens to take the gloss off the payments settlement
reached on Tuesday between Eurotunnel and TML.
Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, which will operate trains
through the tunnel, announced that SBC had confirmed that Mr Brian Keelan, a
senior corporate finance executive, would play no part in the underwriting.
Mr Keelan had aroused Sir Alastair's wrath by revealing that the rights
issue might be as large as Pounds 750m. He had also irritated Eurotunnel's
advisers, Morgan Grenfell, Banque Indosuez and SG Warburg Securities by
appearing to exaggerate SBC's role in the rights issue. Eurotunnel said
yesterday: 'comments by Mr Keelan on that issue, its possible timing and
underwriting were improper, incorrect and unauthorised.'
SBC was keen to play down the involvement of Mr Keelan in the underwriting.
He had played a senior role in negotiating the settlement between TML and
Eurotunnel, but would not have a part in the underwriting, SBC said.
SBC will still play an important role. As well as handling a Pounds 75m
share issue to TML and a Pounds 52m funding deal linked to warrants, it is
also expected to be responsible for a quarter of the primary underwriting of
the main rights issue.
But one banker said: 'They have used the underwriting of the shares being
taken up by TML to push into the transaction and trodden on the toes of
Eurotunnel's traditional advisers.'
Mr Keelan is a senior member of a corporate finance team which has ruffled a
few City feathers. As part of its efforts to expand in the London market,
SBC has taken to attacking accepted practices and undercutting rivals - or,
as it might argue, it has brought innovative ideas to a rather staid system.
Mr Keelan last year challenged the traditional flat-rate 2 per cent fee for
underwriting rights issues. He argued that by using option theory,
underwriters could set a price directly related to the risk involved in the
exercise. He was also involved when SBC intervened in the enhanced scrip
dividend scheme pioneered by Barclays de Zoete Wedd to offer a better deal
to investors.

FT  07 APR 94 / Swedish forester abandons Pounds 230m French expansion plan

<TEXT>
SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, yesterday tore up a FFr2bn
(Pounds 230m) plan to buy 89.8 per cent of Otor Holding, one of France's
biggest packaging companies.
It also scrapped plans for a SKr1bn share issue to foreign investors, which
would have partially funded the purchase.
The company said: 'SCA and the principal shareholders of Otor have not been
able to agree on final terms for the acquisition of Otor by SCA.' It
declined to elaborate.
However, it appears the Swedish group became disenchanted with the deal
after Stora, its leading domestic rival, claimed to have first refusal on
the stake.
Stora holds 10.2 per cent of Otor.
SCA said that Otor's main owners, Mr Jean-Yves Bacques and family, had
presented documents showing that the pre-emption rights did not exist, but
Stora was sticking by its position yesterday.
SCA stressed that it was not blaming Stora for the collapse of the deal,
noting that it had had a 'constructive dialogue' with the company. Stora
insisted it had not planned to exercise its first refusal option and said it
had been willing to sell its existing stake to its rival.
SCA announced the preliminary agreement to buy Otor less than three weeks
ago.
The move would have increased its share of the European packaging market in
products such as corrugated board from 9 to to 11 per cent, assisting its
wider ambition of building a 15 per cent market position.
It would have become the second largest packaging company in France, with
its market share rising from 4.5 to nearly 17 per cent.
The group maintains its expansion strategy will continue. However, analysts
interpreted the announcement as a setback. 'This means that they will not be
nearly as strong as they had hoped to be in the French market,' said Mr
Denis Christie, paper and packaging analyst with James Capel in London.
Under the deal, SCA would have paid FFr1.77bn initially. Mr Bacques and
family would have subscribed to SKr300m of the share issue, with the balance
going to international investors.

FT  07 APR 94 / China sounds alarm over growing industrial unrest: Reforms
push up unemployment as state enterprises face funds squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China sounded the alarm yesterday over rising unemployment, growing
industrial unrest and the deteriorating health of state industry, which is
under pressure in the transition to a market economy.
Commentaries in the People's Daily - the Communist party newspaper - and the
Economic Daily drew attention to potential instability in China's cities
where state enterprises are undergoing a painful transformation.
Alarmist references in the official press to China's economic problems
coincide with indications that the country may be entering an uncertain
period, with fresh reports about the deteriorating health of senior leader
Deng Xiaoping.
'This year and next year the employment situation will be extremely grim,'
said the People's Daily in an unusually frank reference to looming problems
in a politically sensitive area. The Economic Daily also displayed unusual
candour in referring to the plight of the state sector which it said would
register little or no growth this year due to 'lack of funds and sluggish
sales'.
Western officials in Beijing wonder whether the fresh detention of Mr Wei
Jingsheng, China's most prominent dissident, on suspicion of commiting 'new
crimes' might be connected with internal party struggles. The fate of
dissidents has in the past been tied to conflict between party moderates and
hardliners.
Confirmation of pressures on the once heavily-subsidised state sector came
with a report yesterday that a Shanghai textile company had become the
city's first state enterprise to file for bankruptcy.
Wen Wei Po, a pro-Beijing Hong Kong daily, reported that the Shanghai Number
Two Weave Band factory blamed bad management, accumulated debts and removal
of subsidies.
In industrial strongholds like Wuhan in central China and Harbin in the
north-east, unemployment is rising rapidly and companies starved of credit
are barely surviving.
Disaffected workers in state enterprises across China have engaged in
unprecedented levels of unrest in the past year.
Official unemployment in urban areas is 2.6 per cent, but this vastly
understates the extent of the problem. Some estimates put urban unemployment
at about 20 per cent of the workforce.
People's Daily quoted Mr Li Boyong, the labour minister, as saying that
China was 'faced with unprecedented challenges in deploying all the
jobless'.
A prices spiral is adding to disaffection among city workers. Cost of living
increases are running at more than 25 per cent compared with the same period
last year, according to statistics for February.

FT  07 APR 94 / Small businesses set to benefit in wide review of company
law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wide-ranging reform of company law aimed at helping the growth of small
businesses was signalled yesterday by Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate
affairs minister.
Simplification of the 1985 Companies Act and the creation of a new corporate
organisation along the lines of an incorporated partnership are two ideas to
be considered by a Law Commission review, he said.
The review, announced yesterday, follows a Department of Trade and Industry
working party set up to study possible reforms of company law.
Part of the government's deregulation policy, the action is seen by
ministers as a means of removing obstacles to the growth of small businesses
into medium-sized companies better able to compete, particularly in the
European single market, and to provide increased employ-ment.
The DTI stressed, however, that the review should be seen as a necessary
updating of current legislation rather than dramatic root and branch reform.
An incorporated partnership might dispense with some existing concepts of
company law such as the distinction between shareholders and directors while
retaining other features such as separate legal responsibility and limited
liability.
The simplification of the Companies Act might allow companies to opt out of
some of its provisions. The protection provided for creditors and others
would not be diminished, Mr Hamilton said.
The commission will also look at reform of laws on legally binding corporate
documents like contracts and loan agreements.
The DTI considers there are still fundamental problems with the law
regarding such documents, such as conflicting and inconsistent statutory
provisions. It is expected that a consultation paper will be issued by the
commission on this subject in 1995.
The announcements were welcomed yesterday by the Federation of Small
Businesses. A spokesman said: 'A move towards incorporated partnerships
would be particularly important. It would help bridge the gap between
partnerships and companies which is currently a serious weakness in
Britain's industrial structure. At the moment, this gap means we are losing
out in our trade with the rest of Europe.'
The commission will identify specific areas needing attention. It will now
begin consultation to pinpoint the main problems facing small businesses
before making firm proposals.
The commission is expected to report to ministers by July. A DTI spokesman
said legislation would not follow immediately as recommendations would then
have to be studied fully.

FT  07 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Hogg Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a bid for Hogg Group has at least pushed the shares above
1990's 150p rights price. While Hogg is not the only insurance broker to
fall on hard times, its record since the rights issue is hardly edifying.
Problems in US retail broking and fine art insurance were behind the most
recent disappointments. Given that troubled history, a multiple of around 25
times this year's forecast earnings at yesterday's closing price might look
expensive. But potential buyers - including HSBC Holdings with a 6 per cent
stake - must fancy their chances of squeezing substantially more out of the
business than the current management.
Combining Hogg's US retail broking offices with a larger network, for
example, could transform the outlook. That logic might appeal to an
established US broker with an eye on the UK market. Even after yesterday's
rise, Hogg's market capitalisation is only a shade higher than its annual
broking revenue. On that measure, it is not yet expensive. If HSBC is
preparing to make a full bid, it must expect some competition.
Sadly for shareholders in other troubled insurance brokers, Hogg looks like
a special case. A high proportion of retail business sold through regional
offices makes Hogg an unusually predictable target. Any potential bidder for
Steel Burrell Jones - whose shares rose in sympathy with Hogg yesterday -
would run the risk that its prized London market brokers would jump ship.
The long awaited shake-out among insurance brokers is still not at hand.

FT  07 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Groupe Suez
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The looming sale by Groupe Suez of its Victoire insurance subsidiary does
little to lessen the confusion surrounding its strategic direction. This is
not because a company anxious to maintain a profile in financial services is
shedding an insurance business. Suez lacks the retail banking network that
is needed to distribute bancassurance products, and Victoire is a less
interesting investment since its German business was sold last year. Without
Victoire, though, the Suez portfolio, which ranges from banking to hotels
and steel, will look odder than before.
Recent asset sales appear driven primarily by the need to offset losses on
property lending. Exceptional gains of FFr4.4bn from asset sales last year
more than accounted for net profits of FFr1.6bn. Provisions should be lower
this year but, given the exposure of Suez to the still weak commercial
property market, the improvement may be slow. Victoire may thus be the most
convenient piece of family silver to put up for sale.
But Suez is also raising resources to go on the acquisition trail. Its
industrial stakes may give it clout in investment banking, but such an
approach depends heavily on an ability to make sensible purchases. Suez will
be judged as much by what it buys as what it sells. Given the discount of
some 30 per cent to net assets at which its shares are trading, the equity
market is not particularly confident. If there are resources to spare,
investors might prefer to have them back.

FT  07 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Oil
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hedge funds are rapidly gaining the reputation and popularity of medieval
witches. As a consequence, they are ritually burnt at the stake every time
some ill befalls the global capital markets. The latest incarnation is the
unexpected rise in the oil price in recent days. Crudely put, since other
commodity prices have risen and oil has lagged badly, it is seen as an
obvious target for speculative funds.
The interesting question, however, is whether the hedge funds are being
smarter or slower than conventional oil market traders. The second quarter
often sees softening oil prices as demand slips back after the winter.
Opec's failure to rein back production - partly at Saudi Arabia's behest -
shows the cartel's weakness and inability to police quotas. Indeed, the
Saudis seem determined to expand their market share at the expense of price.
There are also the medium-term fears of the return of Iraq to the market and
the rejuvenation of Russian oil fields with western technology. The rapid
expansion of natural gas threatens some of oil's traditional markets.
Yet the slip in the oil price in the last few months happened despite a
near-balance between supply and demand. Stocks were drawn down heavily in
the first quarter to meet cold weather demands in the US. Outside Saudi
Arabia, Opec has little slack to expand production in the short term. There
may thus be some fundamental support for oil prices later, but doubtless the
hedge funds will not hang around to wait for it.

Eurotunnel's broadside against a luckless corporate financier, who talked
indiscreetly about its forthcoming rights issue, will enhance Swiss Bank
Corporation's maverick reputation. Yet despite the ticking-off, SBC will
retain an important role in Eurotunnel's fund-raising. Its agreement to
sub-underwrite Transmanche Link's portion of the rights issue helped cement
a deal between contractor and builder. SBC is also likely to play a big role
in the global distribution of shares.
SBC has trodden on the toes of the City establishment before. It gatecrashed
BZW's enhanced scrip dividend party when it perceived the margins were too
fat and launched a competitive auction for the rump of Trafalgar House's
rights issue. At a general level, it would be a welcome development if SBC
could succeed in its attempts to inject some fresh thinking into the cosy
world of underwriting. After all, real competition is likely to provide a
more effective deterrent against the threat of cartels than strictures from
the Office of Fair Trading.
By applying its expertise in derivatives markets to assess the volatility of
a company's shares, SBC claims it can judge whether the standard 2 per cent
underwriting fee is appropriate to the risk. Such an approach has advantages
for favoured clients, which are guaranteed their money at less cost. The
danger is that by squeezing the fees on the good deals, SBC may upset the
institutions on which it must ultimately rely. In the interests of
self-preservation, most financial advisers have chosen to side with the fund
managers who have the money rather than the companies which need it.

FT  07 APR 94 / Falling back to earth with a bump: Turkey has taken steps to
avert economic crisis - but the price may be a political backlash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After teetering for two months on the edge of an economic precipice, Turkey
this week has tried to pull back from the brink. Under pressure from a
plunging lira and dramatic gains by Islamic radicals in last week's local
elections, Turkey's conservative-led coalition on Tuesday announced an
austerity package in an effort to restore economic health.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, warned that Turkey faces Latin
American-style hyperinflation unless the programme is implemented. The
measures include unpopular moves to raise taxes and state-controlled prices
and close public sector companies, as well as an effective further
devaluation of the lira. This fell yesterday to 39,900 to the dollar against
32,050 on Tuesday, after the central bank stopped supporting the currency.
In launching Turkey on an uncomfortable economic journey, Mrs Ciller, a
48-year-old former Istanbul economics professor, seems to have little
clear-cut idea of the destination. In her televised address on Tuesday, she
said she hoped the measures would spur export-led growth and would not 'stop
the economy'. In fact, if the austerity package is to work, a sharp economic
slowdown - and a possible political backlash - may be difficult to avoid.
Ominously, workers from the Zongludak coal works, and from the Karabuk iron
and steel factory - both earmarked for possible closure - launched protest
marches on Tuesday to voice opposition against expected large-scale
lay-offs.
The immediate cause of Turkey's economic crisis was the decision in January
to devalue the lira by 12 per cent, in an early attempt to correct economic
problems. This sparked a self-fuelling fall in the currency and rising
concern among foreign creditors, in spite of domestic interest rates which
were raised at one point to 1,000 per cent.
The reasons for Turkey's problems, however, go much deeper. For most of the
past decade, annual inflation rates have rarely been lower than 50-70 per
cent. At the same time Turkey has registered annual economic growth rates
well above those of other countries in the 24-nation Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). As an OECD official put it this
week, 'Turkey has been defying the law of gravity for years. But you can't
run an economy with a 50-60 per cent inflation rate without it collapsing.'
The public sector borrowing requirement last year was running at 16 per cent
of gross national product. To bring down the deficit, the government plans
widespread price rises for commodities such as petrol and sugar. It wants to
step up privatisation by selling Dollars 3.5bn worth of state assets in 1994
 -a forecast which may turn out to be heavily optimistic. Overall, Mrs
Ciller envisages cutting the central government's budget in the next three
months by TL38,000bn through revenue increases and cost savings.
With an inflation rate of 74 per cent in March, the time of reckoning has
clearly arrived. However, while the government realises the pressing need to
cool the economy, it also fears the possible consequences. An important
reason for Mrs Ciller's failure to take remedial action earlier was the
memory of the effects of Turkey's last big austerity package, announced in
January 1980 by her predecessor Mr Suleyman Demirel, who took over as
Turkey's president in May last year.
The 1980 measures, launched at the behest of the International Monetary Fund
to boost exports and control inflation, led to months of social disruption
which eventually sparked a military coup d'etat in September 1980. Mr Mesut
Yilmaz, the leader of the main opposition Motherland party, Anap, this week
called Mrs Ciller's package 'a bad copy' of the January 1980 measures.
Since the reinstatement of democracy after a change of constitution in 1982,
Turkey has made an impressive political and economic recovery. But anxieties
about political stability have resurfaced in recent weeks as a result of
violent unrest in the Kurdish speaking south-east of the country and the
surprising gains made by the Islamic-based Refah party (RP) in the municipal
elections on March 27.
The RP gains, particularly its victories in Istanbul, the largest city, and
the capital Ankara, unsettled Turkey's pro-western secular political class.
Coupled with reports of Islamic vigilantes imposing Islamic rules on the
streets of Turkish cities, the election results have heightened the risks if
Mrs Ciller's economic package fails.
In some ways, however, Mrs Ciller emerged strengthened from the elections.
After campaigning on a platform of tough law and order measures against
Kurdish rebels, her True Path party finished with a narrow overall victory
over the Anap opposition party.
Nevertheless, the suggestion that the secular reforms established by the new
Republic could now be at risk sets off alarm signals among Turkey's western
allies. Turkey remains a vital strategic partner for the west in a troubled
part of the globe bordering the Balkans, the Caucasus and northern Iraq.
Also, the country is an important source of business for the European Union,
with trade between Turkey and the EU reaching Dollars 20bn in 1993, making
it the Union's ninth largest trading partner.
Turkey is making an all-out attempt to increase the competitiveness of its
economy in preparation for the planned customs union with the EU in 1995.
Its application for membership of the EU was made as long ago as 1987.
However Turkish ministers are resigned to countries from central and eastern
Europe joining the EU some time around 2000, perhaps a decade before the
date when Turkey will be allowed to accede.
One important factor clouding relations with the EU is Turkey's heavy-handed
military clampdown on Kurdish unrest. Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade
commissioner, has also warned, during a visit to Ankara in February, that
Turkey would benefit from the customs union only if it took firm action to
control state finances.
With international credit agencies this year having twice downgraded
Turkey's debt rating, EU officials believe Turkey can ill afford to delay
its customs union commitment. But industries such as the powerful automobile
sector - hard hit by this year's steep rise in borrowing costs - are looking
for exemptions to the customs union timetable. EU Commission officials warn
that this will be countered by calls from European textile producers to
retain quotas against Turkish textiles.
The government's most important short-term priority is to implement Mrs
Ciller's programme and make it work. All too often since she took over as
prime minister last summer, her economic policy achievements have failed to
match her rhetoric. However western economists point out this is the first
time the government has explicitly envisaged the closure of loss-making
state industries.
'If this is what is needed to keep the fundamentalists out of power that's
fine, I think people are prepared to pay the price,' was how one Istanbul
banker put it. Western diplomats believe Anap will eventually endorse the
measures - above all because, after its lack-lustre performance in the
municipal elections, Anap is in no mood to force an early general election.
The prospect that Turkey could fail to implement the package is, however,
deeply worrying - not just for Turkish industry and for holders of the
country's Dollars 64bn foreign debt. A severe economic crisis would give
further support to Islamic radicals - raising the prospect of a shift in
Turkey's western orientation that would further unsettle one of the world's
most volatile regions. As Mrs Ciller in coming weeks struggles to deliver
the economic medicine Turkey urgently needs, much more than the fate of the
Turkish economy will hang in the balance.

FT  07 APR 94 / Personal View: Bank of France must go its own way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDAN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do Mr Jean-Claude Trichet and his colleagues on the Bank of France's
monetary council think about the Bundesbank's problems in controlling German
money supply? After renewed signs during the past few weeks that M3 'broad
money' is expanding beyond the Bundesbank's target range, should France not
be implementing a monetary policy suited to its own domestic economy, rather
than acting as a Bundesbank satellite?
We are unlikely to find the answer to either question - at least in any
coherent way. The monetary council, since it was set up in January, is
behaving more like yet another elitist club within a secret state than a
pioneer of a new liberal monetary order. Mr Trichet, the Bank's governor,
announced after the council's first meeting that he is the sole spokesman to
the press. Any suggestion that council members would voice their views
publicly, in similar fashion to officials of the Bundesbank or the US
Federal Reserve, was rebuffed.
Cynics would argue that there are no secret council deliberations to
discover. Attempts by journalists and market analysts to ferret out the
council's position on the biggest question of all - should French monetary
policy become much more independent of the Bundesbank? - could mirror poor
K's efforts in Kafka's 'Trial' to find out the contents of his judges'
notebooks: the result would be blank pages.
The cynics have a point. The Balladur government, in its rush to grant
independence to the Bank of France, has left the council largely insulated
from the type of normal pressures which would, in an open society, lead to
changes in policy. Members have not had to face questions from any
parliamentary committee. Nor do they publish minutes of meetings. They are
not subject to US-type freedom of information legislation. The Bank of
France's monthly bulletin remains bland, offering no insights to compensate
for secrecy elsewhere.
All this illustrates that liberal ideology was hardly a big influence on Mr
Balladur's decision to give priority to central bank independence. Rather,
the driving idea was that independence would boost the credibility of
France's anti-inflation policy. France would thereby enjoy the benefits of
lower interest rates and an even harder currency. This hypothesis is now in
doubt. French bond yields have risen by more than 1 percentage point in the
three months since the council started work, whereas the rise in German
rates has been only 0.70 point.
So long as independence means that the central bank is free to follow a
policy of imitating every Bundesbank move, in splendid insulation from
domestic political pressure, there is little prospect of any gain. The
French financial markets and macroeconomy will remain vulnerable to monetary
and fiscal shock from Germany. At best the credibility of French monetary
stability can be no greater than Germany's. Yet in view of the recent
history of error in German monetary policy, could France not aim to do
better? Achieving a higher monetary standard of performance than Germany
would offer France the best long-term route to lower interest rates.
Unless the council is soon forced away from dependence on the Bundesbank,
France could become a case study in how not to grant independence to a
central bank. A failure of the French economy to recover significantly later
this year might turn the council into a scapegoat in the presidential
election campaign.
Perhaps there is still an opportunity for the Balladur government to prompt
a change in course. Legally, the French government retains responsibility
for exchange rate policy. Mr Balladur could instruct the council that a
stable franc against the D-Mark is no longer a central aim. Paris needs only
to drop hints that exchange rate stability is less important that other
economic objectives. The franc/D-Mark rate would then fall.
An end to the stable franc policy could also come irrespective of Mr
Balladur's wishes. The possibility that his rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, may
occupy the Elysee Palace next spring could act as a catalyst for a weaker
franc.
The franc is poised in Humpty Dumpty fashion just above its old support
level of FFr3.43. If it is knocked off the wall again, the French and German
governments are unlikely to send in a joint rescue force. Such a fatal
accident would indeed be for the best. A floating franc would not end the
need to co-operate with the Bundesbank. It would, however, provide France
with the best opportunity for constructing a domestic anchor for monetary
policy that reconciled central bank independence with genuine economic
liberalism.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's car bomb attack in the northern Israeli town of Afula is another
reminder of the fearful symmetry of violence which threatens at every turn
to obstruct the Middle East peace process. On one side are the Palestinian
Islamic militants who claimed responsibility for yesterday's bombing,
apparently in retaliation for the massacre of about 30 Arabs in a Hebron
mosque in late February. On the other are Jewish extremists such as the
fanatical settler, Baruch Goldstein, who carried out the Hebron shootings.
Both sides, though sworn enemies, have a common goal: to ensure, by striking
in the most horrific manner at the most sensitive possible moments, that the
agreement between the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation providing for Israeli withdrawal from and Palestinian self-rule
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank does not succeed.
Fortunately, the current evidence suggests it is they, not the agreement,
that are failing. The anguished standoff between Israel and the PLO that
followed the Hebron massacre has been replaced by an invigorated attempt to
reach detailed agreement by April 13, the date set in the Declaration of
Principles they signed on the White House lawn last September. Moreover, the
Israeli army appears to be preparing the ground for an eventual accord by
pulling equipment and forces out of Gaza and the Jericho area. For the first
time, the negotiations of the past year can be said to be producing tangible
change where it matters.
Important concessions
What recent events have underlined is that neither Israel nor the
Palestinians have any option but to stick to the process on which they are
embarked. Both sides made important concessions to restart negotiations -
Israel by allowing an international observer force into Hebron; the PLO by
shelving demands for the removal of Jewish settlers from the West Bank town.
Moreover, by banning two Jewish extremist groups, the Israeli authorities
have acknowledged for the first time that terrorists from their midst can
pose as much of a threat as those from the other side.
Resolve of this kind will be much in demand in the months to come, both in
Israel and among those attempting to bring about Palestinian self-rule. For
if there is one certainty about the fragile experiment in co-existence now
under way, it is that there will be further violent attempts to throw it off
course. The agreements struck thus far contain too many loose ends to instil
confidence that such threats will be contained, and their implementation is
surrounded by too many worrying uncertainties - not least concerning the
capacity of Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, to rule an embryonic
Palestinian entity with authority, competence or even real democratic
legitimacy.
Jewish settlements
The most ominous grey area concerns the Jewish settlements in the
territories. These are supposedly unaffected by the interim agreement now
being implemented. Even after Israeli soldiers have withdrawn from most of
Gaza and the West Bank and handed over the security of their Arab
inhabitants to Palestinian police, some will stay behind to protect the
settlements. There is plenty of room for misunderstanding or worse between
the Israeli military and Palestinian forces, especially in places like
Hebron, where Jewish settlers live in the thick of Arab population centres.
So far, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, has been
understandably reluctant to broach the settlements issue. It is one of the
difficult questions to be decided in 'final status' negotiations that are
supposed to start up to two years into implementation of the Israel-PLO
Declaration of Principles. It also represents a political minefield in
Israel. Nevertheless, it is an issue which may have to be addressed sooner
rather than later if the interim accord is to bring lasting peace to the
occupied territories. Mr Rabin would be well advised to make a start now by
vowing, without prejudice to the overall fate of the settlements, to shift
the most politically inflammatory of them out of Arab towns. It is in
Israel's interest, as well as that of regional stability, to remove such
sources of friction from what in any case will be a fraught process.

South Africa's courageous press has extended the frontiers of freedom.
The latest issue of Scope, a monthly magazine, boasts 'SA's first

The breakthrough is the result of an ingenious circumvention of censorship
regulations. What the magazine calls 'the naughty bits' on the centrefold
female baring almost all are concealed by an overprinted silver fig-leaf.
Readers are told it can be removed 'by rubbing it carefully with a
fingernail'. If what lies underneath might offend, 'Don't touch the

Some 67 per cent of Americans approve of legalised gambling, according to a
survey published yesterday. Unfortunately, however, they do not live in
Missouri, where ornery southerners have voted down a constitutional
amendment to legalise all sorts of riverboat gambling.
Riverboat casinos are big business on the Mississippi. States encourage them
because of the money and jobs they bring; but paradoxically, opposition to
gambling is stronger in the traditional south than almost anywhere else in
the US.
Yesterday's referendum result will leave riverboat casino operators free to
offer games of skill, like poker and blackjack, but not slot machines where
the real money is made.
No doubt the riverboats will be slipping their moorings and floating over to
the opposite bank of the river - in the state of Illinois.

Bill Clinton can do with all the help he can get in defusing the Whitewater
row. But even he might balk at his newest defender - Lyndon Larouche, the
political extremist and conspiracy merchant not long released from a
Virginia jail after serving a term for tax fraud.
Larouche, who took the short trip round the dark side of the moon from the
far left to (mostly) far right, is planning another presidential run. His
exploratory campaign organisation goes by the wonderful title of The
Committee to Reverse the Accelerating Global Economic and Strategic Crisis.
Whitewater, according to the CRAGESC gospel, is, of course, all a plot by
British intelligence and others intent on destabilising the US presidency.
Active co-conspirators include Conrad Black and his media empire, Henry
Kissinger and those responsible for the Hebron mosque massacre.
Larouche, who used to list the Queen of England and anyone named Rockefeller
among the plotters, claims that he and Clinton share a lot of the same
enemies.

More from the 'do what I say, not what I do' school of financial
scrupulousness. The Accounting Standards Board, which preaches the need for
upstanding financial reporting from companies, has been a bit sparing with
the concept of full and frank disclosure in its own annual accounts.
For a start, no indication of the remuneration of David Tweedie, its
chairman.
Ringing silence also on the dosh dished out to remaining board members, who
determine new guidelines - including an imminent one on executive share
options. The reason is a little piece of cunning accounting suggested by the
board's advisers. The only true legal director is a corporate entity, the
Financial Reporting Council.
Thus none of the board members is a member of the board at all.

In terms of sporting disasters, the cancellation of England's friendly
football match with the Germans does not rank with last year's Grand
National fiasco. But someone deserves a red card.
When did the Football Association first wake up to the fact that the match
fell on the anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth? Seemingly, no one there
knows much about history - which is a mite surprising given the age of some
FA members. If the organisers of today's annual Anglo-German Konigswinter
conference had invited along the odd FA official, this sort of mistake might
have been prevented.
Meanwhile, the German football federation does not emerge from the affair
any better. It talked tough about wanting the game to go on, presumably in
the hope that the cowardly Brits would cancel it.
As for Terry Venables, new manager of the England team, he's lost the chance
to make his mark. The last time there was as big a fuss over a match (1938),
England beat the Germans 6-3 . . . and went on to win the war.

FT  07 APR 94 / Leading Article: Superhighways for Britain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It might seem appropriate that just as the government has decided to scale
back the UK's road building programme, the debate is accelerating on the
merits of a national fibre-optic grid taking a multimedia 'superhighway' up
everyone's front garden.
The connections are more than superficial. In terms of capacity, fibre is to
copper what motorways were to village lanes. A national fibre network, like
the motorway system, can be built incrementally: despite the 'superhighway'
tag, it is no more than an upgrading or duplication of existing local
telecoms networks (trunk networks are already fibre). There might even be a
trade-off between highways and superhighways: current projections of future
trunk road requirements, inevitably based on historic trends, make
insufficient allowance for the potential of 'teleworking' and
video-conferencing to transform work and travel patterns.
But the relationship should not be pushed too far. Demand for superhighway
services - entertainment, information, education, home shopping - is still
largely speculative, particularly at current projections of their price.
Even the fate of video-on-demand, the first service set to come on line, is
uncertain: punters are unlikely to pay much of a premium to avoid a
10-minute trip to the local video store.
Cash cows
Nor should a fibre-optic grid be viewed as a unique national asset to be
provided by public funds. Telecoms companies are among the largest cash cows
the world over: if there is a market for superhighway services, they will be
able to raise the money easily enough without troubling hard-pressed
taxpayers. State funding ought to be reserved for subsidiary but critical
goals such as the application of fibre networks to education.
In the UK, the most immediate question is the future of the ban on BT
carrying entertainment services over its network. The ban was a deliberate
bid by the Thatcher government to encourage cable companies to compete with
BT in telecommunications. As such it was justified; but it would be an
unjustifiable waste of national resources were it seriously to hold BT back
from upgrading its own network.
Such an eventuality would not arise if the government announced now its
intention to lift the entertainment ban in 1998, which it could do within
the terms of the ban itself. Then BT would be free to decide the case for
further fibre investment on its commercial merits. If Mr Michael Heseltine,
the trade and industry secretary, is truly concerned at Britain's
competitive edge, he should take this step and not risk Britain languishing
in the installation of fibre networks.
Fair access
The other side of that coin, however, is that operators besides BT should
have full and fair access to BT's existing and future networks. BT need not
have fibre monopoly - indeed it is unlikely to have one, given the welcome
investment by cable companies in competing urban fibre networks. But if it
goes ahead with further investment in fibre, BT is certain to have Britain's
most extensive, and probably its most advanced, superhighway. To ensure a
diversity of services, other operators must have access to that network on
the same terms as BT itself.
Mr Don Cruickshank, the telecommunications regulator, is taking the
essential first steps to ensuring such open access. He is forcing BT to
account for its network business separately from its retail activities, and
to publish cost-based charges for access to specific services needed by
competitors requiring access to the BT network. His guiding light is the
benefits to be had from competition in terms of diversity of services and
downward pressure on prices.
This is the right approach. It is important, however, to be clear about the
object of the exercise, which is not to emasculate BT but to give consumers
maximum choice consistent with an efficient use of existing resources. The
upshot will undoubtedly be a smaller market share for BT than the 90 per
cent it now commands. But to go further and use the regulatory system to
endow new entrants with long-term subsidies at BT's expense would be to
resurrect the evils of the old nationalised telecoms regime.

FT  07 APR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Drug abuse tackled the wrong way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What business has an economist or economic commentator to write about drug
abuse and the case for decriminalisation? The first and most obvious reason
is that drugs make up one of the world's largest industries. International
trade in illegal drugs is estimated at Dollars 500bn a year. The turnover of
the criminal firms which run the world's illegal drugs traffic is higher
than the national income of 50 of the world's 70 leading nations.
Secondly, and more controversially, economists start with a presumption that
the consumer is the best judge of his or her own interests. It is a
presumption that can be overthrown in extreme cases; and the costs imposed
on other people from widespread drug consumption need attention. But at
least the starting point favours competitive market approaches against the
heavy hand of regulation.
Thirdly economists are concerned with analysing markets, including
government intervention in them. They can thus contribute to understanding
the effects of attempts to criminalise production and consumption of
products, whether alcohol in the US in the 1920s or other addictive drugs
today.
Measures to reduce supply - such as customs seizures, fines, imprisonment or
confiscation of assets - act as a tax on suppliers. The risks are much
greater than in a normal market, and the prices at which the drugs will be
supplied are correspondingly higher. The trade becomes a high-risk,
high-reward one in which criminal gangs have an advantage over normal
traders. They have every incentive and opportunity to collude to exclude
outsiders to keep the surpluses they can earn over and above those they
could gain from normal activities.
To take an example. One gram of heroin of 40 per cent purity is said to have
a street value of Pounds 80. If it were available as a gram of pure heroin
it might sell in the illicit market for Pounds 200. By comparison, legal
supplies of heroin cost the NHS less than Pounds 6 per gram.
The demand side is more controversial. But if demand were very sensitive to
price over the relevant range, then high prices would already have reduced
the problem of addiction to modest proportions. The fact that it has not
supports the view that demand is very inelastic for addicts and drug
dependants - that is what these words mean.
Given a high-risk, high-price market for products with an addictive quality,
one would expect present worldwide restrictive legislation to encourage
criminal activity. The addicts steal to pay for their drugs; and suppliers
will stop at nothing to maintain an enormously lucrative trade.
Things were not always thus. In the early 19th century, British governments
actively supported drug traders, for instance in the Opium Wars against
China. Draconian anti-drugs laws are fairly recent and have largely been
spearheaded by the US. British legislation dates back mainly to the
Dangerous Drugs Act of 1920.
In Hong Kong, Thailand and Laos, anti-opium laws were enacted over the
period between 1950 and 1980. The result was a switch from traditional opium
use, contained and controlled by local custom, to heroin, which is less
bulky and more profitable.
In the Andes, cocaine has replaced the traditional and less harmful chewing
of coca leaves. In Colombia, three presidential candidates have been
murdered for drug-related reasons. The drug trade is now the largest single
support for organised international crime; and about half the murders in the
US are drug-related. In Britain the problem is not (yet) on the same scale;
but drug-related theft may amount by value to half of all theft.
The analysis and facts so far cited all come from a new paper, Winning the
War on Drugs: to Legalise or Not? by Richard Stevenson, director of the
Liverpool University Health Economics Unit, and published today by the
Institute of Economic Affairs (Pounds 8.50). So careful, however, has the
IEA been in treading on this minefield that the paper also contains two
comments by medical practitioners eminent in the field. Professor Julius
Merry, a professor of clinical psychiatry at St Thomas's Hospital, agrees
with Mr Stevenson, who comes out for careful legalisation. A second
commentary written jointly by two psychiatrists and a criminologist
disagrees strongly. But even it favours some liberalisation of policy and
practice.
We have, of course, been here before. Witness the history of alcohol
prohibition in the US in the 1920s, as summarised in the 15th edition of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica. 'Prohibition brought into being a new kind of
criminal: the bootlegger. The career of Al Capone was a dramatic instance of
the development of bootlegging on a large scale. His annual earnings were
estimated at well over Dollars 60,000. The rise of the bootlegging gangs led
to a succession of gang wars and murders. A notorious incident was the St
Valentine's Day massacre in Chicago in 1929 when the Capone gang shot to
death seven members of the rival 'Bugs' Moran gang. Historians of the
underworld, however, suggest that by the late 1920s bootlegging was on the
verge of semi-monopoly control and the end of gang wars was approaching.'
The Encyclopaedia does not mean criminality was ending, but that there were
signs of the bootleggers agreeing on sharing what they might have called
'the loot' and the IEA 'the economic rent'.
Some effects of the official war against drugs are the opposite of those
intended, even from the point of view of drug users. The high price of
illegal drugs encourages injection, which is the most economical but also
the most hazardous method. 'At high prices, users are more likely to share
doses and needles, so the risk of transmitting disease is increased.'
Another response to high prices is to become a small dealer and sell to
friends, thus spreading the habit.
Although alcohol consumption fell in the US after prohibition ended, this
may have been due to special circumstances, such as the Great Depression. An
economic observer ought to concede that, if drug prices were lower, there
could be more casual experimentation - not that the law prevents 30 per cent
of young people from occasional use at the moment. It is a matter of
choosing between this risk and the growing sub-culture of criminality and
addiction.
Legalisation in one country also has its problems. One danger would be the
kind of drug tourism seen in Amsterdam. More seriously, the Colombian
cartels and the billions of dollars in laundered money would continue to
exist so long as the US continued its anti-drugs crusade. But here, at
least, there may be a glimmer of hope from the less straight-laced Clinton
administration. The US surgeon-general, Dr Jocelyn Elders, has urged a study
of legalisation.
No-one, whatever his speciality, can predict the consequences of a large
legislative leap into the dark. Two kinds of gradualism are possible. One is
that already practised by some local British police forces: they do not
prosecute for possession of small quantities of drugs but advise addicts to
enter treatment. A more rule-of-law approach would be to experiment with
legalising softer drugs and imposing the kinds of tax already borne by
alcohol and tobacco.
Stevenson provides an analogy in the case for legal abortion: 'Abortion is
tragic but, given that it will occur in any circumstances, it is better that
it should be performed competently. In the same way it would be better if
everyone could cope without mind-altering drugs, but prohibition is
unenforceable. If some people insist on using drugs, it is better that they
should buy them from law-abiding businessmen rather than criminals, and
better still if they can be integrated into society and brought under
medical supervision if it is needed.'

<TEXT>
Sir, I have received a request for the renewal of my annual subscription to
a business guide published in the UK. After giving details of the Pounds 99
payment due it says: 'Please draw your cheque on a sterling bank account in
the UK. If cheque not drawn on a UK bank please add Pounds 17.00 to cover
bank charges.' This is a general requirement and therefore applies within
the European Union. A thumping levy by banks of 17 per cent on this sort of
cross-border trade takes a lot of the shine off the Union as a free trade
area.
I can understand why financial institutions like to enjoy the profits earned
on currency transactions. I can understand why governments like to retain
national currencies so that they can manipulate them for national advantage.
But while these benefits come in the short term, there must be a substantial
price to be paid in the long term. European businesses will suffer both in
the size of their domestic markets and in their wider international
competitiveness.
Will the Maastricht treaty be able to address this problem, or will it turn
out to be rather like asking bookies to vote for fewer race meetings?

FT  07 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK tax rises give cause for pessimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN RADLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the effects of UK tax rises ('Shoppers in the line of
fire', April 2) reflects the emerging consensus among many economists that
the recovery will continue to gain pace this year and next despite higher
taxation. Our analysis of the current situation and of past tax rises
supports a somewhat more pessimistic view. It also suggests that we should
look closely at the effect of last year's budgets on both consumer spending
and investment.
Both of the last two large tax hikes, under Labour in the mid-1970s and
under the chancellorship of Geoffrey Howe at the start of the 1980s,
coincided with falls or stagnation in consumer spending. Though those
experiences will not be repeated, this does suggest the rate of increase in
consumer spending should be slowed by the tax increases. Past tax rises were
offset by substantial cuts in interest rates and, in the latter case, by the
relaxation of controls over personal borrowing in the 1982 Finance Act.
This time the reverse is true. Though there may be some delayed effects from
the interest rate cuts over the last two years, the next movement in
interest rates is just as likely to be up as down, while lenders,
particularly in the housing market, are becoming more cautious. Consumer
confidence indicators suggest that the recent tax rises have made the
personal sector more cautious, while we should not put too much faith in the
confidence boosting effects of falling unemployment as most of this is down
to increases in less secure areas of employment such as part-time work and
self-employment.
One of the best hopes may be that retailers continue to offer sufficiently
large discounts - such as those available in the January sales when the
month-on-month fall in the price of clothing and footwear was the largest
for 70 years - to allow consumers to spread their incomes further. However,
with unit labour costs rising, this will squeeze profit margins. Given the
strong links between current and expected profits and investment levels, we
should therefore be looking closely at what the budget means for the
recovery in investment just as much as that for consumer spending.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your readers would do well to compare the naive complacency of Michael
Prowse's article (April 5) with a much more realistic analysis of what has
actually happened in America to jobs and security in an article Why fascism
is the wave of the future, by Edward Luttwak (London Review of Books, April
7). The writer is director of geo-economics at the Centre for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington. Luttwak's prognosis for the US and
European economies is grim, especially in the growing insecurity over jobs.
He says: 'Thus neither the moderate right nor the moderate left even
recognises, let alone offers any solution for the central problem of our
days: the completely unprecedented personal economic insecurity of working
people, from industrial workers and white-collar clerks to medium-high
managers.'
Instead of the all too easy jibes at the Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael
Prowse should take on board Edward Luttwak's analysis and try and suggest a
solution.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs ANTHEA L ROSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Late payment of bills' (March 28), draws attention to the
problems facing many small businesses and the difficulties of using
legislation as an effective remedy.
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) is well aware of
the problems as many of our members are active in the small business sector,
being either in business themselves or providers of financial support
services to small businesses.
In our submission to the government's consultative paper, we reject the
notion of a statutory right to interest on overdue payments.
We believe that the introduction of statutory interest would legitimise the
practice of late payment, to the extent that unscrupulous businesses might
choose to pay interest to suppliers on overdue debts rather than to borrow
at higher rates from other sources.
Thus, there might evolve a form of incentive, courtesy of statutory
interest, to maintain a practice of late payment, and the existing problem
might accordingly be exacerbated.
In any case, were companies to be entitled by law to an interest payment on
overdue debts, we seriously question whether the interest element would, for
the most part, constitute such a material amount as to motivate them to go
to the trouble and expense of retrieving it through the courts.
A more practical solution to the problem may be to use the VAT system as a
form of control mechanism, whereby businesses which paid bills after an
unacceptable delay would be forced to wait or be unable to recover VAT paid.
However, it is a fact that effective remedies to the problems of late
payment require a fundamental change in business attitudes and culture; late
payment must cease to be regarded as a fact of business life or as a tool of
astute financial management.

NIHON KAIZO RON
(Blueprint for Building a New Japan)
By Ichiro Ozawa
Kodansha Publishing House Y2,900
(or Dollars 19.95 outside Japan) in
English from April 17; or Y1,500 in
Japanese. 93 pages.
What country is like a giant dinosaur with a tiny brain? That simile was
once used by historian George Kennan to taunt the US, for its inability to
exert its power internationally before the second world war.
Today, it applies to Japan, according to Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the Tokyo
government's backroom strategist. Mr Ozawa's latest book shows Japan as a
passive economic monster of little imagination whose failure to adapt will
turn it into a fossil unless it wakes up fast.
It is no surprise that Mr Ozawa, as prime mover behind Japan's recent the
most radical political changes, argues further reform of the political
system is the first condition for awakening the tiny brain.
Washington's trade hawks, who have been reading this book closely, will no
doubt draw a different conclusion. For those who believe Japan's political
reforms are incomplete and unconvincing, this book could be taken as
evidence that foreign pressure is still needed - in the absence of any more
effective force - to help Japan change its inward-looking ways.
Yet the foreign pressure argument, says Mr Ozawa, is dangerous for both
sides. For change to To be durable, it change must come from within.
But before Japan can find a new form of life, it must first find its own
identity. This, which Mr Ozawa believes, is buried under a concrete sprawl,
in which every big city, playground and park looks the same. Moreover, it is
stifled by a conformist education system, and is denied expression by a
centralised web of regulations.
Japan's identity problem is, results, ironically, a consequence of from the
fact that it is a descendant of the US dinosaur. It owes most of its
economic power to having its post-war security guaranteed by Washington,
rather than, as popularly believed, to its own workers' diligence, argues Mr
Ozawa.
But the end of the cold war undermined 'the very foundation' of Japan's
economic prosperity by removing its value to the US as a bastion against
communism in Asia. To compensate, for this, Japan must now become an
'international nation', taking a full part in world diplomacy, including
United Nations' peacekeeping.
That bit of Mr Ozawa's argument is standard fare from the increasingly
powerful internationalist camp in of Japanese politics, to be found on the
the rightwing of the coalition government. Not surprisingly, He does not air
the alternative view - for a low-profile Japan that seeks a return to
traditional values. That can be found in another newly published book, A
Small but Radiant Nation (in Japanese only) by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief
cabinet secretary. Both These two conflicting alternatives books visions are
important because they explain the visions of Japan which lie at the heart
of the present power struggle in the seven-party coalition.
Mr Ozawa's book makes it clear he believes that the stakes in this power
battle struggle are higher than many foreigners might imagine. Japan's
economic future and chances of becoming a 'normal' nation hang directly on
its ability to play a more active part in the world, he writes.
Japan should learn from successful merchant nations of history, such as like
the city state of Carthage and the Venetian Republic. They achieved
long-term prosperity - 1,000 years long in Venice's case - by becoming much
more than merchants, he recalls.
In different ways, Carthage and Venice ploughed resources into ensuring
peace and free trade in their main markets. Japan has only just begun to do
so. Mr Ozawa does not suggest that Japan should adopt develop a the modern
equivalent of a Venetian navy or a Carthaginian mercenary army. But it
should pay the cash, diplomatic and human costs of assuring peace and free
trade - and just as important, of international respect for itself.
To play a more active role in world affairs, Japan must first get to work on
internal institutional reform, starting with the political system. Mr Ozawa
makes practical suggestions to boost the authority of the prime minister and
cabinet, in order to clarifying where decisions are made and to improveing
the quality of policy debate in cabinet and parliament.
He believes a UK-style system, in which the cabinet is at the heart of
government, could solve the Japanese Japan's problem of a government with no
clear centre of authority. This would bolster prime ministerial power, which
on the evidence of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's recent series of U-turns is even
more fragile in Japan than Britain. Mr Ozawa also has high praise for the
British tradition of having a large number of non-cabinet ministerial jobs.
posts. This trains politicians to take part in making policy-making rather
than, as in Japan, just carrying out bureaucratic instructions.
A more imaginative central government would will enable improve Japan's
ability better to achieve the other tasks needed to become a 'normal
country' - including deregulation, tax reform, decentralisation and improved
town planning, all part of the Hosokawa administration's programme.
Yet Mr Ozawa also sees a sociological explanation of for side to Japan's
dinosaur-like qualities, though he does not discuss it much. As he admits,
the book is supposed to be a workmanlike look at the shortcomings in Japan's
system of government.
Democracy has never really taken root in Japan, partly because of an
inherited collective spirit and an education system designed to stamp out
independent thought. Mr Ozawa believes this system is faulty at both ends -
too rigid at school level and too dull at the university stage.
The book's theme is that Japan's cure must start with the head, which means
creating a more modern government, both on the international and domestic
level. From this will gradually evolve a Japan to be envied, rather than
derided, by foreigners.
Yet tantalisingly, Mr Ozawa says little about what his 'Japanese dream'
would look like.
Perhaps this lacuna is evidence of his own theory that Japan suffers from an
under-exercised imagination.

FT  07 APR 94 / Arts: Lorca's life - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the excellent Spanish Arts Festival continues in London, the Lilian
Baylis Theatre is staging a life of the poet and dramatist Federico Garcia
Lorca (1898-1936). This one-man show is written and performed by Trader
Faulkner; its closeness to Lorca's life alone makes exhilarating theatre;
but its greatest strength is the fine flamenco dance and music.
Lorca lived life on his emotions. His poems and plays, particularly the
1930s' Earth Trilogy of Bodas de sangre, Yerma and La casa de Bernada Alba
are rooted in the Andalusian earth. Few graduates in Maritime Law - Lorca's
degree at Granada University - can have been so attached to dry land. Lorca
duly evokes the bright streets and the dark interiors of Granada, the
passion of flamenco and the sadness of Cante Hondo, the Deep Song of the
Andalusian gypsies. This play makes Lorca's plays more understandable, his
poems less aloof. And, through Lorca's poems, it looks west towards new
writing in Spanish.
Lorca moves at an uneven pace; there is no plot and little sequence. It
tracks Lorca's sad, passionate life from leaving Granada in 1919 for Madrid,
his studies and friendships there with Luis Bunuel, Salvador Dali and Manuel
de Falla, his travels to New York and South America, and his return to
Granada where he was shot by the Fascists on August 19, 1936. Everywhere he
went he lived the painful life of a man on the verge of reinventing himself.
He was passionately in love with Dali. As a homosexual, he was often abused
as 'maricon' (queer) or 'perro' (dog), a nasty joke which inspired Bunuel's
Chien Andalou.
The play delivers all this, and sets Lorca's poems to music and dance,
flickering in and out of Spanish and English. Each scene is punctuated by
the flamenco dance and music which give the play its visceral quality. The
language - both Spanish and English - is sensual and visual, using Lorca's
own poems. There is a wonderful bullfight based on the death of Lorca's
friend Ignacio Sanchez Mejias the matador - A las Cinco de la Tarde. There
are sexually evocative love poems, stark pictures of rural Andalusia, and a
loose-limbed South American sequence where the stern rhythms of Granada meet
the New World.
The piece is superbly acted and sung. Trader Faulkner as Lorca, with the
excellent Tito Heredia (guitar), Liana Vargas (dance) and Luz Elena Caicedo
(songs) produce an ensemble performance of top quality. Faulkner himself
manages the bilingual feat of memory, the intricacies of flamenco steps, and
maintains the intensity of Lorca's life.
Lilian Baylis Theatre (071 278 8916) until April 23.

FT  07 APR 94 / Arts: La Gran Scena pays tribute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In case anyone still does not know who they are, La Gran Scena is a group of
American males whose speciality is presenting opera snippets in drag. Such a
bald description fails to do justice to the affection that has gone into
their portrayals of composite prime donne: a bouffant hairstyle here, a shy
protestation of unworthiness there. Detailed knowledge, too - the cooing
pianissimo whitening into the curlew mew of Madame X, the gallantly
heaved-out top register of Dame Y. The effect is less brash, even less
outrageously camp, than might be expected. These men obviously love their
opera. It's no surprise that their fans include Leontyne Price and Joan
Sutherland.
Above all, they love their dive. The pervasive image is that of the 1960s,
when Sutherland, Tebaldi and Bumbry were at their imperious height,
high-piled coiffeurs as much part of the uniform as the codified hierarchic
display of a mandarin's robes. But Ira Siff, the company's founder and chief
writer, has kept up with the times. One of the highlights of the new
programme is a tribute to such exponents of the new post-modern
deconstructionist school of opera production as 'Peter Sellout' (no prizes
for guessing who): the last act trio from Der Rosenkavalier set in a New
Jersey shopping mall, replete with surtitles for those who loathe them, sung
by Marsh-Lynn (a sleek matron returning from a barmitzvah), Octavian
(jiggling to his walkman in his 'I Love Older Women' T-shirt: Philip Koch,
impeccably in character as a woman playing a man) and a blonde hop-head
Sophie.
The programme's humour veers from pantomime-dame clumping via hoary Coarse
Acting jokes to the wickedly observant. Keith Jurosko's 105-year-old prima
donna quavering through Home Sweet Home evokes those crackly old
dinner-plate 78s and is oddly touching.
Johnny Maldonado's mezzo is unnervingly convincing, though it is not true
that Covent Garden has cast him as Amneris in their forthcoming Aida. The
company also includes Mirella Frenzi, the tenor Mario Costa-Plenti and such
distinguished understudies as Anna Turnover-Somehow, Batleen Cattle and Mo
Guiseppe Monopoli. And Ira Siff, the company's only begetter, triumphs in
the last act of La Traviata, which sums up the show's ambiguities under its
layers of artifice on artificiality: part parody, part homage, part shadow
of mortality falling across brittle, painted things.
Bloomsbury Theatre until April 13.

FT  07 APR 94 / Arts: RSC's Ghosts - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching Jane Lapotaire these days is a very curious business. That we have
few actresses with such intelligence, authority or accomplishment must be
beyond question. Yet it has been years since I could believe in one of her
stage characterisations. Right now, London has the chance to see her in the
great role of Mrs Alving in Ibsen's Ghosts, with the RSC in the Pit.
Watching and listening to her, you cannot help but find new insights into
the role and into the whole fabric of this marvellous play; but you also see
a portrayal so calculated in moment-by-moment delivery, so full of clever
motifs, and so carefully arranged in its final expression of dismay, that it
creaks.
This is too bad, not just because of the waste of Lapotaire's talent, but
also because she dominates Katie Mitchell's staging of the play, excellent
in so many other respects. This production - which I reviewed at its
premiere at Stratford's The Other Place last May - now launches the RSC's
new London season. It embodies many of the best virtues of the RSC, of
Mitchell, and indeed of Lapotaire. For a close scrutiny of Ghosts, it is
unlikely to be surpassed for years to come.
Mitchell fastidiously observes the detailed realism of Ibsen's play. The
play is - among other things - about syphilis, and repression, and
hypocrisy, and women's struggle for social freedom; but, in Mitchell's
hands, those things are the more powerful because she never nudges them into
undue significance, or allows any anachronistic touch to remind us how
modern the play's implications are. Vicki Mortimer's designs are haunting,
perfectly creating the spartan elegance of a Norwegian interior. And Tina
MacHugh's lighting conveys both the darkness of this room, and the distant
pallor of the daylight outside (though the final dawn is none too
persuasive). Details of offstage sound, or the maid's duster, or Pastor
Manders's hat, all contribute beautifully to the eloquent whole.
Simon Russell Beale is a strongly morose Oswald. If one does not quite
believe that his last words would really be 'the sun, the sun', then one
certainly attends to his protest that sunshine and the joy of life have
never been part of his life at home. John Carlyle's Pastor Manders is a
superb performance, bringing a wealth of life to this stiff character.
Alexandra Galbraith and John Normington, however, have slightly coarsened
their detailed interpretations of Regina and Engstrand. Should their
self-servingness be quite so obvious?
The 'ghosts' become more fascinating the closer you attend. Lapotaire hints
in the first two acts that Oswald's father may not be the late Lieutenant
Alving but the still present Pastor. In the last act, however, she seems
simply to have given up this last vestige of her love for the Pastor.
In her most grand and repeated gesture, Lapotaire suggests that Mrs Alving
keeps being failed by men. She stretches out one arm - palm downward,
fingers parted like a claw - towards the memory of her husband, or the
Pastor, or her son. Then she lets the arm fall, slowly, slowly. But the
gesture sums up the failure of Lapotaire's performance. Trying to show Mrs
Alving's spontaneous emotions (normally very contained in her body
language), this gesture actually turns out to be the most unspontaneous
thing Lapotaire does.

So far Carlton TV, which took the London weekday ITV contract from Thames in
the government's demented auction scheme, has achieved an unimpressive
record. Today they could begin to change that with Class Act a drama series
starring Joanna Lumley as a wronged aristocrat whose husband disappears,
leaving her with a prison sentence. She teams up with a female Australian
burglar and a doubtful journalist, and their adventures form the backbone of
the one-hour series.
It is good to see Lumley reaping the benefits of 'AbFab', and encouraging to
find that Class Act is produced by Verity Lambert. But what about the
writer? On the one hand Michael Aitkens wrote 'Waiting For God' which I rate
higher than 'One Foot In The Grave' (in its writing, anyway). On the other
hand his most recent offering is 'Honey For Tea' which has been something
like a disaster. We shall see (9.00 ITV).
The last in Dawn French's series of comedy dramas, Murder Most Horrid II,
finds our heroine playing a would-be torch singer in the gangland setting of
London's east end in the 1960s (9.00 BBC2).

FT  07 APR 94 / Arts: And the band plays soap opera - A worthy film about
Aids too closely resembles an old Hollywood biopic / Cinema
</HEADLINE>

AND THE BAND PLAYED ON (12)
Roger Spottiswoode
GRIEF
Richard Glatzer
THE DIARY OF LADY M (18)
Alain Tanner
REDHEADS (15)
Danny Vendramini
A closing caption in And The Band Played On, based on Randy Shilts's
bestselling book about the discovery of Aids, reveals that 25,000 Americans
died from the disease before President Ronald Reagan deigned to make his
first speech on the subject.
Hollywood has some nerve. It has taken 15 years, and a spectacularly higher
death toll, for mainstream American cinema itself to broach the topic in
earnest. Philadelphia saw us through Oscar time. This week two more films,
Band and Richard Glatzer's Grief, arrive to show that the illness that once
dared not speak its name - indeed could not settle on a name for several
years (it was originally, we are told, called GRID) - is now developing a
startling taste for the soapbox.
And The Band Played On is massively worthy: 2 1/4 hours of all-star
inspirationalism and medical-historical legwork. We meet the brave band of
researchers at the Atlanta Center for Disease Control, led by Matthew Modine
as the real-life Dr Don Francis.
We watch the trans-Atlantic test-tube war between America's Dr Bob Gallo
(Alan Alda) and France's Pasteur Institute (Nathalie Baye, Patrick Bauchau),
both claiming first-discovery honours over the virus. And we goggle at the
procession of guest stars, from Hollywood natives such as Steve Martin,
Richard Gere and Anjelica Huston to our own Ian McKellen (American-accented)
and Phil Collins (indefinably accented as a louche bathhouse owner).
Finally, of course, we applaud the capacity of the Human Spirit to overcome
anything put in its path, including films such as this. It is wicked to mock
an affliction, but in the demonological landscape of Aids a movie like And
The Band Played On may be part of the affliction. Devoid of a single moment
of pain or complex emotional revelation - let alone of real rather than
sentimentalised 'struggle' - the film plays like one of those old Hollywood
medical biopics, only without the flair. Having despaired of reality, we end
up wishing the film would go the whole romantic hog and bring on Greer
Garson, brandishing her smile, her bunsen burner and her ever-attentive
Walter Pidgeon.
If And The Band Played On is Madame Curie with the glums, Richard Glatzer's
Grief is a gay Soapdish - and surprisingly enjoyable for it. This movie of
confused sexuality is set in the mad mad world of American daytime
television. Mark (Craig Chester), who has lost his lover Kenny to Aids,
falls for Bill (Alexis Arquette), who is having an affair with Jeremy
(Carlton Wilborn), all under the eye of butch boss Jo, played by drag
performer Jackie Beat. And that is just behind the scenes of The Love Judge,
the series about a divorce court on which they are working.
Soap opera itself being the art form of emotional instability, a soap
production company is the perfect world for pixillated feelings. Glatzer, a
first-time filmmaker, does not seem quite sure whether he is spoofing soap
emotionalism or subscribing to it. But that is part of Grief's charm. The
straight faces with which the actors collide into one crisis after another
ensure that innocent gravity cohabits with sly comedy: a combination that
never in deft hands fails.
A terrible hilarity overcame the press show audience at Alain Tanner's The
Diary Of Lady M. To my left, The Independent and The Sunday Telegraph, were
knee-deep in chortles; to my right, The Times, agog with satiric disbelief.
It is hard to believe the dialogue in this film about a nightclub singer's
AC/DC affairs with a Barcelona painter and his North African wife. And then
we must grapple with the images.
The Swiss director who once commanded respect with The Salamander and Jonas
now appears to be joined at the hip, or at some other body part, with
writer-actress Myriam Mezieres, who plays the heroine. Their last
collaboration, A Flame In My Heart, was bad enough: the earnestly wanton
tale of a circus lady's amours prodigales. But here we reel from one
voice-over enormity to another - 'I was the plain covered with almond trees
that Van Gogh painted' - while the pictures try vainly to keep up with the
logorrhoea.
Redheads runs The Diary Of Lady M close for worst film of 1994. Danny
Vendramini directs the Brisbane-set tale of two carrot-headed women, a
criminal (Claudia Karvan) and a social worker (Catherine McClements), who
discover a strange kinship in the wake of a murder. The kinship finds
expression in their breathless delivery of B-movie dialogue and their
tendency to wave their arms about in front of a wobbly camera.
Occasionally someone screams, rages or loses consciousness - or was that
just in the audience?

Pepsi-Cola International is to market its new diet cola drink, Pepsi Max, in
more than 20 countries by the end of the year, following successful trials
in selected markets.
The company forecasts that the new drink will achieve retail sales of
Dollars 250m (Pounds 171m) in 1994. Trials in the UK, the Netherlands,
Ireland and Australia resulted in the brand gaining an average 3 per cent
share of each country's cola market within five months.
The drink is aimed particularly at the young male market - a group which has
been traditionally resistant to such diet products. While Pepsi Max is
sugar-free, it does not advertise itself as a diet drink but emphasises a
sporting image and 'maximum' taste.
The drink contains a new blend of sweeteners intended to overcome consumer
objections to the after-taste associated with diet drinks, and perceptions
that the flavour of low-calorie drinks are 'weaker' than regular versions.
Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi worldwide by about three to one, and the gap is
wider when it comes to diet versions of the cola drinks. Pepsi said the new
drink had 'added significant net volume and share to the company's business'
and that tests in the UK suggested the product was attracting previously
loyal Coke drinkers.
There are no immediate plans for the drink to go on sale in the US - one of
the sweeteners used in the product, acesulfame-K, has yet to be approved
there. In addition, Pepsi says it does not want to eat into its US sales of
Diet Pepsi. While diet drinks make up more than a quarter of all soft drink
sales in the US, the figure is only about 4 per cent elsewhere.
Pepsi plans to launch the drink in 10 new markets by the end of next month,
including Spain, Sweden, Japan and Thailand.

FT  07 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sponsors target
global goals - How US companies are making the most of their association
with the 1994 World Cup
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the opening game of the 1994 World Cup football finals less than three
months away, the tournament's main corporate sponsors are spending millions
of dollars trying to make the most of their association with it.
Yet involvement is something of a double-edged sword for the biggest US
companies sponsoring the month-long sporting spectacular: car maker General
Motors; Mars, the confectionery group; fast food chain McDonald's; Gillette,
the consumer products group, and the soft drinks group Coca-Cola.
Sponsors can gain valuable international exposure by marketing their
products in countries where people are passionately interested in football,
and where the World Cup is widely regarded as the biggest event on the
sporting calendar.
In the US, however, being a main sponsor of the tournament is considerably
less rewarding. Football, or 'soccer' as the Americans call it, is very much
a minority sport and the World Cup holds little significance for most of the
country. A survey conducted at the end of last year by a London research
company found that only 35 per cent of Americans even knew that the World
Cup was being held in the US this summer. That compares with 99 per cent
awareness in Brazil and 83 per cent in Germany.
With an apparently unreceptive domestic audience, it makes sense for US
sponsors to focus most of their advertising and marketing dollars on foreign
markets. Having spent a reported Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.60m) on sponsorship
rights, they are determined to get their money's worth.
Coca-Cola, a World Cup sponsor since 1978, has developed a variety of
marketing events and products for consumers overseas. Gary Hite, the
company's vice-president in charge of international sports marketing, says:
'The fact of the site of the event is not a core reason why we're involved .
. . We bought into it because it is such a magnificent global event. We'd be
involved in it if it wasn't being held in the US.'
Gillette, the US company with the longest history of backing the World Cup,
also believes the greatest value of the company's sponsorship is in
football's worldwide popularity. 'No other sporting event can match the
World Cup in terms of marketing power,' said Alfred Zeien, Gillette's
chairman, at December's World Cup draw in Las Vegas.
Among Gillette's marketing initiatives, the emphasis is on gaining exposure
for its products in overseas markets. 'Soccer is the universal language. If
you set out to match a global brand with a global sport, there is no better
choice,' says Gillette.
Other US sponsors view the World Cup from the same perspective. Mava
Heffler, vice-president of promotions at the credit card company Mastercard,
which expects to have spent at least Dollars 75m on sponsorship and
advertising by the time the tournament is over, says: 'We have targeted the
World Cup as a platform to help us build brand awareness internationally.'
All of the main sponsors are employing similar tactics to exploit their
relationship with the World Cup. Commemorative products abound (special Coke
cans, a limited edition Gillette Sensor razor), as do competitions offering
cash prizes or trips to World Cup games.
Television, however, is at the heart of most marketing initiatives: by the
end of the World Cup, a cumulative audience of between 25bn and 30bn is
expected to have watched the tournament. McDonald's has chosen to broadcast
its first global television commercial for the World Cup, a single 30-second
spot which will air on six continents, starting next week. Mastercard is
also running a global television commercial, featuring the Brazilian
footballer Pele.
Other companies will be sponsoring special programmes or television series
for broadcast around the world. Gillette is backing a 13-part series on the
World Cup that will be seen in more than 50 countries. Coca-Cola is
launching a 'Coca-Cola World Cup '94 Radio Network', which will broadcast
reports and features on the tournament to foreign countries.
Sponsors are keen to utilise the large advertising boards - rarely seen in
US sports - which surround the football pitch. GM plans to match them to
television viewers in each country. Thus, when a team from Europe or South
East Asia is playing, it will use the boards to display the logo of Opel,
the company's chief brand in those two regions.
Similarly, the name of Chevrolet, the brand which GM sells in Latin America,
will be on display for games involving countries such as Brazil and Mexico.
Jim Latham, GM's project manager for World Cup '94, says this
'tele-targeting' - aiming different boards at different audiences - is many
times more effective in reaching viewers in Europe than in the US.
'Advertising on soccer pitches is very well-known and means something in
non-US markets,' he says.
While aiming to make a big impression overseas with their World Cup
marketing, US sponsors have not taken their eye off the ball at home, even
if many Americans are more likely to be watching baseball during June and
July.
In the US, sponsors are focusing their marketing in niche markets, such as
the nine cities hosting the games, and among immigrant communities where
football's popularity is strong. The Spanish-speaking market is attracting
the most attention - Coca-Cola and McDonald's, for example, have organised
'La Copa Coca Cola', a regional amateur football tournament.
The sponsors are also hoping that Americans will pay attention to the World
Cup once they realise how important it is to the rest of the world. Hite
says: 'Americans love big events. Once people realise what a huge event it
is, they're going to say: 'I want to be a part of that'.'
Ultimately, the extent of interest in the US will depend greatly on how well
the US national team does in the tournament.

FT  07 APR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Forecasts lift
spending gloom - Budget rises are likely despite last year's fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertising expenditure in European Union countries fell by about 1 per cent
in real terms in 1993 - the first time a fall has been recorded in recent
years, according to provisional figures from the UK's Advertising
Association and the European Advertising Tripartite*.
However, the outlook for 1994, within the EU and for a number of other
countries monitored by the organisations, looks promising, with a return to
real, although modest, growth of about 1 per cent for this year.
Finland, Spain and Sweden's markets suffered most last year: economic
difficulties had a direct impact on advertising budgets and cutbacks in
spending of more than 4 per cent were recorded. Belgium, Denmark, France,
Germany and Japan's advertising spend also fell.
Modest increases in overall spending were seen in the US, UK, Ireland,
Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland, while exceptional growth was
recorded in Greece (12.8 per cent) and Portugal (8 per cent). According to
the Advertising Association and the European Advertising Tripartite, 'the
growth of advertising expenditure in these countries has been dramatic,
despite the recession, because of an increase in the availability of media
vehicles, greater media competitiveness and the strong performance of the
broadcast media, especially television'.
Indeed, in all countries monitored, apart from Austria and Belgium, the
growth in spending on television advertising outstripped print. Television
overtook newspapers to become the single biggest display medium in the EU in
1992; by last year it became the biggest display medium in the whole of
Europe. Double-digit growth rates for TV were seen in Greece, Portugal,
Norway and Sweden.
This trend looks set to continue: further European deregulation could
eventually lead to an almost doubling of the current annual Ecu 15bn (Pounds
11.8bn) spending on TV advertising.
The outlook for 1994 is encouraging, say the two bodies. On the back of the
apparent return of confidence and positive economic indicators they are
forecasting real growth in advertising expenditure almost everywhere. 'The
exceptions are likely to be Finland, the Netherlands, Spain and Japan.
However, the real falls in advertising expenditure in these countries are,
in the main, likely to be marginal.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roberto Grosso is stepping down as an executive director of Cookson Group,
the specialist industrial materials group, and chief executive of the
ceramics division.
Cookson said in a statement that Grosso 'has decided to leave the group in
order to pursue other interests', and will do so after the annual meeting
next month.
Last month Cookson and Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, announced
that they were planning to link some of their ceramic interests in a joint
venture to be known as Cookson Matthey Ceramics. Cookson's ceramic supplies
and minerals division, part of its ceramics operations, will be folded into
the joint venture.
Meanwhile, Stephen Howard, currently chief executive in charge of Cookson's
group corporate development and chief executive of the engineered products
division, will also become president and chief executive of Cookson's
Brussels-based Vesuvius advanced refactories group. Gian-Carlo Cozzani,
currently vice president of marketing and sales at Vesuvius, will become
Vesuvius' chief operating officer.

FT  07 APR 94 / Technology: No cure for risk - Setting up a manufacturing
plant is a particular gamble for drugs companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More and more biotechnology companies are crossing the perilous line from
pure research and development to manufacturing, a move which could lead to
the graveyard for some.
Those with strong roots in science and academia often have little or no
experience in production. Even the most astute companies have trouble
assessing if, when and how much they should be investing in manufacturing
facilities.
Chiron, the US biotechnology company which last year received approval for
Betaseron, the multiple sclerosis drug developed jointly with Schering of
Germany, failed to build sufficient manufacturing facilities to accommodate
demand for the drug, and has faced repeated shortages. At the other extreme,
both Synergen and Centocor invested in manufacturing for drugs which were
later rejected by the US Food and Drug Administration.
'It's a fine balancing act you have to pull off,' says Amy Factor, vice
president of Immunomedics, which has started expanding its research
laboratory into a manufacturing plant for a still-to-be-approved cancer
imaging product. 'You have to walk the tightrope created by the uncertainty
of not knowing whether your drug will get approval, what the demand will be
if it is, and what your other options are.'
Making life more difficult for US biotechnology groups are FDA regulations
specifying that the drugs must be manufactured in the same way they were
prepared for clinical trials. If the process veers from the original course,
approval for the product may be revoked. As a result of this restriction,
firms often sink millions of dollars of what they call 'risk money' into
manufacturing facilities they may never need.
Sometimes the gamble pays off. Amgen, for instance, invested millions of
dollars on a plant for Epogen, a red blood cell stimulant, prior to its
clearance by the FDA. 'We'd started investing in the facility even before we
had obtained any data from human trials,' says Dennis Fenton, senior
vice-president in charge of sales. 'We were encouraged enough by the early
trials to be optimistic.'
Adding to the dilemma is the fact that most manufacturing plants can only
accommodate specific types of products. Constructing a facility for
bacteria-based products, for example, will not help much if a company later
discovers a drug based on mammalian cells.
Some companies are seeking to gain flexibility through facilities that can
handle more than one type of drug. The California-based giant Amgen is
putting millions of dollars into an FDA-approved multi-purpose facility.
'The FDA doesn't really like multi-purpose facilities,' says Fenton, 'but we
showed them we had trained staff and sophisticated equipment so that the
chance of any mix-up between the drugs was small.'
Other companies are looking to resolve their manufacturing troubles by
contracting out their production. This eliminates the need to invest money
up front, but raises a number of other risks.
'There is a concern about proprietary rights,' says Ken Bate, head of sales
for Biogen, which uses an unnamed group to put out Hirulog, an
anti-coagulant. 'If the process is enhanced, who does that part of the
patent belong to, the biotech firm or the manufacturer?' Biogen turned to an
outside manufacturer because Hirulog was a bigger molecule than it usually
dealt with and, therefore, could not be produced in the same facility as its
other drugs.
There are other pitfalls involved in contracting out. For one thing, many
companies are wary of handing so much information over to potential
competitors. The relationship also has to be established early, prior to FDA
approval, to ensure that clearance for the drug is not endangered. Another
risk is that the manufacturing partner may later decide to stop putting out
the drug, leaving the patent holder with no way to get its product to
market.
Despite these concerns, the lure of a contract manufacturer is strong. The
British company Celltech says it has been doing such good business on its
contract production side that it will soon open a new US manufacturing
facility in New Hampshire.
'We've stayed in this business by following some strict rules,' says Iain
Ross, president of Celltech Biologics. 'First, there is no question of a
breach of confidentiality with us. We have strict Chinese walls and the
research side of our company, which is in competition with our manufacturing
customers, does not receive any information on drugs we are making for other
groups.'
Commitments to manufacture products for outside firms are also taken
seriously. 'If our research and development side wants us to make a drug for
them, they have to abide by the same rules as other groups,' says David
Jackson, vice president of US operations for Celltech. 'That means they have
to reserve capacity ahead of time. If there's no capacity available, they go
on the waiting list.'
There may be other ways, too, of minimising the risks of contracting out
production. 'We've made sure our partner has an interest in the drug doing
well, and we trust that they will do a good job,' explains Bate.
For many groups, however, the appeal of building their own facilities is
overwhelming. A shiny new manufacturing plant is often seen as a status
symbol in the industry, a sign of the company's coming of age. Moreover, a
manufacturing plant gives groups full control of quality and output.
Besides the risks associated with FDA approval, companies face hurdles in
building their own facilities. One serious obstacle is the severe shortage
of managers and workers with any experience in making biotechnology
products.
'Not many companies moving from research into manufacturing have the
necessary management skills on hand,' says William Young, senior vice
president at Genentech, which has invested heavily in manufacturing
facilities. 'And to hire people with experience can be prohibitively
expensive for the smaller firms.'
Yet Young concedes that many companies may have no choice. The number of
companies capable of producing drugs for others is limited. 'Those of us
with the facilities, like Genentech, are usually busy making our own
products,' he explains.
Start-up biotechnology firms, facing cash constraints, limited abilities to
recruit the best people and uncertainty over drug approval, are particularly
vulnerable. Indeed, the move to manufacturing may be one of the most
difficult problems the industry faces. 'The move to manufacturing is a
tremendous challenge that most biotechnology companies haven't even begun to
address,' says Factor. 'For many, this is a make or break decision.'

FT  07 APR 94 / People: Mining team digs in at Hambros
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The complete 15-strong mining team at Indosuez Capital Securities (UK) has
moved to Hambros Bank where a new subsidiary, Hambros Equities UK, has been
set up to house them.
Among those who have moved is Chris Orchard, now managing director of
Hambros Equities UK, Roger Franklin, executive director, dealing, and Graham
Roberts executive director, research.
This trio, and many of the other team members, have been together for eight
years during which time the organisation they worked for had several name
changes. They started out with stockbroker Galloway &amp; Pearson, which became
WICO Galloway and then, after being sold to Banque Indosuez, WI Carr (UK). A
merger turned that into Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken and, fairly recently, after a
reshuffle at Indosuez, the team found itself working for Indosuez Capital.
Graham Roberts acknowledges that mining teams do not sit comfortably in any
company in London where there has been a decreasing amount of interest in
the sector - so much so that one gold miner, Monarch Resources, recently
decided to move to the Toronto stock exchange instead. Nevertheless, Hambros
is providing a home 'which will be culturally a place where we can take the
business a step further'.
Hambros already owns Hambros Equities Australia, set up as a joint venture
with Strauss Turnbull in 1986 and becoming HEA in 1990, which specialises in
Australian mining and oil, banking, transport, media and technology
companies. Ross McFadyen, managing director of the Australian offshoot, is
chairman of Hambros Equities UK. Roberts says the combined Australian and UK
businesses will offer a worldwide service, not just in international mining
shares but also financial instruments in the South African and Australian
markets.
Other members of the Indosuez team who have already moved include, on the
research side, John Barker and Chris Pearson; from sales, John Lee, Mike
Long, Robert Lee, and David Starling, while the dealers are Mark Head, Mark
Gibbons and Tony Phillips.

FT  07 APR 94 / Technology: Spider's route through jungle - A look at a
device to cut the cost of telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As companies send larger amounts of data between countries, the task of
finding the cheapest route becomes more tricky. This month sees the launch
of a system that aims to cut corporate telecommunications bills by up to 40
per cent.
Developed by Spider Systems of the UK, it will enable businesses
transmitting data electronically to pick their way through Europe's jungle
of telecommunications systems and always choose the cheapest method for
their needs.
Edinburgh-based Spider Systems, a computer networking company whose main
competitors are North American rather than European, claims that the
SpiderIntegrator is the first product of its kind in the world.
The device is an advanced kind of router, a box loaded with circuit boards
and software which companies connect to their local area networks of
computers and workstations. A router selects the route for communication
between two LANs in different places. The SpiderIntegrator offers the extra
ability to select the cheapest route.
Most companies will need to use all the available methods - comprising
leased lines, ISDN (integrated services digital network), packet switching
systems and external modems - and grapple with charging structures. These
differ across Europe and mean that, for example, leased lines are much more
popular in the UK than in continental Europe. In Germany, ISDN is the
commonest method while in France packet switching, hitherto popular, is
being overtaken by ISDN.
According to Steve Collen, Spider's product line manager, some 85 per cent
of the cost of a data communication network over its lifetime is accounted
for by charges paid for using it, with the cost of the hardware accounting
for only 15 per cent. 'Tariff management is about cutting down on the 85 per
cent,' he says.
To do so, SpiderIntegrator offers three features. First, it can be
configured to select different types of circuit for particular times of the
day, to take advantage of different charges and the user's needs.
Second, SpiderIntegrator can respond to demand for transmission capacity or
bandwidth by automatically opening up additional circuits and shutting them
down when they are no longerneeded. This facility might be needed to augment
leased line capacity at peak times.
Third, it incorporates a feature called triggered RIP (router information
protocol). Normally, routers exchange information about the state of the
network every 30 seconds or every minute. But these calls are costly.
SpiderIntegrator incorporates a protocol (a set of rules in software) by
which the routers only exchange information when the information about the
network changes, thus saving running costs.
Spider is offering this protocol, which it says is unique, as an
international standard to encourage other manufacturers to incorporate it in
their products. 'Inter-operability is in our interests,' says Martin
Ritchie, Spider's managing director.
Another feature of the SpiderIntegrator is that if it knows that at
particular times of day it is cheaper to make a call from one country to
another rather than vice versa, it can call another router automatically and
ask it to call back.
A network manager will operate the SpiderIntegrator by plugging his personal
computer into it and making selections from a menu. But it will be up to him
to keep abreast of changes in tariffs and services and update the settings.
Collen says the SpiderIntegrator is flexible enough to accommodate the many
changes likely in European telecommunications over the next few years.
Spider has spent Pounds 3m developing the SpiderIntegrator and expects sales
of about Pounds 8m next year, believing it will appeal both to individual
teleworkers and multinationals. The machines will come in two models priced
at between Pounds 2,100 and Pounds 3,000 to distributors.

FT  07 APR 94 / Technology: Curb on Czech software copycats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM PULLAR-STRECKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International software producers are starting to take action against
copycats in eastern Europe. In the first concerted attempt to enforce
software copyright legislation in east European courts, the Czech branch of
the Business Software Alliance, an international association of software
companies, is acting against two local companies.
Robert Holleyman, president of the US-based BSA, said in Prague that police
from the city's criminal investigation department had raided the offices of
Dialog Agro - a computer company with Czech, US and Russian capital - on
March 17, seizing 'suspected pirate copies' of packages from Microsoft,
Lotus, Symantec and two local developers, PJ Soft and Software602, all
installed for the firm's own internal use.
Holleyman also said a Czech computer distributor, VT Data - suspected of
reselling pirated programs - was raided by police in January and that civil
and criminal actions had been initiated. Under the terms of the Czech
Republic's criminal code, anyone found pirating software faces a maximum
penalty of five years imprisonment or a Kcs2m (Pounds 46,000) fine.
The BSA estimates that 86 per cent of computer programs in use in the
country are copied illegally, a proportion similar to that of Spain and
Italy but lower than in most other east European states, while the legal
market employed 15,000 locals and produced revenues of Kcs9m last year.
Lori Forte, BSA's European affairs director, said that, if anything, Poland
rather than the Czech Republic had been the 'black sheep' in the region with
pirated software packages sold openly on market stalls in Warsaw.
A comprehensive copyright law stipulating maximum five-year jail terms for
offenders was ratified by the Sejm (Czech parliament) on February 4.

FT  07 APR 94 / Accountancy Column: 'True and fair' debate moves to the
insurance sector - A look at the implications of an EC directive due for
implementation next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS O'BRIEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Truth and fairness have been a requirement for most company accounts for
over 40 years, but it will be a new challenge for life assurance companies
in 1995 when the EC Insurance Accounts Directive is at last implemented.
With little time to go, there is still debate among accountants, and also
actuaries, on how to achieve 'true and fair' in an industry characterised by
long-term contracts, uncertainty, and high initial costs which are recouped
by subsequent revenue.
In the past, life assurance companies' accounts have used the figures in the
financial statements submitted to DTI - the 'DTI Returns' - which are geared
to ensuring they remain solvent. Here the actuary compares the value of a
company's assets with the value of its liabilities from all the policies on
its books. He has to allow for adverse deviations in investment returns,
rates of mortality, and must test a number of extreme circumstances, such as
a 25 per cent drop in the value of shares. This is fine for protecting
policyholders, but is likely to lead the accountant to say that the
liabilities are overstated if the new objective of the accounts is that they
be true and fair.
The problems are greatest for proprietary companies which are reporting
profits to their shareholders. The 'statutory solvency method', described
above, will typically understate profits for a growing company as unreported
profits are being built up, to be released later, for example when bonuses
are paid at the time a policy matures. And the writing of new policies, with
high expenses, typically depresses profits as a result of the regulations
underlying the DTI Returns.
How can we be more realistic? What many life assurance companies are now
focusing on is the 'embedded value'. To calculate this, actuaries first make
an estimate of the future stream of statutory solvency profits expected to
arise from the policies already written, using assumptions about future
mortality, investment returns, policies lapsing, etc. Then these profits,
lasting 25 years or more, are discounted to the present. To cope with the
uncertainty about the future assumptions such as lapses, the discount rate
may be increased to reflect this. The present value of these profits is
known as the embedded value.
This is a capital measure which is a good indicator of the company's
progress in improving profits. It is important information for management,
and providing incentives to increase embedded value is generally good for
shareholders.
However, the difficulties come when it is proposed that the increase in the
embedded value constitutes profit. Actuaries have been looking at the
principles underlying accounts, one of which is that profits should reflect
the past and not future performance of the firm.
This ties in with the ED Directive which requires profits to have been
'made', UK law that profits be 'realised', and also the principles of the
Accounting Standards Board.
The difficulty for the accounts is that the embedded value includes profits
from future performance, ie the insurance and investment management services
which the company provides for its policyholders in future years.
Basically there are two parts to the embedded value. First there are the
profits that have been made (in accounting terms) from services already
provided to policyholders but not passed to the shareholders because of the
way the solvency rules work. This is the 'Shareholders' Accrued Interest'.
Second, we have the discounted value of profits expected to be made from
future services on policies already written. True and fair accounting
requires the former, but not the latter, to be taken into account.
However, since embedded values are important to shareholders, there is merit
if they are shown in company accounts, though only as supplementary
information rather than implying that they represent profits which have been
made.
How can we determine the Shareholders' Accrued Interest in a away which is
true and fair? One suggestion is the 'accruals method', put forward as an
experimental approach, though it has attracted only limited support.
This method basically calculates the Shareholders' Accrued Interest by
subtracting the value of estimated profits relating to future services from
the embedded value. However, the technique to achieve this - 'planned profit
margins' - has been criticised by many accountants and actuaries as too
subjective.
Such margins are typically not planned and cannot be verified; neither can
they easily be applied to with-profits business. Along with other problems
about the treatment of risks and tax rates, it is not easy to see the result
being true and fair. The disparity of views has drawn together some life
assurance companies in an attempt to design an accounting method capable of
encompassing both embedded values and the accruals method. Another task is
to ensure that this can be expressed in the accounting format prescribed by
the directives.
These proposals have yet to be presented, but it is hard to see how they can
overcome the many concerns already expressed about both accruals and
embedded values.
So where is the solution? In fact it is not too difficult; we can revert to
calculating assets and liabilities but avoid the artificialities of the
statutory solvency method. This approach is called the Earned Profits
method, which I presented to the Institute of Actuaries last month. It is
based on a set of accounting principles specifically adapted to the nature
of the life assurance business. In particular:-
Provisions should be assessed prudently but without 'hidden reserves'.
Prudence requires that the liability on a policy should not generally be
less than the surrender value.
Where the shareholders have an interest in future bonuses, then monies
already held for bonuses should be partly attributed to shareholders.
Future losses expected on existing policies should be capitalised, but
future profits should not.
Initial expenses such as commission should be matched against corresponding
revenue, as where the policyholder forgoes an allocation to units in the
first two years, to produce a deferred acquisition cost asset.
The going concern principle to be applied.
This approach is consistent with the ASB's standards, and fits conveniently
with the EC directive. It means that the increase in the excess of assets
over liabilities, the Earned Profit, reflects what the company has earned in
the year. It equates to what policyholders have paid for the services which
the company has provided, less the costs incurred.
The earned profits method avoids the artificialities of profits reported
under the statutory solvency method. For with-profits business there is no
longer a markedly high profit in the last year of a policy when the terminal
bonus is paid; the effect is accrued over the term. For unit-linked business
the artificial loss arising from high initial expenses in the first year is
eliminated.
The Association of British Insurance is currently drafting an accounting
practice which will be a modification of the statutory solvency method.
Based on a calculation of assets and liabilities, it should recognise, for
example, that the provisions required by the solvency test for the expenses
should the company be closed to new business are inconsistent with the
'going concern' principle.
It is to be hoped that the constraints of the DTI's solvency rules are
replaced by ordinary accounting principles applied to life assurance as in
the Earned Profits method. The outcome will be an application of both
actuarial and accounting techniques, which is surely the right way forward
for life assurance accounts to show a true and fair view.

FT  07 APR 94 / Cost to business of VAT is Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost to businesses of complying with value added tax is about Pounds
1.6bn, the National Audit Office says in a report published today.
The costs were partially offset, however, by cashflow benefits of around
Pounds 600m because traders often hold VAT for between one and four months
before handing it over to the government.
The NAO also estimates indirect management benefits of about Pounds 150m as
the requirement to produce regular and reliable VAT returns encourages
businesses to maintain better accounts and records.
Nonetheless, in order to bring down the increasing costs of VAT compliance
the NAO recommends: A review of the regulatory framework, identifying the
primary law on which each regulation is based.
An analysis of where the main compliance costs for businesses arise and a
strategy for simplifying existing regulations, with targets for the number
of regulations to be reviewed each year.
Monitoring of changes to see if the expected benefits and cost reductions
are achieved.
The report points out that the government's de-regulation initiative, which
aims to cut the regulatory burden on businesses, is committed to simplifying
all systems. But of 600 regulations selected for possible reform by
government task forces reviewing red tape, only eight relate to VAT.
The NAO says that, in some cases, VAT might be simplified by abolishing
regulations or reducing their scope. And in some instances new regulations
can produce cost savings.
Since 1985 there have been 209 regulatory changes affecting VAT. The NAO
estimates that 40 were intended to reduce compliance costs, 145 had little
or no affect, and 24 would potentially have increased compliance costs. Some
14 of these 24 related to changes required by European legislation. The
report calls on the government to ensure that all proposals for new VAT
regulations are accompanied by an assessment of the cost to businesses of
complying with them.

FT  07 APR 94 / Employment 'skills gap' widens further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'skills gap' in Britain is widening again, says the Department of
Employment's latest analysis of skill shortages.
The gap - defined as the difference between the skills of existing employees
and those needed to meet business objectives - was reported by 17 per cent
of employers in 1993. The proportion compared with only 14 per cent in 1991,
adds the report written by Mr Ian Dale of the department's statistical
services division.
But employers do not appear to have immediate skill-related recruitment
problems. Only 6 per cent reported hard-to-fill vacancies when asked in the
middle of last year, compared with 22 per cent in 1990.
An increasing number of hard-to-fill vacancies are in low paid, low-skill
jobs. In 1990, 40 per cent of such vacancies were defined as high-skill, but
the figure is now 28 per cent.
The main industry with recruitment difficulty is hotels and catering. In
this sector21 per cent of employers reported problems.
Others worst affected by the 'skills gap' were textiles and electrical and
electronic engineering.
Last year, 10 categories accounted for three-quarters of all hard-to-fill
vacancies: catering trade workers, textiles and garments workers, nurses and
related health professions, sales representatives, engineers and
technologists, transportation operatives, miscellaneous sales staff, sales
assistants and checkout operators, clerks and cashiers, and teachers.
Only 5 per cent of manufacturing companies expected a lack of skilled labour
to limit output in the early months of this year. This compared with a peak
of 28 per cent in 1988.
But the Association of British Chambers of Commerce has reported that in the
fourth quarter of last year 42 per cent of manufacturing companies had
recruitment difficulties - the highest level since 1990 when the proportion
peaked at 73 per cent.

FT  07 APR 94 / Plans to break up N Yorks attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trade and industry associations representing more than 600 companies in
North Yorkshire have written to the prime minister opposing the local
government review.
The Local Government Commission wants to break up North Yorkshire and create
smaller, unitary authorities. The name 'riding' would be revived for some of
them.
Yortek, which represents engineering and other manufacturers, has joined
with Yorkshire Pantry - a food and beverage industry trade body  - and the
Vale of York Small Business Association to support the status quo.
In their letter, Mr Howard Chadwick, Mr Bill Taylor and Mr Ian Traynor - the
organisations' respective chairmen - tell Mr Major: 'North Yorkshire has
served us extremely well over the last 20 years. These proposals will lead
to the break-up of professional and cost-effective services.
'The proposals are not generally supported by local businessmen and are
based on predictions of financial savings which are marginal and so prone to
error that we could certainly not recommend an investment decision on such a
basis,' they add.
The commission's plans are 'ill-founded, grossly unpopular and totally
inappropriate'. Asking for discussions 'at the highest possible level', the
chairmen claim the views of business have been ignored.

FT  07 APR 94 / Jump in women workers forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women workers will make up 46 per cent of Britain's labour force by 2006
according to the latest Department of Employment projections published in
its journal Employment Gazette.
This is 2 percentage points more than the current figure and contrasts with
the latest official figure for women as a proportion of workers in
employment - about 49 per cent (10.5m) last December.
By 2006 the size of the labour force is expected to rise to 29.4m, 1.5m more
than in mid 1993.
As many as 1.3m of the projected additional workers will be women. At
present women constitute 44 per cent of the labour force.
Britain will also have an older labour force. There will be a 2.4m projected
rise among the 35 to 54 age group and 700,000 people aged 55 and over.
By contrast, a fall of 1.6m people is predicted over the same period for the
under-35 labour force.

FT  07 APR 94 / Gooda Names to face extra losses of Pounds 60m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 4,000 Lloyd's Names on seven loss-making Gooda Walker syndicates
will learn this week that they face additional losses of about Pounds 60m.
Gooda Names must pay the extra money to meet claims paid or notified during
1993. These stem mainly from two sources: court awards to victims of the
Lockerbie air crash in 1988 and possible future court awards to Names - the
individuals whose assets support the insurance market - who are suing their
agents for negligence.
GW Run-Off, the agency now managing the Gooda syndicates, says in a letter
to Names: 'Certain results are materially worse than the estimates referred
to in our preliminary report to Names issued in January 1994.'
Total losses of the seven syndicates now amount to Pounds 988.4m and could
eventually exceed Pounds 1.15bn. GW Run-Off indicates that claims paid last
year on business underwritten in previous years had exceeded earlier
forecasts by Pounds 63.22m. Overall, the Lloyd's market has suffered losses
of more than Pounds 7bn since 1988.
'These figures make very depressing reading for Gooda Walker Names,' said Mr
Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group. Mr Deeny said the
figures justified the group's decision to reject Lloyd's Pounds 900m
out-of-court settlement offer made in February. He said that the group would
now increase the amount it is claiming in damages to more than Pounds 600m.
The Names' legal action is due to start on April 26.
GW Run-Off will decide in the next few weeks how much cash it needs to call
from Names this year. Losses either paid or reported during 1993 total
Pounds 163.2m.
It has collected Pounds 700m of the loss so far, of which more than Pounds
500m has been paid by individual Names.
'People are staggered when they hear that figure,' said Mr Ken Randall,
chief executive of GW Run-Off. 'There is more financial resilience around
than you would expect.'
Mr Randall said that less than Pounds 150m has been paid from Lloyd's
Central fund, which meets claims when Names cannot fulfil their obligations.
Explaining the additional losses, Mr Randall said that about Pounds 25m of
the extra money was needed to pay claims arising from the Lockerbie disaster
in December 1988, when a PanAm airliner crashed with the loss of 250 lives.
Aviation insurers now have a clearer idea of how much money they must pay in
legal awards. As a result Syndicate 298, which was a player in the aviation
reinsurance market, can clarify its liabilities.
Claims have also arisen from legal action by Names against their agents at
Lloyd's. Syndicate 290 was a significant underwriter of errors-and-omissions
insurance, which covers Lloyd's agents against legal awards for negligence.
It has increased its reserves against potential claims.
Including the new loss estimates, syndicate 290's overall losses between
1989 and 1991 amount to Pounds 351.9m. Syndicate 298 faces losses of Pounds
332.5m.

FT  07 APR 94 / Government unmoved by Adams letter: Security forces remain
on full alert in Ulster - Mayhew optimistic on prospects of peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was last night studying a letter from Mr Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, calling for direct talks on Northern Ireland - but
continued to insist that there could be no dialogue without a permanent end
to violence.
The letter urging Mr John Major, the prime minister, to end the stalemate by
meeting Sinn Fein to clarify the Downing Street declaration was delivered on
the first day of the IRA's three-day ceasefire.
A Downing Street spokesman reacted cautiously and said the government might
respond to Mr Adam's request for talks, which the Sinn Fein leader says
would be aimed exclusively at clarification and not negotiation, 'in the
next day or two'.
Earlier in the day, however, Downing Street had reiterated the government's
position: 'We are not negotiating with them and we are not going to clarify
the joint declaration. They know what needs to be done; a renunciation of
violence.'
Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein national chairman, yesterday denied that his party
was in contact with the government - in spite of suspicions on the subject
expressed by some unionist politicians. He said he was not aware that any
part of the republican movement was in contact with London.
With an extension to the IRA ceasefire - due to end at midnight tomorrow -
highly unlikely in the absence of a positive government response, prospects
for a breakthrough remain slim.
Security forces in the province remain on full alert, in spite of the
temporary suspension of violence, and there are fears that the end of the
ceasefire will be met by an upsurge in paramilitary activity by republicans
and loyalists.
Mr Hartley, who was in London to deliver Mr Adams' letter, urged Mr Major to
give an 'imaginative response' to what he described as an 'unprecedented
initiative' by the IRA which demonstrated republican readiness to be
flexible in the search for peace.
He criticised the government's refusal to talk to Sinn Fein, given its
readiness to do so from mid 1990 until late last year.
'When we raised points for clarification then, we got them very easily,' he
said. 'It does seem odd the British are now saying 'no' at a time when there
is a real possibility of political movement and a momentum being created.'
Ms Lucilita Bhreatnach, Sinn Fein general secretary, said that Dublin had
provided satisfactory clarification of the Downing Street document - but
that ambiguities and uncertainties remained which London had to clear up.
She declined to be more specific, saying it would be 'unhelpful' at this
stage.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday used a visit to
Canada to deliver an upbeat message on the prospects for peace. He also
reiterated the government's view that political violence had 'no place' in a
democracy.
In a speech at Montreal-based Bombardier Aerospace - owner of Short
Brothers, Ulster's largest manufacturing employer - Sir Patrick said the
Downing Street declaration would do much to bring about an end to terrorist
violence. The people of Northern Ireland, like those of the Republic,
rejected the concept of a three-day 'abstention from political violence'.
Focusing principally on inward investment, Sir Patrick said that Ulster had
accounted for 14 per cent of all new investment into the UK in 1992-93 in
spite of having only 2.8 per cent of the population.
Overseas investors recognised the 'essential normality' of conditions in
Northern Ireland, he said.

FT  07 APR 94 / Heavy job cuts forecast for Northumberland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South-east Northumberland faces a total loss of 2,000 jobs during 1994 and
the three following years on top of up to 1,000 jobs shed last year, says a
report to be considered by county councillors today.
Research by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants for the county council says
recent closure and redundancy announcements in the county, especially in its
industrialised south-east corner, have already put it on course to fulfil
the highest predictions of coal-related job losses in the coming years.
About half the 2,000 forecast job losses have happened in the past few
months with the sudden closure of Northumberland's last pit, Ellington. The
county and district councils are lobbying the government for more economic
development aid.
The consultants, who completed their original study of the Northumberland
economy in late 1992, say there is now evidence that the growth of
self-employment in the area is less than previously estimated, and that the
relative performance of its manufacturing has weakened.
They predict that manufacturing employment will continue to fall while the
energy sector declines steeply.
They now estimate that total employment for the county by 1997 will be 1,800
jobs below 1992 levels, with the brunt of the jobs rundown concentrated on
south-east Northumberland, where a fall of up to 3,000 jobs is expected.
Without additional support, they say, south-east Northumberland's prospects
are bleak, with unemployment expected to reach nearly twice the national
average at about 17 per cent overall and 25 per cent for men.

FT  07 APR 94 / Concession offered on school tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
External marking for national curriculum tests in England and Wales could be
introduced next year, Baroness Blatch, the education minister, announced
yesterday.
Her announcement was greeted with applause from the annual conference in
Blackpool of the NASUWT teaching union, which last year took the lead in
enforcing a boycott of the tests supposed to be taken by all seven-year-olds
and 14-year-olds.
It was the most cordial reception the union has given a Tory education
minister for more than a decade and signalled a big shift in its position
since cuts to the tests were announced in January by Sir Ron Dearing, the
government's chief curriculum adviser.
It also deepened the split between NASUWT and the National Union of
Teachers, which will continue its boycott of all tests.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, called on Lady Blatch to have
the tests marked externally this year.
He dismissed as 'codswallop' claims by NUT leaders that external marking
would reduce teachers to 'technician' status and undermine their
professionalism.
Lady Blatch said she would consult next term on possible changes for the
1995 tests and also gave support for Wandsworth Borough Council's decision
to use supply teachers as external markers.
She said: 'It is open to schools to draw on supply cover as you yourselves
have suggested, and where schools do make such arrangements that is to be
welcomed.'
But Mr de Gruchy said: 'Surely if you think tests are so important for
standards, it is not beyond the wit of this government to organise external
markers and make sure that the tests take place this summer.'
Without external markers, the NUT boycott will probably prevent tests in
several thousand schools.
However, there were warning notes for ministers from the third teachers'
union, the traditionally moderate Association of Teachers and Lecturers,
which yesterday opened its conference in Bournemouth.
The ATL last night took a card vote on a motion condemning its executive for
not holding a second ballot on the boycott. The result is expected this
morning.
Mr Peter Smith, ALT general secretary, said the government was 'on
probation' this year. If Sir Ron's exercise proved 'cosmetic or expedient',
he could not rule out a boycott next year.

FT  07 APR 94 / Railtrack meets council today over threat to fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks will be held today between Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority,
which operates the largest suburban rail network outside London, and
Railtrack in an attempt to resolve a threat to the financing of suburban
railways.
Strathclyde announced on Tuesday that it would be withholding its Pounds 33m
subsidy for this year to ScotRail, which operates the railway network around
Glasgow, until it had more information on the increase in fees it must pay
for the use of track.
The authority calculates that the increase in track access fees announced by
Railtrack in February will increase the subsidy needed from Pounds 33m to
Pounds 95m. Strathclyde wants more details of how this sum is arrived at,
said Mr Charles Gordon, vice-chairman of Strathclyde Regional Council's
transport committee.
Strathclyde is concerned that it would be unable to justify the payment to
its auditors until it has a breakdown of the numbers involved. Railtrack
said it would be happy to provide Strathclyde with the details at today's
meeting.
Seven passenger transport authorities in Britain met Mr Roger Freeman,
transport minister, last week, and appeared to accept a government assurance
that higher track access charges would be matched by a higher subsidy, the
Department of Transport said.

FT  07 APR 94 / M0 growth hints at retail recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyant figures for money supply growth published yesterday may indicate
that retail sales were healthy last month. M0, the narrowest measure of the
money supply, grew by a seasonally adjusted 5.8 per cent in the year to
March compared with an annual rate of 5.5 per cent in February.
Notes and coins, the core component of M0, rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.9
per cent between February and March and by 6.1 per cent over the 12-month
period, said the Bank of England. The annual growth in M0 has been
consistently above the target range of 0 to 4 per cent - though the
authorities have pointed to low interest rates, which cut the effective cost
of holding cash, as a contributory factor.
M0 growth has traditionally been assumed to reflect a rise in retail sales.
But analysts warned that special factors may have applied in March. Mr
Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, the Japanese bank, said:
'The recent relationship between M0 and retail sales has been less precise.'
Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist at Robert Fleming Securities, said: 'The
fact that Easter fell right at the start of April means consumers will have
built up cash at the end of March.'
If the money supply figures do translate into higher retail sales, this will
be an encouraging sign of the strength of the recovery. The annual growth
rate of retail sales dropped to 2.5 per cent in February, the lowest rate
since May 1993, and commentators had assumed that consumers were cutting
back in anticipation of this month's tax increases.
Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said the strong M0
growth would be disappointing news for gilts.
Other figures released by the Bank of England show that overseas
institutions were net buyers of gilts in February, purchasing more than
Pounds 1.5bn. The main sellers were domestic institutions, which unloaded a
net Pounds 338m. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities,
said the Bank, reported to have intervened in February to help individual
marketmakers, was likely to have made net purchases of less than Pounds
500m.
The UK's gold and foreign currency reserves rose by Dollars 89m last month,
taking reserves at the end of March to Dollars 43.5bn compared with Dollars
43.4bn at the end of February.
The underlying change in reserves was a drop of Dollars 45m. This excludes
various factors including proceeds from this month's tender of UK Ecu
Treasury bills and British Telecommunications privatisation receipts of
Dollars 142m.

FT  07 APR 94 / Returns on commercial property rise to 27.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The return on commercial property investments rose to 27.4 per cent in the
12 months to March, say chartered surveyors Richard Ellis. The figures
underline the strength of the recent recovery in the commercial property
market.
The data show a continued improvement in the market since February, when
annual total returns were 24.7 per cent. The last time commercial property
produced returns above 27 per cent was in August 1989.
The strong performance of the property sector has taken place despite
continued weakness in the letting market. The Richard Ellis figures show
rents have declined by 6.4 per cent in the year to March.
Rents in the office sector have stabilised in the past two months, though
over the past year they have fallen 9.4 per cent. Retail and industrial
property recorded falls in rents in March of 0.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent
respectively, and falls of 3.4 per cent and 5.8 per cent over the year.
The continued decline in rents could undermine the strength of the recovery
of the commercial property market, said Mr Angus McIntosh, director of
research at Richard Ellis.
'Investment yields are unlikely to continue to fall, and unless we see some
rental growth soon, capital values will cease rising,' he said.
The industrial sector produced the highest total return, at 29.8 per cent,
compared with 28.8 per cent for the office sector and 24.8 per cent for the
retail sector.
Capital values rose by an average of 19.3 per cent for the year to March. In
the year to March 1993, capital values fell by 10.9 per cent. The capital
value of industrial properties surged in March with a month-on-month rise of
3.6 per cent.
On an annual basis, industrial property recorded capital growth of 20.8 per
cent, office property 20.4 per cent and retail property 17.5 per cent.
Richard Ellis based its figures on a sample of 246 properties valued at
about Pounds 1bn.

FT  07 APR 94 / NUM is told S Wales mine will close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal plans to close Tower colliery, its last deep mine in south
Wales, on April 15, executives told union officials yesterday.
It said the pit would be maintained until it is offered for sale in parallel
with the privatisation of other mines later in the year.
A pithead meeting will be held on Saturday at which Tower colliery's 200
miners will decide whether to appeal against closure through the industry's
review procedure. This could delay closure by up to nine months, but a vote
to fight the shutdown is unlikely.
British Coal said that all contracted and anticipated demand for coal mined
in south Wales could be supplied from other existing sources.
Mr Tyrone O'Sullivan, secretary of the Tower NUM lodge, accused British Coal
of closing the pit 'purely to get us out of the way for privatisation'. He
said British Coal was offering Pounds 7,000 per man on top of redundancy
payments - the extra payment would be withdrawn if the men decided to go
ahead with the review procedure.
South-east Northumberland faces a total loss of 2,000 jobs during 1994 and
the three following years on top of up to 1,000 jobs shed last year, says a
report to be considered by county councillors today.
Research by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants for the county council says
recent closure and redundancy announcements in the county, especially in its
industrialised south-east corner, have already put it on course to fulfil
the highest predictions of coal-related job losses in the coming years.
About half the 2,000 forecast job losses have happened in the past few
months with the sudden closure of Northumberland's last pit, Ellington.

FT  07 APR 94 / Union fights Thorp changes

<TEXT>
Electricians at Thorp, British Nuclear Fuels' Pounds 2.8bn waste
reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, are fighting changes in manning
arrangements which they claim threaten safety, Chris Tighe writes.
The Sellafield electricians' section of the AEEU engineering and electrical
union is holding a meeting today of its 970 members to decide on whether to
hold a ballot on industrial action.
Sellafield manual employees work in teams which have an electrician and an
instrument mechanic, but BNF has ruled that at Thorp some teams will not
include both. Mr Alan Westnedge, union convener, said: 'We don't believe
this is a safe working practice. They are putting people in the situation
where they have to deal with whatever comes up.'
BNF said it wanted to solve the issue by further discussion using
established company procedures. It added: 'We are fully committed to safe
working. We believe all the procedures implemented within Thorp are
perfectly safe.'

FT  07 APR 94 / More employers report 'skills gap' in workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'skills gap' in Britain is widening again, says the employment
department's latest analysis of shortages.
The gap - defined as the difference between the skills of existing employees
and those needed to meet business objectives - was reported by 17 per cent
of employers in 1993 and only 14 per cent in 1991. The report was written by
Mr Ian Dale of the department's statistical services division.
But employers do not appear to have immediate skill-related recruitment
problems. Only 6 per cent reported hard-to-fill vacancies when asked in the
middle of last year, compared with 22 per cent in 1990.
An increasing number of hard-to-fill vacancies are in low paid, low-skill
jobs. In 1990, 40 per cent of such vacancies were defined as high-skill, but
the figure is now 28 per cent. The main industry with recruitment difficulty
is hotels and catering, in which 21 per cent of employers report problems,
followed by textiles and electrical and electronic engineering.
Last year, 10 occupations accounted for three-quarters of all hard-to-fill
vacancies: catering trades, textiles and garments, nurses and related health
professionals, sales representatives, engineers and technologists, transport
operatives, miscellaneous sales, sales assistants and checkout operators,
clerks and cashiers, teachers.
Only 5 per cent of manufacturing companies expected a lack of skilled labour
to limit output in the early months of this year compared with a peak of 28
per cent in 1988.
But the Association of British Chambers of Commerce has reported that in the
fourth quarter of 1993 42 per cent of manufacturing companies had
recruitment difficulties - the highest level since 1990 when the proportion
peaked at 73 per cent.

FT  07 APR 94 / Minister admits threat to pension growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Millions of holders of personal pensions may be losing up to seven months'
growth for their savings each year because of delays in transferring their
National Insurance contributions to their personal pensions.
This aspect of personal pensions is the latest to put the government under
pressure. The possibility of delays was confirmed in a letter from Mr
William Hague, the pensions minister, to Mr John Denham, Labour MP for
Southampton Itchen.
The time-lag arises because the payments from the Department of Social
Security can be made only after an employer has submitted the end-of-year
PAYE tax return. The return is needed so that the minimum contribution to be
made to the personal pension can be calculated. Mr Denham called on the
government to look at where the delays were occurring. If that was in the
late submission of tax returns, more pressure should be brought on employers
to deal with them promptly.
'The exact figure for each person will obviously depend on the performance
of their own pension fund,' Mr Denham said. 'But year in, year out, seven
months' worth of growth lost could make a huge difference to the pension
that is paid out.'
No information is collected centrally on the normal length of delays or the
sums which might be foregone in pension growth. However, some Pounds 3.5bn
in contracted-out pension contributions was paid into private pensions for
4m people in 1991-92, the last year for which figures were available.
Mr Hague's letter said payments were normally made between May and October
following the end of the tax year.
The Contributions Agency, an executive arm of the DSS, said the longest
period for processing payments would normally be no more than six weeks
after it had received the tax return. The agency has a target of processing
98 per cent of all such cases by the end of December following the tax year.

FT  07 APR 94 / Fowler rejects referendum jibe: Party chief says Major will
stay, whatever happens in local elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, yesterday sought to
distance the prime minister from the outcome of the local elections, making
clear that Mr John Major would stay in office regardless of the result.
With backbenchers speculating that only an unexpectedly good performance
could stave off a leadership challenge, Sir Norman flatly denied that the
local elections on May 5 were a referendum on the prime minister's
leadership.
Sir Norman said that while Mr Major would play a leading role in the
campaign for the local government elections, the referendum on the prime
minister had taken place at the general election in 1992.
Asked whether the prime minister's leading role in the campaign was not a
high-risk strategy given poll evidence, Mr John Gummer, environment
secretary, replied: 'One of the joys of John Major is that once he gets out
among people, people recognise in him the kind of greatness and leadership
which he gives us.'
Downing Street said the results of the local elections would have no bearing
on the future of the prime minister, who was said to be determined to remain
in office and win the next general election.
Sir Norman, speaking at a press conference to launch the Tory campaign for
the local elections, was forced on to the defensive over questions that the
party was demoralised. 'We are being told that we are going to do badly,' he
said. 'We were told we were going to do badly in 1992 at the general
election. We were written off.
'I am entirely content that people should take a sceptical view of our
chances. We are going to fight these elections very hard indeed, as hard as
we can. I very much hope - and I believe - we will have gains.'
But Sir Norman resolutely refused to predict where he expected the Tories to
make gains on May 5.
Sir Norman said the party would fight the local elections as a choice
between 'high-quality services at a value-for-money cost from Conservatives
or expensive Lib-Labbery'.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, accused Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor, and Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, of 'sunning
themselves on the Mediterranean' instead of taking part in the Conservative
campaign.
Labour has also been careful to play down its chances of making big gains,
stressing that their successes in the last round of local elections in 1990
represented a high mark in its vote in many boroughs. The last European
elections were in 1989 when Conservatives were losing ground, but not on the
scale of their defeats a year later when the council seats were last fought.

FT  07 APR 94 / Blunkett attacks spending policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, yesterday called for more
spending on public services, in a speech at odds with his party leadership's
view that shadow cabinet members should avoid making expenditure
commitments.
He told public-sector trade unionists in Blackpool that the Labour party
offered 'care before accountancy', and problems could not be solved by
'taking them out of public spending'. The 'stupid belief' that privatisation
and de-regulation were the only way to deal with difficult issues had to be
set aside once and for all.
Mr Blunkett accused the government of creating an 'off-balance-sheet'
approach in an attempt to offload forthcoming dilemmas on to the backs of
individuals.
Labour's 'critical task' was to restore commitment and confidence to public
services and investment in them.
He said provision of more money for improving patient care could be partly
financed by avoiding the bureaucratic and costly administration which had
become endemic in the health service as a result of the government's
market-oriented changes.

FT  07 APR 94 / Six telecoms operators gain licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government gave a further boost to competition in the UK
telecommunications market yesterday by awarding six licences to operators
that could invest a total of Pounds 100m in the next few years.
The licences will lead to new telecoms networks in London and Manchester.
Videotron, a cable operator already building combined telephone and
television networks in London, has been granted a telephony licence for
Westminster and the City of London.
It plans to start building a City telecoms network - the third City network
under construction - immediately, with work starting in the Westminster area
later this year. British Telecommunications holds the cable television
licence for the area, its only TV franchise in the country.
The granting of a licence to Norweb, the Manchester-based electricity
distributor for the north-west of England, increases the stake of the
privatised electricity companies in the telecoms industry.
Norweb already offers a point-to-point telecoms service to large telecoms
users in its region. It plans to expand its network, focusing particularly
on the Manchester business market in association with Energis, the
long-distance telecoms operator owned jointly by the 12 regional electricity
companies in England and Wales. Energis is about to launch a long-distance
network erected on the National Grid's pylons.
The other four companies granted licences are Sprint and Worldcom, both
significant US operators, Telstra, the Australian national operator, and
Telia, the Swedish national operator. They propose to provide a range of
resale services, including international resale, which could cut the cost of
international calls sharply as reciprocal agreements are signed allowing the
carriage of leased-line traffic across the public networks in the UK and the
destination country.

The recent decision by merchant bank Barings to stop taking applications for
personal equity plans shows the extent of competition in the Pep market.
An aggressive price war backed by heavy advertising to promote 'name
awareness' has raised the stakes for smaller Pep providers. And some
companies complain that their distribution costs are increasing as
independent financial advisers demand annual renewal commissions on top of
initial commissions.
Peps, which began in 1987, are popular tax shelters for private investors.
Up to Pounds 6,000 a year can be invested free of capital gains or income
tax in a general plan and a further Pounds 3,000 in single-company Peps. The
general plan market has grown steadily from Pounds 1.6bn in the 1990-91 tax
year to Pounds 3.1bn in 1992-93 and is estimated to be a record Pounds 5bn
for the tax year just ended.
Baring Global Fund Managers, the bank's asset managing arm, is a relatively
minor player - Peps represent Pounds 15m of its Pounds 3bn in managed assets
 -and the company is putting its Pep business on hold pending a review of
its retail operations.
Mr Nick Wells, product development manager, said: 'What stuck out like a
sore thumb is that our Pep business is tiny compared to our institutional
business.' He added: 'We do not want to discount nor do we want to put up
standard charges.'
Discounting is widespread. In 1992, Fidelity introduced tapered exit charges
on its Peps allowing it to cut the initial charge to 2 per cent from the
industry average of 5 per cent to 6 per cent. It continued to pay 3 per cent
commission to intermediaries.
This year, M&amp;G, the largest Pep provider, went further by abolishing the
initial charge on its Managed Income Fund Pep and introducing withdrawal
charges. Ms Rachel Medill, head of corporate communications, said: 'We are
subsidising the managed income Pep, but we hope that it will be profitable
over five years.'
Nor is Barings the only company to feel the pressure. Mr Martin Harrison,
managing director of GT unit managers said: 'We've felt the impact of the
M&amp;G move on our own sales. The price war is unfortunate because more
companies will move out. We'll be left with the giants and the niche
players.' Chase de Vere Investments, publisher of an annual Pep guide,
estimates 20 per cent of companies take 80 per cent of Pep money.
The main costs of administering a Pep are sending out six monthly valuations
to customers and recovering tax deductions on dividends from the Inland
Revenue. Mr Michael Short, managing director of Premier Administration,
said: 'You would need to take in at least Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m in a unit
trust for it to break even, and the amount would be much higher for a Pep.'
To survive on the low margins, companies are relying on generating
sufficient volume to make profits and on the annual management charge, which
has been edging up to 1.5 per cent.
Ms Judy Delaforce, product development manager at Fidelity, thinks the
Barings move could point the way for many more Pep providers. She said: 'A
lot of small players will not be able to afford to stay in the Pep market.'

ASEA Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, said
yesterday it had won an order worth around Dollars 150m (Pounds 102.7m) to
convert an Iranian gas turbine power station into a combined-cycle power
plant.
ABB said the conversion would boost output at the plant in the holy city of
Qom by 50 per cent to 600 MW without requiring additional fuel.
The order was placed by the Tehran regional electricity corporation with
financing provided by the World Bank. The project is due to be completed by
the end of 1996.
ABB will supply boilers to extract waste heat from the four existing gas
turbines. The heat will then be used to generate steam, which will power two
new steam turbine generators.
Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh this week visited Turkmenistan for
talks on the construction of an oil pipeline from the former Soviet republic
through Iran and Turkey to Europe, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported
yesterday.
In March Iran and Turkmenistan agreed to study the building of an oil
pipeline from Turkmenistan to Tehran with a capacity of 80,000 to 140,000
barrels per day.

Developing country members of Gatt would benefit from a US proposal to
establish an organisation to discuss the issue of labour standards and
trade, Japan's ambassador to Gatt said yesterday, Michiyo Nakamoto reports
from Tokyo.
Mr Nobutoshi Akao said 'developing countries should not be too worried,'
about the US proposal, since the proposal was merely to discuss the issue
rather than make any decisions right away.
The US has threatened to upset the signing of the Uruguay Round agreement in
Marrakesh next week by insisting its proposal to establish a committee to
discuss labour standards under Gatt be included in the declar-ation.
The US proposal is strongly opposed by developing countries, which fear the
issue of labour standards could be used against them as a protectionist
measure by industrialised countries.

FT  07 APR 94 / World Trade News: Gatt's successor to be given real clout -
The likely workings of the World Trade Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Trade Organisation that succeeds the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade next year will be a bigger beast but in most respects a similar
animal to its predecessor.
If negotiations with the Swiss government go well, the WTO will be
comfortably ensconced in Gatt's existing Egyptianate building by Lake
Geneva.
The present staff will stay - though there will be some new faces.
Transformation of Gatt from an interim, albeit long-standing, secretariat to
a fully fledged international organisation represents a useful legal
'tidying-up' of its anomalous position.
The WTO will continue to operate, as Gatt does, on the basis of consensus
and mutual agreement between member governments. The differences, however,
are crucial. The WTO will have stronger, clearer rules applying to virtually
all areas of world trade, from agriculture to accountancy. Even more
important, those rules will be enforced by a semi-judicial disputes
procedure which will no longer allow countries to block findings against
them.
All those wanting to join the WTO must accept the results of the Uruguay
Round of trade liberalisation talks in their entirety. A general council of
WTO members will have subsidiary bodies responsible for trade in goods,
services and intellectual property.
But the organisation's top decision-taking forum will be a two-yearly
ministerial meeting - an attempt to give the organisation more political
clout in capitals and a higher profile internationally.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, has made no secret of his desire
to reclaim for the WTO the role assigned to the stillborn International
Trade Organisation in global economic policy-making.
The ITO, negotiated in 1948, was intended to operate as an equal alongside
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank when these institutions
were set up after the war. After the US Congress refused to ratify the ITO,
the Gatt remained as a contractual arrangement between governments, serviced
by the secretariat to the ITO interim committee.
Not everyone shares Mr Sutherland's lofty ambitions for the WTO. Some fear
they will encourage UN-style waffle rather than action. 'The great advantage
of Gatt is that people go there to negotiate, not to talk,' says a senior
European trade official.
By common consent, however, the WTO's credibility as an effective fair-trade
policeman will stand or fall on the success of its new dispute settlement
system.
In a radical departure from previous practice, independent panel reports
will be automatically adopted by the WTO unless there is a consensus to
reject them. Complained-against countries may appeal to a permanent
appellate body but its verdict will be binding.
If offenders then fail to comply with panel recommendations, trading
partners will have the right to compensation or, in the last resort, to
impose (commensurate) trade sanctions. Every stage of the procedure is
subject to strict time limits.
The US, which has loudly voiced its frustrations with the present system,
has high hopes of the new one. 'The new system. . . will work and it will
work fast,' Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, told Congress in
January. He noted approvingly that there will also be the possibility of
cross-retaliation - the raising of tariffs, say, for a breach of the
intellectual property rules.
However, the new system will also substantially diminish the scope for
unilateral US action, a key objective of the EU and developing countries in
the Uruguay Round talks. WTO members are obliged to use multilateral
disputes settlement wherever available. And since WTO rules will extend to
services and intellectual property as well as goods, most disputes will fall
within its jurisdiction.
Some trade officials have predicted a wave of test cases, especially in
relation to the new accord on intellectual property rights - but Gatt is not
expecting a big permanent increase in the present workload. About a dozen
disputes are going through panel procedures.
Nevertheless, Gatt says it will need more lawyers, especially to service the
appellate body, and there will have to be extra staff to cope with the WTO's
work on services and intellectual property rights.
Though the final word on the WTO's expansion will rest with member
governments, who will have to approve an increase in the present SFr94m
(Pounds 45m) annual budget, Gatt expects to add 40-50 professionals to the
180 it currently employs within its 400-strong staff.
Gatt officials point out that the WTO will remain tiny by the standards of
other international organisations. The World Bank, with a budget of
SFr1.8bn, employs 3,700 professionals. The IMF has 1,300 professionals and a
budget of SFr477m. Even the Paris-based OECD, which has no executive
functions, employs 1,100 professionals with a budget of SFr350m.
'When you consider that the Uruguay Round agreement is going to generate up
to Dollars 270bn (Pounds 182bn) annually in extra world income in the goods
area alone, the WTO represents a pretty good return on investment,' says one
top official, half-seriously.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of thousands of protesters staged a rally in New Delhi yesterday,
in the biggest demonstration so far of public opposition to the Uruguay
Round agreement on world trade liberalisation.
The meeting, organised by the right-wing militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata
party, followed another on Tuesday called by left-wing groups, which also
attracted more than 100,000 people.
At both events, speakers condemned the Uruguay Round draft accord as an
instrument of oppression foisted by rich countries on the developing world.
They said the agreement would pave the way to new economic enslavement of
India.
At yesterday's rally, Mr Arthur Dunkel, former director-general of Gatt
Trade, was burnt in effigy. The rallies highlight fears in India and other
developing countries that the US and other rich countries will use the new
World Trade Organisation, which is being established to replace Gatt, to
impose one-sided conditions for trade with third world nations.
The public protests have not persuaded the government of Mr Narasimha Rao,
the prime minister, to change its mind about approving the Urugay Round pact
at the Gatt meeting in Marrakesh next week.
Like most other developing country leaders Mr Rao has accepted that the
benefits of the agreement, in terms of greater access to world markets,
outweigh disadvantages, such as opening India's markets to foreign companies
faster than he would like.
But the recent US move to link trade pacts to social issues including
minimum wage levels, pollution controls and human rights has angered India
and other developing countries. The US action gave fresh impetus to the
organisers of this week's Delhi rallies.

<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, has called a meeting of trade envoys to discuss a dispute between
the US and developing countries over trade and labour conditions, a
spokesman said yesterday, report Reuter in Geneva and David Goodhart, Labour
Editor, in London.
The spokesman said Mr Sutherland was in intense consultations on the
problem, that has overshadowed a gathering of ministers from 121 countries
in Marrakesh next week to sign new Gatt world trade accords.
He said Mr Sutherland would report to the ambassadors to Gatt on his
consultations 'and see if there were a possibility of some kind of
accommodation'.
The US, backed by France, wants a ministerial declaration in Marrakesh to
accept that a new World Trade Organisation, to replace the Gatt next year,
would deal with the link between trade and labour.
Developing countries fear this would open the door to new tariffs on their
goods to compensate for the fact that they are produced with cheaper labour,
and have refused to consider any reference to the issue in the Marrakesh
declaration.
The European Parliament might also refuse to ratify the Gatt deal early in
May if the Marrakesh meeting later this month produces no commitment to
examine the link between trade and workers' rights. Mr Michael Hindley,
leader of the majority socialist group on the European Parliament's external
trade committee, said yesterday that the socialist group may refuse to
ratify the treaty.

FT  07 APR 94 / World Trade News: Warning on China MFN row
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank has warned the US and China that both countries could face
consequences ranging 'from the dramatic to the disastrous' if the US were to
withdraw most favoured nation trade privileges from China.
In a study of trade reform in China the Washington-based development bank
estimates that Chinese exports to the US could drop by between 42 and 96 per
cent if the MFN privileges are not renewed - a loss of between Dollars 7bn
(Pounds 4.7bn) and Dollars 15.2bn (Pounds 10.2bn).
The Clinton administration has demanded progress on a number of human rights
issues before it will agree to renew MFN, which is due to expire on June 3.
An end to MFN privileges would mean that Chinese goods would be taxed at
general tariff rates which are often five to ten times higher than MFN
rates. The average tariff would rise from 13.4 per cent to 42 per cent.
The precise effects will vary, depending on how much other countries are
able to sell substitutes for goods now sold by China.
US consumers could also lose, the World Bank says. They might end up paying
as much as Dollars 14bn a year more in higher prices.

FT  07 APR 94 / North Korea in nuclear warning to Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A North Korean official warned yesterday that if his country was to develop
nuclear weapons, they would be primarily aimed at Japan, rather than at
South Korea or the US.
The warning, one of the most explicit made by North Korea about the intent
of its possible nuclear weapons programme, is likely to heighten concern in
Tokyo that Pyongyang poses a serious military challenge. However, North
Korean officials claim they suspect Japan's nuclear motives, and the
statement yesterday came a day after the start-up of Japan's first
fast-breeder nuclear reactor, which began a self-sustaining chain reaction.
Mr Cha Bong-ju, the North Korean ambassador to India, again said his country
did not intend to develop nuclear weapons, but told the South Korean news
agency Yonhap the North feared that Japan would eventually become a nuclear
power.
'Our nuclear arms, if developed, would be primarily designed to contain
Japan,' Mr Cha said.
He added that a North Korean nuclear weapon would never be used against
South Korea or the US.
The statements could increase pressure on the Japanese government to take a
tougher line against North Korea over the issue of nuclear site inspections.
They will also provide support for Japanese officials arguing that the
country must boost its defence capability.
North Korea has already developed a missile, the Rodong-I, that can reach
most of Japan, although military analysts believe that Pyongyang does not
yet have the capability of building a sophisticated nuclear warhead small
enough to fit on the missile.
But the ambassador's comments appear to confirm some analysts' fears that
North Korea might use the Japanese fast-breeder reactor, which generates
plutonium, as a pretext for proceeding with its own production of plutonium,
used in the making of nuclear weapons.
It was the second North Korean warning this week that it might be ready to
resume plutonium production.
Some analysts in Seoul believe Mr Cha's comments might be an attempt to
allay South Korea's fears about the development of a North Korean nuclear
weapon by appealing to the traditional Korean dislike of Japan.
North Korea has come under growing pressure to open up its nuclear
facilities to full international nuclear inspections to dispel suspicions
that it is developing nuclear weapons.
Pyongyang rejected a request by the UN Security Council last week that it
accept new inspections of nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy
Agency.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday came under pressure from its own supporters in Hong Kong to
explain why it had sentenced a journalist working for one of the colony's
leading daily newspapers to 12 years in jail.
Earlier this week it emerged that Mr Xi Yang, a Beijing correspondent for
the Ming Pao daily, had been found guilty of 'stealing and spying on state
secrets'.
The sentence came after a trial held in camera, at which Mr Xi was not
represented by a lawyer.
An employee at the People's Bank of China, the central bank, was sentenced
to 15 years' prison for assisting Mr Xi in his work.
The sentence meted out to Mr Xi was seen in Hong Kong as disproportionate to
any he offence he might have committed.
Some observers said it was a classic example of the Chinese adage 'to kill a
chicken to scare a monkey', in other words, to warn Hong Kong's news media
of the limits to inquiry by severely punishing one of their number.
Last summer Mr Xi wrote a series of articles about China's attempt to cool
its economy.
He reported that the People's Bank had sold gold to buy yuan to stabilise
the currency; also, he forecast accurately a rise in short-term interest
rates.
Leading pro-Beijing figures such as Mr Tsang Yok Sing, leader of a
China-funded political party in the colony, and Mr Xu Ximing, publisher of a
pro-Beijing magazine, called on China to prove that Mr Xi was engaged in
anything other than news-gathering.
Mr Xu said the 12-year sentence was too heavy.
Mr Xi had never used the information he got 'in any other way involving
espionage, apart from printing it in the newspaper.'
Mr Xi has been given leave to appeal against the verdict of Beijing's
Intermediate Court.
Mr Kevin Lau, vice-president of Hong Kong's journalists' association, said
the verdict had scared Hong Kong-based journalists who have to travel to
China.
There were no objective criteria for what constituted a secret in China, he
added.
He said that after Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, it will have to
enact laws to protect state secrets.
China's law was 'vague and subject to arbitrary interpretation'.

FT  07 APR 94 / Paris tries to melt Beijing ice: Balladur wants warmer
relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, could have picked a better
week to visit Beijing for talks aimed at celebrating a warming of
Sino-French relations after the iciness of the past year or so.
China's announcement on Monday that it was investigating its most prominent
dissident for new, and as yet unspecified, crimes has cast a considerable
shadow over the visit.
Mr Balladur, due to arrive in Beijing today, can hardly avoid broaching with
his Chinese hosts the subject of Mr Wei Jingsheng's incarceration. At the
very least, the continued detention of Mr Wei would preclude any possibility
of a visit to France this year by China's Premier Li Peng.
French officials have been contrasting the relatively low-key Balladur
mission to China with that of Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl last
November. Mr Kohl arrived in Beijing with a clutch of German industrialists
who then proceeded to sign deals worth about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.35bn),
including a Siemens agreement to build the Guanghzou subway.
Mr Balladur, on the other hand, will be travelling with a relatively small
delegation including Mr Alain Juppe, his foreign minister, and Mr Gerard
Longuet, trade and industry minister. But this is not to say the Balladur
mission is without commercial importance.
France is anxious to lay the groundwork for a revival of business relations
chilled following the 1992 decision of the previous French government to
allow the sale of about Dollars 2.6bn worth of armaments to Taiwan,
including 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighters and 1,500 surface-to-air missiles.
A furious Beijing ordered closure of France's consulate in Guanghzou, and
discriminated against French companies bidding for Chinese contracts.
Mr Balladur's ministers have made little attempt to disguise the impulses
that led to the mid-January Sino-French declaration which placed a
moratorium on further arms sales to Taiwan and opened the way for
restoration of what were described as 'friendly relations'.
Mr Juppe, in an interview last November with the French newspaper Les Echos,
asked with Gallic pragmatism: 'Shall we place our bets on a country with 20m
people or one with 1.3bn people? One that is the world's third largest
economy? The choice is clear. France wants to re-establish trusting
relations with China.'
France's disquiet over its diminishing stake in business with China is borne
out by trade figures which showed its share of China's imports fell to just
1.6 per cent in 1993 compared with 3 per cent in 1980.
Mr Longuet estimates that contracts worth more than FFr3bn (Pounds 354m)
were lost during the 1992-94 chill. The Patronat, the French employers'
federation, puts the tally at almost double official estimates.
French business will be hoping that the Balladur mission will at least
improve access in what is proving a highly competitive market. France's
powerful energy, utilities and communications groups hope to derive early
benefits from the Sino-French rapprochement.
'It is clear that we have been at a disadvantage compared with other western
groups,' said an executive of a French engineering company. 'Now we have the
opportunity to compete on an equal footing.'
Electricite de France and Framatome, suppliers of technology for China's
Daya Bay nuclear complex, as well as Alsthom, the engineering group, are all
jostling with international competitors to supply China's energy needs.
Alcatel is similarly enthusiastic about Beijing's plans to raise almost
tenfold the number of its telephone lines over the next five years.
Aerospatiale, the aircraft group, is also seeking to break into China's
growing aerospace market.
But French officials in Beijing say France will make it clear to China that
the soft loans used in the past to sweeten commercial deals will not be made
available quite so readily in the future.
Concessional loans from Paris to China total about FFr35bn, France's biggest
exposure abroad. Officials say France does not intend to use its facilities
to engage in 'cut-throat' attempts to secure business at the expense of its
fellow-Europeans.
Mr Balladur's other mission will be to oil the political relationship with
Beijing and improve the consultative process between fellow Security Council
members.
'We became marginalised in relations with Beijing,' said a French foreign
ministry official, adding that 'it is worrying when one considers the
growing diplomatic and regional importance of China.'
But French and Chinese wishes to make a fresh start in relations are certain
to be bedevilled by the human rights issue, especially if Mr Wei continues
to be held for questioning during the Balladur visit.
Mr Juppe told Le Figaro last week: 'France has no intention of closing its
eyes to the problems of human rights in China.' France's overtures to
Beijing have been based on pragmatism. The limits of that approach will be
tested this week.

Ten per cent of metropolitan Manila's police force are protectors or members
of drug syndicates, the Manila newspaper Today quoted Police Director
Ricardo Sarmiento as saying yesterday, Reuter reports from Manila. It
claimed he said some were involved with Asian drug rings, including Hong
Kong's 14K Triad. All members of the country's police force were ordered to
undergo drug tests, to fight the rising number said to be using drugs.

FT  07 APR 94 / UN envoy fails to win Afghan ceasefire

A United Nations envoy left the Afghan capital, Kabul, yesterday saying he
had failed to win a commitment for a ceasefire from President Burhanuddin
Rabbani and his rival, Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Reuter reports
from Kabul.
'I have not got a firm commitment from the conflicting sides for a lasting
ceasefire,' Mr Mahmud Mestiri, special envoy of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, said at the end of a five-day visit.
He planned to meet leaders of Afghanistan's provinces over the next two
weeks to try to find a way of ending the fighting before returning to Kabul
for final talks with the rival leaders.
Mr Mestiri had two rounds of talks with Mr Rabbani and met Mr Hekmatyar at
the prime minister's headquarters south of Kabul to try to mediate an end to
two years of factional warfare.
'We prefer a permanent ceasefire to a temporary one, not only in Kabul but
in all of Afghanistan,' Mr Rabbani declared after his talks with Mr Mestiri.
The two sides had agreed to a ceasefire during the envoy's visit, although
clashes erupted in the Tagab Valley, about 40 miles north-east of Kabul.
'I asked the leaders, especially the fighting sides, to extend the ceasefire
which has been holding during this visit,' Mr Mestiri said.
'We think that Kabul must not return to the inhuman conditions of the past
three months of war.'
The International Committee of the Red Cross says 2,500 people have been
killed, 17,000 wounded and 300,000 made homeless since the latest round of
the war for supremacy in Kabul erupted on New Year's Day.
More than 11,000 people have been killed and a third of Kabul's 1.5m
residents have fled the fighting since Mujahideen groups took power from the
former communist government and formed an Islamic coalition in April 1992.
Mr Rabbani said he had asked the UN to continue its involvement in
Afghanistan.
'I hope with the co-operation of the United Nations that a decision-making
body could be established soon, made up of people's delegates from all over
Afghanistan,' he added.
Mr Hekmatyar has demanded Mr Rabbani's resignation as a prerequisite for
peace.
Mr Rabbani refuses, saying his departure would open a dangerous power
vacuum.

FT  07 APR 94 / Bank chief more confident on Japan economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday slightly upgraded
his view of the economic outlook, after a quarterly meeting with regional
branch managers.
'The economy is brighter and close to hitting bottom,' said Mr Mieno, a
mildly less cautious choice of words than his pronouncement last week that
the conditions for recovery were falling into place.
He said his view had 'delicately' changed in the light of a three-day day
meeting with 33 branch managers, ending yesterday.
Branch managers told Mr Mieno that corporate sentiment had improved and that
executives were discussing the size, rather than the timing, of a recovery.
Japanese companies had made steady progress in winding down surplus stocks
and in restructuring. Exports were improving in response to a rise in
overseas demand led by the US, said Mr Mieno. 'Improvements in domestic
activities are spreading,' he added.
There was only a 'slim' risk that these signs of economic improvement would
evaporate, as did a phantom upturn this time last year, he maintained.
However, he warned that the yen's continued strength, the impasse in trade
talks with the US and staff reductions by Japanese companies might still
harm the economic outlook.
