FT  24 JUN 94 / Rothmans to cut 1,000 jobs in Europe: Cigarette maker makes
Pounds 124m provision for rationalisation as profits fall to Pounds 344m for
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rothmans International, the restructured tobacco group now shorn of its
Dunhill luxury goods interests, is to cut 1,000 jobs in Europe in a further
rationalisation of cigarette manufacturing.
The company is providing Pounds 123.8m to cover the pre-tax cost of the
moves, which involve the closure of factories in Berlin and The Hague and
rationalisation in Belgium.
The provisions resulted in a sharp fall in profits from Pounds 470.7m to
Pounds 343.6m for the year to March. Excluding the provisions and the Pounds
31.2m pre-tax costs of last year's group restructuring, profits rose 6 per
cent to Pounds 498.6m, with the increase entirely accounted for by exchange
rate movements.
Mr Bill Ryan, chief executive, said the closures were part of a long process
of rationalising acquisitions made after the war. 'In the mid-1970s we had
15 factories in Europe. When this is completed we will have six which is
still more than our main competitors.' Most of the job losses will result
from the closure of the Berlin factory. Production will be transferred to
Zevenaar in the Netherlands and to the two UK factories.
Rothmans had another difficult year in Europe with operating profits falling
23 per cent to Pounds 99.6m on slightly lower sales of Pounds 1.04bn (Pounds
1.08bn). Sales were down sharply in France, after a fierce price war, and by
more than 15 per cent in the UK, largely because two Budgets fell into the
period.
Mr Ryan said the rate of decline in Europe had slowed and he was now more
optimistic. 'We believe there may well be an improvement in the current year
with signs of economies picking up in Germany and France.'
Group operating profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 438.7m, including an
additional Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 22.2m) of rationalisation costs on net sales
revenue 3 per cent higher at Pounds 2.49bn. Worldwide cigarette volumes fell
8 per cent.
The operating profits were less than the City had expected but net
investment income of Pounds 59.9m (Pounds 51.7m) was rather better. This
rise, which was despite the Pounds 450m special dividend paid last November,
partly reflected gains on the disposal of a securities portfolio.
Cash generation was also stronger than forecast with net liquid funds
falling only Pounds 252.4m to Pounds 665.1m after working capital was almost
halved to Pounds 204.1m.
Earnings per unit, excluding exceptional costs, edged up to 35.1p (34.6p)
and the dividend is 13.2p, up from a pro forma 11.5p.
Rothmans' strongest growth continues to come from Asia where profits jumped
37 per cent to Pounds 110.7m on sales of Pounds 408.5m (Pounds 318.4m). The
Americas contributed Pounds 90.4m (Pounds 85.5m) and the Pacific Pounds
52.7m (Pounds 46.4m).
Mr Nyren Scott Malden, of brokers BZW, edged down his current year forecast
by Pounds 15m to Pounds 525m. That puts the shares at 369p, down 9p, on a
forward multiple of just over 10 with a yield of 4.5 per cent.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Eurotunnel rights take-up totals two-thirds in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel yesterday announced that only two-thirds of the UK tranche of its
Pounds 858m rights issue was taken up, significantly lower than for the 1990
issue.
However, the brokers SG Warburg succeeded in placing out the Pounds 70.6m
rump of the registered share issue to institutions at a small premium to the
265p rights price, releasing the underwriters from their obligations.
The underwriters are not entirely off the hook. The announcement of take-up
on the primarily French-owned bearer rights shares will not be made until
July 7.
In addition, the French stock exchange authorities yesterday officially
launched an investigation into possible market manipulation by the
underwriters. This follows accusations by Mr Christian Cambier, the French
head of an association of small Eurotunnel shareholders, that underwriters
may have sold short ahead of the pricing of the issue, in an attempt to
depress the share price and limit their risk.
Nevertheless, the placement of the rump of the UK issue was good news for
the banks behind the exercise, primarily Morgan Grenfell, Banque Indosuez
and Swiss Bank Corporation. The 26.6m rights units that were not taken up
were placed out at 269.46p (net of costs) to 'a wide range of mainly UK
institutions'. Unitholders who did not take up their rights will be paid the
4.46p premium to the rights price.
Take-up of the 241.5m bearer rights shares, listed in Paris, is expected to
be significantly higher. Around 45 per cent of the entire issue of bearer
rights was traded this week, and buyers would be almost certain to exercise
their rights, as under the French system, they do not receive the proceeds
from any subsequent placement.
French bankers suggested a take-up of more than 90 per cent was achievable,
which would bring the average take-up to a more respectable 84 per cent. The
1990 rights issue was 84 per cent subscribed in the UK, with a 98 per cent
take-up in France, but small shareholders were then given travel incentives.
Mr Rory MacNamara, corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell,
Eurotunnel's advisers, said: 'By Eurotunnel standards, it was an encouraging
response. Eurotunnel, at least in the UK, is more of a retail stock, and you
would expect a lower take-up.'
The placement of the rump was helped by a bounce in Eurotunnel's share price
to a high of 300p yesterday, although it closed 1p lower at 278p.
The management has put its own money behind its assertions of confidence in
the shares. Sir Alastair Morton, chairman, bought 10,000 warrants yesterday.
Both the company's chairmen have now invested in Eurotunnel stock in the
past three days. Their combined investment of Pounds 28,500, however, will
provide little more than moral support for the shares.

FT  24 JUN 94 / TSB feels effects of flat retail banking market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing competition in a flat retail banking and insurance market was
evident yesterday as TSB Group disclosed that income from on-going business
rose by only 3.5 per cent in the first half to Pounds 955m, against Pounds
921m.
TSB's pre-tax profits for the six months to April 30 jumped to Pounds 226m,
against Pounds 80m. But this was mainly due to a Pounds 92m fall in
provisions for bad and doubtful debts to Pounds 113m, and the absence of the
previous period's Pounds 44m reorganisation charge.
TSB reached its target of a 15 per cent post-tax return on equity. It
achieved a 15.5 per cent return compared with 5.7 per cent in the first half
of last year and 11.1 per cent for the full year.
Pressure on income emerged despite a 9.5 per cent expansion in the mortgage
book to 6.5bn, compared with overall market growth of 2.1 per cent. Loans
rose to Pounds 17.4bn from Pounds 17bn, but risk-weighted assets stayed at
Pounds 16.1bn.
Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, reaffirmed the bank's interest in buying
a building society. The aim would be mainly to sell a range of products to
the society's members, rather than as a means of increasing mortgage
lending. He said Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester
Building Society had encouraged other societies because it had shown that
they could preserve partial independence if they were acquired.
But he said that the losses sustained by TSB after buying the merchant bank
Hill Samuel in 1987 would make it cautious. 'The last time we bought
something and said to them 'you keep running it', it was a bit expensive,'
he said.
TSB raised its interim dividend by 12.5 per cent to 3.544p, against 3.15p.
Earnings per share amounted to 9.6p, up from 3.1p. It increased its tier 1
ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets to 9.1 per cent, against 8.7
per cent.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman, said that capital strength gave TSB the
flexibility to add new products and 'take advantage of a suitable
acquisition'.
Mr Ellwood said growth in credit cards and personal loans, which have high
margins, offset a squeeze elsewhere. The margin on its mortgage book fell to
1.6 per cent because of the growing proportion of fixed rate products.
He said that TSB would launch a 24-hour telephone banking service called
PhoneBank this autumn, following a successful pilot project in the
north-east. It would offer all customers basic banking services by
telephone.
TSB had provided a 'small additional sum' against compensation payments for
its 55,000 pension transfer cases. It was investigating a total of 100 cases
of possible mis-selling by staff.
The shares shed 9p to close at 211p.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Sanofi to pay Kodak Dollars 1.68bn for prescription drugs
arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sanofi, the French pharma-ceuticals and cosmetics group, is to buy the
prescription drugs business of Sterling Winthrop, a subsidiary of Eastman
Kodak of the US, for Dollars 1.68bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
As part of the deal, Sanofi will sell its minority stake in Sterling Health
Europe, which sells over-the-counter products, back to Kodak.
Mr Jean-Francois Dehecq, chairman of Sanofi, which is a subsidiary of
Elf-Aquitaine, the recently privatised French oil group, said the move would
strengthen the company's presence in the pharmaceuticals industry,
particularly in the US. This was important for the sales and marketing of
products in Sanofi's pipeline, including Clopidogrel, an anti-thrombotic
drug, and Tiludronate, aimed at the prevention of osteoporosis. Following
the deal, Sanofi's annual pharmaceuticals sales will amount to more than
Dollars 3.2bn.
He said the acquisition would be financed by the sale of the group's
bio-activities businesses, one of the group's main business areas with
annual sales of about FFr7bn (Pounds 832m).
Mr Dehecq said the price paid represented a multiple of 1.4 times the sales
of the businesses acquired, which was lower than recent big acquisitions in
the pharmaceuticals industry.
Sanofi's earnings per share would be increased by between 10 and 15 per cent
next year as a result of the deal, he said.
The announcement follows Kodak's decision in May to sell its various
healthcare activities and focus on its core businesses. Sanofi, which had a
far-reaching alliance with Sterling Winthrop, said at the time it was
interested in acquiring a significant part.
Mr Dehecq said the acquisition of the Sterling Winthrop businesses would
also allow economies in the management and marketing structures of the group
and that research and development activities would be strengthened through
the deal.
Sanofi, which faced pressure from its parent company not to increase
borrowings or launch a capital increase, will finance the acquisition
through disposals, principally in its bio-activities division which includes
food additives, gelatine, and veterinary products. Disposals will also be
made in the cosmetics division, although Yves Saint Laurent and Yves Rocher
will not be on the slate.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Delors replacement top of Corfu agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CORFU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure intensified last night on European Union leaders to settle at their
Greek summit the divisive issue of who should replace Mr Jacques Delors as
European Commission president.
The 12 heads of government arrived in Corfu last night for the two-day
summit, where chances of breaking the deadlock are generally believed to be,
at best, even.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, appeared to retain a clear
lead over his main rival, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime
minister. But the UK and Italy have still not signalled an intention to back
either of them.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned on Wednesday that the German EU presidency
would call another summit next month if the 12 failed to agree on a
successor to Mr Delors during their time in Corfu.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, tried to be positive by
suggesting the leaders would 'do everything we can' to reach agreement: 'I
want to be optimistic. I think we will succeed,' he said.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, formally backs Sir Leon Brittan,
the EU trade commissioner, as an outside contender, but the UK prefers Mr
Lubbers to Mr Dehaene, who is being promoted by France and Germany.
On arriving, Mr Major said: 'It is important to get the right result.
Whether that will be here or not, I'm not sure.' He refused to comment on Mr
Dehaene's candidacy.
In the UK yesterday, Ladbrokes, the bookmaker, was quoting Mr Dehaene as 1-3
(on) favourite and Mr Lubbers at 7-2. Mr Brittan was trailing on 7-1 and Mr
Peter Sutherland, outgoing head of the Gatt world trade organisation, was
quoted at 8-1.
The Belgian and Dutch leaders, both Christian Democrats, agreed at a meeting
of EU Christian Democrat parties in Brussels on Wednesday that neither would
veto the other. Both are expected to leave a dinner tonight while their
colleagues remain to try to break the deadlock.
The Netherlands intends to push hard its claim to the top Brussels job,
according to Dutch officials, on the grounds that it is the only
founder-member of the Euro-club not to have held the Commission presidency.
It will also be argued that the Netherlands will shortly become the largest
net contributor to the EU budget on a per capita basis.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Patten's job at risk in the wake of apology for 'nutter'
slur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday faced Tory backbench calls
for his dismissal after he was faced with paying almost Pounds 100,000 in
settlement and costs for calling Professor Tim Brighouse, Birmingham's chief
education officer, a 'nutter'.
Many Conservative MPs privately urged the minister to resign before the
prime minister's forthcoming cabinet reshuffle, describing his remarks as
'deeply embarrassing' and lacking judgment.
While the Department for Education said Mr Patten had no intention of going
voluntarily, he is now expected to be a casualty of the ministerial
reshuffle.
Mr Patten must pay the legal costs and damages - which were not revealed but
were estimated by those close to Prof Brighouse at Pounds 100,000 - out of
his personal resources.
Neither the department nor the Conservative party will pay the damages, as
he made his original comments while speaking in a personal capacity. The
department said it did not know whether Mr Patten had any insurance to help
meet the claim. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, described the
incident as 'a private matter'.
The remarks came in a fringe meeting at last year's Conservative party
conference. In answer to questions from the floor, Mr Patten described Mr
Brighouse as a nutter and a madman who threatened to cause damage to
education in Birmingham as he already had in Oxfordshire.
Mr Patten was yesterday left with few friends in the Commons. An officer of
the 1922 committee summed up the mood of many Conservative MPs when he
described the incident 'as the final nail in Mr Patten's coffin'. He added:
'He should go now; but if he does not the Whips have been told in no
uncertain terms that he has lost all support from the backbenchers.'
The apology is unreserved, and with few, if any, recent precedents for a
secretary of state. The statement read in court said: 'Mr Patten now
recognises that his remarks were false and without any justification
whatsoever', and that he recognised Mr Brighouse's competence, integrity and
dedication.

<TEXT>
AT&amp;T's international alliance has caused disarray in Cable &amp; Wireless's
ranks. Mercury Communications, C&amp;W's UK subsidiary, was almost sucked into
AT&amp;T's Worldsource grouping. Hongkong Telecom, a 57.5 per cent owned
subsidiary, may yet join. All this puts a big question mark over C&amp;W's
strategy of maintaining its independence from the three big telecoms
alliances formed in recent months. Its own plan is to form a 'federation' by
knitting together its multitude of stakes in telecoms operators scattered
across the globe.
The snag is not simply that members of the federation are doubtful of its
value. Investors attribute no value to it either. C&amp;W is viewed like an
investment trust, with the group's market Pounds 9.3bn capitalisation
roughly Pounds 2bn less than the sum of its parts.
There are several ways C&amp;W could realise greater value. One would be to
demerge C&amp;W into its constituent parts. Another would be to beef up the
federation so that it becomes a serious fourth alliance. It is hard to see
how this can be done without a more substantial presence in the US
long-distance market. There is not much left to buy and C&amp;W could end up
paying over the odds. Much wiser would be to do what Sprint and MCI have
done and sell a minority share of itself to a foreign sugar daddy at a
handsome premium. AT&amp;T still looks the best candidate. But if the Baby Bells
are freed to enter the US long-distance market as expected, they could play
that role too.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface, TSB looks a picture of health. First-half profits are up
nearly threefold, net return on capital is 15.5 per cent and the tier 1
capital ratio is 9.1 per cent. The awkward thing is that recent growth has
occurred in peripheral businesses which are supposed to be winding down.
Thus both the bad loan administration unit and Mortgage Express extended the
recovery manifest in the second half of last year. Operating profit before
bad debts in retail banking and insurance fell 5 per cent. That,
unfortunately, is precisely the area on which TSB's longer term ambitions
are focused.
Nor is the outlook encouraging. The process of shifting customers into
higher yielding deposits, which has been a drag on TSB's funding costs, may
soon have run its course. But margin pressure looks set to intensify in the
mortgage market. Life assurance and pensions premium income is dropping and
conditions will become even tougher when commission disclosure is required
next year. No wonder TSB is still talking about buying a building society.
Acquisition looks the only plausible route to growth.
As long as Lloyds Bank cannot even make a friendly offer for a building
society work, though, there seems little chance of TSB pulling off a
significant deal. With its tier 1 capital ratio heading over 10 per cent as
bad debt provisions drop further, it may soon have to start considering
alternatives like a scheme to buy back its own shares. Otherwise competition
may quickly erode its handsome returns.

<TEXT>
It is to be hoped that the glitterati who adorn the Hollinger and Telegraph
boards can muster sufficient resolve to demand some straight answers from
their chairman. Hollinger's sale of 12.5m Telegraph shares in May appears
remarkably prescient considering the newspaper's later decision to shred its
cover price. That news knocked 35 per cent off the Telegraph's shares
yesterday. Those investors who bought the Hollinger shares are apoplectic.
The stock exchange is right to investigate the background. Goldman Sachs and
Cazenove, which facilitated the share placing, must also be musing whether
the fees earned are worth the bad feeling that now surrounds their names.
The Telegraph insists the decision to cut the cover price was taken after
the share sale. It can also argue that none are as blind as those who do not
want to see. The market should have expected some aggression when the
Telegraph's circulation dropped below 1m in May. Mr Black made it plain at
Hollinger's annual meeting - albeit, after the share sale - that 'remedial
action' would be taken if the Telegraph's market supremacy were threatened.
Bruised Telegraph shareholders will be little comforted by such arguments.
The Times' vicious response to the Telegraph's move suggests that Mr Rupert
Murdoch has a higher pain threshold than Mr Black. The newspaper industry
will shudder at the thought that wars are much easier to start than they are
to end.

FT  24 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Securing Goode returns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's pensions white paper strikes a sensible balance between the
security of occupational pensions and the cost to industry of providing
them. The minimum solvency test will probably lead to some shift of pension
fund assets from UK and overseas equities into gilts. If lower investment
returns result, companies will end up contributing more to their schemes
over time. Companies also have to consider the potential cost of falling
foul of the solvency test, since employers will be obliged to make up the
shortfall within three months of the threshold being breached.
But that should not cause companies to walk away from occupational schemes.
The government has defended the right of employers to claw back pension fund
surpluses where schemes are over-funded. The solvency test proposed is far
less stringent than the original Goode Committee proposal. Due to nifty
footwork by the actuarial profession, there is no reason to expect a
stampede out of equities and into gilts.
Some fund managers will doubtless argue that schemes should be entirely free
to pursue high-growth investment strategies in the interests of both members
and employers. There is nothing in yesterday's proposals to stop younger,
wealthier schemes from doing just that. But less well-endowed schemes cannot
afford to take such investment risks. Heavy weightings towards UK and
overseas equities are not always consistent with the degree of certainty
sought by scheme members. If the balance can be righted in these cases
without causing turbulence in financial markets - or driving companies away
from occupational schemes - the white paper will have done its job.

FT  24 JUN 94 / London and Dublin close to framework Ulster deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CORFU, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds were on course last night to agree the
framework for a comprehensive political settlement in Northern Ireland by
mid-July .
As the British and Irish prime ministers prepared for bilateral talks at the
European Union summit in Corfu, senior Whitehall officials voiced confidence
that they could clear the remaining roadblocks to the agreement before next
month's Anglo-Irish summit.
There are continuing differences over repeal of Dublin's constitutional
claim to Ulster and over the shape and authority of proposed joint boards to
enhance cross-border co-operation.
However the officials said Mr Major was determined to find a formula to
bridge the remaining differences over the 'constitutional balance' of the
accord. The escalation of sectarian violence in the province - underlined by
last week's murder of six Catholic men in their local bar  - has added
further impetus to the search for an accord.
Once agreed, the framework document - covering relations between London and
Dublin, cross-border co-operation and outline plans for a new assembly in
Northern Ireland - will be presented as the basis for renewed talks between
the constitutional parties.
It is understood that Britain has rejected any suggestion that new
north-south institutions could imply 'joint authority' over the province.
The Ulster Unionists, whose co-operation is a prerequisite to an eventual
settlement, are determined that the Dublin government is not given
constitutional authority in the administration of Ulster.
But Mr Major is prepared to see cross-border executive boards to oversee a
common approach in areas such as transport, energy, agriculture and tourism.
The creation of such boards - whose powers would be decided in consultation
with the constitutional parties - would acknowledge the two governments had
a 'shared interest' in the economic development of the province.
The Irish foreign ministry wishes the boards to have 'executive powers',
embracing the main areas of mutual economic concern to the two parts of the
island.
For his part, Mr Reynolds is arguing that a commitment by the Dublin
government to amend or repeal articles two and three of the Irish
constitution - which encapsulate the republic's territorial claim to
Northern Ireland - must be contingent on an overall political settlement
acceptable to nationalists as well as unionists in Ulster.

Talk about public relations coups. David Wynne-Morgan, 63, first got into PR
by writing a flattering piece about the late J Paul Getty. The oil tycoon
was so impressed that he underwrote Wynne-Morgan's move into the game,
becoming his first client at 5 guineas an hour. Claus von Bulow later
inherited the Getty account.
Now Morgan has handed in his notice as boss of Hill &amp; Knowlton in Europe. He
plans ending his career by polishing the image of his favourite client,
Peter Munk, the Canadian entrepreneur whose interests include North
America's biggest gold mine, Clark Oil, and Berlin property.
All a bit of a come-down for one of London's veteran flacks? Not likely.
Morgan gets a seat on the board of Horsham - Munk's master company - a
handsome wage and Dollars 1.3m in share options. All for working 12 days a
month for Munk; no doubt a well-earned rest.

Football and politics, a heady cocktail, particularly for Cameroonians.
Cameroon's team is once more threatening to strike if it's not paid some
bonuses before its next World Cup fixture.
The team played similar tactics before its last qualifying match against
Zimbabwe, in October 1993. Then, Cameroon needed a win to guarantee a berth
in the final.
Oddly enough, for such a football-obsessed nation, many fans actually hoped
for a bad result. The reason? Opposition parties had called a general strike
for the following day against the unpopular government of president Paul
Biya. They dreaded the regime calling a public holiday if the Indomitable
Lions won their match.
Nevertheless, Cameroon qualified, a holiday was duly declared, the strike
threat was defused - and Biya survived. Who knows what the outcome this time
round might be - for soccer or politico stars.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After almost 20 years in the diplomatic wilderness, South Africa, the UN's
prodigal child, yesterday returned to the General Assembly - with full
voting rights.
The big question is: will it eventually make good its backlog of outstanding
dues, accumulating since being booted out in November 1974? The debt - about
Dollars 100m - would ordinarily deny South Africa the right to vote. But
with the country now diplomatic flavour of the month, no one at the UN seems
prepared to quibble over a few measly millions.
Instead, an emotional outburst greeted Pretoria's diplomats, several of whom
were snubbed in the UN only months ago. The moment was especially sweet for
Jim Steward, South Africa's current UN ambassador. He was once part of a
delegation ejected - on a credentials challenge - by Abdelaziz Bouteflika of
Algeria, assembly president at the time.
Bouteflika has himself since fallen from grace, following accusations of
mishandling public funds when foreign minister.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Personal View: Dilemma over charges lies downstream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID KINNERSLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In just four weeks, the UK water industry regulator, Ofwat, will reveal its
decision on allowed price increases for individual water companies. The
publicity surrounding current price negotiations for the 31 water utilities
of England and Wales has overshadowed a far more important issue which
customers and companies should be addressing - the basis on which charges
are actually calculated.
The main preoccupation so far has been with the 'K factors' - the rate above
inflation by which water companies will be allowed to increase water and
sewerage charges over the next five to 10 years. As the increases are to be
applied annually, more than 300 figures will be published by Ofwat in one
day.
The K factors are regarded as important primarily for company planners and
City analysts, who try to make forecasts for future profits of the
individual companies.
Yet the basis of calculation is equally significant, and has not been
consistently addressed.
Water companies have long depended on the old rating system as a
second-hand, low-cost way of fixing water bills for 18m households. However,
time is running out. The former UK prime minister, the then Mrs Margaret
Thatcher, was determined to replace the old rates system - which based water
bills on property values - with the poll tax. As part of the poll tax
programme, her government in 1988 passed a law making it illegal to base
water bills on any system derived from old rateable values after the year
2000. This means that water companies have just five more years to come up
with new ways of charging customers.
The privatised companies have been reluctant to face such troublesome
changes or to give up such an easy way of getting much of their income. Less
than 10 per cent of bills have been put on any new basis so far. Some 16m
households must be reviewed in the next five years.
The debate over what is the best method to calculate charges rages, even as
the price increases are being set.
A few companies see metering as the way forward, but want to stretch out the
change, and fear the heavy cost. Some who favour metering also argue that it
could penalise those who can least afford price increases  - for example,
large families in small houses, versus small families in large houses.
Others still hope to climb aboard the council tax system, much as they rode
on the back of the rates system. But council tax is riddled with rebates and
exemptions, which companies will not want to concede. The water industry
will not be allowed to pick the parts of the system that suit it.
The oddest idea being considered is a flat-rate licence fee in some areas,
bringing large increases or reductions in bills, still quite unrelated to
usage.
The essence of a utility is that it should be paid according to the volume
of its service to customers. This is in line with the National Rivers
Authority's insistence that water resources need to be conserved in some
parts of England, and new charging methods could and should promote that.
Meanwhile, the main focus is likely to remain on the more immediately
understandable K factor discussions. These are not as simple as they first
appear. The procedures have several faults. Most importantly, customers have
little idea of what goes into the pricing decisions: for example, how much
of the price increases are to finance future investment and so forth. There
is also no certainty over the rate of price increase - even with the K
factor - since nobody can accurately predict inflation.
Perhaps a greater fault is that this procedure over-dramatises the work of
Ofwat. Companies are already paying too much attention to its heavyweight
style of regulation. This could further isolate customers, who still worry
about water quality, dirty rivers and polluted beaches, as well as about
future water bills.
Neither the water company managements nor City analysts should make too much
of Ofwat's July decisions. Their worry should be that, as the companies
invest in providing better services, they have yet to settle a long-term way
of calculating bills and gathering money from domestic customers. They have
only five years to solve this problem and, more important, to explain their
solution to the customers.
The author is a former research fellow of Nuffield College Oxford and one of
several advisers to Mr Nicholas Ridley, secretary of state at the time of
water privatisation. His book 'Coming Clean' will be published by Penguin in
July

<TEXT>
Glendower: 'I can call spirits from the vasty deep.'
Hotspur: 'Why, so can I, or so can any man. But will they come when you do
call for them?'
Put Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, in the role of Glendower in
Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part One, and transform the majority of the
industrial world's central banks into a collective Hotspur, and you have a
rough idea of where the US stands in its efforts to rally support for the
dollar.
On Wednesday, Mr Bentsen resorted to the first line of defence of any US
administration when faced with an unwelcome fall in the value of its
currency: he tried to talk the dollar up by emphasising the fundamental
strengths of America's low-inflation, investment-led recovery.
By referring in addition to the US's partners in the Group of Seven leading
industrialised countries, the Treasury secretary also tried to give the
impression that international support for the embattled US currency was
close at hand.
But his declaration that 'we continue to be in close communication with our
G7 partners, and we continue to be prepared to act as appropriate,' was more
a statement of hope than a sign that the G7 leading industrial countries
were ready to rally to the dollar's defence.
True, the Bank of Japan was again seen buying dollars in Tokyo after Mr
Bentsen's remarks. But as trading in Europe drew to a close yesterday there
was no sign of either the European monetary authorities or the US Federal
Reserve Board stepping in to support the dollar.
In the mid to late 1980s, when currency manipulation by governments was all
the rage, central banks seemed happy to defend each others' currencies at
the drop of a hat. Nowadays, however, concerted intervention is a rare event
and happens only on those occasions when there is a genuine identity of
interests among the big industrial countries.
Although this week saw the US currency fall briefly through the
psychologically-important Y100 level, it appears that no such identity of
interests exists over the dollar. The financial markets sense this lack of
consensus. And although Mr Bentsen's words, backed by upbeat assessments of
the US economy from President Bill Clinton and Mr Alan Greenspan, the US
Federal Reserve Board chairman, sufficed yesterday to keep the dollar above
Y100 in European trading, traders and analysts argue that it is only a
matter of time before the authorities are again put to the test.
'Round one is over. But round two is still to come,' says Mr Neil MacKinnon,
Citibank's chief currency strategist in London.
The indecision of the central banks reflects doubts over whether
intervention could substantially affect the dollar's value in present market
conditions and a wider uncertainty about whether the US currency's present
weakness against the yen in particular represents a global problem.
At the beginning of May, by contrast, when the dollar fell close to Y100, up
to 17 central banks stepped into the market to buy the currency. Notable
features of that intervention were the participation of the Bundesbank and
the purchase of dollars, not just for yen at Y101.2, but also for D-Marks at
DM1.6570. This week, although the dollar briefly dipped below the Y100
level, only the Bank of Japan has been supporting it.
Seven weeks ago, the air was thick with dire warnings that a fall of the
dollar through Y100 would precipitate a free fall to Y95, Y90 or even Y80.
In the trading session on Tuesday, when the greenback fell through Y100, it
managed to scramble back up above this 'big number' of its own accord.
The dollar's ability to keep its head above water may partly reflect a
strengthening of economic fundamentals. Since the beginning of May, German
interest rates have fallen while the key US discount and federal fund rates
have been raised by half a percentage point.
The effect of losses among the lightly regulated hedge funds and the
proprietary trading desks of investment banks may also be giving the dollar
a respite. According to one senior analyst in London, speculative investors
could have lost as much as Dollars 60bn of capital in this year's turbulent
financial markets, reducing their scope to speculate by an estimated Dollars
600bn.
The non-appearance of concerted intervention could also reflect changed
circumstances in Germany and a perception among market operators that
current market conditions are unsuited to such action.
The outlook for economic recovery in Germany has improved considerably since
the beginning of May, when the Bundesbank stepped in to prevent the dollar's
fall from undermining German exports. Although Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the
Bundesbank president, said yesterday that he favoured currency stability 'in
principle', a somewhat weaker dollar could even be to Germany's advantage at
present, because it would hold down the prices of imported goods and offset
recent price rises for commodities including oil. On the other hand,
intervention by the Bundesbank to support the dollar could increase
inflationary pressures by boosting Germany's already rapidly growing money
supply.
The technical state of the foreign exchange market is also thought to be
restricting the enthusiasm of European central banks for foreign exchange
market intervention.
Intervention to support a currency such as the dollar works best when
speculators have 'shorted' it by selling currency that they do not have in
the hope of buying it more cheaply when they have to settle orders at a
later time. Intervention in these circumstances can force speculators to buy
the currency to cover their positions, resulting in heavy losses.
According to foreign exchange market analysts, the market is not short of
dollars at present. As a result, intervention would have to be on a large
scale and concerted among many central banks, and would still run the risk
of being ineffective.
There is little doubt that European banks would act, despite the risks, if
they felt their interests threatened. But viewed from Europe, the sinking
dollar is more clearly a problem for the US and Japan - so far.
In Japan, a falling dollar threatens the country's exports. A drop in the
dollar could spell trouble for the US if translated into further weakness
and rising interest rates on the US bond market.
But whereas Japan, as shown by central bank intervention, is clearly taking
its predicament seriously, policymakers in America's G7 partners are
uncertain about the true depth of Washington's concern about the dollar.
Reflecting these doubts, Mr Hideaki Kumano, a vice minister at Japan's
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), yesterday said 'the US
itself should defend the dollar'.
The US Federal Reserve is thought to have bought dollars on behalf the Bank
of Japan in recent days. But there has been no sign of it supporting the
dollar on its own account.
Indeed to some observers, the involvement of President Clinton in talking up
the dollar and Treasury secretary Bentsen's statement of Wednesday smacked
of a short-term reaction to domestic US headlines about Tuesday's fall in
the dollar to a post-second world war low against the yen.
Scepticism about the US stance was not eased by suggestions that the US
Treasury had been irritated by President Clinton's announcement that it
would be making a statement on Wednesday. The idea that Mr Bentsen had been
bounced into premature comment was given some support by the low key
references to the G7 in his terse two-paragraph statement. His remarks were
widely interpreted as a sign that the US had at that point failed to win
over its partners to a policy of dollar support.
Such perceptions could bode ill for the stability of the dollar in the days
and weeks ahead. Speculation often builds up ahead of big set-piece
international events such as the economic summit of G7 leaders to be held in
Naples between July 8 and 10, while the unresolved trade dispute between the
US and Japan could easily foment another bout of market turmoil.
Although the central banks have so far been absent as a concerted force in
this week's dollar trading, it is a fair bet that the US will be trying to
secure an agreement on concerted intervention should this prove necessary.
But to win the support of its trading partners for such a move, the US
administration will have to demonstrate that it is prepared to act in
defence of its own currency.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The main issue facing the EU summit in Corfu today is the choice of the next
president of the Commission. It is an important choice, even if the
successful candidate is unlikely to play the strategic role that Jacques
Delors did in the last 10 years. The Commission retains the sole right to
initiate EU legislation. It also has the task of articulating the common
interest of the Union as a whole - a role which may be more important rather
than less if the political initiative has now passed, as many believe, to
national leaders. Within the Commission, that role will fall especially to
the president, who this time has also been promised a say in the choice of
his colleagues.
Choosing the next president is a particularly invidious task for the
European Council, since two of its own number are declared candidates - an
unprecedented circumstance which shows how much Mr Delors' long tenure has
raised the post's prestige. It seems unlikely that the council will be able
to agree. The Greek prime minister, in the chair, is too isolated to act as
an effective broker; and the German chancellor, though now clearly the
effective leader of the Union, may have overplayed his hand in letting his
support for Jean-Luc Dehaene become known in advance. To the positive
sympathy enjoyed in some capitals by Ruud Lubbers is thus added a negative
desire in others to resist the Franco-German steamroller.
So deadlock is quite possible. It may also be desirable. Its effect would be
to throw the choice forward into the German presidency, which starts next
week, obliging Mr Kohl to act as chairman rather than champion.
Worthwhile delay
He has said he would call an emergency summit at once, but he should think
again. Too long a delay would indeed be damaging, given the need for the new
president to help choose his colleagues, and for the whole team to secure
parliamentary approval, before taking office in January. But a delay until
early autumn would be well worthwhile if it were used to make a break with
the current mode of selection and open the process to public scrutiny.
Existing procedures are little short of scandalous. Governments apparently
believe that this important post can best be filled at a private
horse-trading session among 12 individuals. In so far as they have allowed
the public to know anything at all about their motives, it seems that the
nationality of each candidate counts for much more than his personal merits
or opinions, even though once chosen he would be expected to forswear all
national favouritism. Even more demeaningly, the top executive posts in
other international organisations, including some which are far from being
in the EU's gift, have been bandied around as bargaining chips, or as
consolation prizes for nations which lose out in this unseemly contest.
Radical ideas
If they were really concerned about the 'democratic deficit', European
leaders should allow the president to be elected either by the parliament or
directly by the citizens of the Union. But such radical ideas would require
treaty revision, and will have to wait at least until 1996.
For now, the council should announce its intention of reconvening to make a
final choice in, say, late September. It should invite candidates - those
already declared and any others who wish to be considered - to submit formal
applications by mid-July. These applications should be made public, and
should include a statement of the candidate's views on the future of the
Union, on the role of the Commission and its president, and on the way in
which he, or she, would propose to fill that role. They should be the
subject of debate in the European Parliament, in national parliaments and
elsewhere.
The council should also agree on a voting procedure, which might include an
undertaking by all its members to accept the decision of a qualified
majority, if unanimity is not achieved on the first one or two ballots; and
all of them should promise to make their vote public along with the reasons
for it.
If the EU's leaders are not prepared to take it even that far in a
democratic direction, they should not feign surprise at the growing
Euroscepticism, or downright Euro-hostility, of their electorates.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Laying the ghost of Mr Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A crucial test of the government's proposals for reforming the UK pensions
industry is whether they offer adequate protection against crooks like the
late Robert Maxwell. Confidence in the security of occupational pensions was
badly shaken by the monstrous theft he perpetrated against pension scheme
members in his business empire. Establishing a coherent regulatory framework
for pensions is essential in a world in which private pension provision is
becoming increasingly important in sustaining living standards in old age.
There is, of course, no foolproof protection against the predations of a
determined fraudster. Even trustees representing the interests of members
can be intimidated into silence, as Mr Maxwell proved. Yet by largely
endorsing the recommendations in the report of the Goode committee on
pension law reform, the government has shown itself determined to move
towards a comprehensive and statutory form of regulation that will create a
succession of obstacles to fraud.
In the front line of defence will be the members, who will be given better
access to information on their schemes. They will also have the right to
select a third of the trustees - a long-overdue provision for those on whose
behalf pension funds exist. The role of trustees is to be strengthened by
clarifying their responsibilities and duties. Professional advisers are to
be told that they are accountable to the trustees, not the employer. The
solvency requirements provide a further line of defence, with a full
valuation required if the annual solvency report reveals an unexpected
deficiency. An independent regulator will be appointed with powers to
investigate and enforce schemes' compliance with their statutory
obligations.
Compensation scheme
Finally, a compensation scheme is to be established that will pay out if a
fraudster succeeds in jumping all these hurdles. The scheme, funded by an
industry levy, should avoid the heartbreaking uncertainties experienced by
many Maxwell pensioners over their income in retirement.
If there is any doubt over the government's plans, it lies in the reactive
nature of the proposed regulatory framework. Scheme members will be entitled
to request annual reports and accounts, but will not automatically receive
them. Trustees will have to prepare an annual report but not file it with
the regulator where it could be open for public inspection. The regulator
will wait for whistle-blowers to raise the alarm rather than analyse scheme
reports.
Proactive approach
In most cases, this is less than what was recommended by the Goode report,
which rightly favoured a more proactive approach. The committee wanted
schemes to send annual reports to members in the same way as companies do to
shareholders. It also proposed that schemes should make annual returns to
the regulator that would have provided warning of potential problems.
Indeed, the regulator could use such returns to identify at-risk schemes and
initiate investigations in the same way as charity regulators and tax
inspectors do.
On one matter, however, the government was right to water down the Goode
report's proposal - on the definition of minimum solvency requirements.
Members need a simple indicator to judge whether their scheme has the
resources to redeem the pension promises it has made to them. The government
has opted for the compromise proposed by the actuarial profession which
values liabilities on a mixture of equity-type returns and gilts-based
returns according to the age profile of scheme members. This allows for a
more diversified investment portfolio than implied in Goode.
All in all, this is a white paper which strikes the right note, though with
inadequate conviction. The government would also be wrong to think that it
can now relax about the subject of pensions. Changing employment patterns,
changing capital markets and changing consumer preferences all suggest that
the defined benefit occupational pension scheme is in decline. Creating a
sound framework for personal pension schemes, given the recent record of
mis-selling, remains a large and important task.

FT  24 JUN 94 / For what we are about to receive: Andrew Jack on tensions
over the role of investigating accountants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Power without accountability' is a phrase that crops up regularly when the
owner of a textile company in north London talks about his bank, the
accountants it hired, and his business's fall into receivership.
Two years ago he lost his largest customer. Under pressure from the bank, he
agreed to pay Pounds 18,000 to a large firm of accountants to write a report
assessing the viability of the business. All sides agreed that the company
should continue trading and that the position should be reassessed after six
months, during which time the accountant was paid more than Pounds 3,000 a
week to monitor the company's financial health.
Six months later, the overdraft had been reduced to within a few thousand
pounds of the owner's forecast. But repeated restructuring proposals from
him and his independent auditors were rejected by the bank and the
accountants. Instead, the bank appointed the accountants as receivers and
closed the business down.
Underlying the story - and others like it - is an issue that concerns many
directors and a number of financiers and accountants: should accountants
hired by bankers to investigate a financially troubled company be appointed
as receivers?
The debate concerns a potential conflict of interest. The accountant may
have a financial incentive to slant the advice given to the bank to suggest
a company cannot be salvaged under existing management. By recommending that
receivers be appointed, it stands a high chance of winning the work itself
and generating extra fees.
Those most affected - company directors - are generally unwilling to be
identified: often a company's bank loans are secured against their personal
assets even after the companies have collapsed.
One exception is Mr John Jackson, chairman of Brown &amp; Jackson, owner of the
loss-making Poundstretcher retail chain recently rescued by the South
African retailing group, Pepkor. He calls the practice 'objectionable' and
has demanded an inquiry by the Bank of England and the accountancy bodies.
Some smaller accountancy firms are sympathetic to his viewpoint. 'How can a
firm be seen to be objective when reporting to a bank on whether a business
is a going concern if a negative report will provide that firm with
insolvency business?' asks Mr Michael Snyder, senior partner at accountants
Kingston Smith.
He says his firm does not conduct any insolvency work because he believes it
does not 'sit happily' with its work as investigating accountants. 'What is
required is a wholly independent review. The investigators appointed (from
large firms) are most likely to be insolvency experts with the prospect of a
future receivership in their minds.'
These charges are vigorously rejected by those from the larger firms
involved in conducting investigations, which win most of the work from the
banks. Mr Allan Griffiths, a partner with Grant Thornton and vice-president
of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, the leading trade body, says:
'It's a bit hard to stomach people doubting my professional integrity. I get
my enjoyment from saving companies, not closing them down.'
He argues that most of the companies he is asked to investigate emerge
intact with existing management, and with creditors none the wiser.
Moreover, he says, finding a second accountancy firm to act if the first
firm calls for the appointment of a receiver would add to costs, because the
new firm would have to learn about the company. In the meantime, as word
leaked out, the value of the assets to be sold might also be substantially
reduced.
Similar arguments are made by many banks. Mr Brian Clare, head of Midland
Bank's loan management division, says: 'The argument is perceived rather
than real. If banks have a weakness, it is allowing companies without a
future to carry on and throwing good money after bad. I would never accept a
recommendation to appoint a receiver if there was any better alternative.'
Weighing up the merits of each side of the argument is difficult, because
the circumstances surrounding a receivership are rarely clear cut. Company
directors often have a vested interest in slanting their story to conceal
their own poor management, while bankers and insolvency practitioners are
precluded on ethical grounds from breaking confidentiality to tell their
side of the story.
Banks remain split on the issue. But an indication that there is a potential
conflict of interest is shown by the decision of the Royal Bank of Scotland
to reorganise the way in which it handled companies in distress over the
past two years. It introduced a policy banning the investigating accountants
it appoints from becoming receivers, except in exceptional circumstances.
Mr Derek Sach, director of specialised lending services at the bank, says:
'If customers perceive that investigating accountants will become receivers,
they are unco-operative and resist intervention by the bank.'
In the past two years, Mr Sach has reduced the number of people authorised
to approve receivership from 300 to effectively three. Companies in distress
are all handed to his specialist team. He says the result has been to reduce
the number of receivers appointed by the Royal Bank by more than its
competitors - even taking into account that the number of business failures
in the UK has also dropped during the period.
But the Royal Bank's move is unique. The last time the accountancy
profession's joint ethics committee studied the issue of investigating
accountants acting as receivers was two years ago. It decided to take no
further action, although 30 per cent of those asked believed that there was
an actual and not just a perceived conflict of interest.
Mr Jackson thinks it is time for the accountancy profession and the Bank of
England to examine some cases of business failure in detail to decide
whether there is a case for stronger regulation.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Argument on economic targets is back
to front
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor STANLEY FISCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his column, 'Beware Ivy League central bankers' (June 13), Sir
Samuel Brittan criticises the dependence of central bankers on academic
economists 'of the mainstream US Ivy League variety'. As an example of the
errors of Ivy League thinking, he cites the argument in a paper I presented
at the Bank of England's tercentenary conference, that an inflation target
is preferable to a price level target. He exhorted readers and central
bankers to treat mainstream economics sceptically.
Sir Samuel is right that mainstream economics should be treated with a large
dose of scepticism, almost as big a dose as is required for the arguments of
economics columnists. And since MIT is not in the Ivy League, I could be
persuaded of his views on Ivy League economists if his other arguments made
sense.
Unfortunately, though, Sir Samuel's column reveals a serious
misunderstanding of the issues about which he wrote. To simplify the
discussion, suppose that a central bank faces the choice between aiming for
a constant price level, or a zero inflation rate.
At first glance, these targets seem to be the same. The difference between
them is that a central bank with a price level target tries to make up for
past failures to hit the target. Thus, if an inflationary shock in a given
period raises prices above the target level, the central bank has to aim to
reduce prices to get back to the target level. Or if a favourable price
shock reduces prices in such a period, the central bank has to compensate by
producing inflation in some future period. With a zero inflation target, the
central bank lets bygones be bygones, and aims to keep the price level
constant at today's level.
Thus Sir Samuel gets it precisely backwards when he characterises a price
stability regime as one in which prices are as likely to fall as rise, with
the best bet being that prices in the distant future will be the same as
they are today. That is true with a zero inflation target. It is not true
with a price level target: under that regime, when the price level is below
target, the future price level is most likely to be above today's level, and
vice versa.
I discuss the choice between the two approaches in more detail in my paper.
The choice of a price level target brings the benefit of greater certainty
about the price level in the long run at the cost of greater variability of
inflation in the short run. The greater inflation variability under a price
level target results from the fact that every shock to inflation has to be
followed by an offsetting change in the price level in the opposite
direction.
I argue for the inflation rate target because I fear the consequences of
having to aim to deflate the economy half the time, which is what the price
level approach requires. Sir Samuel grandly dismisses this concern by
describing my fear of deflation as extreme. This is armchair theorising of
the worst sort. All economists know that it is theoretically possible to
reduce prices through a pre-announced monetary policy, at no cost in terms
of output. But that has not been done successfully in the post-second world
war period; rather deflations and disinflations produce recessions. That has
been so even for the most credible central bank, the Bundesbank, as the
experience of the last few years confirms. That basic fact underlies my
reluctance to advocate a policy that requires periods of negative inflation
 -even though I recognise the theoretical possibility that eventually,
perhaps, people will be willing to accept nominal wage cuts rather than
fight them as they do now.
Lest all this sound academic, consider the example of Germany. The
Bundesbank has a target inflation rate of 2 per cent. Over the past four
years, German inflation has averaged 4 per cent, implying that German prices
have risen by 8 per cent more than targeted during that period. The
Bundesbank fought the inflation with tight money, and now, at the cost of
recession, German inflation is close to its target range. That is regarded
as a success; it is that success that permits Europe to begin growing again.
But under Sir Samuel's prescription, the Bundesbank would be only half done:
it would still have to reduce the price level by an extra 8 per cent. That
would be deflationary overkill, causing social costs to little positive
purpose.
Sir Samuel's argument does not make sense.

   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Lilley is one of the government's thinkers. Some of his dark-er
thoughts should never have been uttered. They constitute xenophobia at
worst, demagoguery at best. We will not dwell on this today. His lecture on
Monday was free of the tiresome infelicities that sometimes mar his platform
oratory. The transcript I have is fit for decent discourse. That is just as
well. The secretary for social security was addressing a diocesan
conference. His topic was 'the importance of the family'. The sentiments he
expressed were moderate, if a trifle wistful. The family, he concluded,
'will survive even the social revolution of our time'.
Will it? In England and Wales, births outside marriage constituted 14.4 per
cent of all infants born in 1982. The proportion rose to 31.2 per cent in
1992, according to official statistics published on Wednesday. That is lower
than you or I might have guessed. Another wrinkle is that it is not
necessarily teenagers who are becoming parents, unmarried or otherwise.
Their fertility rate, expressed as the number of births per thousand women
under 20, is higher than in 1982, but lower than in 1990. The same is true
for women of all ages, but more so for the young. In 1992 the fertility rate
for women in their early 30s exceeded that for their sisters in their early
20s for the first time. Against that, the younger the mother the less likely
she is to be married when she gives birth.
The effect of this trend, plus the growth in divorce, is that some 2m
children are being brought up by a lone parent, nearly always the mother. Mr
Lilley would like these children to have fathers present in the home. So
would I. So would most of the mothers, we must suppose, although that is
less certain. The absent father has been the subject of much social
research. My desk is littered with reports on the subject. Some, though not
all, conclude that two parents are nearly always better than one. Some argue
that one good parent can be better than two bad ones. Poor parenting, it is
universally suggested, produces criminals and delinquents. Most of them, the
crime statistics indicate, are young men aged between 15 and 25. This is not
a fresh observation. When I was 19, I was arrested for trying to break into
a Hatton Garden jewellery shop with a crowbar. Fortunately I had a good
story, which convinced the court. That ended that particular phase of my
career.
Mr David Willetts, one of the pamphleteers, suggests that today's
15-to-25-year-olds 'are the ones who are getting the unmarried women
pregnant and whom the women - often understandably - have no desire to
marry'. In this he concurs, sort of, with Ms Sue Slipman, director of the
National Council for One Parent Families. She alludes to young men who roam
the streets being a public nuisance, condemned forever to be 'lads'. Those
who would reassert the authority of such men in the family, she said in a
recent speech, 'entirely fail to explain why any woman in her right mind
would take one home with her'.
Ms Slipman offers several reasons why more women are having children outside
a stable partnership. One is the increase in female ambition. Women want
careers as well as homes. Another is the disappearance of heavy industries
that formerly employed unskilled young men at wages that enabled them to
support a wife and family. Today's mothers are obliged to work because
fathers are unemployed or earning too little to pay the bills. This has
produced a 'crisis of identity and role for younger men'. The lads can no
longer exert the power of the pay packet over their mates and offspring.
'They appear to have gone to the other extreme of taking no responsibility
for parenting,' she says.
Mr Lilley wishes this was not so. He sees the family as the basic building
block of society, a bastion of freedom against the power of the state, the
principal channel through which culture, language, religion and values are
transmitted to succeeding generations. Yet he confesses that politicians
have very little power to strengthen the institution. 'The idea that
government could impose family values by edict or exhortation is impractical
and authoritarian,' he said on Monday. He wants the churches to try harder.
No wonder he is said to be in the ministerial firing line. He is talking
sense at last.
According to Mr Lilley, governments can contrive to ensure that their
actions do not discourage the maintenance of stable families. This should
not mean cutting social payments to single parents. Between 1979 and 1992,
he conceded, the real increase in benefits to lone mothers was 13 per cent,
against 18 per cent for couples and 40 per cent in average take-home pay. So
much for the myth that having a baby on your own pays better than marriage.
The government is reviewing the rules for providing housing to homeless
single parents, doubtless with adverse consequences for the latter. It is
also persevering with the Child Support Agency, bravely maintaining the
principle that fathers should accept financial responsibility for their
children. Quite right too.
Ms Slipman would like better sex education, something from which the
government shrinks. Its third-rate ministers pretend to find straight advice
distasteful and argue, absurdly, that information about contraception
encourages young people to sleep with one another. No. The advertising and
entertainment industries do that, in floods. Teachers can only add a drop.
She also wants benefits restructured, more childcare provision, and an
acknowledgement that single mothers who work part time are needed at home by
adolescents as much as toddlers.
Such ideas are the small change of today's politics, on both sides of the
Atlantic. Education and training, which the Conservatives say they are
providing and the opposition parties promise more of, may ease the pain, if
we can wait. Other proposals float about, including a return to national
service for school-leavers, and German-style apprenticeship schemes. Take
your pick. We must learn to adjust our ideas and economies to the entry of
most women into the workforce, and the simultaneous exit of so many young
men. Getting that huge social restructuring right is the only serious family
policy. The rest is wishful thinking, nervous tics as we conjure up fearful
pictures of rootless young thugs bearing down on us.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Disastrous results if UN force were
to be sent to Burundi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your perceptive leader 'Guilt trip to Rwanda' (June 22) accurately
describes the pitfalls of sending French troops into Rwanda. It is clear
that any intervention force in Rwanda must be seen as impartial by both the
government force and the Rwandan Patriotic Front if a further escalation of
hostilities and a worsening of the situation is to be prevented.
Instead, France should be putting its political influence and resources
firmly behind the UN by supplying logistical support to the African troops
of the UN mandated force to Rwanda.
We would, however, disagree with the point that 'the UN would do better to
deploy a force in neighbouring Burundi where further killings might yet be
prevented'. Burundi's fragile peace has been achieved by the positive steps
taken by the acting president and these should be supported by both the
British government and the international community.
To send in troops against the wishes of the Burundian government, and at a
time when delicate peace negotiations appear to be bringing both Hutu and
Tutsi together around the negotiation table for the first time in years,
could have disastrous results.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Vision of gas liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TED TRAFFORD and Others
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the current debate ahout the liberalisation of the gas market in the
UK, we feel that more heat than light has been generated. This has obscured
the vision of the most likely outcome of the whole exercise: lower prices
for all gas consumers.
Opponents of the government's plans to open up the domestic market have
argued that this process will create a 'winners and losers' scenario. Such
arguments simply do not stand up to proper examination. For example, we
believe that any small regional price variations for domestic customers will
be more than out-weighed by the overall reductions that independent
suppliers will be able to offer.
British Gas currently dominates the market with a share of more than 80 per
cent, and will still control the entire transportation system when the
market is fully open. To ensure self-sustaining competition, some simple
steps need to be taken. First is the relatively straightforward legislation
planned by the government. Second is continued downward pressure on the
charges levied for use of the national gas grid to reflect the real cost of
operating the system efficiently.
The liberalisation of the industrial and commercial market has already
generated savings of up to 20 per cent. The introduction of competition in
the domestic market should, similarly, deliver significant reductions in
prices for householders. It will also underpin competition in all sectors of
the market and provide the certainty to encourage companies such as ours to
continue making the necessary investment in the gas business.

There are three World Cup soccer matches this evening. BBC2 shows Brazil v.
Cameroon at 8.30, and ITV shows Sweden v. Russia at 11.40. But the game that
will presumably attract most attention in the UK, now that the Irish have
beaten the Italians and been appointed honorary Brits, is Mexico v. Republic
of Ireland on ITV. Unfortunately for those with normal jobs and travel
arrangements, coverage starts at 5.15. Another outside broadcast on radio
comes from Glastonbury where John Peel is covering the summer music festival
(10.00 Radio 1). Channel 4 Goes To Glastonbury at 11.50 for more than two
hours of music. The names of the groups become more weird and wonderful
every year. Those playing today should include Madder Rose, Spin Doctors and
Manic Street Preachers. Of course soccer is not the only sport on television
today. Coverage of the Wimbledon championships begins on BBC2 at noon and
continues on BBC1 (1.50). There is another two and a half hours of live
coverage on BBC2 at 5.55, and then BBC1 screens highlights at 10.25.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Arts: Gleam of gold from the tombs of the Greeks - Gerald
Cadogan admires jewellery at the British Museum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the next four months London offers an alternative gold show to the
chunky, self-important British Crown Jewels. The pieces in Greek Gold:
Jewellery of the Classical World at the British Museum are light, charming
and intricate. And, unlike the symbols of state the Tower of London guards,
these gorgeous diadems, earrings, necklaces, pendants and wreaths have a
human scale and constantly allude to Aphrodite, golden goddess of love.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the State Hermitage in St
Petersburg and the BM have combined the best pieces of their permanent
collections to create a feast of Greek jewellery of 500 to 300 BC. They are
micro-masterpieces of gold, mostly from the fringes of the Greek world. The
special treat is the Hermitage collection of treasures from tombs in Greek
cities in the Crimea and the north coast of the Black Sea which otherwise we
must go to Russia to see.
The exhibition gives a new view of the Greeks, taking one away from Athens
and the familiar restrained emotion of classic Athenian art. Perhaps the
Athenians had jewellery like this. If they did, we know little about it,
apart from some in the exhibition from a tomb that Lord Elgin (of the
marbles) had dug in Peiraeus. But on the whole the Athenians tried to stop
people being buried with luxurious grave goods.
That was not the attitude of the still developing societies at the edges of
the Greek world, a diaspora that stretched from Spain to the Black Sea. Most
of the pieces (which were generally acquired a long time ago) are from
tombs. In the fringe regions women - and men - clearly believed that they
could take all it with them and their power and prestige would last for
ever. The Athenians would probably have said that this was a shocking abuse
of capital which should be recycled to the children.
But conspicuous consumption in burial by an emerging society was a custom
that had begun a millennium before with the gold found by Heinrich
Schliemann in the royal graves at Mycenae (now a glory of the National
Museum in Athens). The Hermitage jewellery comes from the rich Greek cities
of the Crimea and the Cimmerian Bosporus, where the Greeks faced the
Scythians as friends or foes.
Colossal wealth went with the dead, whether they were true Hellenes or
natives adopting Hellenic culture. One man took his weapons and 13 horses
with their bronze trappings with him. He also had silver and bronze vessels,
two gold necklaces and gold costume jewellery - bull's and ram's heads,
sphinxes and lions - for sewing on to his clothes or his shroud. He shone
with gold.
The woman in another tomb had two large pendants, probably worn on her
clothes over her breasts. They are discs with the head of Athena Parthenos
as designed by the sculptor Pheidias for her great temple on the acropolis
of Athens, the Parthenon. An elaborate ivy-leaf border with green enamel
filling and hanging wire scrolls and drops add to the luxury.
The ivy was the plant of Dionysos. Oak leaves point to Zeus. One wreath from
a tomb in the Dardanelles has two cicadas among the leaves, and a bee to
hide the joint where the wires which hold the leaves meet. But most
allusions are to Aphrodite and the power of sex - not with the explicit
scenes on Greek vases, but with a sophisticated delicacy matching the
finesse of the craft - which tickles our imagination, just as it must have
tickled theirs all those years ago. Two earrings from Macedonia have the
eagle carrying off the beautiful young Ganymede. The heads of bird and boy
are so close that they are almost kissing, the claw of one bird resting
lightly on Ganymede's hip.
In classical times, in central Greece men might wear a ring, and a wreath as
a badge of office. But in the east Aegean they wore more, following the
habit of their non-Greek neighbours; and on the Black Sea they wore more
still.
The exhibition fills out the picture of what it was like to be Greek -
beyond the images of Athenians erecting temples and Socrates asking
questions. Many Greeks clearly loved to dress up. Yet these jewels do not
contradict the famous Greek maxim, 'Nothing to excess', because they are
almost all miniatures. They show how the top half of society could live, but
they are not at all vulgar. The techniques are a revelation, using sheet
metal, thin wire and tiny bobbles (granulation). Look closely to see how the
craftsmen made straps by knitting many strands of wire, and hung pendants of
fruit or faces from the necklaces.
Enamel inlays added colour, as in a pair of loop earrings with pendants of
women's heads which show - in miniature - what they wore. In the hair is a
high diadem like a tiara with relief palmettes and lotus flowers. Rosette
shaped earrings are in the ears, the petals picked out in enamel. And around
the neck is a choker of a double strand of gold beads with a pendant in the
shape of a bull's head.
If you enjoy the show, the next stop should be the Thessaloniki Museum in
northern Greece where the jewels from the royal graves of the kings of
Macedonia found over the last 20 years are a yet more stunning display. They
may be crown jewels, but they show the same traits as the jewels in this gem
of a show at the BM.
Cartier has linked itself to these masterpieces of ancient craft and
sponsored the show, winning a further Pounds 25,000 for it from the Business
Sponsorship Incentive Scheme. The uncrowded display of the gold on purple
cloth would grace any expensive jeweller's. The catalogue by Dyfri Williams
and Jack Ogden is as superb as the jewels themselves.
Greek Gold: Jewellery of the Classical World at the BM until October 23;
Metropolitan Museum from December 1 - March 23, 1995; the Hermitage, May to
August 1995. Catalogue: Pounds 16.95 paperback (Pounds 14.95 during the
exhibition) and Pounds 25.00 hardback.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Arts: Page's 'Fearful Symmetries' - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For his new ballet, which I saw on Tuesday, Ashley Page has turned to a
score by the American minimalist composer John Adams. Its title, which Page
also uses, is Fearful Symmetries. After a very short time in its company, it
is tempting to call it Fearful Monotonies. Like so much minimalism, it wears
its clock-work mechanism on its sleeve. Round and round go the wheels.
Click, click go the little patterns. On and on go the gear changes, as
incidents wear themselves out and are replaced (but oh, how laboriously) by
other dull activities. It is the musical equivalent of the Chinese water
torture, and it serves its choreographer ill.
Ashley Page has made six large works, and many smaller pieces. In Pursuit
and Carmen Arcadiae, which I thought his most assured and convincing, he
revised academic classicism by sharpening its accents, honing its cutting
edge. The dance was bright, clear. In this new work he brings to the stage
certain recognisable qualities: an interest in revising balletic vocabulary,
and an affection for painterly (modern; abstract) design which echoes his
creative taste.
Thus we have a stage decorated by Antony McDonald - or rather,
over-decorated. A backdrop blazing with that crass magenta which
bougainvillea spreads over half the walls in the South of France. A huge
curved and pendant screen at stage left, the colour of which alters, but
always drearily. A battery of lights at ground level, also stage left. An
orange stick that makes a brief appearance. An acid green rectangle that
unfortunately doesn't.
Lighting, by Peter Mumford, that unsettles the action by changing too
frequently, and in the manner peculiar by William Forsythe, contrives to
obscure the dancers. Gloomy costuming that succeeds through acutest malice
in making the dancers look both ugly and foolish. The men boast mini-skirts
(exactly the gear for Mukhamedov, one realises) and the women are in
unflattering bodices and must also cope with fish-net tights that give their
legs a curiously gnarled look.
Thus accoutred, thus chained to his score, Page plunges in the Forsythian
deep end - much activity leading to further activity; a somewhat degage, not
to say cursory, manner for the dancers - and dog-paddles for half an hour.
The physical mood varies between pounding dynamics, with steps flung to the
wind, and strangely lethargic moments (as Adams' score draws breath) when
the cast slump from active to passive mood.
Mukhamedov comes off best. Page has devised a couple of outstanding entries
for him which make much of his strength and his powerful phrasing -
everything seamless, rich in tone, with great swathes of dancing cutting
across th stage. Mukhamedov also comes off worst by being involved in two
duets - with Deborah Bull and Ann de Vos - which are brutal in manner,
awkward in form.
The rest of the cast, who are some of the best of the Royal Ballet, run,
rampage, cower, are caught in tiny and inexplicable dramas, and look (thanks
to their glum outfits) distinctly sooty. The piece struck me as rodomontade.
Over-decorated, overpowered by its score, the choreography has an air of
anxiety, as if its brakes had failed. Page is an interesting choreographer,
but he has been misled by his design and by his choice of score. His gifts
need far more sympathetic support.
The programme also contains early and late MacMillan. Danses Concertantes is
as astonishing as it was in 1955 - classicism refreshed by the wittiest
means - and Winter Dreams explores Chekhov's world with rare sympathy. The
'farewell' duet for Masha and Vershinin was ideally done by Viviana Durante
and Irek Mukhamedov - their hearts spoke to us.
This triple bill can be seen again at Covent Garden on June 28,29,30.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Arts: The American dream distorted - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Out there is a man's world where a man has to do what a man has to do. The
last surviving wilderness. A desert place where you walk tall and lean and
only the strong survive. Eleven years after its premiere at the National
Theatre, Glengarry Glen Ross returns to London; and in Sam Mendes'
production at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden it emerges more clearly
than ever as a sad, half remembered distortion of a great American ideal: a
dream, if not the dream, of independence and toughness, individual
self-fulfilment in a territory bristling with dangers.
Can it be that what the Western genre once epitomised for the American male
has been sublimated into ruthless commercial competition, and something as
ignoble as worthless real estate selling? Yes, according to David Mamet in
his most successful play.
That may be pitching it high, but the play's language gives off the
sweaty-leather crackle of machismo illuminating a set of values where the
ultimate terms of abuse are 'fairy', 'woman' and 'f--ing child'. For all its
rhapsodically streamlined profanity, Glengarry is a wistful work, whose
tawdry characters yearn for vast horizons to explore and sunsets to ride
into once manhood has been tested and proved.
Instead of the purple sage these men act out their destinies against the
Chinese restaurants and cocktail bars of Chicago. Johan Engels's design uses
the old warehouse's brick wall to suggest the entrapping city as the real
estate salesmen thrust, parry, miss, strike home, and occasionally
communicate at the restaurant-table of the opening scene, slowly revolving,
as if a film camera was circling them with scientific detachment.
The American dream of the masculine and the individual has shrunk to the
desperate rivalry among land dealers, not far removed from con-men as they
sell worthless land to the old and gullible, vying for the bonus, the car,
the vacation; or, even more desperately, to hold on to the job.
This production strikes me as funnier and less intense than the original.
Perhaps the language has less of a bulldozer impact, perhaps we have become
more cynical about the ethics of market forces; either way the plot of
paranoid conspiracy is less shocking than it was. The cast is British,
accomplished and slightly lightweight which adds to the play's emergence as
a comedy, albeit a comedy set in the jungle.
James Bolam, more Irish than American, as the salesman going over the hill
to find a precipice on the other side, changes brilliantly from cock-a-hoop
champ to aghast failure, his face sagging blankly in defeat. John Benfield's
thicky is a little too dumb to have survived so long in this jungle; but Ron
Cook's smooth-talking conner, spivvy and plausible, is a convincing golden
boy of the soft sell. Only his lack of stature detracts from his fits of
rage.
At the Donmar Warehouse until August 27. Tel 071-867 1150.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Arts: 'Prodigal Son' marks Kent Opera's return -
Spitalfields Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is five years since the Arts Council decided to close down Kent Opera by
withdrawing its grant, but some companies refuse to take their final
curtain. Its founder Norman Platt is determined to keep the company name
alive, even if it means starting again from scratch.
He intends to keep up pressure on the Arts Council for a new grant, but in
the meantime has raised the finance for a rebirth of Kent Opera from other
sources. The list of contributing organisations, public and private,
including local authorities and charitable trusts, is too long to list here.
The sensible decision on Platt's part was to have chosen for his relaunch a
modest work that could be mounted on a limited budget.
Britten's Church Parables involve just a small band of instrumentalists and
a handful of singers. They are a favourite with small-scale opera companies
who can perform them in churches without the need for any scenery, but for
some reason the third of them - The Prodigal Son - has been neglected at the
expense of the other two. Kent Opera has been touring it around the English
summer festivals and arrived this week at the Spitalfields Festival in East
London.
In its heyday the company made a name for itself enticing young theatre
producers into the world of opera (Jonathan Miller and Nicholas Hytner were
among its recruits). Platt wanted to continue that tradition and chose Tim
Carroll from the Northcott Theatre in Exeter for The Prodigal Son. What he
did with the piece took it a long way from the Japanese Noh-play formality
that Britten had in mind, but the result was strikingly theatrical.
The performance was dominated by Howard Haskin as the Tempter, whose
destructive force tears apart a family. Gwion Thomas sang strongly as the
Elder Son. Alan Watt might have found more paternal warmth as the father,
but James Oxley was affecting as the repressed younger son. Only Britten
could equate the evil temptations that he faces with a chorus of boy
trebles. Under Timothy Dean's musical direction this third parable made a
vivid impact. While money is short, perhaps Kent Opera might consider
building up the complete trilogy.
Spitalfields Festival continues until June 29.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Metal and bone join forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It sounds at first like an unlikely investment for a Japanese metals
company: Kobe Steel's European venture capital arm is to take a 33 per cent
stake in Promotus, a Swiss company developing a bio-material for bone
implants and artificial hip joints.
But Kobe is itself a manufacturer of conventional metal hip joints and is
attracted by the potential of Promotus's new material, Proplast. It is soft
and extremely porous - made from an open matrix of PTFE (a high performance
plastic) coated with hydroxyapatite (the mineral in bone).
The Promotus implant has a coating of Proplast over the metal stem that fits
into the central cavity of the patient's thigh bone. This has two advantages
over conventional hard implants, according to the company: it acts like a
shock-absorber, allowing natural 'micro-motion' to take place in the
artificial joint; and it encourages the body's own connective tissues to
grow into the stem and make it more stable.

numbers of people for signs of heart disease.
The Colby 1907, powered by rechargeable batteries, gives a wide range of
electrocardiogram and other respiratory and heart readings, similar to those
from an ECG machine at a specialist clinic. Readings can be downloaded to a
personal computer or sent by telephone to a specialist for a second opinion.
The cost to the end-user is under Pounds 1,000.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Energy traders get integrated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil and gas traders, who have had to work with a proliferation of on-line
information sources, can now combine them all in a single PC-based
workstation. Saladin, a UK-based energy information company, this week
launched Crusader, a software product designed to integrate real-time market
sources and prices with historical data on one terminal.
Integration in this way offers two main advantages. First, the trader's
office becomes physically less cluttered. And second, the combined terminal
can carry out data analysis, including forecasts of future price movements,
which would be much more difficult with individual sources.
Similar software exists to integrate the mainstream financial information
sources, but Saladin says that energy trading stands out for the sheer
number of different sources available.
Crusader will cost about Pounds 2,000 a month for a five-user system.

The Royal Horticultural Society, best known for its flower shows and
gardens, is to form a substantial scientific research department. The RHS
has appointed its first chief scientist, Sarah Ball, and plans to build a
new Centre of Horticultural Science at its main garden, Wisley, in Surrey.
Ball, a plant pathologist, wants to re-establish the worldwide scientific
reputation that the RHS enjoyed in the 1920s and 30s. By the early 1990s it
was devoting only 3 per cent of its income to science. The long-term plan is
to increase that to about 10 per cent - giving Ball a budget of more than
Pounds 1m a year. RHS scientists will focus on issues of particular interest
to non-commercial gardeners.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Technology: A bittersweet celebration - Clive Cookson
examines Russia's nuclear expansion programme, as it turns 40 today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forty years ago today, the world's first nuclear power station - NP-1 -
started to generate electricity behind a splendidly Stalinist architectural
facade in Obninsk, a new science city built in the birch forests 100km south
of Moscow.
For Russia's sprawling nuclear industry, the 40th anniversary celebrations
have a bittersweet flavour. The older generation retains proud memories of
the Soviet triumph in the post-war race to use 'atoms for peace' but for the
younger scientists and engineers these are almost obliterated by today's
problems.
Like all the vast state enterprises inherited from the previous regime, the
nuclear industry is desperately short of funds. 'The nuclear power sector is
owed 500bn roubles (Dollars 250m) simply because consumers have not paid
their bills,' says Victor Murogov, director of the Institute of Physics and
Power Engineering (IPPE), the nuclear development centre in Obninsk.
On top of its specifically Russian problems, the industry suffers from the
worldwide perception of nuclear power as an energy source that is at best
stagnant and at worst dying. And Chernobyl - a direct descendant of
Obninsk's NP-1 - is an extra burden to bear.
It would be a mistake, however, to regard the Russian nuclear industry as
being in terminal decline. It continues to run on a vast scale and has
immense staying power - symbolised by NP-1, relegated from electricity
generation to a research reactor but still operating today at its original
1954 rating of 30 MW thermal power.
According to Rosenergoatom, the Russian nuclear utility, the country's 29
power-generating reactors produced 119bn kWh of electricity in 1993 - the
same as the three previous years - with a load factor that compares
creditably with western levels. It even managed to commission a new reactor,
a VVER-1000 pressurised water reactor at Balakovo.
The Russian atomic energy ministry has ambitious plans for nuclear growth
over the next 20 years. These involve building about 30 new reactors, both
to replace old plants and to expand the country's nuclear capacity.
The first steps will be to complete two reactors now in the final stages of
construction. Lev Kochetkov, a senior IPPE scientist, says another VVER-1000
unit is on course to start up at Kalinin next year, followed - more
controversially - by the last Chernobyl-style RBMK unit at Kursk in 1996.
At the same time, the final stages of design work are taking place for
reactors whose construction is due to start during the late 1990s.
IPPE is responsible for developing fast breeders - reactors intended
originally to 'breed' new nuclear fuel in the form of plutonium as they burn
uranium. Fast reactors have lost favour in the west as the world builds up a
potentially dangerous stockpile of surplus plutonium. However, the Russian
plan includes five 800 MW fast reactors of a new design, the BN-800. The
first is due to be built at Chelyabinsk in the South Urals.
Kochetkov points out that a 600 MW fast breeder, the BN-600, has run safely
and efficiently at Beloyarsk since 1981. Last year its availability rating
was 80.6 per cent - considerably better than the 76 per cent achieved by
Russia's nuclear plants as a whole. 'I believe the fast reactor is
intrinsically safer than a conventional thermal reactor but it is not easy
to convince even the specialists of that,' he laments.
To answer the criticism that fast reactors will produce more unwanted
plutonium, IPPE engineers have re-designed the BN-800. 'The original design
produced 30 per cent more plutonium than it burnt,' Kochetkov says, 'but the
final design has a breeding ratio of about one; that means the amount of
plutonium built up will be no more than the amount burnt. We could continue
that process to cater for public perceptions of the dangers of nuclear
proliferation, so that the reactor consumed more plutonium than it
produced.'
Another way of disposing of surplus plutonium - which is more popular in the
west than burning it in fast reactors - is to combine it with uranium and
burn the resulting 'mixed oxide fuel' or Mox in PWRs. IPPE is putting the
final touches to a new facility to test Mox fuel elements. But Kochetkov
does not hide his reluctance to go down the Mox road: 'The IPPE directorate
believes it is more profitable to use the plutonium in fast reactors.'
Outside observers believe the Russian nuclear expansion programme as a whole
is far too grandiose to be practical. Russia itself could not possibly raise
internally the tens of billions of dollars that would be required to carry
out the plans on the scale proposed; western donors are far more interested
in making the existing Russian nuclear industry safe than investing in its
expansion. Yet a severely reduced version of plans might be credible - and
even that would be the envy of the stagnant western nuclear industry.
Meanwhile, the fragmented Russian industry, with its many duplicated
facilities, is forced to compete within itself for scarce orders and funds,
both from within Russia and from the west. The main competition for IPPE is
the Kurtchatov Institute, the nuclear development centre in Moscow.
The international profile of IPPE would be raised enormously if it wins a
bid recently submitted to the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development in London for Dollars 45m to build a nuclear safety centre at
Obninsk. The proposed centre - a joint venture between IPPE and Rockford
Technology, a Canadian company based in Vancouver - would concentrate on
training the operators of Soviet-designed reactors, using the latest
techniques of computer simulation.
'The human element is the weakest link in Russian nuclear safety,' says Mark
Prelas, a nuclear engineering professor at the University of Missouri in the
US, who is a regular visitor to nuclear plants in the former Soviet Union.
'The most economical way to improve safety by an order of magnitude is to
provide a standard training programme for engineers and operators of power
plants. Russia currently has no such standards because the industry is so
fragmented; there are well-trained groups but no overall standards.'
The Russian nuclear industry inevitably has mixed feelings about western
safety concerns. Most of the engineers who designed the current generation
of reactors remain proud of their work and believe western anxieties are
greatly exaggerated. At the same time they are keen to take advantage of
those fears to attract western funds.
While the industry waits for large-scale western aid to pay for safety
improvements, it is beginning to sell its services abroad. For example,
radio-isotopes for medical diagnosis and treatment are in short supply in
the west, following the closure of many of the research reactors that used
to produce them in the US and Europe; Russian reactors such as those at IPPE
are now making up the shortfall.
'Our income from abroad has grown three to four times over the past year,
with very beneficial contacts for the institute,' Murogov says. 'The
mentality of our scientists has had to change drastically; for the first
time in their lives they have to think about the application of positive
results.'
Not all the foreign business goes directly to the state-owned nuclear
institutes. Some goes to the private companies being formed by their staff.
IPPE, for example, has spawned Brand Engineering, named after the Brothers
Androshenko who founded it, which is selling computer programming services.
IPPE plans to continue running its first nuclear reactor until its 50th
anniversary, if it passes a thorough safety review scheduled for 1997. It
remains to be seen whether NP-1 will still symbolise the power and
continuity of the Russian nuclear industry early in the next century, or
will seem then like a quaint historical relic.

FT  24 JUN 94 / People: Lining up on the starting blocks at Willis Corroon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Max Taylor, 46, is to take over as chief operating officer of Willis Corroon
as part of a sweeping management reorganisation at the insurance broker.
The changes are designed to prepare for the retirements next year of Roger
Elliott and Richard Miller, two men who helped bring about the merger
between Willis Faber and Corroon &amp; Black in 1990.
Willis announced yesterday that Miller, 62, will retire as chief executive
on January 1 next year, and will become vice-chairman.
Elliott, now 61, will take over as executive chairman, focusing on worldwide
business relationships, but it is understood that he will also seek to
retire next year.
Taylor, who has been centrally involved in moves to introduce electronic
trading to the London insurance market, is currently chief executive of
Willis Faber &amp; Dumas, the wholesale and reinsurance broking arm of Willis.
A Willis employee for more than 20 years, he will chair a new executive
management committee which will direct day-to-day operations of the group.
Its members are Richard Dalzell, 53, the group finance director, Brian
Johnson, 51, chief operating officer of Willis Corroon Americas, George
Nixon, 54, chairman and chief executive of Willis Corroon Europe, Donald
Payne, 55, chairman and chief executive officer of Willis Corroon Americas,
and Kenneth Pinkston, 51, who succeeds Miller as chairman of Willis Corroon
Corporation, the group's US holding company.
Payne succeeds Frank White Jr who will remain with the group in another
executive capacity. All appointments take immediate effect. The company also
announced the formation of a nominations committee, which will be
responsible for nominating candidates for the group board. This will be
chaired by William Schreyer, the non-executive director who last year
retired as chairman and chief executive of Merrill Lynch.

FT  24 JUN 94 / People: Wm Low loses property director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
William Low, the Dundee-based food retailer, has been having an unhappy time
of things recently, and the departure this week of property director Ramsay
Johnson may not hearten spirits.
With its margins squeezed by the continuing supermarket price war conducted
by its larger rivals, Low reported in April this year that operating profits
fell by more than 25 per cent in the six months to mid-March.
Other recent gloom has been a 10 per cent cut in head office staff, and a
decision to scale back plans for new retail space, from the intended
80,000-100,000 square feet per annum to not more than 40,000. Traditionally
strong in Scotland, Low responded to the price war last September, by
announcing its own '500 prices down' promotion.
Perhaps it is not surprising therefore that yesterday Harvie Findlay,
finance director, would add nothing to the company's formal statement about
Johnson's departure, which noted that 'bearing in mind the reduced level of
activity in property development in retail and non-retail assets, no
successor is being appointed in the meantime'.

FT  24 JUN 94 / People: Dominic Cadbury to become chairman at The Economist
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A new editor, a new chief executive and now a new chairman. Dominic Cadbury,
54, executive chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, is to take over from Sir John
Harvey-Jones as chairman of The Economist Newspaper, parent of the weekly
business magazine which has just celebrated its 150th anniversary.
The Economist's new chairman is the latest in a series of boardroom changes
at the group which is 50 per cent-owned by the Financial Times. Bill Emmott
took over as editor when Rupert Pennant-Rea left to become deputy governor
of the Bank of England and Marjorie Scardino replaced David Gordon as chief
executive following his move to be chief executive of ITN.
The Cadbury family have been shareholders since 1929 and Dominic Cadbury has
been on the board since 1990. He will succeed Sir John after the agm on July
12. Sir John, who retires having turned 70, took over from Sir Evelyn de
Rothschild, whose family owns 20 per cent of the company.
Under Sir John's seven-year tenure, The Economist's profits have risen by 50
per cent. Last year, the group increased its pre-tax profits by 22 per cent
to Pounds 15m on the back of a 8 per cent rise insales to Pounds 121m. The
average circulation of the weekly magazine rose by 9 per cent to a record
549,000.

<TEXT>
The London Fire and Civil Defence Authority has a new chair, Judith
Jorsling, 44. A Labour councillor for the London borough of Newham, Jorsling
was previously the LFCDA's deputy leader; she is both the first woman and
the first black person to become the authority's leader.
The LFCDA is responsible for the work of London's 8,000 firefighters and
administrative staff - there are some 6,500 uniformed firefighters  - and in
the fiscal year 1994-95 has a central government-funded budget of some
Pounds 255m.
Jorsling came into politics via a familiar route, through community-based
projects in Brixton and later Newham - assisting the self-development of
disadvantaged groups, setting up a tenants' association, and eventually
becoming a Newham councillor in 1986. The LFCDA comprises representatives
from each of London's 32 boroughs, plus one from the City.
Jorsling says she feels 'extremely honoured' to have been chosen for the
position. 'So often in politics you find yourself wanting a certain position
or function - it's very nice to be chosen by your colleagues for something
as important as this.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Property: IPD emphasises slowdown in property prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The slowdown in the surge in property prices that began in late 1993 has
been underlined by a second consecutive monthly fall in the IPD Monthly
Index total return.
The total return for May was 1.2 per cent, the lowest monthly level since
August last year. Capital growth was down to 0.5 per cent in May, the lowest
monthly movement since April 1993 when yields started to shorten.
Over the past three months, the total return was 6.1 per cent, suggesting
that the total return for 1994 is likely to be lower than the 7.8 per cent
recorded in the quarter to March.
Total returns continued to slow across all three sectors in May reflecting a
decline in the rate of capital growth. Industrials regained their lead as
the best performing sector in May with a total return of 1.4 per cent.
Retail property slipped into second place with a return of 1.2 per cent,
while offices showed a monthly return of 1.0 per cent.
In the year to May, the total return for the retail sector was 27.4 per
cent, an increase of 0.8 percentage points over the year to April; the total
return for the office sector was 25 per cent, a marginal improvement over
the 24.7 per cent return for the 12-month period to April; the total return
for industrial property was 26.6 per cent for the year to May, compared with
25.8 per cent for the year to April.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Property: Trials and errors - Has the sector learnt from its
mistakes, asks Vanessa Houlder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the mid-summer point four years ago, the cracks in the property industry
were only just emerging. New developments were still being launched, rents
were rising and, despite the tightening of interest rates, many optimists
believed the economy would make a 'soft landing'.
But when the Gulf crisis broke out in the first week of August - the week I
began to write about property for the FT - the cracks began to widen. Deals
went on ice, investors lost heart and the huge overhang of bank debt
threatened to bury the industry.
The years that followed were some of the most nerve-wracking seen in the
industry. The downturn - the most damaging since the second world war -
proved more severe than anyone had expected, crushing companies, ruining
careers and costing banks and shareholders billions of pounds. The upturn,
when it finally came last year, was frenetic.
The fall-out from the crash went beyond the property companies and the banks
which lent to them. Company balance sheets were also weakened, towns were
blighted by empty, boarded-up property and the construction, architectural
and surveying industries lost thousands of jobs. Even the Church of England
cut stipends as a result of its investment managers' ill-fated forays into
property development. It is no wonder the industry has a tarnished image.
But its fundamental importance - of providing commerce and industry with
adequate premises - has been obscured by its errors, chiefly the squandering
of billions of pounds in unwanted developments.
The rigidity of the UK lease structure has also blighted many businesses,
particularly small companies which discovered they were liable for the
unpaid rent of companies to which they had assigned their leases. The
tradition of lengthy leases, with upwards-only rent reviews, means that
landlords are often seen as passive rent collectors rather than companies
servicing their customers' needs. The government is examining the
possibility of reforming the structure of leases.
As an industry that hinges on deal-making, the property market revolves
around its leading personalities. As a result the blame for the instability
and short-sightedness of the industry rests largely with the way its
foremost figures operate.
A steely ambition and self-belief that is the essential characteristic of
most property entrepreneurs resulted in too many speculative buildings in
the 1980s. Developers, blinded by an overweening belief in their projects,
would see no obstacles: indeed the ability constantly to look beyond
immediate hurdles and risks is an essential attribute of developers, who
often spend years piecing together sites, winning over investors and
overcoming planning problems.
One of the inherent risks in the industry is the long lead times involved
between the conception and completion of a building. As long as the
government fails to smooth the cyclical nature of the economy, property
developers will continue to be prone to the disrupting effect of economic
booms and busts.
The UK's planning regime is also widely seen as a contributory factor behind
the industry's problems. The laisser-faire planning policies of the Thatcher
years are widely blamed for the surplus of space - particularly in places
such as the London docklands, where some 4m square feet of office space
remain empty. Moreover, the lax planning regime generated a glut of
out-of-town developments that have - the government now concedes - had a
damaging effect on town centres.
Banks, too, are culpable. Driven by deregulation, the globalisation of the
banking industry and the loss of corporate customers to the commercial paper
and bond markets, banks poured money into property with an insufficient
understanding of the risks.
Nor have mainstream property investors acquitted themselves with glory -
with a few notable exceptions. While the UK institutions did well to shun
property at the start of the downturn, they failed to appreciate the
opportunities at the bottom of the market, leaving the best deals to some
astute German investors. After property values began to increase on the back
of rising bond values last year, UK institutions re-entered the market,
fuelling a sharp increase in prices.
Despite its recent uplift, the property market lacks much of its old
ebullience. The absence of rental growth is a worry. Banks are still wary of
lending to developers. Property dealers are keeping a close watch on bond
markets, which could yet cause a nasty setback to parts of the market.
While the unease in the market pales in comparison with the nervousness of
1990, the experience of the past four years has taught people that the
sector can be unexpectedly volatile. But how long before they forget?

FT  24 JUN 94 / Management: Ringing the changes brings mixed results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was seven years ago that a group of senior executives first recognised
British Telecom's need to introduce what has become known as 'process
management': the replacement of activities fragmented between departments,
businesses and geographic units by processes which span them. But the UK
telecoms giant is still having mixed success with the approach.
This is partly because of the scale of the changes required in such a large
organisation. But there have also been other reasons. For several years,
BT's efforts at what has now generally become known as 're-engineering' were
piecemeal. Nor were they linked to a revised corporate strategy. Top
management took until 1992 to throw its weight behind the principle that BT
needed to be re-engineered along process lines.
Among myriad other barriers within BT, according to a new study entitled
Re-engineering: The Critical Success Factors*, 'process management' has not
yet been legitimised at BT by being integrated with the responsibilities and
rewards of line managers.
BT has also had problems combining two approaches to re-engineering:
focusing on selected complete 'core processes', such as the ordering and
provision of private circuits; or re-engineering service components, such as
customer relations.
BT's very mixed experience with re-engineering is one of several company
case studies examined in the report from Business Intelligence, which looks
beneath the considerable consultancy hype of the last 18 months and probes
the practical experience of American and British companies which have been
striving to introduce re-engineering. Other companies studied include Lucas
Industries, Pilkington Optronics, Reuters, Rank Xerox and Western Provident
Association, a UK health insurance company.
The strength of the study is its comprehensive scope, and the rigour with
which, unlike many consultants and their clients, it defines what
re-engineering really is - or should be. Although 'business process
re-engineering' or BPR, has been dubbed 'big people reductions' by some
cynics - including within BT, which is slashing its workforce - the study
stresses that it has little in common with conventional restructuring or
'downsizing'.
As the study argues, re-engineering can only succeed when it is accompanied
by changes in corporate strategy, management methods, behaviour and culture.
Combined with these, it becomes what some consultancies call
'transformation'.
The study distinguishes between two forms of re-engineering: what it calls
'business re-engineering', which it defines as the - hitherto rare -
re-engineering of entire businesses or organisations; and 'process
redesign', the narrower but still daunting reconfiguration of selected 'core
processes' which span departmental boundaries, such as order fulfilment and
the development of new products.
Among a useful checklist of 'risk factors' in re-engineering, the study
warns that the frequent failure to carry out a thorough initial strategic
review tends to result in the re-engineering of processes which have a
trivial impact on overall performance. Re-engineering is useless, it says,
for an organisation which has products, services or a philosophy of business
which are losing touch with market needs.
Although many consultancies claim that the definition of core processes is
the easiest part of re-engineering, the report warns that it can be both
hard and time-consuming. It is difficult to form an accurate view of how
work is actually performed when formal procedures have been replaced over
the years by informal ones, the study says. Yet a failure to define core
processes correctly can lead to disappointing results, since it prompts
companies to target too few or too many processes.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Management: Families' foreign assignments - Richard Donkin
on the main issues when sending staff abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger is a senior manager in a large multinational energy company. A
qualified petroleum engineer, his job had frequently taken him to many parts
of the world but his suitcase-lifestyle had not interfered too greatly with
his domestic arrangements.
His wife Ann, and three-year-old daughter, Bridget, were settled in their
four-bedroomed house on a new estate near Kingston, Surrey. Today they are
in a new home - a rented bungalow with gardeners, a maid and a guard that is
nearer Kingston, Jamaica.
The posting was as sudden as it was unexpected. The job offer came and Roger
accepted. Then he told his wife. To say she was unhappy about the prospect
of uprooting everything to start afresh in a different culture would be an
understatement, but marital loyality overcame her resistance.
The move meant she had to give up her own job as an oil company geologist.
Her position is less senior than Roger's but only, perhaps, because of her
decision to start a family. And although Roger's posting is ostensibly for
two years, her company refused her request for a career break.
Roger is a big fish in his new job. His Caribbean island status, where he is
frequently in the newspapers and mixing with government officials, is a
world away from his previous life. But the letters home from Ann to her
parents demonstrate that there is a cost - their daughter is not easily
adapting to her new surroundings.
The difficulties associated with conflicting career paths of men and women
are increasingly recognised as one of the biggest obstacles to international
job transfers. A study by Monks Partnership, remuneration advisers, looking
solely at job transfers in Europe, has found that partners' dual careers are
seen by their employers as the most common difficulty to overcome before
transfers can take place.
An increasing number of companies are responding by providing career
counselling for the spouse, says the report. Researchers discovered some
examples of executives moving close to airports so they could commute to
work abroad. Companies tend to be against splitting families because it
often leads to assignment failures.
The greatest difficulties, says the report, arise when both partners have
jobs of equal status. The survey, covering 1,000 work transfers among 30
multinational companies, found that employers put dual-career families ahead
of children's education and language barriers in their perception of
problems that needed to be overcome.
The results show a marked change from those in a similar survey last year
which found that cost of living considerations dominated company concerns.
David Atkins, the report's editor, says: 'As inflation has gradually been
reduced in European economies the fear of rising prices and different costs
of living in these countries has disappeared.' The report found that 40 per
cent of the companies were willing to assist with boarding school costs in
the home country and, depending on the length of the assignment, more than
60 per cent of the companies surveyed would assist with day school fees in
the new country.
Nearly all companies would pay for language training for the executive and
90 per cent would pay for lessons for the whole family. More than half the
companies said they would also provide some cultural familiarisation
training.
The findings are supported by recent research at Shell International which
found that dual career considerations were a growing issue, particularly
among employees aged under 30. 'The trailing spouse makes the sacrifice and
all the satisfaction lies with the working partner,' said Mike Coughley, a
Shell human resources manager.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Management: Re-engineering's all the rage - Alan Cane
reports on the popularity of a controversial business tool in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A majority of the UK's large companies claim they are already in the throes
of business process re-engineering, the iconoclastic technique which
promises ambitious performance improvements for companies prepared to
undertake the drastic changes involved.
In essence, BPR involves rethinking the way a company does business - or any
part of its business - from the beginning, cutting out unnecessary stages
and using information technology where appropriate to improve efficiency. It
is necessary, management experts say, to give the improved performance
necessary to remain competitive.
There are substantial risks involved - it can be likened to rebuilding an
aircraft in flight - so it is perhaps surprising that surveys, carried out
by the Cranfield School of Management, and by the management consultancy
Price Waterhouse in collaboration with the Financial Times, indicate
separately that between 60 and 70 per cent of big companies claim to have
undertaken, or are about to undertake, BPR. Even more surprising, only 7 per
cent in the PW/FT survey saw it as a leading cause of business instability.
The surveys indicate that IT directors may be enjoying a new prominence
after a spell in limbo when their projects failed to deliver all they
promised. Now they seem to be working with their chief executives to define
and push through the changes needed for BPR.
Most of the companies canvassed said they were attracted to BPR because of
the potential savings. The Cranfield study, carried out among 40 senior
managers from a variety of business functions, listed cost reduction, cycle
time reduction (doing things quicker) and improvement in customer
satisfaction as the chief drivers. The PW/FT survey, an occasional poll of
100 chief executives, revealed that 79 per cent were looking for improved
performance, while 35 per cent saw BPR as a means of cutting costs through,
for example, staff savings. None of the respondents saw it as a waste of
time or effort and 24 per cent said BPR was essential to survival.
Both surveys show that commitment to BPR from both the chief executive and
the IT director is essential for success, but that support from the rest of
the organisation is equally critical. The Cranfield study, directed by Chris
Edwards and Ashley Braganza, observed: 'The rest of the management team
needs to support the proposed change if it is to work.'
There is evidence, nevertheless, that senior executives are not spreading
their commitment to other staff: 'The organisation as a whole is barely
aware of the existence of BPR when compared with the senior management,'
according to Cranfield.
It identifies this tendency for BPR to be seen both as an issue for senior
management and, as an IT issue, as a substantial barrier to successful
implementation.
Indeed, 38 per cent of respondents to the PW/FT survey believed the chief
executive had been the main architect of BPR while 28 per cent gave the
credit to the IT director. One respondent to the PW/FT survey said: 'It
would be difficult for IT to drive BPR. It must be generated from within the
operational side of the business with IT providing support where possible.'
A sound knowledge of the company, energy and a willingness to take a fresh
approach are clearly needed. Some 60 per cent of those credited with leading
BPR in their companies had been in post from one to three years. Thirty-five
per cent had been there longer but only 5 per cent had been in post for less
than a year.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Telegraph faces news distribution trade row: Raymond Snoddy
on the consequences of newspaper cost cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Daily Telegraph was last night heading for confrontation with the news
distribution trade over attempts to link wholesalers' and newsagents'
margins to performance, to help pay for its price cut to 30p.
In an effort to get back some of the estimated Pounds 40m a year cost of the
weekday price reduction from 48p, The Telegraph group has told the news
trade that it will keep the 26.5 per cent distribution margin but that
traders will be compensated for the price cut with a performance bonus.
No further details were given but the implication is that the amount will be
linked to sales.
A wholesaler said last night: 'The trade will not fall for this.' He added
that his company would pass on any difference to newsagents.
The Telegraph conceded that Forbouys, the multiple newsagent chain, had
already written expressing concern.
It is believed that at least one multiple newsagent group has already
decided not to accept a performance bonus element in its terms.
The Times, which last night announced another round in the price war by
reducing its weekday price from 30p to 20p and Saturday price from 40p to
30p, has been careful to keep the news trade 'on side'.
The attempt to link distribution costs to performance is just one attempt by
The Telegraph to reduce costs.
Mr Max Hastings, Telegraph editor-in-chief, said yesterday: 'We will look
seriously at all costs.' He said it would be irrational to do anything to
damage the editorial product. He added: 'We are not going to cut a swathe
through editorial.'
Big savings would come from the paper's promotional budget, at present about
Pounds 9m-Pounds 10m a year. All special offers, such as free CDs, would be
dropped, although the 30p Telegraph would continue to be advertised. Mr
Hastings said the decision to cut the cover price, a move designed to
protect long-term market share, had cost him and several other senior
Telegraph managers several hundred thousand pounds each.
They have share options maturing in February which are likely to be worth
very much less than they otherwise would be.
Mr Hastings said: 'At least we can't be accused of acting out of
self-interest.'
News of the imminent decision to cut the paper's price forced him to speed
up editorial changes at the top of the Telegraph hierarchy.
Mr Simon Heffer has been appointed a deputy editor. Editorial executives Mr
Christopher Hudson and Mr Trevor Grove are leaving.
Mr Hastings said the changes would add bite to the opinion pages of the
paper.
He added: 'When I told Conrad (Mr Conrad Black, the chairman) he said, 'Max
I thought you had lost the capacity to surprise me. You haven't'.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Nuclear Electric to shed further 2,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nuclear Electric is to cut up to 2,000 jobs in the next three years - more
than 20 per cent of its workforce.
The state-owned nuclear generator for England and Wales attributed some of
the cuts to a recent decision by the industry regulator to cap prices in the
wholesale electricity pool, which it said could depress 1995-96 profits by
up to Pounds 200m.
It said it had to compete against private-sector generators. These have cut
staff by more than half since privatisation four years ago.
The planned cuts will lead to a provision in the company's 1993-94 accounts.
The company could not say what the provisions would be, but more than Pounds
150m seems likely.
This will partly offset the effect of a sharply improved operating
performance, where losses have been reduced to Pounds 224m from Pounds 564m
in 1992-93 - excluding the effects of the nuclear levy.
The job losses are the latest in a series in the nuclear industry. Last
month British Nuclear Fuels said it intended to cut 2,000 of the 7,000 jobs
at its Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria in the next five years.
Nuclear Electric has already cut nearly 5,000 from its 14,200 total of four
years ago.
Yesterday's announcement came three days after the company called for
ministers to privatise it as it published a submission to the government's
nuclear review.
Union leaders said yesterday that in cutting so many jobs the company was
trying to show that it could be as tough as the electricity companies, which
were privatised four years ago.
Mr Mike Jeram, head of electricity at the Unison public services and
utilities union, said: 'Workers seem to be the victims of a vicious circle
of job cuts in which power companies vie with each other to see who can shed
the most amount of labour.'
Mr Danny Carrigan, national officer of the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, said he was astounded at the scale of the cut.
In a letter to staff yesterday Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear electric chief
executive, said the company had to continue to reduce costs following the
pool price cap.
He said: 'We need to refocus our efforts and look carefully at all costs in
order to make good some of this loss and to achieve our goal of being the
lowest-cost generator.'
The company said it had to compete against private-sector generators.
Nuclear Electric could only secure its long-term future by achieving the
same kind of cost reductions and efficiency improvements as them.
Nuclear Electric faces a delay of several weeks in the start-up of the
Sizewell B nuclear power station in Suffolk, David Green writes.
The company said it would lose more than Pounds 500,000 a day in revenue
from electricity sales because of the delay, which has been caused by a
further round of public consultation over radioactive discharges from the
power station.
The station is nearing completion within its budget of Pounds 2.03bn.
The new consultation exercise was made necessary after a High Court ruling
concerning the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria.
The Inspectorate of Pollution said yesterday that the formal period for
responses to the discharge application had ended but it would be weeks
before they were assessed.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Industry in price-cut turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The newspaper industry was in turmoil last night as managers went into
huddles to discuss the intensifying price war between The Times and The
Daily Telegraph.
Concerns spread far beyond the national broadsheet newspapers to provincial
dailies and caused particular tremors in the Irish Republic, where
newspapers are both expensive to produce and burdened with value added tax.
'This makes me feel very ill,' said one newspaper industry specialist after
feeding the numbers into a matrix of revenue and circulation. 'Millions and
millions will be lost.'
There was growing concern that the cost-cutting process would break down
loyalty to particular titles. First indications were that The Independent,
at 20p for a single day yesterday, increased sales by 15 per cent to 16 per
cent. The Daily Telegraph at 30p claimed a rise of more than 25 per cent,
although some wholesalers put it closer to 12 per cent.
The Times said last night it had lost only 2 per cent to 3 per cent. The
middle-market papers, the Daily Mail, Daily Express and Today, are believed
to have lost 4 per cent to 6 per cent.
It was not clear whether any other national newspaper planned to join the
price war, although there is growing speculation that The Independent may go
to 40p.
The Guardian, whose circulation rose last month, will be extremely cautious
about any price cutting.
Mr David Bell, chief executive of the Financial Times - at 65p the most
expensive national daily - said: 'The Financial Times is priced according to
what it costs to produce. We think that is in the best long-term interests
of both the paper and its readers.'
Lord Rothermere, chairman of Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily
Mail, is understood to be reviewing the situation and a cut in the price of
the mid-market papers should not be ruled out. The Daily Mail has been
selling at 20p in Northern Ireland and is understood to have achieved a 24
per cent sales increase.

'There is an enormous chance to rebuild Britain's share of world trade,' he

an opinion poll published by the Scottish Daily Express yesterday.
Defeat on June 30 would be a blow for Labour, but the party dismissed the
poll, saying that the sample size of 401 was too small to be reliable.
The poll, by Market Research Scotland, put the SNP at 42 per cent, Labour at

A finance director who stole more than Pounds 350,000 from his company,
causing its collapse with the loss of 200 jobs, was jailed for four years
yesterday.
Mr Richard Oates, 44, took the money to finance a lavish lifestyle. As a
result Bristol-based Godwin Warren Engineering folded in 1988.
Mr Oates, now of Mold, north Wales, was convicted at Bristol Crown Court on
five specimen counts of theft and one of publishing a false statement. He
was acquitted on four charges of false accounting.
His co-defendant Mr Jeremy Kirk, finance director of Data Group, which was

FT  24 JUN 94 / Nationalists lead in Scottish poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish National party is narrowly ahead of Labour in Monklands East,
scene of the by-election to choose a successor to John Smith, according to
an opinion poll published by the Scottish Daily Express yesterday.
Defeat on June 30 would be a blow for Labour, but the party dismissed the
poll, saying that the sample size of 401 was too small to be reliable.
The poll, by Market Research Scotland, put the SNP at 42 per cent, Labour at
38.7 per cent, the Conservatives at 2.2 per cent, the Liberal Democrats at
1.2 per cent and others at 1.5 per cent.
At the general election Labour gained 61.2 per cent of the vote, the SNP 18
per cent, the Conservatives 16 per cent and the Liberal Democrats 4.6 per
cent.
Mr Alex Salmond, SNP leader said: 'The poll confirms what we are finding on
the doorsteps. There is a mood of change in Monklands East and this
by-election is now a tight two-horse race.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, described it as a 'Mickey
Mouse poll which ought to be believed only by Donald Ducks'.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Director jailed for four years
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A finance director who stole more than Pounds 350,000 from his company,
causing its collapse with the loss of 200 jobs, was jailed for four years
yesterday.
Mr Richard Oates, 44, took the money to finance a lavish lifestyle. As a
result Bristol-based Godwin Warren Engineering folded in 1988.
Bristol Crown Court heard that Mr Oates bought a Pounds 50,000 Ferrari and a
Pounds 200,000 home.
Mr Oates, now of Mold, north Wales, was convicted on five specimen counts of
theft and one of publishing a false statement. He was acquitted on four
charges of false accounting.
His co-defendant Mr Jeremy Kirk, finance director of Data Group, which was
owned by Godwin Warren, was convicted of four charges of false accounting.
Mr Kirk, 37, of Clifton, Bristol was ordered to do 240 hours of community
service.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Apology adds to pattern of black marks: John Authers on the
education secretary's turbulent two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten's apology in the High Court yesterday, for calling
Birmingham's chief education officer a 'nutter', was the most personally
damaging episode in a turbulent two-year career as education secretary.
It was not, however, the most politically damaging.
Significant retreats have been made on all the gov-ernment's most important
education reforms since Mr Patten was appointed education secretary by Mr
John Major, the prime minister, after the general election in April 1992.
The past two years have seen the collapse of compulsory national curriculum
tests in schools, sweeping reductions to the curriculum itself, and a U-turn
on legislation still before parliament to curb the powers of students'
unions. Over the test boycott, the Conservatives sustained arguably their
most embarrassing defeat at the hands of trade unions in 15 years of
government.
Meanwhile, the flow of schools choosing to opt out of local education
authority control - a flagship of the government's 1988 Education Reform Act
 -has slowed to a trickle.
While Mr Patten's sharp tongue has harmed him, his difficulties mostly stem
from tactical mistakes handling national curriculum tests last year, when
they were due to be made compulsory for pupils in England and Wales aged 14.
The first opposition, in January of last year, came from the National
Association for the Teaching of English. It objected to the tests on
academic grounds, and said that they should be scrapped for at least a year
while more work was done.
At this stage an announcement that the tests had been postponed for a year
would have caused little comment.
But Mr Patten pressed on, and rejected a joint request from all six
teachers' unions for England and Wales to abandon the tests. He believed
either that the unions would fall out or that parents would side against
them. Failing that, the government believed industrial action against the
tests would break the law.
But the unions were united, and parents and governors sided with them. The
NASUWT successfully fended off challenges in both the High Court and the
Court of Appeal from the Conservative-run London borough of Wandsworth.
Mr Patten announced concessions - including the review of the national
curriculum by Sir Ron Dearing which was generally regarded as a political
success - but refused to make the tests voluntary. The boycott was almost
total, and the results went unpublished.
The year since this crushing defeat has seen a series of confrontations on
other issues. Independent school heads complained about Mr Patten's refusal
to alter A-level examinations, which he called the 'gold standard'. They
wanted more flexibility.
In November, schools and local authorities were angered by publication of
national truancy 'league tables' which suggested that in some schools more
than 80 per cent of pupils had played truant. Manchester, where in one
school the tables suggested that a fifth of pupils played truant at any one
time, said the figures were 'spurious'.
Soon after, Mr Patten was wrong-footed by an interview given by Mr Major
strongly favouring universal nursery education. The education secretary was
on record as thinking this was too expensive.
Needless rows over forcing schools to hold daily acts of worship - opposed
by most head teachers - and over plans by Mr Iain Sproat, sports minister,
to make five competitive team sports compulsory in schools have further
provoked teachers this year.
The distrust is still intense. Mr Patten was dubbed 'The Great Unshuffled'
by the headmistress of one independent girls' school last year, after he
survived Mr Major's last cabinet reshuffle. He may not keep that soubriquet
much longer.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Property spending up in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK pension funds and insurance companies invested a net Pounds 479m in
property in the first quarter of 1994, underlining the resurgence in the
commercial property market.
Figures from the Department of Trade and Industry show that net investment
in the first three months of the year was more than 90 per cent of the total
net investment in 1993, which was Pounds 520m.
The biggest spenders in the first quarter were long-term insurance funds,
which spent a net Pounds 537m. Other insurance funds sold a net Pounds 168m,
while pension funds invested a net Pounds 110m. The institutions were active
sellers as well as buyers, with sales of Pounds 1.35bn, compared with
purchases of Pounds 1.83bn.
They became enthusiastic buyers of property in the last quarter of 1993,
when they invested a net Pounds 791m, because they considered that property
values had hit bottom and offered good value compared with other
investments.
In the autumn of 1993 and the spring of 1994, the fierce competition to buy
prime property regularly pushed prices well above the asking price. However,
since Easter the market has cooled. Total returns from the property market
edged downwards in May, according to Richard Ellis, chartered surveyors.
Intense buying activity in the first half of the year has given way to a
quieter second half, as turbulence in the bond market spilled over into the
property market. The bond market's influence is because, in the absence of
rental growth, property resembles a fixed-interest investment.
Pressures from the bond market have particularly affected sales of buildings
that had little prospect of rental growth. Investors are giving more
consideration to the location and quality of a building, which will
determine rental growth.
Mr Adrian White of Fletcher King said: 'Investors must be convinced of the
underlying fundamentals of location and quality of a building, because the
yields now being achieved demand rent growth in the medium term to justify
acquisition against a background of higher bond yields.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Blair's vision targets consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday held out a vision of Labour as the party of national
renewal in his personal manifesto for the contest to succeed John Smith.
The 20-page manifesto promises a modernised Labour party committed to
consumer rights in a market economy, shunning interventionism,
nationalisation and economic isolationism.
There are few specific policy commitments in the paper, which was
accompanied by a four-page colour brochure aimed at the 4.3m voters in
Labour's leadership election.
The social democratic language of the manifesto does open up a clear
ideological gap between Mr Blair and the two traditional socialist
candidates - Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting leader, and Mr John Prescott,
employment spokesman.
Mr Blair said he was seeking to modernise Labour's traditional values,
rather than abandon them. Supporters of the two leftwing candidates said he
was scrapping the party's basic prin-ciples.
The manifesto says that the market economy is in the public interest, and
indicates that a Blair government would limit intervention to 'developing
and guiding' industry in areas such as technological innovation and research
and development.
'The difference between this approach and the perception of Labour policy in
the past, is that the purpose of economic intervention is not so that
government can run industry, but that it should work with it,' it says.
'Government must concentrate on what only it can do, and do it well.'
The manifesto explicitly rules out 'trying to pick winners or run industry'
and promises 'macroeconomic stability through sensible demand management and
international co-operation, not the policies of boom and bust or economic
isolation'.
Much of the manifesto is concerned with ways of helping people to cope with
economic and industrial change by strengthening community values and
balancing individual rights with responsibilities.
It focuses on ways of increasing individual opportunity through community
action, and promises 'social solidarity' to replace the 'insecurity and
uncertainty' of Tory Britain.
The manifesto endorses Labour's policies on progressive taxation,
devolution, education and training, parliamentary and local government
reform, crime prevention, minimum wages and the European Union, including
lukewarm support for a single currency. It also promises to use the tax and
benefits system to reduce the poverty trap and return the welfare state to
its 'original aims' of 'providing opportunity for people to escape poverty,
not creating a dependent group of people in poverty'.
The manifesto is strongly consumer-orientated, reflecting Mr Blair's
conviction that Labour can win the next general election by appealing to a
wide range of people disillusioned by economic decline and social disarray.
It even risks a clash with the public-sector unions by promising to rebuild
public services 'free from vested interests of any sort'.
Mr Blair, the shadow home secretary, is the runaway leader in the leadership
contest, which will be decided on July 21.
Mrs Beckett is expected to issue her manifesto next week.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Disc-based travel planner launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travellers in the north-west of England will be able to plan bus and train
journeys on their home computers following the launch of a journey planner
on a disc by Cumbria County Council.
The computer programme helps find the most convenient journey by giving
departure, arrival and connecting times for trips within the county and to
main destinations outside, such as Manchester and Glasgow.
The council hopes the Pounds 2.50 disc will be used by information centres,
libraries, bus operators and hotels as well as local people and visitors
with access to a computer.
The programme lists 980 destinations and includes the timetables of more
than 80 local transport operators. If the initial scheme is successful the
council plans to update the disc every six months for the public and monthly
for commercial organisations. The pilot scheme has cost Pounds 8,000.
Further refinements may include allowances for road works and diversions,
estimated walking times in town centres and between railway platforms, and
details of bus boarding points.
The Cumbrian disc is the first in the UK to include both train and bus
timetables. British Rail has produced a disc of its nationwide timetables
for the two past years, which sells about 4,000 copies at each six-monthly
update, mainly to large companies. Individual copies cost Pounds 41 or
Pounds 45 depending on the system used.
Disc-based journey planners are used by the railways in the Netherlands,
Norway, Finland and Denmark, and by two Danish bus companies. A disc
covering all forms of public transport is available in the Netherlands.

FT  24 JUN 94 / MP warns on regional aid cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-term future of international companies' plants in England may be
jeopardised if the government cuts the regional aid it offers them to
upgrade their facilities, Mr Doug Henderson, Labour MP for Newcastle North,
warned yesterday.
Mr Henderson said a foreign-owned company with a plant in his constituency
had approached him for help after being told by the Department of Trade and
Industry in the past week that its application for Regional Selective
Assistance had been rejected.
He said the benefits of attracting international companies making products
for worldwide markets could be undermined if they found that further
investment, needed to maintain a competitive edge, did not win government
backing.
He has told the DTI of his concerns and will next week table parliamentary
questions, asking if the government is seeking to cut its regional aid
budget. He said: 'If companies like the one in my constituency feel they are
not getting the regional support they did in the past, and the support they
could get in other European countries, they will be less inclined to invest
in the future and that could mean jobs will be undermined.'
On Wednesday, the DTI confirmed that it was tightening the allocation of RSA
grants for projects in England, as part of public spending constraints. It
was also placing greater emphasis on the quality of jobs the projects would
create.
The clampdown, which affects foreign investors and indigenous companies, is
causing concern among economic regeneration bodies.
Mr Henderson said the company in his constituency, which he declined to
name, had received RSA in the past. It is understood it was seeking a
seven-figure sum this time. The proposed investment included equipment
modernisation and increased research and development.
The company was a world leader in its field, yet had been told its project
showed insufficient regard for skilling and high technology. The MP said the
company had told him an estimated 30 companies in north-east England had
been rejected for RSA recently.
The DTI said it could not comment on individual applications on grounds of
commercial confidentiality.

FT  24 JUN 94 / KPMG points to growth of fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International fraudsters are increasingly laundering money through physical
assets such as gold bars, senior fraud investigators claimed yesterday.
In an effort to prevent money flows being traced, they are buying precious
metals, antiques and other commodities, said Mr David Smith, a partner with
KPMG Peat Marwick's forensic accounting department.
Speaking at the opening of the department's annual conference, Mr Smith said
the transactions were partly a response to tougher guidelines on money
laundering. Much of the money came from drug transactions.
Mr Robert Chambers, head of the department, said there was a substantial
growth in fraud in the US, partly due to the loss of internal controls as
companies restructure during the recession.
He said there was evidence of growing involvement in corporate fraud by
organised crime, and that many police departments no longer had the budgets
to investigate white-collar crime.
Mr Smith said the development of high-quality colour photocopiers and
sophisticated printing equipment was making forgery difficult to detect.
He added that there was evidence of growing fraud in the former Soviet bloc,
particularly involving the Mafia, but that there was little government money
available to help pay for investigators to prevent fraud or recover stolen
money.
There was also a likelihood of growth in illegal money flows out of Hong
Kong and South Africa over the next few years, a reflection of the
countries' political instability.
He said it was important that companies ensured their employees took
holidays and others did their work while they were away, in an effort to
ensure that no frauds were being concealed by staff.
However, it is proving far easier than many believe to freeze assets held in
Switzerland, he said.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Study urges state funding of all 'off the job' training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All 'off the job' vocational training leading to qualifications should be
paid for from public funds, a study from the London School of Economics
says.
Mr Ken Mahew, one of the editors of the study, said yesterday it was
difficult to cost the proposal but it could add Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn a
year to what the government spends on vocational training.
The UK is good at graduate training level, the report says, but increasingly
bad at lower levels of skill. 'In order to combat unemployment and low pay,
the top priority is to lift the skills of the less able workers.' The report
says this would not happen adequately through more people staying on in
full-time education. It required a system which guaranteed part-time
vocational education to everyone who did not stay on full-time.
The study also proposes:
Anyone employed aged under 19 should be employed as a trainee - with clear
obligations on the employer, and appropriate levels of pay.
Any company employing workers under 19 should by law ensure they receive at
least one day a week off-the-job vocational education.
A review of National Vocational Qualifications.
Funding to be through existing channels.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Racal offshoot escapes action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK data communications and network
services group, has escaped legal action from the Office of Fair Trading
after giving assurances on its policy for supplying equipment to dealers.
The OFT said yesterday that Racal Health and Safety had given the assurances
to Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, after notice of his
intention to start legal action under the 1976 Resale Prices Act.
The company is a leading UK manufacturer of respiratory equipment and the
world's biggest producer of powered respirators.
The case arose after Protec (Manchester), a distributor of industrial
protective equipment, complained to the OFT last summer. Sir Bryan
subsequently alleged that the Racal company had breached the act by
threatening to refuse to supply Protec because it was giving excessive
discounts.
The act makes it unlawful for a supplier to withhold goods if they are sold
below a specified price, or to notify dealers of a price stated, or
calculated to be understood, as a minimum price.
The Racal offshoot has assured Sir Bryan that it was not company policy to
notify minimum prices to its customers and that it would not contravene the
act.
Sir Bryan said yesterday: 'I take breaches of the Resale Prices Act very
seriously. I am glad that in this case supplies to Protec were not
interrupted.
'It is important that all of Racal's distributors should know that in the
pursuit of profitability they are free to sell, advertise and display for
sale products from Racal and other suppliers at whatever price they choose.'
The OFT said legal action in such cases was very rare, and most cases were
settled after assurances from the company against which the complaint had
been made.
Protec said last night that the threat of legal action by Sir Bryan had
helped secure the future of Protec Direct, its discount direct mail
operation.
Mr Jonathan Prest, managing director of Protec, said: 'The success of Protec
Direct has proved that the market is looking for established brand name
products at low prices.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / Queen to give up royal yacht Britannia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Queen will be doing her bit to trim Britain's defence costs by
renouncing her right to free private travel in Royal Air Force aeroplanes
and giving up the royal yacht Britannia, it was announced yesterday.
On the relatively rare occasions when the Queen or her family use RAF
aircraft for purely private purposes, they will reimburse the Ministry of
Defence for the cost, accord-ing to an MoD statement.
The commercial rate for such journeys would be about Pounds 1,770 per hour.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said the 41-year-old Britannia would
be taken out of service in 1997 and the government would consider whether
the floating palace ought to be replaced.
Queen Elizabeth, who is commander-in-chief of Britain's armed forces, is
understood to feel that a yacht is no longer necessary for the purposes of
royal travel alone.
It is still possible that a new vessel will combine royal service with more
prosaic tasks such as promoting British trade - as Britannia has been doing
for the past few years.
The government is also keeping its options open on the ultimate fate of
Britannia, which has been anchored off the coast of Finland this week and
will be used next week for a reception by the London Docklands Development
Corporation - a typical assignment.
The Queen indicated through a spokesman that she hoped the yacht could
continue to serve a useful purpose 'in this country' - a hint that she does
not want it to be sold to a wealthy foreigner as the ultimate status symbol.
The MoD said the Queen would be consulted closely over the yacht's final
destiny but nothing was ruled out.
The vessel's running costs - Pounds 9.2m in the past financial year - are
only a tiny fraction of the annual defence budget of about Pounds 23bn, but
to have kept the yacht in service for another five years beyond 1997 would
have required a Pounds 17m refit.
The Queen's Flight, a prestigious unit of the RAF which consists of three
BAe 146 passenger jets and two Wessex helicopters, is to be amalgamated with
another squadron and transferred from its base in Oxfordshire to Northolt in
west London.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Imro fines company for rule breaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lancaster Hilton Investments has been fined Pounds 25,000 by Imro, the
self-regulating organisation for the investment management industry, for
breaches of rules related to safe-keeping of customers' money.
While the amount falls far short of the high fines levied by Imro on Noble
Lowndes and Invesco MIM, the regulator said yesterday that it should be
regarded as 'substantial'. LHI must also pay Imro's costs of Pounds 65,000.
The charges cover activities from late 1991 to 1992, and include failure to
keep proper records of clients' money and to hold proper information about
transactions carried out for customers.
Imro said that it was satisfied that no client had suffered a substantial
loss as a result of the rule breaches - which affected slightly more than a
quarter of LHI's 100 or so investment portfolios - and that LHI had provided
compensation where any minor loss had occurred.
LHI's shareholders have put the company into voluntary liquidation, and its
membership of Imro will soon end. Imro has supervised the return of customer
funds.

FT  24 JUN 94 / CBI reports upward price pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The industrial recovery remains on track but growing numbers of
manufacturers expect to raise prices in the next four months, the latest
Confederation of British Industry monthly industrial trends survey shows.
The survey, published today, says companies' price expectations rose in
June, after several months in which price expectations have been fairly
flat.
Twenty-one per cent of companies questioned hope to increase domestic prices
in the next four months, while only 9 per cent expect to reduce them.
This positive balance of 12 per cent on the question of raising prices is
significantly higher than in the months between February and May, when the
balance ranged between minus 1 per cent and plus 4 per cent.
The CBI pointed out yesterday, however, that company expectations could be
overly optimistic - when the balance of price expectations last rose to 12
per cent in January these expectations were largely unrealised.
Although the City is watching closely for any sign that the economic
recovery could be fuelling inflationary pressures, Mr Howard Davies, CBI
director-general, yesterday denied that the figures were a cause for alarm.
He said: 'The outlook for inflation is less positive than last month . . .
but we cannot yet be sure that this signals a change from the subdued
inflation outlook of recent surveys.'
Mr Davies added: 'Companies are still facing tough competitive conditions in
both home and export markets and overall inflationary pressures remain low.'
Elsewhere, the survey, which questioned 1,124 companies representing about
half of UK manufacturing, paints a picture of steady, modest growth.
Order books remained at their best levels for five years with 28 per cent of
companies believing that business is 'below normal', while only 25 per cent
believe it is 'better than normal'.
The balance in these total orders between export-driven and domestic demand
was stable - suggesting that April's tax increases have not significantly
dented domestic demand.
Export order books were unchanged, at their best level for four years - 27
per cent of companies said exports were above normal, while 29 per cent said
they were below.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Accounting move may help small companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hundreds of thousands of smaller companies may escape the requirement to
follow existing accounting standards, under radical proposals being drawn up
by the profession.
Preliminary recommendations to exempt smaller companies from certain
standards were drawn up by a working party created by the Accounting
Standards Board. They were announced at the annual conference of the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales held in London
yesterday.
The findings follow widespread calls that generally accepted accounting
principles are primarily drawn up forbig companies but must also be followed
by smaller companies.
Under existing practice, all of the UK's 1m limited companies must obey the
accounting rules laid down in law and produced by the board, although many
are less relevant and more costly for smaller companies to follow.
Ms Danielle Stewart, a partner with Warrener Stewart and a member of the
working party, said: 'Financial reporting is all about communication, and I
do not believe the communication value of small or private company accounts
is improved by the addition of a myriad of disclosure requirements and
complex accounting treatments.'
She argued that compliance with accounting standards could only be justified
when in the public interest - which meant they should apply only to quoted
companies or others with substantial public interest.
Smaller companies believed the requirement to comply with accounting
standards often made their accounts more unintelligible, she said.
The working party, which was set up under the auspices of the Consultative
Committee of Accountancy Bodies, representing the leading six professional
bodies, is still considering the threshold below which companies would be
exempt.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Unit trust draft changes published
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes making the regulatory regime for unit trusts simpler and more
flexible could be in place by September, after draft rules were published
yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
watchdog.
The rules relate only to the less controversial proposals for deregulation
in the unit trust industry, however. They do not deal with the issue of
moving from a system of 'dual pricing' to one of single pricing even though
this has been the subject of growing consensus within the industry.
An increasing number of unit trust managers believe that the pricing system,
under which investors buy units at an 'offer' price and sell at a lower
'bid' price, is a barrier to selling unit trusts, especially outside the UK.
Pressure for single pricing is expected to intensify with the introduction
into the UK of open-ended investment companies, a form of pooled investment
already common in other European countries and in North America, perhaps as
early as next year.
Single pricing and the question of allowing performance-related fees for
geared futures and options funds will be addressed separately in a further
consultation paper from the board later this year.
Among the most important issues covered in the rules which will be
implemented more quickly is the proposal that the board's lists of approved
securities and derivatives markets should be replaced with a duty on the
managers to ensure that the markets where they invest meet certain criteria.
The change would allow unit trusts to invest in a much wider range of
emerging markets.
Exit fees will also be allowed for all types of funds, and newspapers will
no longer have to print routinely the cancellation price of unit trusts. The
cancellation price, which is the minimum bid price, applies when the fund is
shrinking and its manager is forced to sell investments.
A paper from the Treasury on the introduction into the UK of the open-ended
investment company is expected within the next few months.

FT  24 JUN 94 / BR chiefs angered by signals row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Rail chiefs are furious about what they see as the incompetent
handling of the signalling staff's dispute by Railtrack, the state-owned
company responsible since April 1 for maintaining the railway network.
It emerged yesterday that senior BR managers believe they could have reached
an agreement with the RMT rail union over the grievances of the signalling
staff last year.
They say they were unable to do so because Railtrack insisted on taking over
responsibility for negotiating a deal with the signalling staff in April
last year rather than on the company's vesting day on April 1 this year.
The BR managers said that by spring last year they were at an advanced stage
in a study of the restructuring of the pay and conditions of the signalling
staff with the support of RMT union - a process that started in August 1991.
Railtrack took over the signalling staff issue on April 22 last year.
British Rail said it could not understand why there was such a long delay at
Railtrack before the package of restructuring proposals for signalling staff
was put to the RMT jointly with BR last November.
Meanwhile, the independent Public Finance Foundation yesterday released
figures suggesting that railway signalling staff have had among the lowest
increases in earnings of any public sector group in the past five years.
Since 1988 their earnings have risen by an average of 43 per cent, compared
with 44 per cent for local government workers, 56 per cent for the police,
51 per cent for the armed forces, 48 per cent for health service employees
and 52 per cent for those in education.
Only civil servants - at 42 per cent - have had smaller rises over the
period. Employees in the private sector had average rises of 53 per cent in
the past six years.
Mr Chris Trinder, head of the Public Finance Foundation, said: 'The railway
signalling staff failed to benefit from the pre-general election pay bonanza
of 1991-1992.'
But signalling staff are also the last group of workers on the railway
network not to have benefited from job restructuring that started in 1990.
Their position looks particularly anomalous compared with the signal and
telecommunication technicians and supervisors grade immediately above them
in the hierarchy.
That group acquired a new pay structure in 1992 that improved basic pay
rates by 25 per cent with a shorter working week in return for job
evaluation and work flexibility.
Other groups already covered by restructuring deals include Railfreight
distribution staff, retail and customer service staff and civil engineering
supervisors.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Possible changes to company annual reports suggested
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Lawrence, chief executive of the Stock Exchange, said yesterday
that the exchange might consider making compulsory the Operating and
Financial Review which is now only a suggestion to be included in company
annual reports.
He told the conference that the review provided useful information to
investors and there might be a case for enforcement.
Sir David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, called for
greater forward-looking information in company accounts.
He endorsed calls for revisions to company law to reduce the hundreds of
irrelevant financial disclosures required. The board has commissioned
research to identify candidates.
He also said the board was considering introducing a revised version of FRS
3, the standard on the profit and loss account, that would focus on trading
profits and exclude profits from other transactions, such as property sales.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Welsh land reclamation wins praise from watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reclamation of derelict land in Wales has achieved good value for money, the
National Audit Office says in a report published today.
The NAO says the Welsh Development Agency's programme for reclamation has
cleared 13,000 acres of unsightly and hazardous land since 1976. Sir John
Bourn, head of the NAO, said it was widely recognised as a notable
achievement and had contributed to improvements in the environment and
economic development.
Land reclamation has been a high priority in Wales since the Aberfan coaltip
disaster in 1966. The WDA is responsible for managing the programme and
makes full grants to local authorities, which undertake more than 90 per
cent of the work. Spending is running at Pounds 35m a year and the agency's
objective, agreed with the Welsh Office, is to reclaim all significant
dereliction by the year 2000.
The NAO says the agency has made substantial progress in clearing the
backlog of key unsafe and unsightly sites. Eighteen sites were examined in
detail, with Ove Arup and Partners, consulting engineers, as advisers.
Good-quality reclamation had been achieved in 14 of the schemes and in the
other four it was adequate. Net costs were described as satisfactory.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Plea deal with CPS attacked by judge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A judge yesterday described two men involved in a counterfeit currency
racket as 'two of the luckiest men in England' when they escaped long jail
sentences after a plea bargaining deal with the Crown.
Judge Owen Stable QC attacked the Crown Prosecution Service for
'incompetence' and 'lack of professionalism' over the deal which allowed Mr
Timothy Murphy and Mr Bruno Longy to be charged with an offence with a
maximum two-year sentence.
He told Snaresbrook Crown Court that they should have faced a more serious
charge which carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence.
The pair had been arrested when they attempted to hand over 70,000 fake US
dollars to undercover police for Pounds 8,750.
Because of the deal, the judge could only jail Mr Murphy, who has 17
previous convictions for robbery and violence, for 21 months, and Mr Longy,
a man of previous good character, for 15 months.
Mr Murphy, of Dagenham, Essex, and Mr Longy, of Ryde, Isle of Wight, both
pleaded guilty to possession of fake dollars.
Judge Stable said they should have been charged with possessing them with
intent to pass them to another, knowing the notes were counterfeit.
If that had been the case, Mr Murphy would have been jailed for seven years
and Mr Longy five.
Mr Murphy has already spent nine months in custody on remand - the
equivalent of a 20-month jail sentence - and will be free within weeks.
The judge said he wanted to bring to the attention of Mrs Barbara Mills,
director of public prosecutions, 'how woefully the department over which she
presides has bungled this case from first to last'.
He added that undercover police involved in infiltrating the counterfeiters
following a tip-off from American secret service agencies had put their
lives at risk.
Judge Stable first attacked the Crown Prosecution Service on Wednesday when
he said: 'There has been the most gross amount of bargaining going on behind
the scenes and I end up in the most totally unrealistic position.'
He adjourned the case until today to go through the case papers.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Law stumps windscreen cleaner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The trade in cleaning windscreens of cars caught in slow-moving city traffic
led to legal confusion in the High Court in London yesterday.
A judge heard that windscreen washer Mr Trevor Nowell was told by police in
London's East End that he needed a street trading licence and was threatened
with prosecution for obstruction unless he moved on.
When he asked the London Borough of Newham for a licence, he was told that
they were granted only to designated stallholders for local markets.
These markets were all in pedestrian areas. 'That rather defeats the object
of your trade,' the judge told Mr Nowell, of south-east London. Mr Nowell
replied: 'It does rather. I'm confused.'
He denied causing an obstruction, adding: 'I'm trying to keep out of trouble
and not break the law.'
There were no problems with Metropolitan Police officers in some areas but
in others they were clamping down on the windscreen washing trade.
Asked by Mr Justice Latham whether the police had charged him with
obstruction, he said: 'They have not - that is the annoying part.' If he had
been prosecuted the matter could have been sorted out.
The judge rejected Mr Nowell's application for judicial review as there was
no formal decision made by police or the local authority against which he
could appeal.
He suggested to Mr Nowell that he apply again to the council for a street
trader's licence. If refused, he should give notice that he intended to seek
a judicial review.
The Metropolitan Police said its policy was to take action against
windscreen cleaners if they were causing an obstruction, otherwise they were
free to carry on cleaning.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Qualified welcome from employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers' organisations yesterday gave a qualified welcome to the
government's proposals for pension law reform, but the Trades Union Congress
described it as 'totally inadequate'.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
said: 'The government has paid some attention to company representations and
has proposed a less burdensome regime than the Goode Committee advocated,
but one which nonetheless will improve security for occupational pension
scheme members.'
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress said: 'We were
looking for a tough package that would prevent employers ripping off their
employees' pensions, but employees still will not be assured of that basic
warranty.
'The framework in the white paper still would not prevent workers losing
their pension rights to pay the price of their employers' dishonesty.'
Employers' concerns focused on the costs of the proposed minimum solvency
standards and the compensation scheme to cover losses resulting from theft
or fraud.
The Institute of Directors said the government had clearly tried to strike a
balance between preventing another Maxwell episode and imposing heavy
burdens and costs on companies operating pension schemes.
But there was a price to pay for all new regulatory systems, and the
proposal could make companies more reluctant to operate schemes. The
definition of solvency and the precise application of the age rebates would
be crucial.
The CBI and the IoD were unhappy about the compensation scheme, and the
extent to which good schemes will have to pay for bad ones. The proposed
regulator and the compensation scheme should be financed by the government,
said the CBI, rather than by a levy on schemes.
The CBI said the obligation to maintain 100 per cent solvency, irrespective
of short-term stock market fluctuations, 'could provoke large-scale
switching from equities to gilts and, in the long run, reduce the returns
available to pensioners'.
The Engineering Employers Federation welcomed the phasing in of solvency
standards, and the strengthening of the role of pension fund trustees. It
pointed out that training for all trustees, and not just member trustees,
was important.
Mr Monks criticised the government for ignoring calls for a majority of the
trustees to be elected by scheme members. 'Member trustees can play a vital
role in eliminating pension fund fraud. Under these proposals they still
will not comprise a majority on trustee boards,' he said.
Other criticisms came from Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of the MSF, the
scientific and technical union, who said: 'Pension law reform was supposed
to protect pension scheme members against employers like Robert Maxwell. Far
from closing the stable door on pension abuse this white paper leaves it
propped open.'
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said the white
paper had introduced a weak and ineffectual regulator without the necessary
enforcement powers.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Insolvency risk remains serious
matter - Barry Riley discusses the implications for pension-fund investment
policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The minimum solvency standard in the white paper is not quite as tough as
the one proposed last year by the Goode committee.
But the 90-day rule - that solvency of under 90 per cent must be corrected
through a cash injection or something similar within three months - will
mean companies still have to take the insolvency risk very seriously.
According to Ms Penny Webster of consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow it is
also surprising that no smoothing of market values or interest rates is to
be permitted. A scheme that had an annual valuation on a particularly bad
day for the market could be forced into an injection which would not be
necessary on a broader view.
It has been argued by Mr Alistair Ross Goobey, head of the PosTel pension
fund management firm and a member of the Goode committee, that it could be a
blessing in disguise to be forced to invest at the bottom of the market. But
the threat of a cash hit in the middle of a national financial crisis is the
finance director's nightmare.
How might investment strategies be affected? The simple proposition is that
the holding of a significant proportion of low-risk assets, such as
short-dated bonds or index-linked gilts, will reduce the volatility of the
fund compared with a normal pension fund portfolio, which has more than 80
per cent in UK and overseas equities.
Therefore schemes with weak solvency will be prudent to buy lower-risk
investments, but this will also reduce the expected return. Over the past 30
years the total return on gilts has been on average 5.5 per cent a year less
than on UK equities. A high-gilt strategy would therefore involve
significantly larger regular contributions.
A complicating factor is that the maturity of many UK pension schemes,
especially the large ones, is rapidly increasing. Many have substantially
more pensioners and deferred pensioners on their books than current
employees. So their liabilities are becoming more predictable and can be
safely matched against fixed coupon or index-linked bonds, and are less
easily matched against equities.
On the other hand, this means that the concession compared with the Goode
version, that cash equivalents could be based on high equity returns - and
thus be much cheaper - for younger members, will be less beneficial in a
maturing environment.
There could thus be a double effect as the minimum solvency standard is
phased in over the next six or seven years. Figures released earlier this
week on the investment patterns of UK pension funds in the first quarter of
the year already showed sharply higher purchases of gilts - Pounds 3.3bn,
which was more than in the whole of last year.
Tentative figures in the white paper suggest that the extra gilts required
would be no more than Pounds 9bn.
Funds would not sell UK equities but would run their holdings of overseas
equities and bonds down by about Pounds 7.5bn instead, apparently because
foreign assets would offer a less safe match for UK liabilities. This would
be a comfortable outcome, posing no threat to the UK stock market and
promising a slightly - but not dramatically - easier environment for the
government to finance its deficits.
There is, however, a quite different argument based on the proposition that
it is highly risky for UK pension schemes to hold almost 60 per cent of
their assets in a single asset class (UK equities). Diversification will be
an imperative, and one that would require significantly greater holdings of
overseas assets, as well as gilts.
This could seriously threaten the UK equity market, of which UK pension
funds own about a third.
The government will play down the possibility of such a damaging strategic
upheaval, but the danger cannot be dismissed at this stage. There is no
getting away from the fact that providing effective insurance for schemes
against the impact of securities market disasters is going to cost employers
money. There may need to be further negotiations and adjustments before a
final deal is struck.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Funds face asset allocation
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proposed minimum solvency standard is expected to have a significant
impact on the asset allocation of UK pension funds, reducing the average
fund's proportion of equities to as little as 50 per cent from the current
80 per cent to 85 per cent.
The schemes likely to be affected are those with a 'mature' membership -
schemes which have a disproportionate number of members who are either
already retired or very close to pension age. Schemes that are at or under
the minimum solvency level will also face considerable difficulties if the
proposed timescales for rectifying underfunding are not modified.
The main problem for average and mature schemes is that the long-term
funding for liabilities linked to earnings inflation - as is the case with
future pensions - demands a high equity exposure.
However, the way the solvency level is calculated assumes the company
becomes insolvent tomorrow and therefore the fund requires a much greater
proportion of gilts since these are used to match immediate pension
liabilities.
Consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow estimated that in extreme
circumstances, where a scheme's liabilities related to a membership solely
comprised of pensioners, the fund could have to switch to 100 per cent in
gilts.
The average fund, which has one third of its membership already as
pensioners, could be forced to disinvest up to 30 per cent of its UK and
overseas equity portfolios.
Mr Richard Whitelam, partner with Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said: 'The matched
position for an average scheme with one-third pensioner liability is close
to 50-50 in equities and gilts. This compares with the current Combined
Actuarial Performance Services average distribution of close to 85 per cent
in equities and the remainder in gilts, bonds and cash.'
The impact on the equity markets cannot be gauged at this stage, but it
seems certain that the schemes most likely to be affected are also some of
the UK's largest. Former public sector companies and the heavy manufacturing
industries are the most obvious examples of mature schemes. The mineworkers
scheme, the steel and chemical industry funds, the merchant navy pension
funds and even some of the banks' schemes are considered very mature due to
the shedding of large numbers of staff during the recession and, in some
cases, the privatisation process. Several of these funds are valued in the
Pounds 12bn to Pounds 15bn range.
Where funds switch from equities to bonds the likely impact in reduced
annual returns is dramatic, as can be seen in the table. Mr Eric Lambert,
investment consultant at pension performance measurement company WM, said,
'Each additional 10 per cent of bond investment equates in broad terms to a
reduction in return of 0.3 per cent per annum over periods between 10 and 20
years. An increase of 30 per cent in bond investment could reduce
prospective returns by about 1 per cent per annum.'
Looking ahead, Mr Lambert said that the additional cost in terms of lost
investment opportunity after 20 years for an average UK pension fund of
Pounds 200m that had to switch to a portfolio structure of 50 per cent
equities and 50 per cent bonds would be Pounds 861m.
Mr Ross Russell, a partner with actuaries Hymans Robertson and a member of
the Association of Consulting Actuaries (ACA) pensions committee, said that
employers had an alternative option to switching wholesale out of equities.
'Employers could consider contributing more to the scheme to build up
surplus funds as a buffer against investment fluctuations and other adverse
experience.'
A second alternative, to use futures and options to protect against
investment fluctuations, was not workable because there was insufficient
capacity in the equity markets, he said.
Mr Russell added: 'The ACA's main concern is the tight timescales laid down
to rectify an insolvency position. This could mean that a company has to
make a huge cash injection or create yet another creditor to the company.
'However, despite the categorical wording in the white paper, we understand
that the government intends to seek further consultation on this issue and
we welcome this initiative.'
The government is also understood to be considering a new type of gilt that
would more closely match the future liabilities of schemes under the minimum
solvency standard.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Inflation-link guarantee to
disappear - Deborah Harrison on the 'double blow' proposed changes in the
administration of schemes may deal to consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In April 1997 the government will remove an important inflation-linked
guarantee - known as the guaranteed minimum pension or GMP - provided by the
majority of UK company pension schemes.
Experts say the change will simplify company scheme administration, but the
consumer will lose out. The measure will create a long-term net saving to
the Exchequer of Pounds 1.5bn in the year 2050.
The vast majority of final salary schemes in the UK contract the entire
scheme membership out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps)
and in return pay a reduced rate of National Insurance contribution.
They also have to guarantee to provide a replacement pension that is at
least the equivalent in value to Serps.
However, at present contracted-out members do not forfeit the entire Serps
pension but retain an element of inflation-linked top-up from the state
scheme.
This Serps-matching requirement is particularly valuable for early leavers
because the deferred Serps pension entitlement is increased each year in
line with earnings inflation, unlike most private schemes. Serps pensions
are based on 20 per cent to 25 per cent of NI 'band earnings' - that is,
earnings between Pounds 2,964 and Pounds 22,360 for the current tax year.
Personal pensions and group money purchase schemes contracted out of Serps,
which provide a pension based on investment returns rather than on the
individual's final salary, do not have to provide a GMP.
After 1997 final salary schemes will no longer have to provide the GMP in
order to contract members out of Serps. Instead there will be a general test
based on the 'overall quality of the total benefits offered' which, the
government said, 'should be superior to those offered in Serps'.
Ms Penny Webster, partner with actuarial consultants Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said:
'Scheme members will suffer a double blow. They will lose the valuable
top-up between the value of the GMP and the value of Serps that is currently
provided by the state scheme.
'They will also lose the full inflation-linking of the GMP, particularly
where it is deferred for early leavers.
'The government has simplified the system but at the expense of the
consumer.'
Ms Joanne Segars, pensions officer at the Trades Union Congress, said: 'In
light of (Robert) Maxwell and the personal pensions scandal, the government
should be taking the lead in providing more pension security, not weakening
it.'
The government said the change, which severs the link between contracted-out
occupational schemes and Serps, will simplify and speed up the move to equal
pensions for men and women - a requirement of European Union law.
GMPs are based on the value of Serps and therefore increase at a different
rate for men and women because men are able to draw the state pension at 65
and women at 60.
The white paper also changes the terms for the rebate of NI contributions
paid to contracted-out schemes.
The rebate is calculated as a percentage of band earnings and for the
current tax year is 4.8 per cent (5.4 per cent with tax relief). Those with
personal pensions, who are aged 30 or over, receive an extra 1 per cent.
The government said that all money purchase schemes would in future be
entitled to the bonus for older members but that final salary schemes will
continue to receive a flat-rate rebate.
Moreover, when the government actuary sets the new rebate level in 1997 it
is expected to be higher than the existing figure.
The government hopes this will encourage more people to opt out of Serps to
reduce the long-term financial pressure on the state scheme. The white paper
also introduces changes to improve the flexibility of personal pensions.
First, by extending the limited age-related rebate system the government
aims to make it attractive for employees of all ages to opt out of Serps
whether they have an individual personal pension or are members of a
contracted-out group money purchase scheme.
A second boost to personal pensions is the measure to give investors greater
flexibility over when they convert their investment into an annuity.
The measure would allow individuals to keep their pension fund fully
invested and to postpone the annuity purchase to any age up to 75, instead
of immediately on retirement as at present.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Goode proposals provide basis
for system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The white paper aimed at improving the regulation of occupational pensions
adopts many of the proposals urged by its own advisory panel, the Goode
committee, nine months ago.
The paper is intended to be a blueprint for sweeping legislation which will
be proposed in the next parliamentary session. In spite of clear indications
from Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, in recent weeks that he
would do the opposite, the government has stated its support for a fully
fledged pensions regulator with sweeping powers to intervene in the
activities of pension schemes when members' benefit rights appear to be
threatened.
But contrary to the Goode committee recommendations, the regulator will not
be able to search independently for breaches of the rules. It will instead
have to rely on 'whistle-blowing' by scheme advisers or members.
In another departure from the recommendations, the government has proposed
that the industry, not taxpayers, should pay the estimated Pounds 10m annual
bill for running the office of the pensions regulator. This will be more
than the budget of about Pounds 750,000 available to the Occupational
Pensions Board - which it will replace - because its duties are more
sweeping and it will oversee more schemes.
The government estimates that the legislation would cost the average scheme
with Pounds 16m in assets roughly Pounds 5,160 in additional costs and
Pounds 14,005 in one-off setting-up costs.
The government estimates the cost of the proposals to itself to be Pounds
120m a year due to tax relief for recurrent costs borne by industry, and
Pounds 80m to Pounds 120m for the additional tax relief granted to schemes
that increase their investment in lower yielding assets to meet new solvency
requirements. It expects an additional Pounds 30m in lost tax revenue as
schemes write off the non-recurrent administration costs incurred in
adjusting to new information-keeping and reporting requirements.
The paper proposes some cost savings for employers in its plan to abolish
the Guaranteed Minimum Pension from April 1997. GMP is the portion of
occupational pension intended to provide the same level of benefits as the
State Earnings Related Scheme for which employers receive rebates of
National Insurance Contributions. The white paper proposes continuation of
the rebates but employers will only be required to increase pensions in
payment each year by either retail price inflation or 5 per cent, whichever
is lower.
Currently, the GMP portion of each member's pension must be increased by the
level of earnings inflation, or by 7 per cent each year, or by a maximum of
5 per cent if they are prepared to pay a premium to the state.
The white paper proposes that occupational schemes with 100 members or more
will be required to allow members to appoint a third of all trustees if they
wish. The Confederation of British Industry, the employers' body, had argued
against it, although many of the UK's largest pension schemes have trustee
boards composed of up to 50 per cent members.
The government has rejected the Goode committee's advice to bar employers
from taking cash from their schemes when a surplus is found. The government
will allow employers to take cash out, provided that the scheme rules allow
it. Where the rules do not allow it, they may apply to the regulator for
permission to do so.
The government also rejected advice that it should extend the period which
employers have to wind down a significant cash surplus before attracting
punitive tax charges.
As expected the government is proposing a 'minimum solvency standard'
although it has modified what the Goode committee proposed. The
modifications, suggested by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries are
intended to allow companies to continue to hold large percentages of their
total assets in equities rather than force them to switch into bonds.
Schemes will have to meet 100 per cent of the minimum solvency standard from
1997 and will have up to 10 years to correct any shortfall.
The main points of the proposals are:
A new pensions act to establish a regulator from April 1997. The regulator
will consist of a full-time chairman supported by a board of at least six
part-time members with pensions expertise. It will have an advisory
committee which will represent a broad range of interests. Any decisions
taken by the board will have to be agreed by the majority of its members. It
will have an annual budget of Pounds 10m to be funded by a levy on the
industry based on the size of each scheme.
The regulator's powers will include the ability to select sanctions and
penalties ranging from a reprimand to a fine, removal or disqualification of
trustees and winding up the scheme. A list of potential sanctions is being
drawn up.
All 'defined benefit' schemes which promise a set benefit upon retirement
will be required to meet a minimum solvency standard. The calculation will
be based on so-called cash equivalents - roughly the transfer value of each
member's benefits if he had left the scheme. Following consultation with the
IFA the Goode committee proposals on how to calculate the standard have been
altered. Under government proposals, the calculation of cash equivalents for
younger members will be based on equity yields. As members age, gilt yields
 -typically lower than those on equities - will assume an increasingly
important role.
The solvency standard will begin to take effect in April 1997 and schemes
will have five years to bring their fund up to the requisite level.
Each three years and actuarial valuation will have to include a
certification that the scheme has enough assets to meet all past service
liabilities on wind-up. If not, the trustees must develop a plan to bring
the scheme up to the 100 per cent level over the next three years. This
means that current schemes may not have to meet the solvency standard in
full until 2005.
If the scheme is found to have less than 90 per cent of assets needed to
meet liabilities, it must be funded to the 90 per cent level within three
months either by an immediate cash injection or some other measure.
Alternatives could include a bank guarantee or the creation of some form of
cash reserve, provided trustees were reassured that this was properly
ring-fenced.
In calculating the cost to pension funds of meeting the minimum solvency
standard, the government said that only those pension schemes which were
less than 110 per cent solvent were likely to have to engage in any move out
of equities into lower-yielding gilts. The cost of additional contributions
from this year until 2004 should be no more than Pounds 100m in total for UK
pension schemes. Additionally, the cost of adjusting the investment strategy
would be no more than Pounds 60m to Pounds 140m by 2004.
The government is considering the development of a new type of security
which could provide more appropriate backing for pension schemes'
inflation-linked liabilities.
There will be a compensation scheme for cases where the new Pensions
Compensation Board believes losses to members have occurred as a result of
'dishonest removal of assets', including fraud, theft or other
misappropriation. If the assets of the scheme, as a result, fall below 90
per cent of the minimum solvency standard, there will be powers to authorise
'drip feed' payments to a claimant scheme in the form of loans. Meanwhile,
the trustees of the scheme have a duty to try to recover missing assets. The
scheme will not guarantee that pensioners who lose their benefits through
fraud will be fully compensated. Compensation is not payable on 90 per cent
of the benefits due but on up to 90 per cent of the minimum solvency
standard.
Members of all types of schemes shall have the right to select at least
one-third of all the members of the board of trustees. The minimum number of
trustees in all cases will be at least two, except for small schemes,
defined as those with 100 members or fewer. In such schemes, members shall
have the right to appoint at least one member trustee. Employers will be
required to allow member trustees paid leave to carry out their duties and
to undertake training.
The government opposed the recommendation that for defined contribution
schemes - where benefits are simply accrued contributions plus investment
returns - members be allowed to appoint two-thirds of trustees. Employers
should not have the sole right to appoint trustees and should not be able to
veto a trustee selected by the members.
Scheme actuaries and auditors should not act as trustees except for small
self-administered schemes and the scheme administrator should not be a
scheme trustee.
Also, scheme members should be free to appoint a non-member trustee such as
a trade union representative if the employer agrees. There should be the
power to refer disagreements to the regulator.
The government will allow some changes in employers' freedom to use pension
scheme surpluses. However, it rejected the Goode committee's advice that
employers be barred from refunding cash to themselves from the scheme, even
when scheme rules allow it, unless the pensions regulator agreed. Instead,
for schemes whose trust deeds do allow cash extractions, members will have
the right to challenge trustees' decision and seek the intervention of the
regulator if criteria set out in the trust deed are not complied with.
Where the trust deed does not provide for cash refunds, there should be an
additional requirement that the employer notify scheme members to enable
them to press their case before the regulator. Also, the employer should
inform members why the regulator allowed the refund to be paid.
In earnings-related schemes which require the employer to finance any
shortfall, employers should remain free to take contributions holidays.
However, they may not do so if the effect of the holiday would reduce the
funding level below the 100 per cent minimum solvency standard.
Separately, the government rejected the Goode committee suggestion that
employers be allowed to write off surpluses greater than 105 per cent of
liabilities over a 15-year period before attracting tax penalties. Critics
have said that the current five-year limit encourages employers to take
either refunds or contributions holidays which can quickly lead to scheme
deficits when markets fall sharply in ensuing years.
The government has decided against making any recommendations on the
disposition of pension assets in divorce cases as recommended by the Goode
committee.
The government proposes to break the link between Guaranteed Minimum
Pensions - up to 20 per cent of each employee's pension - and the State
Earnings Related Pension Scheme. This will have benefits for the government,
saving it an estimated Pounds 1.5bn of Serps expenditure by 2050.
Occupational scheme members and providers will continue to receive a
national insurance contribution rebate for each member but schemes will no
longer be required to provide benefits equal to those of Serps.
Employers who qualify for the rebate will be required to uprate the entire
pension by either retail price inflation or 5 per cent, whichever is the
lower. The change will not affect GMP entitlements on service before to
April 1997.
The government expects employers to share in the cost savings of this
measure. Assuming that 80 per cent of pension scheme members are in
contracted-out (where GMP is paid instead of Serps) salary-related schemes,
the entire sector will see recurrent funding savings of Pounds 90m. This
will be offset, however, by non-recurrent costs for scheme administration of
Pounds 95m.
Other changes have been proposed to improve flexibility for non-occupational
scheme members.
Personal pension holders and members of money-purchase schemes will be
entitled to age-related rebates. This will give smaller tax incentives to
young people to encourage them to contract out of Serps via personal
pensions but tax rebates will rise as they age to discourage them from
contracting back into Serps.
Also, the government is proposing to relax its strict rules requiring a
retiring individual to put all the assets into an annuity immediately when a
personal pension matures. This has forced some individuals to buy annuities
at the top of the market, severely reducing the scale of benefits they
receive. Instead, individuals will be allowed to delay purchasing an annuity
until the age of 75.
Those who do defer purchasing an annuity will be allowed to draw sums from
their pension fund, subject to strict annual limits to ensure that the fund
is still sufficient to purchase broadly the same pension as it would have
done at normal retirement age.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Doubts over who pays for
policing - Roland Rudd explains fears about factors which may undermine the
effectiveness of the new regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday outlined a regulatory structure in its white paper
which it said would prevent another Maxwell scandal. But by rejecting the
Goode committee recommendation that it should be funded by the state it has
raised questions about the effectiveness of the new regime.
Ministers want the regulator to be funded by an increased levy on schemes,
saying that those who benefit from the regulatory framework should pay for
it. This has raised fears that ministers may have weakened the regulator's
independence - and consequently its ability to prevent further pension fraud
 -by making it dependent on the industry.
Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, said: 'Does it really
buttress the independence of the post to leave the regulator dependent on a
levy of the industry? How will it be able to stop the next fraud from
happening?'
The government's decision to make the regulator's full-time board more than
an advisory committee - by requiring a majority vote - also raises fears
that the regulator might become too dependent on members close to employer
organisations.
Ministers are proposing a raft of changes such as giving scheme members the
right to appoint at least one-third of trustees and a duty on some auditors
and scheme actuaries to speak out against fraudulent practice.
The most important proposal of the white paper, however, concerns the role
of regulator since it will be responsible for enforcing the new regime. To a
large extent it will depend on who Mr Peter Lilley, social services
secretary, picks as the regulator and to what extent the regulator is
responsible to parliament. This is why Mr Jeremy Corbyn, a Labour member of
the social security committee, wanted the regulator to be appointed by
parliament.
Mr Lilley has reassured most backbenchers he has clamped down on the
potential for pension fraud by advocating a regulator that will have most of
the powers recommended by the Goode committee, but remains unencumbered by
bureaucratic procedures.
Concerns remain, however, both in parliament and the industry, that the
regulator might still not be powerful enough to prevent further scandals.
Auditors and actuaries will have a duty to 'blow the whistle' to the
regulator that could be be hard to enforce. It is not clear what protection
auditors and actuaries will have when reporting information to the
regulator. Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, said: 'A
whistle-blowing auditor wouldn't have remained the late Bob Maxwell's
auditor for many moons.'
Mr Lilley said the new regulator would have a pro-active role in preventing
pensions fraud and would not have to wait for a whistle to be blown.
He also said that while auditors would be duty bound by the legislation to
pass on information to the regulator they would have a 'powerful defence'
against legal action.
But one company of auditors said such a powerful defence might not be enough
to persuade all auditors to 'rat on their client' if it meant that they
could lose the business.
There are fears in the industry that the regulator will not be active enough
in preventing fraud.
While the regulator will be able to investigate suspicions and might develop
a system of checks and investigations, the government has said it will not
interfere into what it calls 'well-run schemes'.
Mr Martin Miles, a consultant with the pension consultants Bacon &amp; Woodrow,
said: 'There are still grey areas concerning the role of the regulator. It
does not look like he will have the same power as Lautro, the
self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, for example, to
conduct spot checks.'
Mr Lilley said the regulator would have the power to interfere if he thought
something was wrong, such as a constant change in auditors.
But while the regulator has the power to act at the first sign of trouble,
he is not being invited to try to prevent fraud before it happens.
Mr Lilley concluded his statement in parliament by saying that he was
certain that the industry remained 'very aware and concerned in the wake of
the Maxwell affair and is on its guard against fraud'.
The test of the new regime will be whether the regulator manages to run a
system independent of the industry that prevents fraud in the longer term,
when the immediate memory of the Maxwell scandal has faded.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Blair's vision targets consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday held out a vision of Labour as the party of national
renewal - as an opinion poll showed that he would boost his party's overall
popularity if elected leader.
In a 20-page manifesto for the contest to succeed John Smith, Mr Blair
promised to develop a modernised Labour party committed to consumer rights.
Mr Blair's manifesto shuns interventionism, nationalisation and economic
isolationism. But there are few specific policy commitments in the paper,
which was accompanied by a four-page colour brochure aimed at the 4.3m
voters in Labour's leadership election.
The social democratic language of the manifesto does open a clear
ideological gap between Mr Blair and the two traditional socialist
candidates - Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting leader, and Mr John Prescott,
shadow employment secretary.
Mr Blair said he was seeking to modernise Labour's traditional values,
rather than abandon them. Supporters of the two leftwing candidates said he
was scrapping the party's basic principles.
The manifesto also says that the market economy is in the public interest,
and indicates that a Blair government would limit intervention to
'developing and guiding' industry in areas such as technological innovation
and research and development.
It endorses Labour's policies on progressive taxation, devolution, education
and training, parliamentary and local government reform, crime prevention,
minimum wages and the European Union, including lukewarm support for a
single currency.
The manifesto is strongly consumer-orientated, reflecting Mr Blair's
conviction that Labour can win the next general election by appealing to a
wide range of people disillusioned by economic decline and social disarray.
Today's opinion poll, conducted by MORI for the Times, shows that Labour
support would increase by about 3 percentage points if Mr Blair became the
party leader.
According to the poll, the party ratings over the last month (with those for
the end of May in brackets) are: Labour 52 per cent (46 per cent),
Conservatives 24 per cent (27 per cent), Liberal Democrats 20 per cent (23
per cent).
But the 'Blair factor' would increase Labour's rating to 55 per cent, reduce
the Tories to 23 per cent, and send the Liberal Democrats down to 18 per
cent.
Mr Blair is rated higher than Mr John Major and Mr Paddy Ashdown on who
would be best at understanding world problems, Britain's problems,
representing Britain in Europe and at handling Britain's economy.
On understanding Britain's problems, Mr Blair is regarded as best by 40 per
cent, Mr Major by 16 per cent and Ashdown by 20 per cent.
Mrs Beckett is expected to issue her manifesto next week.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Clarke heads off calls to cut taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday put tax cuts on the back burner
by warning the cabinet that reductions in public spending would be
'extremely tough'.
Facing renewed rightwing calls for early tax cuts to restore Tory
popularity, Mr Clarke told ministers not to underestimate the difficulty of
achieving existing fore-casts.
Backed by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Mr
Clarke said all the obvious targets for cuts had been tackled in last year's
public spending round.
The chancellor's warnings, delivered at the beginning of a one-hour debate
on public spending, forestalled any discussion of tax cuts by the cabinet's
rightwing minority.
The cabinet did not discuss undershooting the Treasury's 'control totals'
for non-cyclical spending of Pounds 263bn for the coming financial year and
Pounds 272.3bn for 1996-97.
Downing Street said spending would be kept 'within' the control totals,
renamed ceilings to emphasise the Treasury's view of them as limits rather
than targets.
Mr Clarke told the cabinet his strategy would keep growth of public spending
during the period to 1997 below growth in the economy as a whole. He said
the government remained committed to reducing the proportion of national
output taken by the state, which would, in turn, reduce the public sector
deficit.
Mr Clarke has said that he will not cut taxes until a looser fiscal stance
is justified by reductions in the public sector borrowing requirement. But
his remarks keep open the option of tax cuts in 1995 or 1996, which would
satisfy many backbenchers who believe tax will be the main issue in the next
general election.
In the City, analysts remained worried that ministers might be tempted into
tax cuts in an attempt to restore the government's declining popularity.
'If they can deliver spending cuts in 1994, they may be able to cut taxes in
1995,' said Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at James Capel. 'But we do need
to see actual cuts in spending rather than vague trimming of the contingency
reserve.'
Ms Harriet Harman, the shadow chief secretary, accused the government of
endangering Britain's long-term economic prospects by planning further cuts
in public investment.
'Cuts in public investment will simply exacerbate Britain's chronic economic
problems of under-investment and under-capacity,' she said.
Detailed analysis of the prospects for public spending cuts will be carried
out by the EDX committee, chaired by the chancellor, which will report to
the cabinet in the autumn.
The committee is expected to look hard at the scope for cuts in the Pounds
85bn social security budget, the criminal justice system and the running
costs of government departments.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Prescott urges industrial revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, yesterday sought to put
his commitment to Labour's traditional values in a modern setting by calling
for a joint public and private-sector initiative to revitalise core
industries.
Mr Prescott, who is standing on a traditional socialist platform in Labour's
leadership and deputy leadership elections, accused the government of
deliberately destroying core industries as part of an attack on unions.
He told the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation conference in Jersey that a
joint initiative was the only way to revitalise industries such as
shipbuilding, railways, steel and coal.
'It is a national disgrace that the government has destroyed the capacity of
these core industries through a deliberate policy of industrial vandalism,
designed to attack the power of trade unions,' he said.
But he said Britain must work in harmony with its European Union partners,
using the European recovery, infrastructure and regional funds to stimulate
industrial recovery. 'International finance, co-ordinated international
recovery and co-operative international social policy is the reality of our
traditional values in a modern setting,' he said.
Mr Prescott's remarks were in line with attempts during the campaign to
dilute his image as an opponent of Labour's modernisation drive.
But he reaffirmed his commitment to the use of targets to measure the
progress of a Labour government towards achieving full employment. The use
of targets has been rejected by Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary and
favourite to succeed John Smith as leader. Mr Prescott said it would be 'a
moral outrage if we accepted mass unemployment as a permanent feature of our
economy'.
Mr Prescott called in an interview in the Daily Mirror for a 'massive
training programme' funded by a levy on companies.

FT  24 JUN 94 / SFO wins test case on silence clause
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office yesterday won a test case over its powers to remove
a suspect's right to silence, John Mason writes.
Giving judgment after a judicial review, two High Court judges ruled that Mr
Larry Trachtenberg, one of six men charged over the Maxwell affair, had no
reasonable excuse when he refused to answer the SFO's questions during a
'section 2' interview.
Under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 suspects are obliged to
answer questions put to them by SFO investigators unless they have a
reasonable excuse.
After his arrest in June 1992 Mr Trachtenberg, a former adviser to Robert
Maxwell, refused to answer questions and was charged with a breach of
section 2.
In February last year a stipendiary magistrate at Clerkenwell magistrates
court, London, ordered Mr Trachten-berg's acquittal, accepting his argument
that he had a reasonable excuse not to answer questions because he had
already been arrested and charged. The High Court judges yesterday
overturned the magistrate's ruling, saying his approach to the case had been
'fundamentally flawed'.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Truce agreed on future of Smithfield market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, and the
Smithfield Market Tenants' Association yesterday agreed a truce in the
long-running dispute over funding the market which at one point had
threatened the City's constitution.
The dispute, triggered by disagreements over how to pay for the Pounds 60m
refurbishment of the meat market required by European hygiene regulations,
had led to attempts by Smithfield traders to pack the electoral register for
December's elections to the City's Court of Common Council.
Under the City's medieval constitution, some wards have fewer than 100
electors, making them an easy target for special-interest groups.
Senior corporation officials feared that the traders could win as many as a
third of the seats, inflicting critical damage on the organisation's
political credibility. They had encouraged private companies and
partnerships to boost the numbers of staff they put on the electoral roll.
Preliminary indications are that the register has several thousand more
names on it this year than it did last.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy committee, said
that the City would continue with plans to reform the franchise - which
would require an act of parliament - even though the Smithfield campaign had
ended.
He said: 'You can be quite sure we will be reviewing this year's events and
coming forward with a reform package we will put to the government, even
though they are not very sympathetic.'
The traders' campaign appears to have won concessions.
The City is spending an extra Pounds 2m, spread over five years, to add to
the Pounds 10m in subsidies during that period which it had already agreed.
The tenants have accepted an increase in the rents which they must pay per
square foot from Pounds 13 to Pounds 20.
At one point they had claimed they would be asked to pay an extra 400 per
cent, and that the corporation's proposals would mean closure of the market.
They also challenged the City's actions unsuccessfully in the courts.
Mr John Brewster, chairman of the tenants' association, said he was
delighted by the agreement, while Mr Cassidy said the City and the tenants
would now be able 'to work together to make Smithfield the best market in
Europe'.
The corporation has already spent Pounds 27m building new trading and office
accommodation, and will continue with plans to spend another Pounds 33m on
improving listed buildings and the basement car park, and providing new
commercial office space.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Steel to stand down as MP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, announced last night that he
would be standing down as an MP at the next general election.
He told his local constituency association that he would not contest the
seat of Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale again and would contemplate 'doing
something equally constructive and challenging with the remaining decades of
my working life'.
Sir David, 56, has probably been the most active and outstanding Liberal MP
over the past two decades. He said yesterday that he would be relinquishing
the post of foreign affairs spokesman for his party at the end of the
current session of parliament to concentrate on his role as head of the
Liberal International.
One factor influencing the MP's decision is that the boundaries of his
constituency are due to be changed drastically in a forthcoming review.
Sir David acknowledged last night that the changes would pose no serious
problem for his Liberal Democrat successor in a seat which will remain a
straight fight between the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates.
However, much of the new territory in the constituency will have a strong
Labour following. 'Time and effort will be required to convince former
Labour voters of the political realities in their new home, where the Labour
vote is small,' he said last night. 'Frankly it makes every sense for this
to be undertaken by a new and younger candidate.'
Sir David, Liberal leader from 1976 to 1988, first entered parliament in
March 1965.
In 1967 he piloted a landmark reform of the abortion law through parliament.
From 1977 to 1979 his party sustained the Labour government in a
parliamentary agreement.
In the 1980s he steered his party into an alliance with the Social
Democratic party. They later fought two elections under the Alliance banner,
and Sir David once famously told activists to 'go back to your
constituencies and prepare for government'.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Stock Exchange probes up 60%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of investigations carried out by the London Stock Exchange into
possible breaches of trading and reporting rules rose more than 60 per cent
last year.
Its market supervision department carried out almost 500 investigations into
possible rule breaches compared with just over 295 in 1992-93.
According to the exchange's annual report, the number of cases relating to
unusual trading that were passed on to other agencies for further
investigation or prosecution also increased, from 62 to 75 in the year to
end-March 1994. It carried out more than 450 investigations into unusual
trading patterns or events.
Setting out planned management changes, Mr Michael Lawrence, chief
executive, said that he had begun seeking a new head of regulation. The
regulation activities include the role of Competent Authority for Listing
and supervision of the markets.
The report also revealed that the exchange had made a post-tax profit of
Pounds 4m after four successive years of deficit. Pre-tax profit of Pounds
18.9m compares with an Pounds 11.9m loss in 1992-93.
The Pounds 21.9m fall in operating costs, to Pounds 190.2m, is mainly the
result of no longer having to bear the costs of developing Taurus, the
discarded plans for a paperless settlement system, which totalled Pounds 38m
in 1992-93.
Costs for a replacement have risen by Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 11.6m.
The 1993-94 accounts include Pounds 20m provisions for the exchange's
leasehold properties because the fall in market rents means that it now
expects to incur 'a material loss'. This follows an initial Pounds 4m
provision in 1993.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Music to the industry's ears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monopoly situations exist in both the music production and retailing
industries, but neither operates against the public interest, the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission said yesterday.
The commission, which published its report on the UK music industry
yesterday, found that prices of compact discs in the UK were not excessive.
It said prices were 'set at levels determined by effective competition in
the UK market'.
The five leading music companies form a complex monopoly, it said, which
means that they engage in practices which prevent, restrict or distort
competition. The five - EMI, PolyGram, Sony, Warner and BMG - account for
about 70 per cent of the UK market.
Among the practices referred to by the commission are restrictions on
parallel imports, which allow music companies to block imports of their own
products from abroad.
The commission said lifting restrictions on parallel imports would be
contrary to the European Union rental directive and would increase the risk
of music piracy. It said it did not think freer imports of music would
result in lower prices. Some countries with no parallel import restrictions
had higher CD prices than the UK, it said.
The music companies' complex monopoly did not operate against the public
interest, the commission said. It added: 'The majors compete vigorously
amongst themselves and also with the independent sector, consisting of some
600 companies.'
The commission said that, in record retailing, WH Smith and its subsidiary
Our Price constitute a scale monopoly, as they supply more than a quarter of
the market.
However, it added that the WH Smith group, which accounts for 26.6 per cent
of UK music sales, operated in a competitive market and did not make
excessive music retailing profits.
The commission also said there was no case for changing the contracts
between artists and record companies. The commission said the proper forum
for resolving disputes between artists and companies was in the courts.
Pop singer George Michael failed this week in his attempt to get the High
Court to declare his contract with Sony unenforceable.
Nevertheless, the commission found that contracts have generally moved in
artists' favour during the past 20 years. It said advances and royalty rates
had increased and the length of contracts had come down.

The detachment crossed into Rwanda from Zaire and de-ployed at a refugee
camp near the town of Cyangugu, where thousands of minority Tutsis are
threatened with death at the hands of Hutu militias, a senior French officer
said.
The mission marked the start of the United Nations-backed Operation
Turquoise, following the arrival of French troops and equipment in eastern
Zaire. Highlighting lukewarm European Union support, France was forced to
charter four huge Soviet-built Antonov 124 transport aircraft from the
Russian state airline, Aeroflot, to help fly troops and material from Istres
in southern France.
French diplomats struggled to find more partners as French humanitarian
agencies, intellectuals and parliamentarians warned the action could worsen
the genocide which is already estimated to have claimed 500,000 lives.
The French intervention is fiercely opposed by the rebel Rwanda Patriotic
Front (FPR). Dismissing assurances that the military operation was purely
humanitarian, the RPF representative in Europe said French troops would be
regarded as aggressors and confronted. Mr Jacques Bihozagara, apparently
unswayed by talks with the French foreign minister, Mr Alain Juppe, said the
French action was designed to give Rwandan government forces 'a breathing
space'.
The French military official said the first troops to enter Rwanda, a small
motorised detachment of some 50 men, 'was fairly well received by
administrative authorities and local inhabitants' in Cyangugu and at a camp
containing between 5,000 and 10,000 refugees a few kilometres outside the
town. 'The detachment will carry out a census and take the first
humanitarian measures,' the official said.
The French have emphasised that they do not intend to set up bases inside
Rwanda. Most troops will be based in Bakavu and Goma in eastern Zaire, but
make short forays into the west of Rwanda, where thousands of persecuted
Tutsis are herded in concentration camps guarded by Hutus.
The RPF rebels distrust Paris because of its military and financial support
for the government of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana until his death in an air
crash on April 6. Having bolstered Rwanda's crumbling army with military
advisers, weapons, armoured cars and helicopters, France is regarded as an
accomplice to the slaughter of Tutsis and Hutu opponents of the Habyarimana
regime following his death.
The UN mandate authorises French troops to use force if attacked.
In Paris, Mr Juppe yesterday sought to lay down the military and political
risks in the face of hostility from rebels controlling two-thirds of the
country. 'Senegalese soldiers will be at our side and discussions are in
train with Guinea-Bissau,' he told the French Senate yesterday. Senegal is
to send troops it had already agreed to contribute to the planned UN force
due in Rwanda in late July when France intends to withdraw.
Mr Juppe said he hoped European countries would give France the logistic
support the US has already pledged. France will be pressing its European
Union partners for backing when the Twelve start their summit in Corfu later
today, Mr Alain Lamassoure, French EU affairs minister, said yesterday,
adding that while 'there might be 10 good reasons for not intervening, the
one essential reason for doing so is that a whole people is in the course of
dying'.
The French are setting up hospitals on the Zaire border. But it is not clear
whether they will just seek to evacuate refugees and wounded, or try to set
up safe zones as they and other UN peacekeepers have sought to do in Bosnia.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Britons held by Kashmir militants set free
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two Britons held by Moslem militants in Kashmir for 17 days were set free
unharmed yesterday.
Mr Kim Housego, 16-year-old son of a former Financial Times correspondent,
and Mr David Mackie, a 36-year-old London video director, were released to
local journalists who delivered them to Mr David Fitton, a British diplomat,
in Srinagar, summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.
'We were treated well the whole time. They gave us plenty of food and extra
blankets,' Kim Housego said. The militants, numbering about 20, had moved
hideouts frequently since kidnapping the pair while they were on separate
trekking holidays.
Four Kashmiri journalists were summoned yesterday to Anantnag, south of
Srinagar. Eight militants, some of them armed, handed over the Britons and
insisted they should not be taken to the police in Anantnag but be delivered
to their families in Srinagar. David and Jenny Housego, Kim's parents, were
in Anantnag awaiting the release, but eventually heard that their son and Mr
Mackie were free and in Srinagar.
Mr David Housego, former FT New Delhi correspondent and now a Delhi
businessman, was at the centre of attempts to secure the release. Operating
from a houseboat in Srinagar, he secured an undertaking from the Indian
authorities to refrain from actions which could jeopardise a safe release
and travelled into the mountains to meet the militants last weekend.
There had been signs release was imminent for several days. But efforts
appeared to have been set back on Monday by the murder near Anantnag of Mr
Qazi Nissar, a Kashmiri Moslem leader acting as an intermediary with the
kidnappers. The murder, which caused public outrage in Kashmir, appeared
unconnected with the kidnap. Mr Housego yesterday described Mr Nissar as a
'generous and warm man'.
Messages from the Pakistani government and Pakistan-based militant groups,
calling for release of the captives, had clearly influenced the kidnappers,
Mr Housego said.
The Harkat-ul-Ansar group took responsibility for the kidnap although its
leader in Pakistani Kashmir called for the captives' release. The
kidnappers' demand for release of three jailed leaders was quickly dropped
as they saw they had no support.
Kashmiri militant groups, who oppose Indian rule in the disputed territory,
have been embarrassed by the kidnap; they saw it as hampering their efforts
to publicise alleged human rights violations by Indian security forces in
Kashmir. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, expressed his delight at the
release and thanked the governments of India and Pakistan for their
'co-operation and support'.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Chinese ask to adjourn Hong Kong talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A high-level meeting of British and Chinese diplomats discussing Hong Kong's
future yesterday took a dramatic turn when the Chinese side requested a
suspension of the talks until Monday.
The two sides said the adjournment of the 29th meeting of the Joint Liaison
Group was needed so that a sub-group negotiating the transfer of military
land could have more time for agreement.
It is believed the Chinese negotiating team needed time to refer to Beijing
for fresh instructions after Britain refused to improve on its final offer.
Today's meeting of a joint group discussing finance for Hong Kong's
multi-billion-dollar airport project is unaffected by the suspension of the
JLG, the first such interruption of a JLG session since it began talks in
the mid-1980s.
However, optimism about a settlement of airport financing at this meeting
has given way to caution.
In spite of encouraging remarks by senior Chinese government officials, a
deal looks less certain, government officials said late yesterday.
The issue of defence lands has proved one of the most difficult for Britain
and China to resolve. For the past seven years the two have been negotiating
about how many of the 39 military sites will go to the People's Liberation
Army.
The sticking-point in the present talks, raised late on Wednesday, is
understood to be a Chinese demand that the British guarantee completion of
more than HKDollars 3.5bn (Pounds 298m)-worth of work on PLA military
facilities.
These include the construction of a base for the Chinese navy.
China has made this demand because the UK cannot guarantee that Hong Kong's
Legislative Council (LegCo), which has to approve all government spending,
will agree to vote the money as asked.
British officials hope that China's new demand is simply a gambit by
negotiators to show their superiors in Beijing that they have tried hard to
secure the best deal possible.
They see no chance of the UK Treasury underwriting the cost of Chinese
military facilities.
These officials point out that a failure to agree terms by July 6, when
LegCo rises, means the Hong Kong government will be unable to finish the
naval base by mid-1997 when sovereignty of Hong Kong passes to China.
The British objective has been to get the Chinese military to accept as few
of the military facilities in Hong Kong as possible. The UK also wants the
PLA to accept that when military land becomes surplus to requirement, it
should revert to the Hong Kong government for redevelopment.
There is considerable unease in Hong Kong about the stationing of the PLA in
the colony. Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's ailing leader, has decreed there will
be a PLA presence in Hong Kong. It is generally assumed this force will
number some 10,000 soldiers and a naval contingent whose strength is
unknown.

FT  24 JUN 94 / The rising yen: it was not always thus - William Dawkins
tracks the Japanese currency from Dollars parity in 1874
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese exporters who complain about their currency's historic break
through Y100 to the dollar might cheer themselves up by looking back 120
years.
For the yen was as mighty as the dollar itself when it was born as a
gold-backed internationally negotiable currency in 1874, by order of the
young Emperor Meiji. Since then, it has neatly moved from a yen to the
dollar to a yen to the cent.
The first gold yen coins were minted on presses imported from Hong Kong when
Japan was running a heavy trade deficit to feed its breakneck modernisation
from medieval to industrialised country.
The name yen, meaning 'round', was introduced by educated urbanites in the
1950s to replace the untranslatable ryo, the forerunner of the modern yen.
The ryo and the multiple rival paper notes issued by warring daimyos, heads
of feudal clans, were of such uncertain value that traders and financiers
used a parallel tender, Mexican dollars issued by the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Bank's Yokohama branch. These, still in circulation until the turn of the
century, were the precursors of the first yen notes issued by commercial
banks in the late 1870s, followed by government issued paper with the
foundation of the Bank of Japan in 1882.
The emperor fixed the 1874 yen at 1.5g of gold, the same as the dollar of
the time. Today, the same weight of gold is worth Dollars 586.
Of course, the yen has been revalued several times since then and Japan's
currency has been as volatile as the country's own fortunes over the past
century.
From its mighty birth, the yen steadily grew mightier, so that it was worth
Y0.23 - or 23 sen - to the dollar by the outbreak of war with the US in
1941, according to Japan's central bank.
The yen came out of international circulation during and just after the war.
Hyperinflation caused its value to collapse dramatically, forcing the
authorities in 1946 to redenominate, by slicing two zeros off the face
value.
The debate over whether to redenominate the yen again - which would restore
parity with the dollar - has resurfaced several times, most recently after
the 1986 round of yen appreciation, or endaka. Proponents believe it might
stimulate consumer spending by making people feel their yen are even more
valuable, but bankers in Tokyo scoff at the idea.
In 1949, the US occupying forces fixed the Japanese currency at Y360 to the
dollar, its rate when Japan entered the International Monetary Fund three
years later. At first, Mr Ralph Young, the US Federal Reserve's emissary to
Japan advised a rate of Y270 to Y300. In the event, Japanese industry was
let off lightly.
Japan's rapid industrialisation in the 1960s made Y360 clearly undervalued
by the time the US abandoned the gold link in 1971. It shot up to Y270 in
less than a year, at which it hovered for nine months, a rare period of
stability, until the first oil crisis.
The surge in oil prices hit the economy so hard - even causing the neon
lights to go out in Ginza, Tokyo's prestigious shopping area, recalls one
seasoned observer - that the exchange rate slumped quickly back to Y300.
The yen dipped again after the 1979 oil price shock, tantalisingly
suggesting a pattern: that it should go down when commodity prices go up, as
they are doing now. 'High commodity prices are very bad for Japan's terms of
trade. That's one of the reasons why I fail to get excited by the yen's
present strength,' says Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring
Securities in Tokyo.
The yen started to climb again with the 1980s export boom, as Japanese cars
and cheap high quality consumer electronics swept Europe and the US. The
easing of US monetary policy, reinforced by the 1985 Plaza accord to curb
the value of the dollar, caused the yen to shoot off again to around Y140 by
the end of the decade, its value virtually doubling in the 1980s.
The yen was supported for a while by Japan's economic 'bubble'. And then,
perversely, the onset of recession at the start of the 1990s pushed it up
even higher, to nearly Y100 last August, as a fall in imports caused the
export-dependent economy to record an increasingly wide current account
surplus.
In contrast to previous sharp rises, the latest surge, to Y99.85 at one
point, has more to to with the dollar's weakness against European currencies
than with any inherent talent of the yen for defying gravity.
On Tuesday the Asahi Shimbun electronic newsboard, on top of a Ginza
towerblock, flashed the news to the crowds below that the yen had crashed
through Y100. For the viewers below, the figure could have been a symbol of
short-term complications for the economy or as one more indicator of the
country's economic rise.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Arafat sits tight for a better financial deal: PLO chief
delays trip to liberated Palestine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The timing of Mr Yassir Arafat's first visit to the newly-liberated areas of
Palestine could be decided as a result of emergency meetings in Washington
today involving leading members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
the World Bank and US officials.
Mr Arafat, chairman of the PLO, has delayed announcing a date for his trip
largely because he is not satisfied with the financial arrangements for the
new self-governing authority which will take over responsibility for the
Gaza strip, Jericho and later much of the West Bank.
More than Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) has so far been pledged by
international donors for development projects in the territories over the
next five years, but serious problems have arisen over start-up costs of the
new Palestinian authority and covering its budget deficit in the first year
of operation.
Mr Ahmed Qurei, also known as Abu Ala, who heads the Palestinian Economic
Council for Reconstruction and Development (Pecdar), told donors earlier
this month that Dollars 177m needed to be paid into a Palestinian account.
'Without it, we cannot build new administrations, or pay the police force
and employees.'
Mr Arafat said in Tunis on Tuesday that offers of cash aid so far were
'derisory'. Senior officials added that he would not decide on the date of
his trip to Jericho until the issue was resolved.
Aid donors have pledged Dollars 720m out of Dollars 2.3bn for the first
year, of which Dollars 80m has been disbursed and a further Dollars 350m
committed to specific projects. However, legal restraints prevent some
governments from transferring aid pledges into direct budget support, while
others are demanding additional 'transparency and accountability' by
Palestinian institutions before releasing funds.
The cost of covering start-up costs of the new Palestinian authority and its
budget deficit this year is put at Dollars 168m. Some Dollars 91m had
already been pledged before a donors' meeting in Paris earlier this month,
which brought further commitments of Dollars 42m, including contributions
from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which had previously refused to consider any
direct cash payments to the Palestinians.
These contributions have been paid into the Holst Fund, named after Mr Johan
Joergen Holst, the late Norwegian foreign minister, who played such a
central role in facilitating the September 13 outline peace accord signed by
the PLO and Israel. The fund, administered by the World Bank, stands at
about Dollars 55m. PLO officials, headed by Mr Qurei, wish to know from the
bank how quickly this money can be disbursed.
At the same time, the PLO team will seek US help in pressing other donor
nations to provide the remaining Dollars 35m required to satisfy budget and
other costs until the end of this year. Members of Pecdar have emphasised it
is difficult to engage in planning longer-term projects while immediate
financing requirements for 1994 remain uncertain.
Mr Arafat appears equally determined not to make his trip to the territories
without having at his finger tips at least some of the financial patronage
which over many years has helped sustain his authority.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Death drug share sales investigated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's securities industry watchdog yesterday raided a drug wholesaler,
Nippon Shoji, at the centre of a scandal over alleged share sales by 175
employees and their relatives just before an announcement linking the
company's shingles drug to the deaths of 15 patients.
The raid was the first by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance
Commission, which the government established two years ago to clean up the
image of the Japanese securities industry after an embarrassing spate of
brokers' scandals.
Before the raid, which came after several days of press speculation, the
allegation that company officials had profited from their knowledge of the
patients' misfortune had stirred outrage, even though insider trading is
often taken for granted by the public.
Deaths caused by side effects of a drug manufactured and distributed by the
Osaka-based Nippon Shoji provoked criticism last October, when the company
conceded that, for some patients, the drug could be fatal. But the new
allegations have deepened the public's mistrust of Japan's health
establishment.
The shingles drug case comes after the deaths of 20 patients taking an
anti-cancer drug.
This case late last year had prompted a dispute among officials at the
Health Ministry, drug companies and doctors, who blamed each other for the
deaths. The ministry has since agreed to disclose its evaluation procedure
for new drugs.
Yesterday's investigation follows an earlier probe into the case by the
Osaka securities exchange. A total 175 company employees and their families
are suspected of selling Nippon Shoji shares before last October's
announcement by the government.
Nippon Shoji, which is listed on the second section of the Osaka securities
exchange, started falling a few hours before the Health Ministry's
announcement, closing down 7.6 per cent on the day at Y3,150. The stock
declined a further 15.5 per cent following the release.
Following numerous many allegations of unfair trade practices during the
stock market 'bubble' of the late 1980s, the Ministry of Finance tightened
Japan's regulations on insider trading and set up its own version of the US
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Nippon Shoji case has allowed the
watchdog, criticised for its ineffectiveness, to show some teeth.
In a related development, officials at Eisai, another leading drug maker
which was helping Nippon Shoji with the promotion of Sorivudine, said it had
launched its own investigation on possible insider trading among its
employees.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Clinton's team breathes easy at N Korea accord: George
Graham reports on a sense of relief in Washington that there was a third way
to resolve a thorny foreign affairs issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enormous relief was expressed in Washington yesterday at the emergence of an
agreement with North Korea that would freeze Pyongyang's nuclear programme
and pave the way for talks in Geneva next month.
Clinton administration officials had adopted a wait-and-see approach after
former president Jimmy Carter returned from Pyongyang last week with an
offer that apparently met US conditions for resuming talks.
When official confirmation finally arrived on Wednesday, it allowed the US
to embrace Mr Carter's deal, a third option far more palatable than the
policies of economic sanctions or military action which appeared a week ago
to be all that remained.
The pursuit of economic sanctions at the United Nations never seemed very
promising. North Korea's limited economic links with the rest of the world
made it largely immune to such economic pressure, in the unlikely event that
neighbouring China would agree to a strong sanctions resolution.
The option of bombing North Korea's nuclear facilities, advocated by several
senior officials from the administration of former President George Bush,
though in the more clinical language of 'eliminating reprocessing capacity',
carried with it the possibility of provoking at least some counter-attack on
South Korea, if not a full-blown second Korean war.
It remains to be seen how complete the victory will prove to be. North
Korea's President Kim Il-sung may have folded, but poker rules allow him to
keep his cards concealed, and the truth about nuclear fuel extracted in the
past may now never be established.
For an apparent success, however, the US's achievement in getting Pyongyang
to agree to a freeze on its nuclear development was greeted with an unusual
degree of criticism.
Why did the White House not come up on its own with Mr Carter's blindingly
simple idea of talking directly to President Kim? Was it the White House's
failure to brief Mr Carter properly that led him to say prematurely last
week that the drive for sanctions had been called off? Why did President
Clinton appear over the weekend to disown Mr Carter, only to embrace him
again on Wednesday when he received confirmation from Pyongyang that the
deal did indeed correspond with what the former president had announced?
These were the questions being asked.
White House officials were irked by the carping tone with which their
announcement was received.
'When we have just had a positive step forward, I find it strange to
speculate on how we messed it, so I'll try to get my mind around that,'
sniffed one senior administration official.
The whole episode, coming on the heels of about-turns and waverings on
China, Haiti and half a dozen other international problems, has reinforced
the image of Mr Clinton's foreign policy team as 'the gang that couldn't
shoot straight'.
The criticism may be unfair, but at the least, the Clinton team is the gang
whose every shot is going to be viewed as astray by a White House press
corps whose binoculars are trained firmly on the trigger finger, not on the
target.

FT  24 JUN 94 / French troops poised to enter Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French troops flew into eastern Zaire yesterday in readiness for Operation
Turquoise - the controversial military expedition to rescue civilians
trapped in Rwanda's genocidal war.
Transport aircraft landed the first soldiers of a 2,500-strong force at
airfields in Bukavu and Goma on the shores of Lake Kivu. From there, the
military intends to make short forays into western Rwanda, where thousands
of persecuted Tutsis are herded in concentration camps guarded by Hutu
militias. France won the UN Security Council's blessing for its mission of
mercy despite international scepticism, a shortage of allies on the ground
and the bitter opposition of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which
believes France is intervening to deny them an outright victory in the civil
war.
Yesterday, however, the RPF seemed to be softening its opposition to French
intervention. 'If the French stick to their humanitarian mandate, and do not
interfere in our struggle, then we will have no quarrel with them,' Dr
Emmanuel Ndahiro, the RPF's military spokesman, said from the capital,
Kigali. 'But we still have misgivings about the French operation. We cannot
exonerate them from the crimes committed by the Rwandan government.'
The rebels distrust Paris because of its military and financial support for
the government of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana until his death in an air crash on
April 6. Having bolstered Rwanda's crumbling army with military advisers,
weapons, armoured cars and helicopters, France is regarded as an accomplice
to the slaughter of Tutsis and Hutu opponents of the Habyarimana regime
which followed his death.
France plans to lead quick missions into Rwanda to rescue endangered
civilians, but has pledged not to make deep raids or to be drawn into
fighting between government and rebel forces. The UN mandate authorises
French troops to use force if attacked.
In Paris Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, yesterday sought to
downplay the military and political risks for France intervening almost
alone in Rwanda, in the face of hostility from rebels controlling two-thirds
of the country.
'Senegalese soldiers will be at our side and discussions are in train with
Guinea-Bissau,' he told the French Senate yesterday. Senegal is apparently
to send troops it had already agreed to contribute to the planned UN force
due in Rwanda in late July, at which point France has said it will pull its
troops out.
Mr Juppe said he hoped European countries would give France the logistic
support the US has already pledged. France will be pressing its European
Union partners for backing when the Twelve start their summit in Corfu later
today, Mr Alain Lamassoure, French EU affairs minister, said yesterday,
adding that while 'there might be 10 good reasons for not intervening, the
one essential reason for doing so is that a whole people is in the course of
dying'.
The French are setting up field hospitals on the Zaire border. But it is not
clear whether they will just seek to evacuate refugees and wounded to the
hospitals, or try to set up safe zones as they and other UN peacekeepers
have sought to do in Bosnia.
Although Operation Turquoise is meant to be a bridging operation until the
UN can muster a multinational force, it has inadvertently undermined the
work of the 400 UN military personnel who remained in Kigali after the
majority of UN troops and all foreigners were evacuated in April.
Thousands of Tutsis have also demonstrated against the French expedition in
Bujumbura, the capital of neighbouring Burundi, which is bristling with the
tensions of the Rwandan conflict.
With anti-French sentiment rising in the RPF-controlled areas of the
capital, the UN decided to relieve 42 French-speaking African soldiers from

FT  24 JUN 94 / Hata faces motion of no confidence

<TEXT>
Japan's Liberal Democratic party, the country's largest political opposition
group, yesterday launched a no-confidence motion against the minority
government. The attack came after the upper house of parliament finally
agreed this year's national budget, three months after it was due to take
effect. The LDP and other opposition parties had agreed a political amnesty
until Japan's national finances were assured.
The five-party coalition of Mr Tsutomu Hata responded by boosting its
campaign to entice the Social Democratic Party to rejoin the government, in
the hope of restoring its parliamentary majority. Mr Hata was closeted last
night with Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Socialist leader, in a last-ditch
attempt to save his two-month-old administration.
The LDP attack paralysed attempts to resolve the US-Japan trade deadlock, a
factor in the recent currency turmoil, forcing Mr Koji Kakizawa, Japan's
foreign minister, to shelve next weekend's talks with Mr Mickey Kantor, US
trade representative.
Mr Hata admitted his government's fate hung on the result of talks with the
Socialists. 'I would like to stake everything, including whether to resign,
on the policy talks between the coalition and the Socialist Party,' he said.
The Socialists left the government in late April in anger at the formation
of a right-wing group excluding them.
Mr Hata said if he did resign, he would not call a general election, but
leave it to opposition parties to form a new government. An election would
delay the final phase of electoral reform: the redrawing of electoral
boundaries. Japan's move from a multi-seat electoral system to a mix of
proportional representation and single-seat districts would benefit parties
such as Mr Hata's Renewal Party.
If the SDP joins the coalition, the vote will fail. But up to 20 SDP MPs
could ignore such a call, when the coalition's survival would hang by a
thread.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Durable goods orders increase 0.9% in May
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New orders for US durable goods rose more strongly than expected last month,
underlining the strength of the US industrial sector, official figures
indicated yesterday.
Orders rose 0.9 per cent between April and May, twice the increase projected
by most Wall Street analysts. Orders have risen in nine of the past 10
months and are now running 16.7 per cent higher than in May last year.
Orders for primary metals were especially strong, rising 4.7 per cent last
month and by 21.3 per cent in the year to May. Orders for transport
equipment were also vigorous, rising 2.2 per cent and 20.5 per cent
respectively.
The figures are not adjusted for inflation, running at less than 3 per cent
per annum.
Durable goods shipments, a guide to present capital spending, also rose.
Excluding the aircraft sector, shipments of non-defence capital goods rose
2.2 per cent last month and by 17.9 per cent in the past year.
The orders figures reinforce the findings of a recent upbeat assessment of
investment intentions by the commerce department. This indicated US
companies were planning to raise spending on plant and equipment by 8.9 per
cent in real terms this year. Much of this investment is expected to raise
industrial capacity and thus enable the economy to expand without putting
strong upward pressure on inflation.
The strength of investment and orders contrasts with a dip in personal
spending in April and May.

</HEADLINE>

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas has appointed Mr Jorge Madrazo, the head of the
government human rights commission, to be the new commissioner for peace in
the Mexican state of Chiapas, indicating a continuing commitment to a
negotiated settlement to the conflict.
Mr Salinas said Mr Madrazo would be entrusted with bringing a 'dignified
peace' to Chiapas. The appointment of the respected Mr Madrazo and President
Salinas's commitment to peaceful resolution follows rebel rejection of the
government peace offer nearly two weeks ago, and resignation of the previous
peace commissioner, Mr Manuel Camacho.
'This raises the possibility and expectation that dialogue can continue
despite the Zapatista rejection of the peace agreement,' said a government
official.
The Zapatista rebels seized four towns in the state of Chiapas on new year's
day. Although a ceasefire was reached in early January, the Zapatistas
remain armed. Still in control of a southern part of Chiapas, they have
threatened to rise up against the government and remain a threat to the
security of the state.
The call for dialogue may help reduce tension in the area, and should allay
fears of a government crackdown. However, Mr Salinas did not meet the
central Zapatista demand of agreeing to further national democratic reforms,
saying such reforms had been negotiated by the main political parties, and
without such a commitment, it seems unlikely an agreement can be reached.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Reno to investigate US tobacco allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Justice Department said yesterday it was examining allegations of
criminal misconduct by the tobacco industry as a company executive hit back
at charges that his company manipulates the level of nicotine in its
cigarettes.
Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, said her department's criminal, civil
and anti-trust divisions were looking at 'all the allegations. . . to
determine what would be the appropriate response'.
The investigation follows charges by members of Congress that tobacco
company executives lied under oath when they testified in April that they
did not manipulate the nicotine level in their cigarettes, and that they did
not know nicotine to be addictive.
Mr Thomas Sandefur, chairman of Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of
the UK's BAT Industries, denied that his company deliberately manipulated
nicotine levels and misled the public.
Mr Sandefur appeared before the congressional sub-committee which on Tuesday
heard Mr David Kessler, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner,
allege that B&amp;W had secretly developed and commercialised a tobacco leaf
with twice the nicotine of normal tobacco plants.
Mr Kessler also accused the company of misleading FDA investigators who were
looking into the high-nicotine leaf used by B&amp;W known as Y-1.
Congress is attempting to determine whether cigarettes should be subject to
FDA regulation on the grounds that nicotine is an addictive drug. Mr
Sandefur and others in the tobacco industry claim that stringent FDA
regulation will put 'the industry out of business.'
Mr Sandefur accused Mr Kessler of leading 'a dangerous crusade' to advance
his 'personal and political agenda' of banning tobacco products.
He repeated his claim that nicotine is not addictive but struggled to
convince sub-committee members, many of whom stated in their opening remarks
that nicotine is a drug that should be subject to further government
regulation.
Mr Sandefur said B&amp;W did not instruct contract researchers working on Y-1 to
mislead Mr Kessler's investigators about its existence and
commercialisation. He said research was encouraged by the US Department of
Agriculture in the 1970s.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Latin America: chance to break the cycle of sorrow - Stephen
Fidler on prospects after action on budget deficits, protectionism and the
role of government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank's chief Latin American economist, Mr Sebastian Edwards,
likens the region's economic history to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel, One
Hundred Years of Solitude. In the novel events follow irregular and magical
cycles of sorrow and frustration.
He now sees rays of hope that this melancholy sequence may be broken by the
economic measures that governments in the region have undertaken - to
varying degrees - over the last five years. These measures have brought
budget deficits under control, ended years of protectionism and sharply
reduced the role of government, thereby vastly enlarging the part played by
the market.
On the face of it, they have been mostly successful. Inflation has fallen
dramatically in the 1990s, except in Brazil, and the region as a whole has
enjoyed per capita growth, though modest, for the first time in more than a
decade.
The reforms have had other, often underestimated, effects. Many companies
are looking for the first time to markets beyond their own borders, usually
within the region.
Even if Latin American governments stall in their efforts to achieve formal
economic integration - another feature of the 1990s - a de facto integration
is under way at the corporate level.
Companies are also undergoing profound restructurings to compete in an
international environment. Some are making important gains in productivity,
as management and workforces realise that new working practices are needed
for survival.
Yet many see themselves in a vice between high-technology exporters of the
industrialised world and the ultra low-wage economies of Asia, in particular
China. Imports flood into the shops, and Latin America's trade deficit
widens.
A study published today by the McKinsey management consultancy finds that in
three of four industries studied, Latin American labour productivity was
extremely low.
'In steel, productivity averaged 37 per cent of the US level, 31 per cent in
the food processing industry, and 29 per cent in the retail banking
industry.'
Only in telecommunications did productivity begin to approach American
levels.
But McKinsey also shows that productivity in two of the industries -
telecommunications and steel - has increased significantly in recent years,
especially in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina.
Latin America's steel producers can remain internationally competitive
because of low labour costs, it concludes.
The question is whether these productivity increases will be widespread or
rapid enough to build a platform for exports. Without export growth doubts
will remain about the foreign exchange generating capacity of some countries
which still register very high debt ratios. According to figures from JP
Morgan of the US, Argentina's debt-to-export ratio hardly changed between
1982-84 and 1991-93 at over 430 per cent. Brazil's ratio, around 300 per
cent, and Venezuela's around 200 per cent, have not improved much either.
Last year, the region's Dollars 40bn (Pounds 26bn) plus current account
deficit, which includes interest payments on debt, was easily financed. This
year, with foreign capital markets more hostile, the economies with the
largest deficits look vulnerable.
For now, the region's only undisputed comparative advantage remains in raw
materials and energy. Most governments are welcoming foreign investment, and
many mining and energy companies are getting excited about prospects.
While the development value of raw material exploitation has been
questioned, it at least offers flows of foreign exchange to allow breathing
space for other sectors become productive. Indeed, Latin America's most
successful economy, Chile, built the initial phase of its strategy on the
exploitation of raw materials.
However, Chile pursued an explicit policy of encouraging exports in the
1980s, including a crawling peg devaluation of the Chilean peso. Capital
inflows have forced some peso appreciation, but the long-standing
disposition to keep the exchange rate competitive has encouraged investment
in export sectors.
Other countries have either been less successful in stemming exchange rate
appreciation, for example Colombia, or have explicitly used the exchange
rate as the central plank in fighting inflation - such as Argentina and
Mexico.
A competitive exchange rate was also, according to a book published by the
World Bank last year, an important feature of the economic success of east
Asian economies. The east Asian economies 'avoided strategies of
macroeconomic stabilisation that stressed the role of the exchange rate in
breaking inflationary expectations,' it says.
The book, The East Asian Miracle, describes the following as common factors
in Asian success:
Low inflation and competitive exchange rates
Successful building of human capital, in particular universal primary
education
Creating effective and secure financial systems, which encourage savings
Limiting price distortions
Disposition to absorb foreign technology
Limiting the bias against agriculture
Strong institutional mechanisms, including a meritocratic and well-paid
bureaucracy.
While economists caution that this is not a unique and infallible recipe for
success, Latin American countries score only average marks in important
areas.
In some, the recipe is already impossible to follow. The need to maintain
access to markets in the industrialised countries will make it difficult to
provide domestic protection for export industries used by Asian economies.
Savings rates, while rising, are still well below levels in Asia. Latin
America's average, says Ms Barbara Stallings of the UN Economic Commission
for Latin America, is 19 per cent of GDP, compared with Asia's 29 per cent.
This is also at the core of the region's overdependence on foreign capital.
The competence of Latin American governments to drive this agenda is also
open to question. The UN Human Development Report, published last month,
shows many Latin American countries raise as much in tax revenues as their
Asian counterparts.
However, they have spent it badly, in part because of corruption. According
to Mr Juan Llach, Argentina's economic planning secretary: 'The state used
to direct 7 per cent of GDP a year to investment, but since it bought
everything at twice market prices, this was only equivalent to 3 1/2 per
cent.'
In 1990, the Venezuelan government spent 4.1 per cent of its gross domestic
product on education, more than Singapore's 3.4 per cent, but the quality of
spending was atrocious.
According to one study, 43 per cent of the education budget went into
administration and planning, and 37 per cent to further education, leaving
only 16 per cent for basic and 2.9 per cent for secondary education.
'Education appears to be the single most important determinant of inequality
at any given time,' says Mr Edwards at the World Bank.
Mr Alejandro Foxley, Chile's former finance minister, reckons that the
crucial difference between Asia and Latin America is wealth inequality. In
Asia, the richest fifth has between 5 and 10 times more wealth than the
bottom fifth; in Chile the ratio is 12, in Argentina 16 and Mexico 27.
These divisions have weakened social consensus in Latin America. And, unlike
many parts of Asia (and indeed Pinochet's Chile), Latin Americans have a
choice when they elect their governments. Already -in Venezuela, Costa Rica
and Colombia - voters have returned governments offering a softening of
market-oriented reforms. Elections are due in the region's three largest
economies - Brazil, Mexico and Argentina - in the coming 12 months.
Mr Foxley asks whether the new economic order is politically sustainable,
particularly if Latin Americans cannot be persuaded that the benefits of
reform are being equitably divided. If market reforms are, or are seen as,
widening the already-broad divide between rich and poor, then electorates
will become intolerant of them. If this happens, the threat of populism -
which offers only a return to Marquez's baleful cycle - may not be far away.
By reducing their interference in the economy, Latin American governments
have provided the basis for escape from that cycle. Paradoxically though,
the final escape looks like it will only be achieved through government
action: in education, in improving the quality of government spending and in
making sure the benefits of growth accrue to more than a narrow proportion
of the population.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Congress tries to solve crime bill conflicts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Congress members met again yesterday to try to resolve conflicts delaying
final passage of all-embracing anti-crime legislation. Both Senate and House
of Representatives have already passed crime bills covering everything from
drug treatment programmes to gun-control measures.
Hardly anyone in either chamber is anxious to face the electorate in
November without being able to boast about what they have done on an issue
now topping most voters' concerns. But House and Senate seem deadlocked over
whether the bill should include legislation allowing defendants to cite
statistics showing the death penalty has been unevenly applied to different
races as part of their defence.
In 1987, the Supreme Court ruled in McCleskey vs Kemp that such statistics
were not enough to sustain a constitutional challenge to the death penalty.
Opponents of the death penalty have been trying ever since to restore this
weapon by legislative means; the measure is included in the version of the
crime bill passed by the House.
Many senators oppose the provision, which is not included in the Senate
version. To complicate matters, the House later voted in favour of a
non-binding resolution urging its representatives, in meetings with the
Senate, to oppose the measure it had earlier approved. Cost of the bill
continues to climb. The Senate version would originally have cost Dollars
22.3bn over five years, the House version Dollars 28bn over six years. Cuts
have resulted in a total Dollars 30.2bn over six years.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Bolivar suffers steep decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, has fallen sharply this week, amid public
concern over the government's handling of the country's banking crisis and
rising fears of exchange controls or other dramatic government action.
Strong purchases of dollars drove the bolivar to 200 per dollar at midday
yesterday in Caracas commercial banks, a 10.5 per cent devaluation since the
beginning of the week. The bolivar has fallen by 47 per cent since the end
of 1993.
Demand for dollars has been intensified by delay in the re-opening of seven
commercial banks and a commercial finance company closed by the government
on June 14.
Government officials have made contradictory public statements as to when
the affected banks would reopen and how much money each depositor would
receive.
Three banks in which the government has intervened, Amazonas, Bancor and La
Guaira, reopened yesterday, behind schedule, to begin paying depositors up
to Dollars 500 (Pounds 325) each.
But it is not clear if individual depositors will eventually be paid a
maximum of 4m bolivars (about Pounds 14,300) as stipulated by current
legislation, or double that, as suggested by one government official. The
banks subject to intervention held in all about Dollars 2.6bn in public
deposits as of May 30.
In May, the government reportedly came close to applying foreign exchange
controls amid heavy buying of dollars following the abrupt resignation of
Mrs Ruth de Krivoy as central bank president in April. Fears have risen that
the government may again be considering this strategy.
The central bank has not released figures on its international monetary
reserves since April, but the country's reserves fell by 14 per cent, or
Dollars 1.7bn, during first quarter of this year.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Shipyard workers vote for strike
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at the world's largest shipyard voted to strike for three hours
during the telecast early today of South Korea's match against Bolivia.
Workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries, near Seoul, voted nearly 2 to 1 for the
strike.
The company said the strike was so the 22,000 workers could watch the game
live, but the union claimed the strike supported a 13 per cent wage rise.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: FIFA hands out longest suspension
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Romanian player was suspended for three games yesterday for what FIFA
called a 'brutal' foul, the latest move by the governing body against rough
play.
FIFA imposed the penalty on Ion Vladoiu, who was sent off minutes after
entering Wednesday's game against Switzerland as a substitute in the closing
minutes.
It was the third red card of the tournament but by far the stiffest penalty.
In addition to the suspension, which begins with Sunday's game against the
USA, FIFA's disciplinary committee levied a 7,500 Swiss franc (Dollars
5,555) fine on the Romanian federation.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Italy battle to 1-0 win after 'keeper is sent
off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy overcame a one-man disadvantage after goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was
sent off to beat Norway 1-0 last night in a bruising game at Giants Stadium
in New Jersey.
Pagliuca was ejected for touching the ball outside the penalty area and
tripping Norway's Oyvind Leonhardsen as he closed on the Italian goal from a
Norwegian breakaway.
Bringing on substitute 'keeper Marchegiani, Italy surprisingly took off
Roberto Baggio, who until then had looked the most likely to find an opening
goal.
Norway's strategy of deep defence and swift counter-attacking backfired in
the second half when Italy's ten men battled to a deserved lead.
Dino Baggio's close range header from Guiseppe Signori's 69th-minute free
kick gave Italy three desperately-needed points. The result leaves Ireland,
Italy and Norway tied in Group E with three points each.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Stars judged by their on-field feats - The
tournament's dominant personalities are beginning to emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The name on America's lips this week is OJ Simpson, the former gridiron star
accused of murdering his former wife and her male acquaintance. It is
impossible to turn on the TV or open a newspaper without hearing or reading
someone pontificating on this great national 'tragedy.'
On the one hand, the vox pop generally speaks of its 'love' for OJ and its
disbelief that he could have committed such a crime. On the other, the
pundits pronounce - as, typically, did Anna Quindlen in a New York Times
column headlined 'Remember Nicole Simpson' - that 'this is not the story of
a fallen idol' but of a man who went beyond wife-beating, bad enough, to
murder. Throw in some media angst about overkill and the cup of talk shows
is filled to overflowing.
The great blessing for the soccer stars gathered here for the World Cup is
that all, except possibly Argentina's Diego Maradona, are closed books to
Americans. Profiles delve into Jurgen Klinsmann's engaging wanderlust, which
the German likes to exercise in this country, or Roberto Baggio's un-Italian
Buddhism, but they are really only the coloured wallpaper behind the reality
that, for 31 days and assuming they do nothing egregious, the players are
going to be judged only by how they perform on the field.
So, after nearly a week, the question logically arises: who are really
stamping themselves on the cup, rather than the opposition's calves, who
have egg on their faces, and on whom is the jury still out?
The simplest criterion is goals. By that yardstick, the star so far is
Gabriel Batistuta of Argentina. With a hat-trick against Greece, he looked
fast and incisive, though no more so than his team-mate Claudio Caniggia, of
the stringy hair, who failed to score.
But both of them - and Maradona, who scored and had a half-way decent game -
were up against the poorest team yet seen, whose coach afterwards complained
that his players were more interested in being photographed with Maradona
than actually competing with him.
Four players have two goals - Klinsmann, Juan Andoni Goicoechia of Spain,
and Gheorghe Hagi and Florin Raducioiu of Romania. All have benefitted from
goalkeeping mistakes, with the Spaniard freely admitting that his goal
against Germany was unintentional, a slightly mis-hit cross ending in the
net courtesy of Bodo Illgner's leaden-footed miscalculation. But Raducioiu,
who could easily have had two more against Switzerland but for fine
goalkeeping, has looked a complete attacker.
Klinsmann has been sharp in two games as well, capable of sprinting past
defenders on either side. He also falls more dramatically than any other
player yet observed, which is saying something since just about everybody
here is capable of scoring 5.8 for artistic interpretation.
Other strikers who have looked the part and found the net once include
Rashidi Yekini of Nigeria and Francois Omam-Biyik of Cameroon, confirming
all the good impressions he made four years ago in Italy. Both are big,
strong and direct, but leavened with finesse.
Brazil's Romario, who scored once and won a penalty, and Bebeto
(conveniently No's 7 and 11 for Americans weaned on convenience stores) are
small, quick and dangerous, with excellent rapport.
Lothar Matthaus, the German sweeper and captain, has chosen so far to play
his cards close to the chest, as have, mostly, his team. His speed is ample
to vacuum up any defensive problems, but the lacerating long passes and
rapid forward rushes in two games can pretty much be counted on the fingers
of one hand. He is not yet playing as Franz Beckenbauer once did, but then
he has not needed to.
Rai, the more ponderous but still elegant Brazilian mid-fielder, and Hagi
consider themselves mid-field artists who play far enough forward to create
and score goals, which both have.
Hagi, though, can disappear from games, as in the second half against
Switzerland, while Carlos Valderrama, the Colombian engine room, is firing
on even fewer cylinders than four years ago.
The virtues of more conventional hard-running counter-attack from mid-field
have been amply displayed by Andy Townsend and Ray Houghton for Ireland,
John Harkes for the US, and, best of all, Alain Sutter of Switzerland.
Wim Jonk and Ronald Koeman of Holland have different sorts of calling cards:
hard-nosed defence mixed with thunderous shots from way beyond the dyke.
Jonk's strike from a good 30 yards against Saudi Arabia ranks as the most
spectacular (a la Sir Robert Charlton) goal of the tournament to date, but
Koeman could match it if he sets his range-finder right.
Goalkeepers have experienced mixed fortunes. There have been fine saves
a-plenty, none greater than Michel Preud'homme of Belgium palming a close
Moroccan header on to his crossbar, Erik Thorstvedt of Norway and Spurs at
full stretch to deny an inter-continental Mexican missile, and Dmitri Kharin
of Russia and Chelsea, beleaguered all day by a magical Brazil, incredibly
flicking a short-range certainty over the top.
But there have been horrors from the last line of defence, too. It is
indecent in a family newspaper to identify offenders by name, but the
'keepers from Colombia, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia, Greece and Germany (all
right, the German's name is Illgner, heretofore mentioned) have all cost
their sides a point or two or three. (In fairness, some of them, like the
Saudi Al Deayea, had done yeoman duty beforehand).
But all their glories and mistakes still remain ephemeral, because all have
played only one game or two. They can all improve or recover or flatter only
to deceive (there's a cliche for the ages). It will take a much larger hand
 -of God or a jury - and far more time for OJ Simpson to disappear from the
national consciousness.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Big money is still piling on to Brazil to capture a record fourth World Cup
title, and the odds against the US have fallen sharply.
Ladbroke, the UK betting leader, quotes Brazil as 9-4 favourite to win the
cup on July 17. Germany are 3-1, Italy 7-1, Argentina 8-1 and Holland 9-1.
Odds against the US have collapsed from 125-1 to 40-1, and Ireland are 16-1,
alongside Spain, Nigeria and Norway. Colombia have been pushed from 10-1 to
a derisory 150-1.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Ireland aim to conquer Mexico and midday heat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After their dour win against Italy, Ireland play Mexico in Orlando today in
Group E, the World Cup's toughest first-round group - and are spoiling for
an early entry into the second round.
Ireland's coach Jack Charlton is counting on his players to pressure the
Mexican defence and its 5ft 9in goalie, Jorge Campos, and hoping that Irish
stamina does not wilt under the midday sun. In turn, Mexico is set to boost
its attack with added speed and skills.
'They live in this kind of heat, we don't,' said Charlton of the Mexicans,
wondering about today's game-time temperature. During the first World Cup
game at the Citrus Bowl, Orlando, last Sunday, it peaked at 109'F (43'C) on
the pitch itself.
'This match is a great incentive to qualify and top our group,' said
Charlton. That would mean Ireland would play in New Jersey in the second
round, with overwhelming local support.
Charlton said the Mexicans needed a win today to stay in the tournament.
Mexican coach Miguel Mejia Baron said: 'We will try to be more offensive,
more aggressive on the attack. The way they are going to play is just wait
for counter-attacks. They'll try to take advantage of mistakes.'
After the loss to Norway, Baron is expected to bring on Alberto Garcia Aspe.
The mid-field star was suspended for the first game. 'He will be of great
help,' said captain Ignacio Ambriz. Garcia Aspe is known for pin-point
passing and a lethal left-foot shot.
Baron could also call on striker Carlos Hermosillo, a veteran from the 1986
World Cup team, when Mexico reached the quarter-finals.
Ireland will count on their traditional game of long passes, crosses and
headers to pressure the comparatively small Mexican defence. But Tony
Cascarino will not be in the Irish side. The striker ruled himself out
because of a calf muscle injury.
Charlton is hoping that Tommy Coyne can take the heat. Coyne suffered from
severe dehydration against Italy.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: 'Miracle on grass' as US beats sluggish
Colombia
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
'I don't believe in miracles,' said US coach Bora Milutinovic after his
team's stunning 2-1 victory over Colombia in Group A of the World Cup on
Wednesday night.
Milutinovic aside, anyone else involved in US soccer probably does believe
in the miraculous after the national team trampled over one of the
pre-tournament favourites at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The defeat of the
Colombians ranks with 1980's 'Miracle on Ice' - the US ice hockey team's win
over the Soviet Union in the Lake Placid Winter Olympics - as the most
remarkable feat in US team sports history.
History, however, will have to wait for now, because the greatest impact of
the US triumph is that it virtually assures the team's progression into the
second round. The Americans' present four-point tally looks sufficient to
take them through, even with one game left (against Romania on Sunday).
The tournament's organisers were jubilant at the US team's feat. Jim
Trecker, spokesman for World Cup 1994, said yesterday: 'The World Cup's
already been a great success, and the US reaching the second round can only
add to that.'
The 2-1 defeat of Colombia was extraordinary as much for its manner as for
the result. Although the home team opened the scoring after 35 minutes
courtesy of a freak own-goal by Colombian defender Andres Escobar, they
dominated the rest of the match with sturdy, patient defending and
lightning-quick attacks.
One of these attacks produced the second and clinching goal in the 52nd
minute when striker Ernie Stewart ran on to Tab Ramos's perfectly flighted
pass to lift the ball past the on-coming (and already notorious) Colombian
'keeper, Oscar Cordoba.
But the US were denied the perfect finale when Marcelo Balboa's spectacular
overhead kick flew only inches wide with Cordoba frozen on his line.

FT  24 JUN 94 / All things not being equal in Canada . . . : . . . . means
that a country with negative inflation has had to raise interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada has notched up two very different records in economic performance
over the past few days.
Statistics Canada announced late last week that, alone among industrial
countries, inflation had disappeared. The Bank of Canada's dogged six-year
battle against inflation, reinforced by cuts in tobacco taxes, was rewarded
with a 0.2 per cent drop in consumer prices in the year to May.
At the same time however, Canadians are reeling from some of the industrial
world's steepest jumps in interest rates. The Bank of Canada's trend-setting
Bank rate has climbed from a 30-year low of 3.87 per cent in early February
to 7.09 per cent this week. Commercial banks this week lifted their prime
lending rate to 8 per cent.
Towering real interest rates have raised fears that the economic recovery,
which seemed to be gaining strength from a fragile start, could be in
jeopardy. The Toronto stock exchange's TSE-300 index hit its lowest level of
the year on Tuesday, 22 per cent below its peak last March.
The prospect of sharply higher debt-service payments also risks undermining
a recent drive by the federal government and the 10 provinces to contain
their budget deficits.
The federal government last February projected a drop in its deficit to
CDollars 39.7bn (Pounds 18.8bn) in the year to March 31 1995 from CDollars
45.7bn last year. But the estimate was based on a long-term bond rate of 6.1
per cent, far below the current yield of 9.5 per cent.
Finance department officials have warned their minister Mr Paul Martin that
his budget projections are being derailed. But Mr Martin, whose relationship
with his senior civil servants is said to be cool, is confident that the
aberration will turn out to be temporary.
'As economists are wont to put it: if everything else is unchanged, lower
inflation will bring about lower interest rates,' says Bank of Montreal
chief economist Mr Lloyd Atkinson. 'But not everything remained unchanged.'
Canada has been side-swiped by the upheaval in global markets since the US
Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy in February. The bond
market, like that in the US, has suffered from the scare caused by higher
oil, wheat, copper and other commodity prices.
But Canada is also paying an extra price for fiscal laxity and political
uncertainty. As one commentator noted in yesterday's Globe and Mail
newspaper: 'If high rates are justified in Germany and higher rates are
justified in the US, then especially high rates are going to be visited upon
profligate, politically divided Canada.'
The federal government and the 10 provinces have amassed a mountain of
public sector debt over the past decade. Their combined debt burden has
ballooned in the past 12 years from 43 per cent to 97 per cent of gross
domestic product. The ratio is set to rise to 108 per cent in 1997, even if
governments achieve the deficit-cutting targets they have set themselves.
The jitters are reflected in a widening spread between yields on Canadian
and US government long bonds. The gap has grown from less than 1 percentage
point in February, when it looked as if Ottawa's success in curbing
inflation might bring Canadian interest rates down to US levels, to 2.1
percentage points.
On the political front, nervousness is again rising as the debate over
Quebec's future moves to centre stage before elections in the francophone
province this autumn. The uncertainty is reflected in the gap between yields
on long-term bonds issued by Quebec and neighbouring Ontario, which has
widened by one-fifth of a percentage point since the end of April.
The separatist Parti Quebecois, which has pledged to call an independence
referendum within a year of taking office, is well ahead in public opinion
polls. PQ leader Mr Jacques Parizeau did not endear himself to the
investment community with threats earlier this month that a PQ government
might cut off business with banks and securities dealers that publicise the
potential costs of independence.
But the turmoil in financial markets has given the federalist side some
badly-needed ammunition. Mr Jean Chretien, the prime minister, assured
parliament on Tuesday that interest rates would drop if the ruling Liberals
were re-elected. Few economists would disagree.
Another consolation for the Liberals is that their leader Mr Daniel Johnson
remains personally more popular than Mr Parizeau.
For the time being however, in Mr Atkinson's words, 'there is ample reason
to believe that the air will be filled with uncertainty for months to come -
an outcome that is likely to produce not only a lot of volatility
potentially, but much higher interest rates on average than would otherwise
be the case.'
The ups and downs have been amplified by the rising involvement of foreign
investors, estimated to hold almost half Canada's total debt. Their view
that Canada is a potentially high-yielding but fickle investment is likely
to make for roller-coaster markets.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Trade rivalry divides Brazil and Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relations between Latin America's two biggest economies, Mexico and Brazil,
are coming under strain as the battle to head the future World Trade
Organisation intensifies.
The candidature of both Mexico's President Carlos Salinas and Mr Rubens
Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister, may split the Latin American vote and
help their rivals.
The differences over Latin America's choice follows competition over
leadership of the trade issue in South America. This may be felt more
strongly in Brasilia than in Mexico City. Brazilian officials have watched
with discomfort as Mexico, after securing the North American Free Trade
Agreement with the US and Canada, have signed free trade accords with South
American governments. The latest, the Group of Three accord with Colombia
and Venezuela, was signed last week.
Brazil has responded with its own proposal for a South American free trade
zone but the attraction has been limited by Brazil's economic instability.
Put baldly, the Brazilian view is that Mexico has abrogated its right to
speak for Latin America and the rest of the developing world by signing up
to Nafta. In the more diplomatic language of a finance ministry official, Mr
Ricupero could provide a 'third way' between the choices of the EU and Nafta
trade blocs. A Brazilian foreign office spokesman insisted that Brazil
believed Mr Ricupero remained a strong candidate.
Mexico's foreign ministry argues that Mr Salinas' record as president of
Mexico, strong commitment to free trade, and apparent support from most of
Latin America, the US and Canada makes him by far the stronger of the two
regional candidates - and the only one with a chance of winning.
Mr Manuel Tello, Mexico's foreign minister, firmly denies that the rift
between Mexico and Brazil reflected a wider struggle for Latin American
leadership. He says the two candidates should be judged on individual merit.
Mr Tello made little secret of his disappointment that Brazil has not backed
down. Mr Tello said Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister, told him on
May 30 that Brazil would reconsider proposing Mr Ricupero if Mr Salinas
chose to run and that Mr Amorim had said the Mexican president's candidacy
was 'a very good idea'. Brazilian officials denied this version, however.
According to them, Mr Amorim told his Mexican counterpart and Mr Salinas on
May 30 that countries would need to 'examine the situation' if a president -
meaning Mr Salinas - became a candidate. This was, they say, diplomatic
language and never intended as an indication that Mr Ricupero's candidacy
could be withdrawn.
In the absence of President Itamar Franco of Brazil, the Latin American
participants of the Ibero-American Summit last week in Colombia backed the
Salinas candidacy. According to Mr Tello, President Carlos Menem of
Argentina first proposed that the heads of state should endorse Mr Salinas,
arguing that the chance of an important international position for a Latin
American should not be missed.
Brazil's anger led to an embarrassing about-turn by Buenos Aires and
Argentina issued a diplomatic letter stressing its support for Mr Ricupero.
Mr Hugo Herrera Vegas, undersecretary at Argentina's foreign ministry, said:
'It was all a misunderstanding. It has been clarified. It was a mistake.
These are the dangers of high level diplomacy, the diplomacy of chefs
d'etat, which have their advantages as well as disadvantages.'

<TEXT>
The contest for the first head of the World Trade Organisation widened
yesterday when South Korea said it was nominating Mr Kim Chul-su, its trade
and industry minister.
Mr Kim is the fourth declared candidate. President Carlos Salinas of Mexico
formally entered the race on Wednesday, following Brazil's nomination of Mr
Rubens Ricupero, its finance minister, and Italy's endorsement of Mr Renato
Ruggiero, a former trade minister.
The Seoul foreign ministry said Mr Kim had a 'good chance' of election by
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's 123 members, four-fifths of
which are developing countries. Canvassing for Mr Kim among trading partners
has only just begun, according to South Korean officials in Geneva.
Many developing countries would in principle like to see a Third World
candidate head the WTO, which will succeed Gatt next year. The Gatt job has
always gone to a European. But developing country support could split on
regional lines. To complicate matters, the US, which last year backed Mr
Peter Sutherland, the EU nominee as Gatt director general, is said to favour
Mr Salinas. The EU is not helping its own cause by delaying endorsement of
Mr Ruggiero as part of the horsetrading over the EU presidency and other top
jobs.
Under Gatt rules, the appointment of a director general must be made by
consensus, after consultations being conducted by Mr Andras Szepesi,
Hungary's Gatt ambassador and current chairman of the contracting parties
(members). The final decision will be taken by members at their annual

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Trade News: VW set for windfall after China ruling -
Tony Walker on a freeze on new players in the market that will benefit the
German car maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER

<TEXT>
Mr Peter Loew, chief executive of Shanghai Volkswagen, China's largest
manufacturer of passenger cars, wears the smile of a man who knows that he
is on to a good thing.
China's new automotive industry policy, which has been widely leaked to the
Chinese press, specifies a freeze on new participants in vehicle assembly
plants until 1996.
This could hardly have provided a more satisfactory windfall for Volkswagen
which is rapidly expanding its manufacturing and assembly facilities near
Shanghai and at Changchun in northern China.
'The policy will give existing joint ventures time to improve their products
and introduce new models to reach world standards,' Mr Loew said. He could
have added that the moratorium will stretch Volkswagen's lead in the world's
fastest-growing vehicle market. Demand is expected to soar in the next few
years as more Chinese are able to afford their own cars.
In 1993, China produced 234,000 passenger cars of a total 1.3m vehicles
manufactured locally. By the year 2000 demand is expected to exceed 2m
passenger cars with local production accounting for about 1.8m of the total,
according to the Chinese plan.
This figure presupposes a sevenfold increase in production of passenger
vehicles by the turn of the century. Such growth would be impossible without
the entry of additional foreign manufacturers.
Shanghai Volkswagen, which was established in 1985 as a joint venture (VW
has 50 per cent) with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, Bank of
China and China National Automotive Industry Corporation, produced 100,000
Santanas (a variation of the Brazilian-designed Passat) in 1993. It plans to
raise output to 150,000 a year by next year with a second car plant at
Shanghai, due to be finished later this year.
At the same time Volkswagen is increasing engine production to 150,000 at
its Shanghai plant with plans for further expansion. It is also increasing
capacity at its Changchun facility where it is in partnership with the First
Auto Works, producing Audi 100s and Jetta cars. Combined production of the
Audi and Jetta exceeded 30,000 last year. Output is expected to increase
this year to more than 40,000 and in 1995 to 60,000.
Mr Loew said Volkswagen, whose production of passenger cars accounts for
about 60 per cent of China's total sedan output, hoped to be producing
600,000 vehicles in China by the year 2000, but this would require
additional plants.
In the past year Volkswagen achieved a breakthrough when it lifted local
content in its Santanas to more than 80 per cent, thereby earning a
reduction from 48 to 32 per cent in duties on imported items.
Some 82.2 per cent of Santanas are now sourced locally and Mr Loew says
Volkswagen has no plans to raise local content further at this stage since
the company is now paying the lowest rate of duty on imported items; but
there is scope for further increases in the 60 per cent local content of the
Audis.
Among the difficulties in raising local content levels has been an
under-developed components industry. Volkswagen relies on some 160 local
suppliers, but quality is a frequent problem.
Mr Loew said he hoped there would be more competition in the components
sector under the new policy.
Beijing has also declared that attracting foreign investment in the
components sector was a key element of its automotive policy and that
companies wishing to assemble cars in China would first have to demonstrate
their good faith by investing in the manufacture of components and spare
parts.
Japanese and US car companies, which have been comparatively slow to respond
to the opportunities in China, are planning Chinese components ventures as a
means of positioning themselves for the end of the moratorium on new
participants in car manufacture and assembly.
Mr Loew said that VW's equity had 'increased tremendously' since the
company's initial investment of Yn350m (Pounds 26.7m). Shanghai Volkswagen
repatriated profits last year for the first time, making a modest
contribution to the balance sheet of its troubled parent.
Mr Loew is confident that sales of the Santana, Audi and Jetta will continue
to be buoyant. Volkswagen would seem to have reason to be quietly satisfied
with its 1984 decision to proceed in China while its competitors were
standing on the sidelines.

FT  24 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Russia energy deals gather pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 10bn oil and gas agreement between Russia and a western
consortium is the latest in a string of large deals to develop energy
reserves around the Russian periphery. The agreement, signed in Washington
late on Wednesday, covers the development of two oil and gas fields off
Russia's Sakhalin Island by a consortium led by Marathon Oil of the US.
Other partners include Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Royal Dutch/Shell and McDermott.
The fields - Piltun-Astokhskoye and Lunskoye - contain an estimated 750m
barrels of oil and natural gas liquids, and 14,000bn cubic feet of gas.
Marathon says peak production of 180,000 barrels a day of liquids and 1.5bn
cubic feet a day of gas is expected four years after the go-ahead is given
for full-scale development.
That, however, must await passage by the Russian parliament of an oil and
gas law to govern production-sharing agreements such as the one signed this
week. Some western oil companies are demanding additional assurances in the
form of separate legislation covering specific projects before they commit
substantial funds in Russia.
Marathon says Russia would receive more than 50 per cent of the production
revenues from the project, which is one of a number envisaged for Sakhalin
in spite of the harsh operating conditions in the area. Much of the work in
the area can only be done between May and mid-October, when winter storms
make construction impossible.
Many big western oil companies have chosen to pursue technically difficult
but self-contained projects on the Russian periphery rather than rely on the
Russian oil export transportation system, which is plagued by bottlenecks.
The Marathon-led consortium plans to liquefy the gas for direct sale to
fast-growing Asian markets such as Taiwan or Korea. The oil will be piped
ashore before being exported by tanker. The Russian government has supported
such schemes because neither it nor any Russian oil companies have the
financial resources to develop them.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Sharp fall in Russian output
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Russian industrial output in May was 29 per cent below the level of a year
ago, according to figures from the state statistics committee. January-May
output was 25.9 per cent below the same period last year. The statistics
committee said one quarter of small and medium-sized enterprises had closed
at least one production line or stopped one shift in May because there was
no demand for their products. Production of some goods, including some
drilling machines, some computers and some types of road building equipment,
had been stopped completely in the first five months. The statistics office
said the fall was sharpest in the machine building sector where January-May
output was 45 per cent below levels a year ago. Light industry output was
down 35 per cent. However, some officials say Russian statistics are
unreliable. The statistics committee only appointed people to monitor the
emerging private sector late last year and official data takes little
account of the activities of private companies. Reuter, Moscow.
Swedish industrial capacity utilisation grew by 1.3 per cent in the first
three months over the previous quarter to reach 85.9 per cent, underscoring
a sharp upturn in industrial output as the country emerges from a three-year
recession. Industrial output grew 10.6 per cent in the year to the end of
April, mainly thanks to sharp export growth, the central statistics bureau
said.
Finland's gross domestic product rose 1.6 per cent year-on-year in the first
quarter compared with a 4 per cent fall in the first quarter of 1993,
Statistics Finland said yesterday. Finnish industrial production volume rose
9.8 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 1994 compared with a 2.0
per cent year-on-year rise in January-March last year.
The Dutch trade surplus narrowed to Fl 1.6bn (Pounds 571m) in February from
Fl 1.9bn in January, the statistics bureau said.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Day of judgment for the CDU: Judy Dempsey reports on an east
German test for Chancellor Kohl
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Theodor Luhr, a senior official at Saxony-Anhalt's economics ministry,
was sitting in a sparsely decorated small office in the government complex
on the outskirts of Magdeburg, the state capital. 'What I worry about most
is that when people vote in the elections, they will forget what it was like
before 1989,' he said.
Like many other officials, he has no idea if the governing Christian
Democrats (CDU)/Free Democrats (FDP) coalition will be returned to power on
Sunday when the first of the eastern states goes to the elections.
During the last state elections in Saxony-Anhalt in October 1990, the CDU
received 39 per cent of the vote and the FDP 13.5 per cent. The Social
Democrats (SPD) polled 26 per cent.
In the local elections earlier this month, seen as the most reliable
barometer, the CDU's support slipped to 31.1 per cent, the SPD's rose to
29.7, the FDP fell to 7.9 per cent, and the reformed communists, the Party
of Democratic Socialism (PDS), rose to 18.2 per cent.
Before German unification, the Stasi, or state security police, had occupied
the grey, dull government buildings. One could hardly see out of the
windows, or dared to open them. The air was stinking - thick and poisoned
from pollution emanating from the chemical works, the mainstay of the
Saxony-Anhalt economy. Four years later, the stench has gone; the air is
clear. 'People forget those smells,' said Mr Luhr.
'I also remember when I moved into these offices in late 1990, we only had
three senior people to dismantle this huge centralised economy. Our economic
policy was based on one principle. We had to break the monolithic structure
through privatisation, diversification, and investments,' he added. Since
then, more than DM2.5bn (Pounds 1bn) has been spent on upgrading the streets
and roads.
Another DM4bn has been spent on modernising the archaic telephone system. An
additional DM12bn has been poured into restructuring the chemical industry.
But the CDU has found it difficult to get its economic message across.
'People don't think about the long-term impact of the investments. They
think about jobs and the high level of unemployment. 'This is the price we
have had to pay to dismantle this wasteful and inefficient economic
structure,' said Mr Luhr.
The SPD has latched on to unemployment in the belief that the party will woo
away voters from the CDU - and the PDS. Excluding those on job creation
schemes and short-time work, Saxony-Anhalt's unemployment rate is more than
17 per cent, higher than the average in the other eastern states which is
now 15.5 per cent. But as Mr Luhr argues, the unemployment rate is one of
the highest because the state's manufacturing and chemical industry was one
of the most inefficient and overmanned. But the SPD's ability to exploit the
unemployment issue is handicapped by its weak party organisation, and the
increasing popularity of the PDS, both factors which could be to the CDU's
advantage.
Unlike the CDU, FDP and PDS, the SPD in eastern Germany had no
communist-sanctioned 'bloc party' before unification. 'We had to start
completely from scratch,' said Ms Sabine Kaspereit, the SPD mayor of the
small town of Wengelsdorf, who is running for the Bundestag next October.
'We only have about 6,000 SPD members, whereas the PDS inherited all the
Communist party organisations and structures.
'The other parties could rely on a local network as well. We started from
zero.'
The other problem facing the SPD is its image. 'We told Mr Scharping he was
colourless and that he had to have strong policies with which the easterners
could identify, otherwise the PDS would drain votes away from us,' said Ms
Edith Braun, the SPD mayor from Stendal.
Many SPD officials admit that the worthy and respected Mr Reinhard Hoppner,
the party's leading candidate in Sunday's election, is no match for the
charismatic Mr Gregor Gysi, the PDS's most prominent politician.
Yet Mr Christoph Bergner, the CDU prime minister, cannot rely on a split
vote in the left for the coalition to be returned to power. Although the CDU
is gaining in popularity in Saxony-Anhalt, the party has to do far better
than the recent local election results because the FDP is doing so badly.
Part of the reason is the spate of corruption scandals in the government.
Another reason is that the FDP relied on the personality of Mr Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, the former foreign minister who was born in Halle, the state's
second largest city, to attract support.
But now, similar to the SPD, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the FDP's leader and foreign
minister, is considered dull and ineffectual.
'We are clinging onto power. The outcome might be a grand coalition,' said
Mr Helmut Starauschek of the economic ministry. Sunday's outcome will show
whether Chancellor Helmut Kohl's policies in eastern Germany will be
vindicated, or Mr Rudolf Scharping, head of the SPD, can make the vital
breakthrough needed to dislodge the CDU, he says.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Berlin's coalition government yesterday averted early elections after
reaching a compromise about the future of the city's senator for interior
affairs.
Deputies from the Social Democratic party (SPD), the former communist Party
of Democratic Socialism, and the Bundnis 90 environmental party had demanded
the resignation of Mr Dieter Heckelmann, the interior senator, after it was
disclosed his press spokesman had ties to a far right group of intellectuals
known as the Tuesday Circle.
But Mr Eberhard Diepgen, the Christian Democrat mayor of Berlin, and Mr
Ditmar Staffelt, head of the SPD, had threatened to call elections, probably
for October, if a no-confidence vote was called in the senate. The prospect
of early elections worried both parties which are concerned about their
popularity.
Rather than go to the polls, the CDU and SPD agreed that Mr Heckelmann need
not resign, but at the same time he can no longer have responsibility for
protection of the constitution, a brief normally held by the interior
ministry.

Romania's main centre-right opposition parties have lodged a no-confidence
motion in the country's minority left-wing government. The opposition said
it was bringing the motion because the government's economic polices had
failed, it had violated the constitution and many of its members were
corrupt. The Democratic Agrarian Party, one of four small parties with a
pivotal position in the country's hung parliament, said it would support the
motion, which is expected to be voted on next Thursday.
Until now, the ruling Party of Social Democracy has relied on the DAP, a
centre-left party supported by farmers, and the three other parties, for a
slim parliamentary majority. It is the fifth no confidence motion the
opposition has lodged since the PSD won elections in September 1992. The
motion last December failed by just 13 votes. But since then the government
has secured Dollars 1bn in new loans from the International Monetary Fund
and other official lenders, inflation has halved and the economy begun to
stabilise.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The cost to the Italian state of the constitutional court decision on
pensions arrears is still growing, according to the head of the INPS, which
manages the country's state pension system. Italian press agencies reported
yesterday that Mr Mario Colombo, INPS chairman, had estimated the pensions
'hole' at L32,500bn (Pounds 13.5bn) after capital revaluation and interest
charges are taken into account and said it was still growing. Mr Colombo
cited the figure at a meeting yesterday of the labour committee of the
Italian parliament's upper house.
The Italian constitutional court ruled two weeks ago that the government
should make up the difference between reduced benefits and full pension
entitlements, allegedly denied to as many as 600,000 pensioners since 1983.
At the time, following meetings with Mr Colombo, Mr Clemente Mastella, the
labour minister, said the hole was at least L30,000bn.

Leaders of Germany's postal and telecommunications workers yesterday offered
to suspend their campaign of token strikes, as the danger of political
deadlock over the country's privatisation programme for Deutsche Telekom and
the postal service loomed closer. The unions want to accelerate negotiations
with their employers to determine post-privatisation deals for workers'
participation in management and social benefits. They claim the employers
are deliberately dragging out the talks to raise the political pressure for
a solution, because the Bundestag has to approve the draft privatisation law
by next Wednesday if it is to come into effect this year.
The law requires the approval of the opposition Social Democratic Party
(SPD) as well as the ruling coalition to change the status of the postal
service in the German constitution, but yesterday SPD deputies abstained
when it went through committee because of continuing concern at the
unresolved labour talks.

Bosnian government forces yesterday pressed forward against rebel troops in
the north-west, amid warnings by international mediators that the warring
parties would face serious consequences if they failed to back a last-ditch
peace plan. With remote hope that Bosnia's warring leaders will endorse the
newest peace plan, Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to former
Yugoslavia, appeared pessimistic, calling it the 'last chance to come to an
agreement'. His US counterpart, Mr Charles Redman, on a diplomatic shuttle
last weekend tried to convince Moslem and Croat leaders to back the plan,
devised by the so-called contact group, composed of representatives from the
US, Russia, Germany, Britain and France.
In Washington, defence ministry officials from four European countries
warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that a unilateral lifting by the
US of the arms embargo against Bosnia would result in 'war, interruption of
humanitarian assistance and the prevention of reconstruction.'

<TEXT>
Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin yesterday ended meetings in
Washington with Dollars 820m in new loan commitments from the World Bank,
Dollars 400m in equity funds from the US Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (Opic) and numerous smaller deals and joint ventures designed to
assist the restructuring of the Russian economy.
Two of the World Bank loans, for Dollars 240 and Dollars 80m, will support
farm and land reform, respectively. This is the bank's first attempt to help
Russia lay a foundation for private agriculture. A Dollars 200m World Bank
loan will help improve private banking services, promote banking stability
and help mobilise resources and credit allocation. A Dollars 300m loan is to
upgrade deteriorating roads. The bank's total commitments to Russia will be
around Dollars 1.5bn by June 30.
Opic announced support for construction of a generic drug manufacturing
facility in Russia. On Wednesday it pledged Dollars 200 in risk insurance
for a US-Russian-German joint venture to redesign and improve the commercial
aviation engine used in Russian-made aircraft.

Leading German and Dutch steel producers said yesterday they would go ahead
this week with a European Court challenge to the Brussels decision to
approve state subsidies for Ilva, the Italian state steel producer.
The German Steel Federation, with Preussag Stahl, Thyssen Stahl and
Hoogovens, the Dutch steelmaker, will be backing similar complaints at the
Luxembourg court by British Steel, EISA, the European independent steel
manufacturers, and Denmark's Det Danske Stalvalsevaerk.
The steel federation said yesterday the massive subsidies to the loss-making
Italian state concern were causing substantial damage to private
manufacturers in all member states.
'It is illegal, because it is not compatible with the steel subsidy code,'
it added. 'There is no room for an exception to be declared. Moreover the
European Commission has not demanded any adequate compensation in terms of
an appropriate reduction of capacity.'
Along with CSI of Spain, Ilva received the lion's share of Ecu7bn (Pounds
5.4bn) of aid approved by EU industry ministers in December. The Commission
says it has acted legally under Article 95 of the European Coal and Steel
treaty, which allows state aid to be paid to steel companies, but only with
the unanimous consent of the Council of Minsters. 'The decision to allow
these subsidies to be paid was taken with the full backing of all the member
states,' said a Commission spokesman.
The German federation argues that approval of any further subsidies is
permissible only in terms of the subsidy code if it does not lead to any
distortion of competition.
It is understood British Steel will start its action early next week against
the subsidies to Ilva and CSI. The UK steelmaker said this week the
Commission should not have applied Article 95 in these cases.
Instead, it said, the Commission should have insisted on 'the full and
proper enforcement' of the steel aid code.
Separately, Brussels will open an investigation into German government aid
paid to Ekostahl, the German steelmaker, following the decision by Riva, the
private Italian steel company, not to buy east Germany's largest steel mill.
The commission is concerned that capital injections to Ekostahl, via the
state run Treuhand privatisation agency, contravene EU rules on state aid.

<TEXT>
Mr Neil Kinnock, the former leader of the Labour party in the UK, yesterday
confirmed at a meeting of socialist leaders in Corfu that he hopes to be
appointed as Britain's second EU commissioner in Brussels from next January,
writes Philip Stephens, Political Editor. His candidacy poses a dilemma for
Mr John Major, the prime minister. Two years ago Mr Major bowed to pressure
from right-wing MPs and rejected Mr Kinnock as the successor to Mr Bruce
Millan. But a second refusal would prompt charges from the opposition that
the prime minister remained in the thrall of a handful of Euro-sceptics.

FT  24 JUN 94 / French recovery 'slow and uneven'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French economy is showing signs of improvement, but recovery from
recession remains slow, partial and fragile, says the Patronat, France's
employers' association.
Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, vice-president of the Patronat, said that while
the French economy had moved from a period of contraction to growth of 0.5
per cent in the first quarter of the year, a survey of industrial
federations and management unions belonging to the employers' association
revealed concerns about the strength and composition of recovery.
According to Mr Seilliere, a significant minority of companies believed that
the economy was still in a phase of stagnation in the first quarter. Most
thought the situation was showing improvement in the second quarter, but 71
per cent felt that recovery would be modest. Overall, 65 per cent of
companies said they believed the economy was in a phase of fragile recovery
while 30 per cent said they did not yet see any recovery.
The survey also revealed an uneven pattern of performance across France's
industrial sectors. Basic industries including chemicals, paper, metals and
steel had seen some improvement. But manufacturers of capital equipment
sector continued to suffer persistent weakness of demand.
Consumer goods industries, excluding the automobile sector which has
benefited from stimulatory government measures, have suffered from a
weakness in household spending. Textile companies, however, have partly
compensated for this by improved exports.
Faced with the uncertain outlook, the Patronat urged support France's
economic recovery. These include increased financial support and credits for
exporters, funding for trade promotion in overseas markets, assistance for
small and medium-sized companies facing financial difficulties and tax
incentives to revive investment.
According to the Patronat, measures to support investment are increasingly
important because of the upward pressure on long-term interest rates
resulting from the falls in the bond market.

Germany's monetary policies cannot be blamed for the recent turbulence in
international capital markets, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the
Bundesbank, said yesterday.
Speaking at the end of the regular fortnightly meeting of the Bundesbank's
central council, held once a year in eastern Germany, Mr Tietmeyer also
confirmed that German interest rates would remain unchanged. The discount
rate and the Lombard rate were last reduced on May 11 to 4.5 per cent and
6.00 per cent respectively.
His statement coincided with warnings by both Germany's industrial
federation, the BDI, and the federation of German banks, that the present
economic recovery is still extremely hesitant.
The banks also warned that the flight of foreign investors from the German
bond market in recent months, compounded by the high level of public sector
borrowing, would maintain pressure for rising long-term interest rates. The
country was now far more dependent than it used to be on foreign capital
inflows, the commercial banks said. Rising capital market interest rates
were inevitable, to maintain the flow of funds to finance the public sector
deficit.
Mr Tietmeyer said it was the Bundesbank's role to provide a stable
background for financial transactions. 'Market players must make their own
decisions about how to react to developments,' adding that volatility in the
bond markets appeared to have calmed in recent days.
On the money supply question, Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank chief economist,
described recent M3 data as 'better but still not good enough.' The
Bundesbank would undertake its routine mid-year review of money supply
policy and will decide at the July 21 council meeting what strategy to
follow in the second half, he said.
Money supply grew at a lower-than-expected annual rate of 13.7 per cent in
May, down from 15.4 per cent in April. But economists said there was no
chance the Bundesbank would meet its 4-6 per cent target for M3 growth for
the year.
On a brighter note, Mr Tietmeyer said the economy of eastern Germany is
showing gradual signs of growth but warned that the high level of financial
transfers to the region would have to continue 'for some time.' He insisted
that the transfers from western Germany to the east, which last year
totalled DM140bn (Pounds 56bn), must be used 'for purposes of investment.'
Several indicators pointed to a slow recovery in the east, he said. These
included inflation which had 'approached to a large extent' west German
levels. Last month, eastern German inflation was 3.4 per cent compared to
3.0 per cent cent in western Germany. In addition, the rate of unemployment
is slowing down, and the number employed would probably 'stabilise' at
around 6m - compared with almost 10m before unification.
In west Germany, the BDI warned that a continuing squeeze on disposable
incomes would mean that private households would be hard pressed to maintain
their level of consumption in the coming months.
'In view of the declining savings quota, which has been sinking for four
years, and the continuing decline in employment, the room for manoeuvre will
remain very narrow,' the BDI concluded.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The next Dutch government must seize the opportunity of a mild economic
recovery to reform the Netherlands' rigid labour market, the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development said in its survey published
yesterday.
The country's labour market is 'unquestionably the weak spot of an otherwise
fundamentally healthy economy', according to the OECD.
It said incentives to find work were low in the Netherlands, reflecting the
traditional generosity of the welfare state system. Other problems
identified by the OECD were high Dutch labour costs, stiff job protection
laws and wage-setting by economic sector which prevents prospective
employees from 'bidding' for lower wages.
'On balance, employment protection legislation seems to be detrimental to
employment,' it said.
The OECD, noting that growth of gross domestic product is projected to rise
to 2.75 per cent next year, said: 'The challenge to the next government is
to seize this opportunity, relying on the many strengths of the Dutch
economy and society, and to move towards major reforms now, rather than only
if and when it is faced with the threat of an impending crisis.'

FT  24 JUN 94 / OECD urges Spanish reform
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Spain should move faster on privatisation and deregulation of state
monopolies to increase competition in services and utilities, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said in a report
released yesterday.
It also called for tighter control over regional government spending, state
company management, social security abuse and and tax evasion. It said the
government could reform some welfare schemes 'to concentrate benefits on the
really needy'.
The encouragement given by the OECD to the government to press ahead with
structural reforms and a tight budget stance coincides with pressure from
hardline factions in the ruling Spanish Socialist party for a shift towards
more left-wing policies following the Socialists' European election defeat.
The OECD said legislation to increase labour market flexibility, which came
into force this month, was 'a landmark for Spain' which would help lay the
ground for sustainable growth.
However, the OECD it complained of 'hesitancy' in other areas where
deregulation was urgently needed, such as telecommunications.
In spite of a restrictive 1994 budget, the OECD said greater efforts were
needed to meet EU public deficit targets set out in the Maastricht treaty.
It forecast that Spain's general government deficit this year would remain
at slightly above 7 per cent of gross domestic product. However, the Economy
Ministry said it still hoped to bring the deficit down below this level.
The greatest contrast between the OECD and Spanish government views was over
the outlook for employment.
Predicting economic growth of 1.2 per cent for the year, following last
year's negative rate of 1 per cent, the OECD warned that Spain would
probably have to wait until next year to see a fall in unemployment and that
the rate, currently close to 25 per cent, was 'unlikely to decline
significantly before 1996'.
It predicted a further 1.2 per cent shrinkage in employment this year -
about 140,000 jobs - although new apprenticeship contracts would help stem
the fall.
The Economy Ministry described this forecast as 'excessive', predicing a
reduction closer to 0.7 per cent and 'a slight improvement' in the jobless
rate by the end of the year.
For 1995, the OECD expected Spanish growth to be 2.7 per cent.
However, it warned that even with 3 per cent annual growth rates in the late
1990s, new jobs would be created only slightly faster than the expansion of
the labour force.
'The fall in unemployment may be small,' it said.
The OECD's expectations for inflation were broadly in line with the
government's at 3.5-4 per cent from December to December, against 4.9 per
cent last year.
However, a report by Spain's Institute of Economic Studies said 4.5 per cent
was more likely.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Portugal replaces bank chief: Appointment of minister as new
governor raises suspicion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The governor of the Bank of Portugal was yesterday replaced with a junior
government minister, casting doubt on the central bank's independence and
the future of monetary policy.
Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, accepted the resignation of Mr
Miguel Beleza and replaced him with Mr Antonio de Sousa, who was secretary
of state for finance. The resignations of two vice-governors and a director
of the bank were also accepted.
Mr Beleza, a former finance minister in the centre-right government, had
directed a firm defence of the exchange-rate stability of the escudo since
he was appointed governor of the central bank in March 1992. But his policy
began to be undermined by a government pressing for lower interest rates to
help stimulate recovery from recession.
Although the government has expressed support for a stable escudo, Mr
Beleza's resignation had been expected as a result of growing tension over
monetary policy between the central bank and the government and within the
Bank of Portugal itself.
Over the past three months, the apparent contradiction between the
government's commitment to both a firm currency and lower interest rates has
led to a wave of attacks against the escudo by speculators expecting a
realignment of the currency.
Contrary to the prime minister's forecast in April that Portugal's main
money market rates would fall two points this year, Mr Beleza's defence of
the currency has forced rates up several points and banks have raised their
lending rates.
Earlier this week, Mr Cavaco Silva strongly defended the stability of the
escudo and said the speculators would be beaten. Mr Joao Costa Pinto, one of
the new vice-governors of the Bank of Portugal, said yesterday that nothing
would change in regard to the bank's exchange rate policy.
But Mr de Sousa, who has been in charge of Portugal's privatisation
programme and is a close ally of the prime minister, is widely known to
support lower interest rates. The incompatibility of this position with a
commitment to maintaining exchange rate stability caused uncertainty on
Portugal's foreign exchange and money markets yesterday.
The escudo strengthened to Es103.4 to the D-Mark from 103.6 on Wednesday
after the central bank intervened by buying escudos at 103.5 and 103.6. 'We
expect Mr de Sousa will allow the escudo to slip a little despite the
government's statements,' said Mr Rui Ferreira, a director of Banco
Finantia. Mr Antonio Borges, a former vice-governor of the Bank of Portugal,
who resigned last year because of disagreements with the government, said
yesterday that the appointment of the new governor would clearly strengthen
government influence over the central bank.
Mr Borges joined opposition parties in saying the government was reversing a
long process of increasing the bank's independence and was at odds with
European Union efforts to diminish government influence over central banks.

FT  24 JUN 94 / The Corfu Summit: EU leaders at mercy of hijacked agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CORFU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European summit which opens today on the Greek island of Corfu will
produce stunning scenery and snapshots for the photo-album.
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia has made a flying visit. The prime
ministers of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will officially sign their
accession treaties to the European Union. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi
of Italy makes his first appearance at an international summit since his
rightist coalition, Forza Italia, swept to power.
Mr Berlusconi is a new leader with some questionable political allies in
search of respectability which the EU family offers.
The Alpine and Nordic leaders are on the brink of entry into an expanded
Union of 16 members, though only Austria has passed the popular test of a
referendum on membership. Mr Yeltsin, who was dining with the Twelve last
night, will today sign a new 'partnership' accord. Viewed alongside Moscow's
agreement this week to join Nato's Partnership for Peace, the EU pact
suggests that Russia is starting to find its place in a wider Europe after
the collapse of the former Soviet Union.
The question is whether the Corfu summit will produce much more than a few
snapshots and a siesta for the ailing Greek prime minister, Mr Andreas
Papandreou. At first sight, the omens do not look especially promising.
To their dismay, EU leaders have allowed the two-day meeting to be hijacked
by the struggle over the successor to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the
European Commission. Efforts to cool tempers have met with limited success;
but there is still no sign of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime
minister backed by France and Germany, or Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime
minister, dropping out of the race. Tonight's dinner discussion among the 12
prime ministers is sure to produce sparks.
Yet it would be misleading to focus on the 'horse race' to succeed Mr
Delors. Several other items are on the Corfu agenda which, though they may
not produce immediate decisions, are still important. Among the chief topics
are:
The European Commission's White Paper on growth and employment. Mr Delors
will urge EU leaders not to be seduced by the incipient economic recovery,
but to renew efforts to improve labour market flexibility and lower
employers' costs in order to tackle unemployment in Europe, nearing the 20m
mark. Leaders will also discuss revised macro-economic guidelines which
propose strict budget and wage discipline in order to prepare for the
planned single European currency.
Trans-European networks. EU leaders are likely to give the go-ahead for 11
priority road and rail projects designed to improve west-east transport
links. But Mr Delors is unlikely to persuade the prime ministers to approve
extra funding for the projects through fresh European Commission borrowing.
The UK, Germany and the Netherlands argue that the European Investment Bank
has plenty of credit available.
Restructuring of the Ukrainian nuclear industry, including the closure of
Chernobyl. Leaders want to prepare for a joint EU position at the G7 summit
in Naples next month.
The 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty.
Leaders are expected to set up a working group to study constitutional
issues and streamlined decision-making to prepare for a Union of up to 25
members. Germany and the Benelux countries want the European Parliament to
be represented in the working group; but the UK and France are opposed.
Italian milk. The row over the way Italy exceeds its milk production quota
seems certain to resurface in Corfu. Brussels says Italy has not cut its
output in line with commitments two years ago. Italy wants higher quotas and
the end to UK-led court action to reverse a Commission decision to cut fines
against Rome. The dispute could block an increase in EU spending on regional
aid from next year.
Greece is likely to push for an early start to EU accession negotiations
with Cyprus; but her partners seem unlikely to commit themselves to the
Greek target date of January 1, 1995.
One of the least contentious items appears to a Franco-German proposition to
tackle racism and xenophobia, through education programmes and cultural
exchange.
The German chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, is keen to use the Union statement as
political cover for cracking down on right-wing racism at home; but Italy
may interpret the declaration as an indirect attack on neo-fascists in the
Berlusconi government.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Times price cut to 20p in war with Telegraph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch last night stepped up Britain's newspaper wars, cutting
the price of The Times by 10p to 20p, one day after The Daily Telegraph
dropped its price to 30p.
Earlier in the day, the London Stock Exchange launched an investigation into
the circumstances surrounding the Telegraph's action, amid fierce City
criticism of the recent share sale by proprietor Mr Conrad Black.
The Stock Exchange visited the Telegraph's offices where it was provided
with documents showing the sequence of events leading up to the price cut.
It is also investigating share sales by two Telegraph employees on
Wednesday.
Telegraph shares plunged by 191p to 349p yesterday, 40 per cent below the
price at which Hollinger, the Canadian publishing group controlled by Mr
Black, sold Pounds 73m of shares on May 19.
The shares were bought by Cazenove, the Telegraph's stockbrokers, and
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, which sold them on to institutional
investors, including fund manager Henderson Administration.
The purchasers, nursing total losses of almost Pounds 30m, expressed anger
at the timing of the Hollinger sale. One institution said: 'This is a
serious matter which we will be taking up with the non-executive directors.'
Mr Black said the documents provided to the Stock Exchange showed that the
price cut decision was made after June 10, when the Telegraph management saw
figures showing the surge in the Times sales in May. 'At the time of the
share sale, which we discussed with the Telegraph management, we could see
nothing other than business as usual through the summer,' he said.
Mr Black said he was not told of the Telegraph management's recommendation
to cut the price until June 14. The Telegraph had intended to make the price
cut next week but was rushed into it.
'I agreed with the decision and although I knew it would be embarrassing for
me I could not say 'you can't do that for the sake of your chairman's public
relations convenience',' Mr Black said.
Lord Swaythling, the Telegraph's senior non-executive director, said: 'I am
absolutely convinced that the executive management had not contemplated the
price cut until very recently.'
Shares in Hollinger fell CDollars 1 3/4 in Toronto to close at CDollars 14
3/8 .
Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, said he was determined to maintain
the momentum in making The Times 'a permanently profitable paper'. Now
selling 515,000, it would probably need sales of between 800,000-900,000 to
be profitable at 20p.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Respite for dollar but markets stay nervous
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US administration's defiant response to the dollar's renewed plunge
earlier this week appeared to be paying off yesterday as the currency held
steady.
But traders warned that the foreign exchange markets remained extremely
nervous and suggested the administration had not yet reversed the general
trend of the dollar's decline.
In London, the dollar closed slightly higher against both the yen and D-Mark
at Y101.15 and DM1.6035 respectively, from Y100.695 and DM1.6006 on
Wednesday. In late trading in New York, the dollar was a touch stronger
against both currencies.
Rumours of central bank intervention punctuated the day, but were not
translated into action. 'The dollar is sitting just slightly above the level
where intervention might be expected,' said Mr Michael Saunders, economist
at Salomon Brothers.
The US currency's steadiness helped most European bond and stock markets,
although shares traded lower in New York and bonds finished at mixed levels.
The US benchmark 30-year bond was unchanged, yielding 7.395 per cent. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 25.68 points to 3,699.09 on renewed
weakness in the technology sector.
Foreign exchange dealers appeared yesterday to have stayed largely on the
sidelines, for fear of concerted intervention by the central banks of the
Group of Seven leading industrial nations. That could change if signs of
disagreement emerge among the G7 partners in the run-up to their summit
meeting in Naples in two weeks.
Administration officials yester day reiterated Wednesday's up-beat
assessment by President Bill Clinton of the US economy.
Mr Leon Panetta, budget director, tried to reassure the debt markets, saying
the budget deficit could fall to Dollars 225bn (Pounds 147bn) in the current
fiscal year.
Bond markets were strong in Europe with 10-year German bunds up by around
half a point, following a Bundesbank decision to leave official interest
rates unchanged, and 10-year gilts up by around  5/8 of a point.
The German and French equity markets each rose by more than 1 per cent,
following a 2.2 per cent increase in Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index earlier in the
day. The main exception to the trend was London, where the FT-SE 100 index
fell 0.6 per cent.

FT  24 JUN 94 / Tougher rules planned for pensions: Fraud prevention
targeted in white paper - Regulator would enforce standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, JAMES BLITZ, and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A far-reaching overhaul of the occupational pensions industry, with the
proposed creation of a regulator with powers to enforce common standards,
was unveiled by the government yesterday.
Its white paper was tougher than had been expected, endorsing many of the
proposals urged nine months ago by its own advisory panel, the Goode
Committee.
The paper also proposes that pension schemes meet minimum solvency
standards, allow members to appoint at least a third of their scheme's
trustees, and contribute to a compensation scheme that will pay pensions if
assets disappear through fraud.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said the prevention of fraud was
at the heart of his proposals. He emphasised that no single measure could
provide a satisfactory defence against fraud, but claimed the new
arrangements could have prevented the Maxwell pensions scandal had they been
on the statute book some years ago.
Mr Lilley said his proposals would 'strengthen the whole pensions industry
by providing the three basic essentials of security, equality and choice'.
Industry reaction to the white paper was generally supportive, although
employers, scheme advisers and the pension industry's trade association all
expressed some reservations.
Industry professionals estimate pension schemes will have to spend 10 times
the Pounds 60m to Pounds 140m that the government says is needed to meet the
new standards. The Goode Committee was formed in June 1992 following the
death of Robert Maxwell and the subsequent discovery that more than Pounds
440m had disappeared from pension schemes he controlled.
The government proposes, however, that the regulator be less powerful than
suggested by the Goode Committee. It will have to rely largely on
'whistle-blowing' by professional advisers and scheme members to uncover
wrongdoing and will not routinely inspect scheme financial statements. Also,
contrary to recommendations that it be financed from general revenues, the
government proposes that a levy on industry finances a budget of about
Pounds 10m.
Labour criticised the white paper as failing to ensure the regulator would
be independent.
Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the Commons social security
committee, accused the government of making a mistake in deciding the
industry should pay for the regulator, instead of the state, saying 'people
will not trust a regulator that is not independent of the industry'.
Employers will have up to 10 years to meet new minimum solvency standards in
full. However, once they begin to take effect, employers whose schemes have
less than 90 per cent of assets needed to pay liabilities will have to add
additional cash almost immediately, a proposal which the industry had
opposed.
The white paper proposes eliminating guaranteed minimum pensions and
substituting a new protection against inflation. It will be required to
increase pensions in payment by 5 per cent or the rate of inflation,
whichever is lower. The white paper proposes linking tax rebates for
personal pension holders to their age and allowing those about to retire
some flexibility in buying an annuity.
Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds,
criticised the proposal to make schemes pay for the cost of the regulator.
'Regulation should be paid for by the state if - as we believe - it is in
the national interest for pension funds to be regulated effectively.'
Mr Nigel O'Sullivan, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow, said
the role of the regulator was too limited.

            Strengthening the industry: The main proposals
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  New pensions regulator will be funded by a levy on industry,
estimated at Pounds 10m
  Minimum solvency standards take effect in 1997. Schemes will have
five years to meet them, and another three years if they meet at least
90 per cent of the standard. Some may be required to shift investment
from equities to gilts
  Scheme members will have the right to appoint at least one-third of
trustees, with a minimum of one

FT  24 JUN 94 / MMC warns retailers about misleading CD 'hit' lists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK music industry was yesterday cleared of overcharging for compact
discs, but retailers were told to explain that the charts in their windows
often listed hits they wanted to sell rather than those already sold.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission, in a long-awaited report on the music
industry, said the way some retailers compiled their music charts was
misleading. The commission found that several retailers, including market
leader WH Smith and its Our Price subsidiary, based their charts on
predicted rather than actual sales.
The commission added: 'We were also concerned to learn that WH Smith had in
the past charged record companies for inclusion in the chart.' It said it
was 'unacceptable to display a chart which might well have the effect of
misleading consumers'.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that he had
asked Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, to seek
assurances from retailers that they would specify at the point of display
how their charts had been compiled.
The misleading charts were the only sour note for the music industry in a
report which otherwise acquitted it of overcharging for CDs, an accusation
levelled persistently by the Consumers' Association and by the House of
Commons national heritage committee.
The national heritage committee last year called for a cut of at least
Pounds 2 in the dealer price of CDs. It said the music industry had given no
adequate explanation of why CDs cost less in the US than in the UK.
The Commission said, however, that the price of CDs was determined by what
consumers were prepared to pay. It said that industrialised countries other
than the US generally had higher CD prices than the UK.
The Commission said the CD price differences between the US and the UK
largely resulted from different tax arrangements. Sales taxes in the US were
lower than the UK's 17.5 per cent value added tax rate. Full price popular
CDs were on average only seven to 9 per cent more expensive in the UK than
the US.
The Consumers' Association called the report 'astonishingly complacent'. Mr
Stephen Locke, the association's policy director, said: 'The toothless
watchdog that is the MMC has come up with yet another weak and muddle-headed
report . . .The losers are consumers.'

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: First Leisure shares fall despite advance
to Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First Leisure yesterday announced interim profits up 16 per cent to Pounds
14.1m pre-tax, but warned that there was still no sign of a substantial
upturn in consumer spending.
Mr John Conlan, chief executive of the discotheques, bowling and tourist
attractions group, said consumers did appear to be going out more and
spending more.
He added that market conditions were more encouraging than they had been for
some time, but he said: 'What we haven't seen is a boom around the corner.
We shouldn't over-anticipate the speed and scale of the recovery.'
The City reacted badly to the announcement, marking First Leisure's shares
down 19p to 289p. Analysts said this was more of a comment on the prospects
for leisure spending generally than on First Leisure, which is seen as a
well-managed group.
Turnover in the six months to May 1 rose 21 per cent to Pounds 62.9m.
Earnings per share were up 7 per cent from 5.74p to 6.15p. The interim
dividend is raised to 2.12p (2p).
Profits from tourist resorts fell 19 per cent to Pounds 1.3m, resulting from
an increased depreciation charge and accelerated pre-season marketing costs.
The group expects to benefit, however, from the publicity surrounding the
centenary of the Blackpool Tower.
Profits from the sports division, which includes bowling, a marina and a
health club, dipped 13 per cent to Pounds 6.6m. The fall resulted from
bowling, where price increases in 1992 ran into consumer resistance. Mr
Conlan said the group was in the process of introducing a new pricing policy
with the aim of enticing bowlers back.
The discotheques division saw profits increase by 13 per cent to Pounds
8.5m. Spending per head was up 2 per cent.
COMMENT
Reservations about First Leisure reflect doubts about the nature of
post-recession spending throughout the economy. Few know whether consumers
will resume their free-spending habits of the late 1980s, even when the good
times have fully returned. Early evidence from First Leisure is that leisure
consumers are not about to abandon their caution. A good summer in Blackpool
might restore enthusiasm for the group. That partly depends on the vagaries
of the British summer. Expected full-year pre-tax profits are Pounds 38.5m,
with earnings of 17p. The prospective multiple of 17 fairly reflects the
balance between competent management and an uncertain economic future.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Portuguese telecoms merged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal's three state-owned telecommunications companies are to be merged
today into a single unit. The new utility which will be the country's
largest company, is to be partially privatised by mid-1995, government
officials said yesterday.
The creation of Portugal Telecom is the first step in a restructuring that
will bring all the country's main telecommunications services under the
management of a single state monopoly.
The utility is to be progressively privatised but the state will keep a
'golden share,' enabling it to veto strategic decisions. Privatisation is to
begin next year with a public offer of 25 to 30 per cent. The operator would
later seek an international partner, officials said.
Portugal Telecom will be formed from three companies: Telefones de Lisboa e
Porto, which operates basic services in Lisbon and Oporto; Telecom Portugal,
which runs services in the rest of the country and with Europe and the
Mediterranean area; and Teledifusao Portuguesa, which beams television
signals.
Subsidiaries of the three companies that operate mobile telephone, cable
television and data transmission services are also to be brought into the
new utility. Portugal Telecom will have 22,000 employees and an estimated
value of more than Es1,000bn.
Radio Marconi, which operates Portugal's intercontinental telecommunications
services, will subsequently be merged with Portugal Telecom. The officials
said private investors, who own 49 per cent of Marconi, were expected to be
given a choice of selling their shares to the state or exchanging them for
shares in Portugal Telecom.
The government has not yet decided whether to sanction a proposal for a
Es30bn (Dollars 224m) management buy-out of Marconi's 40 overseas
subsidiaries and its 33 per cent holding in Telecomunicacoes Moveis
Nacionais, a state-controlled mobile telephone operator.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Peugeot sees 'real chance' of
profits

Peugeot Citroen, the French car group, has a 'real chance' of returning to
profit this year, despite an expected slowdown in the growth in the European
car market, Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman, said yesterday.
Addressing a shareholders' meeting, Mr Calvet said it was still too early to
say whether the company would achieve its three financial aims for this year
 -a return to profit after losses of FFr1.4bn (Dollars 250m) in 1993,
covering investments through cash flow and a sharp reduction in group debt.
The Peugeot chief said, however, that 'the first indications we have been
able to get lead us to think that barring a shake-up in the car or currency
markets, our chances of succeeding are real'.
According to Mr Calvet, sales rose strongly in the early part of the year.
In France, he said, sales had increased by 16 per cent in the first five
months, partly because of government measures to stimulate the industry.
These measures included paying FFr5,000 to car owners who trade in vehicles
more than 10 years old to buy a new one.
The impact of these measures has, however, begun to wear off. Mr Calvet
described the recovery in the European and French car markets as fragile,
and partly artificial.
Mr Calvet said that hard times still lay ahead, resulting from overcapacity
in the market, and uncertain demand. As a result, Peugeot Citroen will
continue to cut costs. This year, the company would again aim for a 12 per
cent improvement in productivity, Mr Calvet said.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Metallgesellschaft to sell HQ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the heavily indebted German metals, mining and
industrial group, has entered negotiations to sell its headquarters site in
the centre of Frankfurt.
The move follows the sale last week of an 80 per cent stake in its Buderus
engineering subsidiary, which raised DM1.2bn.
The Frankfurt site could have a market value of DM750m (Dollars 460m),
Metallgesellschaft said, but cautioned that not all the proceeds would flow
to its coffers as the land is jointly owned with a company controlled by
Dresdner Bank.
The group said it had entered into negotiations to sell the land as it made
no business sense to have administrative offices, a car park and research
laboratories on so valuable a site.
The planned sale of the land and the disposal of the Buderus stake come
against the background of continuing business problems at MG Corp, the
group's New York-based trading subsidiary, whose speculative trading in oil
derivatives brought Metallgesellschaft to the brink of collapse in January.
MG Corp was still a 'machine for losing money', Metallgesellschaft's
chairman Mr Kajo Neukirchen warned yesterday in an interview in the
employees' magazine. Problems in the US represented the biggest challenge to
Metallgesellschaft's recovery plans, he said.
MG Corp has become entangled in the affairs of Castle Corporation, a US oil
refinery with which MG Corp has entered into a number of what Mr Neukirchen
called 'inexplicable' contracts.
The contracts oblige MG Corp to supply Castle with crude oil and help it
finance the oil purchases. Then MG Corp is obliged to buy back the oil from
Castle - 40 per cent owned by MG Corp itself - at above the market price
until the year 2000. Mr Neukirchen said he was trying to extricate MG Corp
from the contracts but he could not predict when a solution might be found.
These contracts have required Metallgesellschaft to set up fresh provisions
to cover risks arising from the north American operations. The scale of the
provisions has not been disclosed but they are thought to be at least DM1bn.
Mr Neukirchen insisted that the sales of land and assets were not a direct
result of the north American problems, although earlier in the year the sale
of the Buderus holding had been ruled out.
Analysts had suggested that the change of heart implied that the Buderus
disposal was a 'forced sale'.
Metallgesellschaft had total debts of more than DM9bn at the end of March.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Yeltsin defied as deputies' militancy grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's lower house of parliament yesterday failed to pass the 1994 budget
at a third reading and came out strongly against President Boris Yeltsin's
decree against crime as it 'seriously limits the constitutional rights and
liberties of Russian citizens'.
The votes, together with a swell of protest against proposals from Mr
Vladimir Shumeiko, leader of the upper house and an ally of Mr Yeltsin, to
prolong the terms of both the parliament and the president by two years
without election, marks a sudden militancy in a body which has been
relatively restrained in its six-month life.
The ground on which it is preparing to fight - that of the constitution - is
similar to that on which Mr Yeltsin and the previous parliament divided and
ultimately fought. The difference this time is that the constitution is Mr
Yeltsin's creation.
The vote on the budget, which had been expected to go through after two
lower house readings in which it gained large majorities, followed its
rejection by the upper house earlier this week. The upper house had demanded
an increase in military spending in the budget from Rbs37,500bn to
Rbs55,000bn, following sustained lobbying by the military and military
industry.
A large majority of deputies voted for the budget but failed to secure the
required 225 votes. Between 215 and 220 voted in favour, with 43 against and
60 abstaining.
There was overwhelming support - 246 against 6 - for a resolution calling on
Mr Yeltsin to withdraw his decree announced last week 'on urgent measures to
protect the citizenry against banditry and organised crime'. The size of the
majority shows that opposition to the unconstitutional nature of the decree
has spread across all parties.
Mr Viktor Ilyukhin, a leading member of the Communist faction, said it broke
as many as eight articles of the constitution, while Mr Boris Fyodorov,
reformist leader of the Liberal Democratic Union, said that 'until the
government and president obey their own laws and its own constitution we
will not have reform here'.
The decree allows for a suspect to be held without charge for 30 days,
against the 48-hour limit specified by the constitution.

<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the French entrepreneur turned politician, will on Tuesday
face a National Assembly vote to decide whether to endorse yesterday's
recommendation by a committee to lift his parliamentary immunity. Mr Tapie,
whose left-wing Energie Radicale movement won 12 per cent of the votes in
this month's European elections, could then face two separate fraud charges
concerning the purchase of the Phocea, his luxury yacht. His immunity was
previously lifted late last year so he could be examined in a fraud case
concerning Testut, one of his old business interests. Mr Tapie's critics
have accused him of becoming a Euro-MP to stave off further legal threats. A
cartoon on the front page of today's Le Monde shows him monocycling across a
tightrope stretched between the French and European parliaments.

FT  23 JUN 94 / GE replaces top man at troubled Kidder Peabody
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric yesterday replaced Mr Michael Carpenter as chairman and
chief executive of Kidder Peabody, its troubled securities subsidiary, in a
move intended to shore up sagging confidence in the firm on Wall Street.
Mr Dennis Dammerman, GE's finance director, has taken over full-time
management of Kidder. GE has also created the post of president and chief
operating officer at the securities company for Mr Denis Nayden, an
executive vice-president at GE Capital, the group's financial services arm.
In a further attempt to restore confidence in the firm, Mr Jack Welch, GE's
chairman, took the unusual step of announcing that Kidder was likely to
report a loss of Dollars 25m-Dollars 30m for the three months to June 30.
The firm has been beset by reports that it had taken far bigger losses in
recent weeks on mortgage-backed bonds, a market which it dominates in the
US.
Mr Welch added that GE expected to report second-quarter earnings of Dollars
1.5bn.
The management shake-up at Kidder comes two months after Mr Welch expressed
confidence in Mr Carpenter and his management team in the wake of a phantom
profits scheme which rocked the Wall Street firm. Kidder has claimed that
the head of its government bond trading desk, Mr Joseph Jett, created
fictitious profits of Dollars 350m to boost his bonus, although Mr Jett has
said that he acted under instruction from senior Kidder executives.
Mr Welch said yesterday's management changes were being made to demonstrate
GE's continuing commitment to Kidder. The company came close to selling
Kidder two years ago, and the recent troubles have led to speculation that
it may try again to dispose of the business.
'Kidder's fundamentals are strong and we intend to provide whatever
financial and human resources are appropriate for the firm to realise its
potential,' Mr Welch said.
British-born Mr Carpenter had also been appointed by Mr Welch to run Kidder
after a troubled period at the firm. In 1989, when he was made chairman, the
firm had been rocked by insider trading allegations and poor profitability
after the 1987 crash.
GE called Mr Dammerman's involvement at Kidder 'a transition role', and said
he would return to his position as chief financial officer at the parent.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kidder gives GE a taste of
turmoil - Securities firm has been beset by speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the 13 years that Mr Jack Welch has headed General Electric, he has taken
it into dozens of different businesses. He became one of the most respected
big-company bosses in the US. But none of it prepared him for the whirlwind
that has whipped around Kidder Peabody for the past two months.
'This is the first experience we have in a business where perceptions, which
have no basis in fact, can become reality,' Mr Welch said yesterday.
Kidder has been assailed in recent weeks by incessant speculation about its
financial stability. It claims it was the victim of a large fraud with a big
portfolio of mortgage-backed bonds as bond markets were falling fast - so it
is little surprise there have been questions about its health. On Wall
Street, where financial firms live or die by the strength of their balance
sheets, rumours began to fly.
Other securities firms, lacking a strong parent such as GE, have succumbed
to this death by a thousand cuts. Drexel Burnham Lambert and E. F. Hutton
collapsed in the face of a liquidity crisis as market confidence
disappeared.
Had GE not acted, it could have happened to Kidder. Mr Welch yesterday said
the securities firm had not experienced any funding problems, but it might
have done in time. Like all securities firms, Kidder - with assets of more
than Dollars 100bn at the end of March - relies on the confidence of the
markets.
There were signs that some customers, particularly retail ones, were
deserting, Mr Welch added. 'We didn't have any problems - yet. But it was
going to get worse and worse.'
The management changes at Kidder follow GE's decision to inject Dollars 200m
of new capital in to the firm to plug the gap left by the phantom profits
scheme allegedly set up by Mr Joseph Jett. GE disclosed yesterday that
Kidder has reduced its assets by about Dollars 17bn since the end of March,
to Dollars 90bn, to increase financial flexibility.
Its portfolio of mortgage-backed bonds had been cut to under Dollars 10bn
from Dollars 16bn, Mr Welch added. These securities - bonds whose interest
and principal are backed by the payments on pools of individual mortgage
loans - have aroused the greatest concerns.
A GE analysis last year indicated Kidder could lose as much as Dollars 100m
on these bond holdings if the market moved against it. This was a risk the
company was prepared to take, given the profitability of this part of its
business.
With US interest rates rising since February and bond markets falling, the
losses in mortgage bonds amount to about Dollars 30m. Kidder will report
second-quarter losses after tax of Dollars 25m-Dollars 30m, GE said.
Mr Welch was unequivocal yesterday in his praise of Kidder's mortgage-backed
bonds group for limiting the damage. Led by Mr Mike Vranos, reputedly one of
the highest-paid traders on Wall Street, they had performed like heroes, and
had done better than '99 per cent of GE managers' faced with such difficult
circumstances, Mr Welch said.
Mr Dennis Dammerman, GE's chief financial officer, and Mr Denis Nayden, the
number two at GE Capital, gave no hints yesterday about what they will do at
Kidder.
The firm still faces an investigation into the Jett affair, undertaken by Mr
Gary Lynch, a former head of enforcement of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and due next month. It also faces an uncertain market - in the
second half of this year, it could make or lose Dollars 50m, said Mr Welch.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Paribas seizes Stoltzenberg's
Perkins stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banque Paribas has seized a 17.5 per cent stake in Montreal-based Perkins
Papers, a sizeable North American paper towel and toilet paper manufacturer,
from Mr Wolfgang Stoltzenberg, the German-Canadian financier whose property
empire collapsed two years ago.
But the French bank, which is due to take formal possession of its shares
today, is embroiled in a dispute over a voting trust between Mr Stoltzenberg
and a US west coast family which is Perkins' biggest single shareholder.
The disagreement means that almost two-thirds of Perkins' shares cannot be
voted. Unable to muster a quorum, Perkins has delayed its annual meeting,
which was due to be held yesterday, for at least a month.
Mr Rocco Bramwell, Perkins' chief executive, said that the dispute does not
affect day-to-day operations and that he expects the voting trust issue to
be resolved in the near future. Perkins' has annual sales of CDollars 117m
(USDollars 84m) and employs about 800 people.
Mr Stoltzenberg, who lives in London, pledged his Perkins shares to Paribas'
Swiss subsidiary as collateral for a loan to one of his private companies.
The market value of the shares is currently just under CDollars 6m, but they
were worth as much as CDollars 19.4m before the recent recession.
The crux of the dispute is Paribas' claim that it is entitled to the three
seats formerly controlled by Mr Stoltzenberg under the voting trust on
Perkins' seven-member board.
Paribas is also among the leading creditors of Montreal-based Castor
Holdings, the top company of a tangled international property syndication
group led by Mr Stoltzenberg which collapsed in 1992 with debts of CDollars
1.4bn.
According to the bankruptcy trustee, Castor's affairs are still 'years away'
from being wound up. Creditors have been warned that they are unlikely to
recover anything, barring the discovery of a large chunk of missing funds.
The trustee is still trying to get to the bottom of Castor's far-flung and
intricate affairs. Besides investigations in Canada, the probe has been
widened to Curacao, Ireland and Switzerland, among other places.
The Canadian police have been called in, but no criminal charges have so far
been laid.

Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the pharmaceuticals company formed when the French
state-owned chemicals company took a majority stake in the US drug
manufacturer, announced last night that second-quarter profits would be
lower than expected and that it would take a restructuring charge of Dollars
121m, or 58 cents a share, in the quarter.
After taking the charge, the company said it will post a 'small loss' in the
quarter.
Excluding the charge, Rhone-Poulenc said it expected earnings of between 50
cents and 55 cents a share - well below Wall Street estimates of 77 cents a
share - because of slower than expected sales.
Rhone-Poulenc also said that the impact of the charge would not be made up
in the second half of the year, which means its full-year earnings will come
in roughly level with last year. In 1993, the company earned Dollars 421.1m,
or Dollars 2.96 a share, on sales of Dollars 4.02bn.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Amgen shares hit by legal battle
over drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The share price of Amgen, the biggest biotechnology company in the US, fell
5 per cent on Wall Street yesterday. The fall was triggered by concerns that
a legal battle between two smaller US biotech groups might lead to the
launch of a product to rival Epogen, the drug used to treat kidney failure
which last year accounted for about 40 per cent of Amgen's sales.
Investors sold Amgen shares, which ended down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 42
7/8 on the Nasdaq market yesterday, after Genetics Institute, a
Massachusetts-based company, filed a suit against Ortho Pharmaceutical.
It claimed its manufacture and sale of erythropoietin in the US infringed
Genetics' patent covering pharmaceutical compositions containing
erythropoietin. Ortho, a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Amgen are the only
two companies in the US selling erythropoietin compounds.
Genetics, which is majority owned by American Home Products, said yesterday
it was filing the suit because it should be rewarded for the 'significant
patentable contribution' it made to the discovery and development of
erythropoietin, a protein which stimulates the growth and production of red
blood cells. Drugs containing the protein are used to treat kidney failure
and anaemias.
Wall Street is concerned that if Genetics wins the suit against Ortho, it
will be able to produce a rival erythropoietin compound that could steal
market share from Epogen.
The outlook for Epogen is crucial to Amgen, which is relying on rapid growth
in the product's sales to compensate for the slowdown in sales of Neupogen,
its successful cancer treatment drug which is used worldwide as an adjunct
to chemotherapy.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: MEPC to buy Belfast shopping centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, has agreed to buy the
Castlecourt shopping centre in Belfast from John Laing, the construction and
housebuilding group, for initial and deferred payments expected to exceed
Pounds 80.5m.
The deal is in line with MEPC's strategy of increasing the retail component
of its portfolio. John Laing is selling the property because it does not
wish to be a long term holder of developed investment properties.
John Laing intends to use the proceeds from the disposal to expand existing
activities, particularly projects in the Pacific Rim, and in private
infrastructure in the UK.
MEPC has agreed to pay an initial sum of not less than Pounds 72.5m next
month, and a further minimum amount of Pounds 1.65m next February. There
will be additional payments up to 1998, based on the capitalised value of
rents achieved on further lettings and the outcome of rent reviews. The deal
is subject to shareholders' approval.
The 320,000 sq ft shopping centre opened in April 1990. Rental income in
1993 was Pounds 5.2m. It has been valued on an open market basis at Pounds
80.5m.
The net book value of Castlecourt at the end of last year was Pounds 60m.
The disposal will generate an extra Pounds 7.1m of pre-tax profits for
Laing's full year and will realise net cash of Pounds 30m, after the
deduction of costs and repayment of Pounds 40m of bank borrowings.
Laing has also agreed to sell Churchgate in Peterborough for Pounds 2.5m,
payable on completion and a minimum further consideration of Pounds 2.5m,
payable within five years.
Laing said trading conditions remained difficult in its UK construction
activities and margins remained under pressure. However, work intake
compared favourably with this time last year.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Clinton drops threat of N Korea sanctions: US agrees to
talks after assurance on N-programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday announced that the US had agreed to
high-level talks with North Korea in Geneva next month, after receiving
assurances that Pyongyang would halt its nuclear programme and allow
international inspectors to monitor the freeze.
The announcement followed days of diplomatic uncertainty as the US sought to
verify that the offer relayed by former US president Jimmy Carter last week
from North Korean President Kim Il-sung met the US's conditions.
'Their definition of freeze was the same as ours,' Mr Clinton said.
North Korea had confirmed that it would not attempt to reload its nuclear
reactor nor to reprocess any of the spent nuclear fuel it has unloaded in
recent weeks, Mr Clinton said.
It would also allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to keep
inspectors in the country to verify that the promised freeze was in fact
being carried out.
The US, meanwhile, will suspend its efforts to persuade the United Nations
Security Council to vote for economic sanctions against North Korea.
Mr Clinton said the moves were 'not a solution to the problem but they do
mark a new opportunity to find a solution'.
He hinted at the possibility of economic assistance and normal diplomatic
relations as the US sought 'to give North Korea a way of moving with dignity
into the international community'.
In the days since Mr Carter returned from Pyongyang, US policy has appeared
to be in some disarray. While the White House cautiously sought formal
confirmation from North Korea through the slow channels of diplomatic
communication at the UN, the former president appeared to undercut his
successor's position by announcing on television that the crisis was over
and that the US had abandoned its sanctions drive.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said that the apparent
confusion had been exaggerated.
'I don't see any incoherence about this. We cannot allow North Korea to
manufacture nuclear weapons; that is an absolute. But they don't have to
stop by teatime today,' he said during a visit to Washington yesterday.
In Seoul earlier yesterday, South Korean officials expressed optimism that
an unprecedented summit meeting with North Korea would take place, after
Pyongyang agreed to discuss arrangements.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Russia warns Nato on allies: Moscow signs landmark
Partnership for Peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, yesterday urged Nato not to
risk provoking public opinion in his country by rushing to welcome east
European countries as members of the alliance.
The appeal was made during a visit to Brussels for a Nato meeting hailed as
a landmark in Russia's links with the west. Representatives of Nato's 16
member states were gathered to honour Russia as the 21st, and most
important, member of Partnership for Peace, the military co-operation
programme.
The partnership is intended to broaden military co-operation in Europe and
the former Soviet republics, setting up programmes for joint peacekeeping
exercises and grooming countries for eventual Nato membership.
Mr Kozyrev told Nato many Russians needed convincing that the alliance was
not intent on a 'triumphant march eastwards'.
The Russian minister said a 'major psychological adjustment' would be
necessary before his fellow citizens could accept the idea of countries like
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joining the alliance.
In welcoming the Russian participation, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary
of state, said that 'by widening the reach of the great post-war security
and economic institutions, we can help ensure that war, poverty and
oppression never again engulf this continent'.
Mr Kozyrev shelved demands that Nato be subsumed by the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe, a loose club of 53 nations whose
current brief is more diplomatic than military, and said time would tell
which was the most important institution.
'Experience will show the correct combination and determine the real value
of each of them,' Mr Kozyrev said.
As well as signing up to the partnership, Mr Kozyrev and his hosts approved
a separate document that will usher in a broader relationship between Russia
and Nato, including a dialogue on European security issues.
But allowing Russia to negotiate this side agreement before joining the
partnership has dismayed central and east European states, who were told
they must adhere to PFP first and then refine their links with NATO.
Nato said it was satisfied that the document's final text did not give
Moscow any automatic right to sit in on their private discussions. Diplomats
said that in four days of haggling over the text, Russia showed goodwill by
agreeing to work from a Western draft but it won some important concessions.
One was the exclusion of a phrase that would pledge Russia and Nato not to
interfere in each other's decision-making process. Another was the inclusion
of a reference to Russia's importance as a nuclear power.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Society defends insolvency practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leading insolvency trade body yesterday defended the practice by which
bankers can appoint as receivers the same firm of accountants they initially
hired to investigate a troubled company.
Critics - including a company director, two accountancy firms and the Royal
Bank of Scotland - have said that there may be a potential conflict of
interest in the arrangement and have called for an independent inquiry.
The Society of Practitioners of Insolvency (SPI) said a consultation
exercise it carried out with the accountancy profession's joint ethics
committee two years ago concluded that the 'overwhelming majority' of those
asked supported the existing position. However, details from the survey
which were submitted to the council of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales last year show that 30 per cent believed
there was a conflict.
The remaining 70 per cent agreed with a carefully-phrased statement in which
they were asked whether they agreed that the conflict for investigating
accountants was 'perceived rather an actual'.
It is believed that one respondent from outside the profession and at least
one accountancy firm called for a ban although there was no question
soliciting this response.
The exercise led to a few minor changes in ethical guidance on insolvency,
including a requirement that investigating accountants made it clear who
they were acting for.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Patten to issue apology in court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, is expected to agree in court today
to pay damages and to apologise unreservedly to Birmingham's chief education
officer whom he called 'a nutter'.
A solicitor for Mr Patten is expected to admit that his remarks about
Professor Tim Brighouse were untrue and without justification.
Mr Patten's comments were made while he was speaking to a fringe meeting at
last October's Tory party conference. He said Birmingham education authority
was useless and had apointed 'this nutter' as director.
He accused Prof Brighouse, chief education officer in Oxfordshire between
1978 and 1989, of 'blathering away about education dreams and visions' and
getting the county's service into a 'dreadful muddle' before he was made
professor of education at Keele University 'as a reward'.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Cameroon players considering 'strike'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cameroon players are considering a strike for their game with Brazil on
Friday because the players have not been paid.
'It's possible,' Joseph-Antoine Bell, the team's goalkeeper and captain,
said last night.
Bell, speaking in San Francisco, said the dispute has been going on for some
time. The players reportedly have not been paid for two months and it is not
clear how much they are owed.
'It's always the same problem,' he said. 'The players are not happy. They
have not gotten their bonuses, their salaries.
'I know there is a possibility to arrange everything, to solve the problem.
But the players are anxious, because nothing has been done.'
Cameroon's French coach, Henri Michel, acknowledged the financial problems
and said it is having a detrimental effect on his players.
'The players have not received pay for games,' he said. 'The players are
losing confidence and they want a guarantee. It's difficult to concentrate
on games.'
No soccer team has ever gone on strike at the World Cup. The Portuguese
players considered such action at the 1986 tournament, but the matter was
resolved with their federation.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Swiss bank three points in thriller against
Romania
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In one of the most open and entertaining games of the tournament so far,
Switzerland romped to their first World Cup finals victory for 40 years by
beating the fancied Romanians 4-1 to put themselves in a strong position to
progress to the second phase.
Four points from two matches and a 5-2 aggregate goal edge should be enough
against all but a complete collapse against Colombia next Sunday.
After Switzerland's Alain Sutter - who is heading for Bayern Munich after
the tournament - had a goal disallowed for offside, the Swiss turned up the
heat and there was no doubt about his sensational strike five minutes later
which give his side the lead.
Romania's influential playmaker Georghe Hagi has a tendency to blow hot and
cold, and last night he was distinctly chilly until the 36th minute, when he
curled a spectacular long-range equalizer past Marco Pascolo.
The Swiss came out after the break with more than their supporters' cowbells
ringing. Stephan Chapuisat got the lead back after 52 minutes following a
goal mouth scramble with more than a suspicion of a Swiss handball.
There was just a hint of offside in Adrian Knup's 65 minute third goal, but
nothing could take away from the beauty of Sforza's powerful run and pass to
set it up. Knup got another seven minutes later, deflecting a right-wing
cross from close range.
There was further misery for Romania when substitute Ion Vladoiu, who had
been on the pitch for just four minutes, was sent off for a wild tackle on
Chapuisat.
The result leaves Romania needing at least a draw against the USA next
Sunday to clinch their place in the next round.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Dramatic currency surge both mesmerises and horrifies:
Manufacturers fear a decline in profitability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Small huddles of Japanese salarymen broke off their early morning journey to
work in central Tokyo to pause outside the numerous banks and brokers whose
shop windows bear the latest electronic news from the financial markets.
They were hoping to catch a glimpse of the moment when their currency hit
the magical figure of parity with the US cent. But if they were mesmerised
by the ascent of the mighty yen their bosses were stunned at the blow to
nascent recovery hopes.
Some thought the drama apocalyptic. 'The abnormally strong yen will not only
damage the Japanese economy which has been gradually recovering but bring
about the collapse of manufacturers in the country,' said Mr Takeshi Nagano,
president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren).
What hurts most is that they had thought it could not get any worse. Last
year corporate Japan expected the yen to hover around the 120 mark, and were
caught on the hop when it stayed below 110. Chastened, this year most have
planned for a dollar/yen rate of 105. Suddenly even that caution starts to
look optimistic.
Only last month equity analysts were forecasting a healthy return to profits
growth this year after a record-breaking four straight years of decline. But
the yen's climb could halt that. According to Nikko Research, each one yen
rise in the yen against the dollar knocks 3.4 per cent off manufacturers'
pre-tax profits.
Some companies have insurance policies in the form of forward hedged yen
positions, but all acknowledged the key test would be whether a 100 yen
dollar proves durable. 'The economy was at a turning point,' said Mr
Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, 'but if the
yen stays above 100 the upward trend will be halted and growth could be
flat.'
Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia, thought that
unlikely, as the country's huge trade surplus was at last beginning to
shrink. 'We are in the last stage of yen appreciation, and it's not going to
stay long,' he said.
But Japan's battered manufacturers have been told for years that the yen's
rise cannot go on for ever. On a depressingly historic day for them, many
were beginning to doubt it.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Italy gives debt and inflation a higher priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lamberto Dini, Italian treasury minister, yesterday signalled a shift in
economic policy of the new Berlusconi government, by emphasising the battle
against inflation and the need to tackle the budget deficit and Italy's
debt.
His statement to the annual meeting of the Italian Bankers' Association was
an attempt to win back the financial markets' confidence in the government's
economic policy. It follows a Treasury statement, in a similar tone, on
Monday and pledges by Mr Dini last Friday of a tough 1995 budget.
'The priority of Italian economic policy must be to deal with any risks that
might arise from the recovery,' Mr Dini said. The economy is expected to
grow next year by 2.5 per cent.
The two fundamental guidelines were to 'maintain a low rate of inflation and
restore the health of public finances'. The former director-general of the
Bank of Italy added: 'Without restoring the health of public finances, none
of the macro-economic objectives can be reached.'
He criticised the Ciampi government for failing to pursue rigorously Italy's
public finances and the debt stock, now exceeding 120 per cent of GDP. He
warned of a big shake-up in the main areas of public spending - health,
pensions and the public administration - and told the unions to sustain
their level of moderate wage claims and be prepared for a more flexible
labour market.
In a further signal to the markets, he said the government was prepared to
go beyond existing privatisation plans and divest itself of its entire stake
in financial institutions, worth L13,000bn (Pounds 5.3bn).
Since taking office a month ago, the government has given confused signals
on policy priorities. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, has
consistently played down the need for tough measures and has emphasised the
need for job creation and business confidence to fuel recovery.
As a result, initial measures have been directed at job creation and Mr
Berlusconi has sought to avoid a mid-year mini-budget to hold the budget
deficit to about 10 per cent of GDP. The government has yet to present an
outline of its macro-economic objectives in the context of the 1995 budget.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ethnic Albanians yesterday refused to participate in the census in
Macedonia, a move which threatens to heighten tensions in the fragile Balkan
republic. For the second day running, ethnic Albanians ignored the
population survey, which they hope will confirm that their numbers warrant
greater participation in the Macedonian state. They have objected to the
number of documents needed to prove citizenship, which they say most
Albanians do not have. Albanians claim that they account for nearly twice as
much as the official figure of 22 per cent, established in the 1991 census -
which they boycotted. If ethnic Albanians decide to launch a mass boycott,
the Party of Democratic Prosperity, their main political group, is likely
pull out of the coalition government. With elections planned for this year,
an Albanian withdrawal would upset the fragile coexistence with the majority
Slavic Macedonians and undermine stability in the republic itself.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (12): Island's charm is under threat / A
look at the impact that market liberalisation may have on Cheju
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The beautiful volcanic island province of Cheju provides a good example of
the challenges that South Korea is confronting in opening its domestic
market to foreign competition.
Its half-million citizens are debating whether the benefits offered by wider
international access will outweigh the disruptive changes caused by market
liberalisation.
Cheju, which lies 100 kilometres south of the Korean mainland, will be one
of regions most affected by the relaxation of restrictions on agricultural
imports under the recent Uruguay round of Gatt.
The threatened decline of the agricultural industry, which has supported the
island for centuries, is accelerating a shift toward international tourism
as the province's new economic mainstay.
This is also forcing a change in attitudes on the island, which has
traditionally displayed a fierce independence to the outside world.
Cheju's tragic history has been marked by frequent revolts against the
central government in Seoul. Its farmers were mostly freeholders, rather
than tenants as in the rest of Korea, which contributed to a resentment
against the heavy hand of the central government.
The rebellious nature of the island was reinforced by its role as a place of
banishment for political exiles until the expiration of the Korean monarchy
in 1910.
The island suffered a mini-civil war in 1948-49, which was a harbinger of
the Korean War of the 1950-53, when the Seoul government adopted a tough
policy in reasserting its authority over the island following Korea's
liberation from Japanese colonial rule.
An estimated 30,000 persons, about 12 per cent of the island's population at
the time, were killed during the insurrection.
The island's bloody history has created ambivalent attitudes toward the vast
changes being imposed on Cheju from the outside.
The most significant development will be the decline of agriculture, which
still accounts for 36 per cent of the island's economy.
Cheju's agricultural industry is largely based on tangerines, which are
grown on small, inefficient and heavily state-subsidised farms on the
southern half of the island. The full opening of the Korean market to
tangerine imports by 2004 is likely to lead to a consolidation of local
farms.
The government, however, hopes to take advantage of the lower trade barriers
promised by the Uruguay round to increase tangerine and other agricultural
exports to Japan, which are expected to triple within the next five years to
Dollars 100m.
Cheju is seeking to create a sales network for agricultural products in
Japan and establish direct shipping routes there for the quick delivery of
produce.
But these measures are only meant to preserve some of island's agricultural
industry and will do little to sustain Cheju's economic growth. Instead, the
government is concentrating on inter- national tourism as the key instrument
to revive the island's fortunes.
The natural beauty of the island is well-suited to attract visitors. Its
landscape bears more similarities to Europe than to Asia, combining the
volcanoes of Iceland with the moors of Ireland and the coast of northern
Italy. The push for tourism began in the 1970s, when Cheju was developed as
a honey- moon resort for Korean couples. It enjoyed a captive market since
overseas travelling by Koreans was severely restricted by the government
until the late 1980s. Tourism in the past few years has become the island's
biggest industry, accounting for 40 per cent of the economy.
But the recent easing of travel restrictions has meant that Korean
newly-weds are now visiting Guam, Saipan and Hawaii instead. Cheju has
switched its tourism strategy to attracting more foreign visitors,
particularly from Japan and Taiwan.
A total of Won7,390bn will be invested in Cheju by 2001 to build a series of
resort complexes in an attempt to increase tourism by 50 per cent to 5.3m
visitors annually. The emphasis will no longer be on mass tourism, but on
attracting prosperous individual travellers.
'We would like to build more hotels, sports facilities, aquariums, amusement
parks, yacht marinas and casinoes in the hope of making Cheju the Las Vegas
of Asia,' says Mr Chi Youn-tai, president of the Korean National Tourism
Corporation.
The KNTC has already established one resort complex at Chungman Beach and
will participate in the construction of two others. The Hanjin conglomerate,
which owns the country's main carrier Korean Air, is also planning to build
a resort facility.
The government estimates that increased tourism by high-spending visitors
will quintuple the size of the island's economy to Won7,800bn by 2001.
But the islanders have expressed resentment at the development plans. 'Cheju
people are very independent- minded and don't like to be interfered with by
outsiders,' admits Mr Chi. 'These people sometimes feel that the outsiders
are reaping all the advantages of the development and they are left with
little.'
But the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and its impact on the island's
agricultural sector are changing people's attitudes. 'They now realise that
they have a beautiful place for tourism, which will mean their survival.
They are beginning to understand that tourism is very important,' Mr Chi
explained. Public opposition to the building of a second golf course on
Cheju, for example, is receding.
But the threat remains that extensive development will spoil the island's
con- siderable natural charm and destroy the appeal that first attracted
visitors to Cheju.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (13): Overseas publicity criticised -
Efforts to boost tourism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
This season's T-shirts in Seoul feature the cute kids of the Visit Korea
Year logo, banal grins distorted in fear and chubby legs in flight as a Scud
missile approaches from the armpit zone. The legend runs: 'You'd better
visit Korea in 1994 . . . because it might not be here in 1995'.
North Korea's nuclear ambitions have undoubtedly made something of a mockery
of the republic's drive to woo tourists in 1994; but hoteliers and other
industry figures complain the drive has been as ill-conceived as it has been
ill-timed. Marketing has been thin and poorly targeted, incentive schemes
have gone unflagged. The tourist office in Seoul shows an exotic promotional
video containing war clips among shots of cherry blossom and snow-clad
mountains.
The Korean National Tourism Corporation will spend some Dollars 8m on the
campaign, promoting Korea as a tourist destination through TV advertisements
on Star TV and CNN, publicity tours for travel agents and school teachers,
poster ads on buses from London to Hong Kong, and - intriguingly - through
sending some 50 Miss Korea contestants to entice Americans in New York, Los
Angeles and Washington to sample the delights of Korea. That could well be
the winning stratagem in KNTC's armoury.
KNTC, which has masterminded the Visit Korea Year in commemoration of
Seoul's sixth centennial, claims success: tourist arrivals in the first five
months of the year are up 18 per cent year-on-year and it expect 4m visitors
for the whole of 1994, a 20 per cent increase on last year's 3.3m but still
below the 4.5m forecast in its own promotional slide presentation. The
average visitor spends four days and five nights, during which he will spend
Dollars 1,100.
Ambassador Chi Young-tai, KNTC's president, says the figures are encouraging
and blames any shortfall in visitors on the nuclear issue. 'Sometimes
relations are stormy between North and South Korea and unfortunately this is
a very stormy period, but I'm sure the cloud will pass over.
'If you look around it's business as usual - the stock market is rising and
traffic jams are as bad as ever - so it's only the news media that see
things differently.'
KNTC's efforts in pushing tourism are impressive: the tourist office,
complete with theatre and raised map models, must rate as one of the most
comprehensive and user-friendly in the world and staff display CD-Rom
memories and impeccable English. The trouble is that they are to an extent
preaching to the converted rather than broadcasting the message further
afield.
That, at any rate, is the lament of the hoteliers. The 1,500-room Lotte, one
of Seoul's leading tourist hotels, reports no noticeable improvement in
sales this year - because of the nuclear scare, the recession in Japan which
provides 70 per cent of its customers (although this is offset to some
extent by the strength of the yen) and the government's failure to spread
the Visit Korea Year message abroad.
According to a hotel executive, 'Malaysia had a very good Visit Malaysia
Year, but we have not been so successful in promoting sales in Visit Korea
Year. That is mainly because the KNTC is in charge of sales promotion. I
guess the promotion planning is a little strange and out of date.
'They do not have enough experience in promoting abroad, nor have they made
sufficient preparations in time. That - and the fact the budget is
insufficient - is why they have failed,' he explains.
Ms Seung Eun Chung, sales manager (Europe) for The Westin Chosun, one of
Seoul's 10 de luxe hotels, cites the case of a Canadian travel agent who was
unaware of one of the government's key incentives - scrapping the 10 per
cent tax which is normally added to room rates for non-resident guests and
travel agencies.
Having been told, the agent tried to contact the Korean government
representatives in Toronto for further information - but drew blanks all
round. Many guests staying in the Westin Chosun and benefiting from the 10
per cent reduction were also unaware of the government's bounty.
'My feeling is that the government has failed to promote Visit Korea 1994
abroad. They have also failed to activate demand internally,' says Ms Chung.
Much of the push has been concentrated on Japan, which yields some 45 per
cent of Korea's tourists. The tireless KNTC has supported this internally by
providing Japanese as well as English booklets and cassettes for taxi
drivers, although Ambassador Chi admits to limited success here: 'They don't
realise how important their role is in promoting tourism. Sometimes they are
very rude, especially because of language problems.'
Broadcasting the need to learn English - 'to internationalise' - has been an
important spoke of the tourism campaign, and staff at hotels and shops are
well-versed in the (Americanised) niceties, bidding guests have a nice day
and sweet dreams depending on the time of day. A limited number of road and
subway signs now bear English translations and taxi drivers generally have
at least enough English to ascertain if their passengers are American.
Other steps taken to enhance Korea's reputation as a tourist destination
include streamlining the immigration and customs procedure and government
plans to invest funds in improving the country's infrastructure. Sports
facilities are also being upgraded and developed, as these are an important
part of Korea's tourism message.
Korea itself has a convincing message for tourists. Depending upon the
season, it offers skiing and mountain hiking in national parks; sightseeing
round old Buddhist temples and palaces; scuba diving, golf and hunting;
cherry blossom in springtime and a semi-tropical climate in the southern
island of Cheju. It is no longer particularly cheap (except, perhaps, to
those wielding yen), a problem KNTC has paid lip service to by producing a
book of money-off coupons.
This year Korea will host 300 international meetings in the capital city, in
addition to sports and leisure events - such as the underwater photographic
championship and international windsurfing contest - across the country.
For the big hotels, the real money spinner is business travellers who are
starting to return after a two-year recession-induced slack period. This
year the Westin Chosun expects to fill some 80 per cent of its rooms over
the year. The average room rate is as much as W110,000, except for the five
months' low season.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (10): Trade barriers foster overseas growth
/ A look at the secure home base of the country's car manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growing number of new Korean cars appearing in western cities from
London to Los Angeles is a sight that enrages European and US motor
companies.
While western carmakers worry that South Korea may repeat the success of
Japan in posing a serious challenge in their home markets, they are
virtually shut out of Korea, which is the second biggest car market in Asia
after Japan.
Korea last year imported only 1,984 passenger cars, which is almost the same
as the number of cars sold in a single day in the country. In contrast,
Korea exported a record 639,000 vehicles last year, with one third being
shipped to western Europe and the US.
Korea's restrictions against car imports are cited as one example of how the
country has used trade barriers to foster the growth of its main industries
by protecting them against foreign competition. The complete domination of
the domestic market by Korea's big three carmakers - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo
 -has helped transform the country into the world's sixth largest vehicle
producer.
Korean car manufacturers are now launching an aggressive export offensive in
Europe and the US from their secure home market.
Hyundai Motors, South Korea's largest car manufacturer and biggest vehicle
exporter, already has a strong presence in the US and Europe, which accounts
for 63 per cent of the company's overseas sales. Its marketing strength
reflects Hyundai's status as the only Korean car company that has been able
to sell vehicles under its own badge abroad through an independent dealer
network.
Kia Motors and Daewoo Motors, Korea's second and third largest car
companies, have also been shipping vehicles to the industrialised world by
supplying them on an original equipment manufacturing (OEM) basis to their
respective partners, Ford and General Motors.
They are now starting to establish an independent presence in Europe and the
US. Kia started marketing in western Europe last autumn and recently
announced that it would start producing its popular Sportage four-wheel
sports utility vehicle in Germany early next year in a joint venture with
Karmann, an automotive engineering group. Kia also plans to expand its US
distribution network to 330 dealers by 1996.
Daewoo will enter western Europe next year and the US in 1996 following the
recent collapse of its joint venture with GM, which had imposed export
restrictions on the Korean motor company.
The prospect of increased Korean vehicle exports is provoking European and
US car companies to demand that Korea open its market to foreign competition
or face retaliation.
European motor companies are calling on the EU to revoke the generalised
system of preferences (GSP) that lowers tariffs on Korean cars.
The US is asking that Korea cut its import tariff on passenger cars from 10
per cent to 2.5 per cent and revise vehicle taxes that discriminate against
foreign models. Restrictions on the number of distribution outlets available
to importers and a complex certification system are regarded as the main
non-tariff barriers to foreign cars.
Korea has already made a few concessions on the issue. The government says
it has abandoned tax audits of foreign car customers, a practice that
importers claim was meant to discourage their purchase as part of an
official crackdown on conspicuous consumption.
Seoul is considering some of the other demands made by Washington. US
officials expect that the luxury tax on executive cars will be cut and
limits on TV advertising will be eased.
The promise of lower barriers is already prompting more western car
manufacturers to open showrooms in Seoul. But most analysts believe that the
increased presence of European and US cars will not seriously threaten
Korean car companies. 'European carmakers will only have a minimal impact on
the market,' says Mr Gilles Anouil, head of the EU office in Seoul.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Korea estimates that if car imports
increase from their current market share of 0.14 per cent to 4.9 per cent,
the same level as in Japan, it would represent 70,000 vehicles with annual
sales of Dollars 1bn.
A greater potential threat to the Korean motor industry would be opening the
market to Japanese car imports, which are now virtually banned. 'Korean car
companies at their current stage of development cannot compete against the
Japanese,' says Mr Kim Moo, a vice president at Samsung Heavy Industries,
which is planning to enter the passenger car industry.
For a start, Japanese cars have a quality advantage over their Korean
competitors. They might even be price-competitive despite the high yen due
to better productivity in Japanese car factories and low transport costs
from Japan.
The government is considering dropping the import ban on Japanese cars in
1997, a measure that could disrupt Korea's ambitious programme to become one
of the world's five largest carmakers.
In spite of trade protection, Korean car companies suffer from low
profitability. Hyundai and Kia reported 1993 earnings of Won58bn and Won18bn
respectively, while Daewoo lost Won60bn. Although all had improved earnings
performance last year, analysts believe profits could have been much higher
given the 20 per cent rise in total sales. Increased marketing costs and
heavy debt burdens have cut into profits.
Competition in the domestic market is already expected to increase with the
entry of Ssangyong into the passenger car industry in 1996, followed
possibly by Samsung a year later. Although Korea remains one of the world's
fastest growing vehicle markets, there are doubts whether a nation of 42m
can support five car companies.
Growing pressure in the home market is the main cause for the Korean motor
industry's rapid expansion overseas. Besides western Europe and the US,
Korea is focusing on China as a new market. Car ownership in China is
expected to triple to 3m in the next decade. 'Korean vehicle makers view
China as the source of their future salvation,' says Mr Brian Gold, of
Euro-Asian Business Consultancy in Seoul.
Western car companies, frustrated about entering Korea, can at least take
comfort from the fact that their Korean rivals are having similar problems
in breaking open the Chinese market.
In what one Seoul-based western motor analyst calls 'the height of audacity
given Korea's own record,' Seoul recently asked Beijing to drop barriers
against Korean car imports.
Korea is also seeking to establish car factories in China as a means to
penetrate the market. But Beijing is demanding that the Koreans establish
joint venture automotive component plants as a first step, while postponing
approval for the car factories.
Some Korean car companies are resisting the request, believing that the
supply of components could give the Chinese the technical capability to
create an independent motor industry that might eventually challenge Korea.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (9): So close - and yet so far apart - Paul
Abrahams considers the affinity - and also the antipathy - towards the
Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS

<TEXT>
South Korea is xenophobic. Suspicion of foreigners and foreign goods is
instilled at primary schools, propagated by the media and practised by
bureaucrats and businesspeople. There are, of course, individual exceptions.
But South Korea is probably one of the most xenophobic countries in the
world.
The cause of this extraordinary collective dislike of things and people
foreign is not hard to fathom. Korea has been invaded, ravaged, and
economically exploited by foreign powers throughout its history. Forces from
the country's three powerful neighbours, Japan, China and Russia, have all
battled over the country, while even before the Korean War, troops from the
US, France and the UK each made incursions of various gravity.
Although Korea has endured onslaughts from all directions, South Korea's
xenophobia is targeted at one country in particular - Japan. A visit to the
Independence Hall of Korea, near Chonan, a shrine to nationalism visited
daily by thousands of children, explains why.
The most popular exhibit - in the Japanese Aggression Hall - is a waxwork
display illustrating Japanese soldiers during the occupation between 1910
and 1945. They are shown in the process of torturing Korean women, and
burying Korean men up to their necks before beheading them.
The hall explains to the children how the enmity between the two countries
dates back to the first Japanese invasion of 1592 when Shogun Toyotomi
Hideyoshi's forces ransacked the country. They can read citations of merit
awarded during the conflict which granted a stipend to Koreans who beheaded
more than one Japanese soldier. On view is a replica of one of the 'turtle
ships' that Admiral Yi Sun-Shin used to destroy the Japanese fleet. And in
case the message has not sunk in during the visit, the children can buy
comic books retelling the sagas of Korean heroes and heroines fighting
against the Japanese.
Admittedly, the museum does offer a few details of other foreign incursions.
The Manchurian invasion of the early 17th century, which was probably as
destructive as the earlier Japanese attack, is given a little space. One of
the hundreds of monuments erected in the 1870s by Regent Hungsun Taewon-gun
after the French and US landings is also on show. It reads: 'Western
barbarians invade our land. If we do not fight, we must then appease them.
To urge appeasement is to betray the nation.'
But the main emphasis of the museum is directed against the Japanese. Such
sentiment is propagated throughout South Korea. Take Korea's submarine
construction programme. The first vessel was called Changbogo-Ham, after the
1st century Korean admiral who fought the Japanese. The second was the Lee
Chun-ham, named after another admiral who struggled against the Japanese.
The third, the Choemuson-Ham, was named after the 14th century admiral who
destroyed about 500 Japanese pirate ships using gunpowder and guns. Fourth
was the Park-Wi-ham, after the admiral who attacked Tsushima Island in Japan
and crushed 300 Japanese vessels in 1389. Even South Korea's armaments
programme, the Yulgok project, is named after a 16th century court adviser
whose warnings about the possibility of a Japanese invasion were ignored.
The Japanese Aggression Hall focuses not only on the atrocities during the
colonial period, but also on the cultural imperialism imposed by Japan. In
the later stages of its colonial occupation, Japan attempted to force
complete union by obliging Koreans to adopt Japanese style names and
enforcing use of Japanese in state schools. Inability to speak Japanese
meant Koreans were denied ration cards. The Japanese also tried to stop the
Koreans wearing their traditional white clothes. Pictures in the hall also
show Koreans being forced to worship at Shinto shrines.
Few nations continue to poke at the sores of the second world war with as
much fervour as Korea. This compares with a Japan, where many continue to
deny Japanese blame for the outbreak of hostilities during the Manchurian
incident in the 1930s and refuse to admit that the Japanese army committed
atrocities during the subsequent war.
Earlier this year, Mr Shigeto Nagano was forced to resign as Japan's justice
minister just 10 days after taking office. The reason was that he had voiced
the view, commonly-held among older Japanese, that the massacre of 150,000
people in the former Chinese capital of Nanking in 1937 never happened. He
also claimed that the occupation of China had not been an act of aggression.
Many Japanese also still refuse to admit the role of the Japanese imperial
army in setting up brothels during the Pacific War using other Asian
nationals, including Koreans, known as comfort women. The Japanese
government only last year acknowledged and apologised for coercing such
women. At least 100,000 of them were Koreans.
As for Japanese attitudes to the colonial period, diplomats in Tokyo
privately regret that Koreans do not recognise the beneficial side of
colonialism. During 37 years of occupation, Korea's economy was transformed,
they say. Feudalism was abolished, the political and judicial systems
updated, the economy advanced from an agrarian to a semi-industrial state.
Agricultural production increased, railways were built and mining and
forestry operations vastly expanded. Such patronising attitudes infuriate
the Koreans.
Given the history of Korea and Japan, lateral relations between the two
countries are understandably not as good as they might be. However, both
governments are trying to create a rapprochement between the countries,
ending centuries of enmity. The Koreans want to reduce their massive and
worsening Dollars 8.45bn trade deficit with one of their most important
trading partners by attracting Japanese technology and investment,
particularly in the realm of automotive components and machine tool
technology. The Japanese, for their part, view the possible nuclear build-up
in North Korea as a direct threat to their security, and so are anxious to
support Seoul.
However, to attract additional investment and generate more cordial
relations with Japan will require a massive change in attitudes among
Koreans, who will have to exorcise the Japanese ghost from their national
psyche. It will also need a complete redirection of Korean nationalism.
Admittedly, the Korean attitude to Japan is ambiv- alent. There is the
fascination of the Japanese economic model. Protectionism, large
conglomerates and state- directed investment have all been borrowed from
Japan in an effort to emulate that country's economic miracle.
Similarly, urban Korean youths are obsessed by Japanese culture. Women
openly look at banned Japanese fashion magazines, although many cannot
understand Japanese. Adolescent boys read Japanese comics and listen to
Japanese music. The ambivalence of Korean youths is shown in the results of
a recent survey which recorded that the country they most admire is Japan.
But they also view Japan as potentially the most dangerous.
Any rapprochement with Japan is likely also to require a reassessment of
Korea's own role during the Pacific war. Although the Independence Hall of
Korea stresses the horrific treatment by the Japanese of Korean 'comfort
women', there is no mention of the tens of thousands of Koreans who fought
for the Japanese during the Pacific War, many of them volunteers. The
behaviour of Korean prison guards, many of whom had a worse reputation for
cruelty among Allied prisoners of war than the Japanese, is also glossed
over.
Nor does the museum explain that Korean collaboration reached the highest
echelons of subsequent governments. For example, former President Park
Chung-Hee saw active service in the Japanese Imperial Army in China during
the final stages of the conflict. Many members of the government after the
1961 coup also had Japanese military experience.
How successful are the two governments likely to be in their efforts to
reduce animosity? Certainly, the countries have a cultural affinity. The
Koreans are proud that the Chinese influence, so pervasive in Japanese life,
was transmitted through Korea. They share Confucianism, both support a
similar form of capitalism, and they are also among the few democratic
governments in Asia. Economically, they could form a powerful trading block.
But although they may be physically close, the countries remain mentally
apart. The long-term relationship will depend on how Korea views its
strategic interests in a post-unification future. Without a threat from the
north, Korea will be bereft of an external threat. Is Korea sufficiently
mature to feel comfortable without an enemy?
South Korean policy makers are unsure whether Korea and Japan, the region's
two economic powerhouses, are set on an inevitable collision course, leading
to an arms race that would shatter the strategic balance in north-east Asia.
The ambition of the Japanese self defence forces to acquire aircraft
carriers is viewed with alarm by the Koreans who believe such vessels can in
no way be construed as defensive weapons.
The alternative policy, viewed as desirable by some bureaucrats in the Blue
House, the president's residence, is the creation of huge trading bloc
between Japan, Korea and Taiwan, which would offer a combined market almost
as large as the US.
If they are to be successful in healing this bruised relationship, the
Japanese must become more sensitive to Korean concerns. The Koreans, for
their part, must develop a more mature form of nationalism, based less on a
xenophobic past and more on the needs of the future. The alternative is an
arms race that will serve neither countries' interests.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (11): Samsung in the global village - The
impact of Gatt on a key industrial group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Uruguay Round of Gatt has sharply divided South Korea, provoking a clash
between tradition and modernity.
Farmers demonstrate in the streets of Seoul and other cities to protest at
the opening of the rice market, which they warn could destroy the
agriculture industry and with it the source of the country's rich culture.
In contrast, the Samsung industrial group tells its workers in a corporate
video that 'if we fail to open our door to foreigners, both Korea and
Samsung will perish'.
Parliamentary approval of the new Gatt agreement, which is expected this
summer at the earliest, would represent the most significant sign yet of the
government's commitment to accept a more open economy.
If farmers are the biggest losers from the Gatt treaty, Korea's big
conglomerates, such as Samsung, believe they will be the main beneficiaries
because the accord promises increased business.
'Industrial groups such as Samsung are the best-prepared sector of the
economy to take advantage of the Uruguay round because we have been exposed
to foreign competition for 30 years, while the service and agricultural
sectors are vulnerable because they have been protected,' says Mr Lim
Dong-sung, president of the Samsung Economic Research Institute.
One obvious benefit is that exports of Korean manufactured goods will
increase due to the reduction of tariffs. Samsung is the world's leading
producer of semiconductor memory chips and Korea's largest consumer
electronics company. Its other main businesses include ships, machinery and
petrochemicals.
Although Samsung, the country's second largest conglomerate, is expected to
face stiffer competition at home due to increased imports, particularly in
the petrochemical and machinery sectors, it believes that growing exports
will outweigh the negative effect of lower Korean tariffs.
Samsung has also recently reduced its operations in textiles and food
processing, two other sectors that could suffer under increased imports from
China and south-east Asia as tariff barriers are dismantled.
Nonetheless, Mr Lee Kun-hee, the Samsung chairman, remains deeply concerned
that the group, which his father founded in 1938, remains psychologically
ill-prepared to compete in the global market.
'Despite the enormous changes in the world, Samsung has yet to comprehend
how far behind we are in these rapidly changing and competitive times,' Mr
Lee wrote in a group pamphlet that has become mandatory reading for its
employees.
'We are still caught up in the notion that Samsung is the best in Korea. We
cannot be satisfied with that notion because it has no meaning in this
global village,' he adds.
Mr Lee last year introduced management reforms that emphasise individual
initiative in a group that was known for its rigid hierarchical structure.
The reforms were widely publicised in Korea after President Kim Young-sam
recommended that government officials should study Samsung's new management
practices.
But there has been growing resistance among employees to the changes, which
are considered 'too radical', according to one Samsung executive. An
internal survey revealed that a majority of workers disliked Samsung's new
working hours of 7am to 4pm, which were introduced to improve efficiency.
Moreover, the group seems torn between its traditional commitment to growth
and Mr Lee's goal of promoting quality at the expense of quantity, even if
means the loss of market share.
Officials at Samsung Electronics, for example, speak of making the concern
one of the world's five biggest electronics companies by 2000, up from its
current ninth place ranking, even as they acknowledge the need for
improvements in product quality.
The 'quality' issue has taken on increased importance for Samsung because
one adverse result of the Gatt agreement is that it will place increased
pressure on Korea to end its import ban on important Japanese products, such
as electronics and cars.
'We are still lagging behind the Japanese in terms of quality and
productivity, although we are confident we can close the gap before 1997,
when the import ban is expected to be eased,' says Mr Moon Byung-dae, a
senior managing director of Samsung Electronics.
The entry of Japanese cars into the domestic market could also hurt
Samsung's plans to begin passenger car production in late 1997, although
Samsung believes that its recent agreement to buy advanced technology from
Nissan of Japan will make it competitive.
One benefit from the Gatt agreement is that it could force the government to
accelerate its financial liberalisation programme, which would improve
opportunities for Samsung to finance its corporate activities.
Samsung and other Korean companies generally have to pay high interest rates
on capital raised at home because of the country's antiquated and
inefficient financial system. Companies are also restricted by the
government from raising large amounts of cheaper funds abroad.
The opening of financial services 'will help the competitiveness of industry
because it will promote increased efficiency in the domestic financial
sector and lead to lower capital costs,' says Mr Lim.
Lower capital costs are crucial for Samsung as it undertakes a restructuring
of its operations. Samsung plans to expand its high-tech activities,
including costly research on developing a next generation of 256-megabit
memory chips. It will also spend at least Dollars 6bn on its car project by
2000.
But financial liberalisation will also have a negative impact, at least
temporarily, on the financial service business that Samsung is developing.
It already owns leading insurance and credit card companies and bought a
securities firm in 1992.
'These financial companies will suffer a bit initially because the financial
sector in general is vulnerable to foreign competition, but in the long term
we don't expect our position will be harmed,' says Mr Lim.
Indeed, analysts believe that Samsung and other conglomerates that operate
financial services will benefit in the long term from financial
liberalisation. The government is expected to break down barriers among
various financial sectors and allow the creation of comprehensive Korean
financial houses as one means to improve their competitiveness against
foreign rivals.
'Financial liberalisation will provide an opportunity for Samsung and other
conglomerates to edge out weaker competitors and expand their financial
services, outside of banking, as the financial industry undergoes
consolidation,' says Mr John Wadle, an analyst for BZW in Seoul.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (8): US is blamed for crisis / A look at the
south's foreign policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most criticised aspect of President Kim Young-sam's administration has
been its inconsistent policy on the North Korean nuclear issue.
Mr Kim has shifted back and forth between accommodation and tough rhetoric
during his 16 months in office. This reflects deep divisions, largely based
on generational differences, among the South Korean public and his own
cabinet on how to handle North Korea.
But North Korea's apparent final refusal to allow international inspections
of its nuclear facilities has ended the months of wavering in Seoul. The
government now appears united in supporting stiff sanctions against the
north.
This does not mean, however, that public debate on the issue has abated.
There are predictions that South Korea could soon witness some of its
biggest demonstrations since 1987, when the military government was
overthrown, as students protest that the government's hard-line policy could
eventually lead to war.
The nuclear dispute has served as a catalyst on Korea's future role in
north-east Asia and Seoul's relations with the US, its closest ally.
Whatever the outcome of the crisis, South Korea is likely to adopt a more
independent and assertive foreign policy in the future that could weaken its
ties with the US and might even lead to acquiring its own nuclear
capability.
Conservatives have criticised the government for allowing the US to dominate
policy on North Korea at the expense of South Korea's national interests.
They were angered by Washington's willingness to establish direct contacts
and possible diplomatic relations with North Korea, a development they
feared would weaken South Korea and strengthen the north.
As South Korea tried to undermine support for the north by wooing its
Chinese and Russian allies, so North Korea was believed to be doing the same
by using the nuclear inspection issue to gain US diplomatic recognition.
The collapse of Washington's conciliatory approach to North Korea in
response to Pyongyang's continued refusal to make concessions on nuclear
inspections has vindicated the conservative faction and strengthened its
influence.
But there are doubts in the two opposition parties - and among the 84 per
cent of the population born after the Korean war ended in 1953 - that
confrontation with North Korea is desirable.
University students believe that the US and Japan, not North Korea,
represent the biggest potential threats to South Korea, according to a
recent survey. They claim that the nuclear dispute has been provoked by the
US to reverse Washington's dwindling influence on the Korean peninsula.
Anti-American feeling is widespread because of past US support for the
country's military rulers. This view is not limited to students. 'The US
military and CIA are causing this crisis because they need a new enemy to
replace the Soviet Union and thus maintain their huge budgets. That enemy is
North Korea,' says a South Korean businessman.
Public distrust is even greater concerning Japan, Korea's traditional foe.
One sign of widespread suspicion toward Japan is the plot of South Korea's
current best-selling novel, a thriller called The Rose Of Sharon Has
Blossomed, the title referring to Korea's national flower.
It is the late 1990s and Japan has launched a limited military attack
against South Korea as a result of a dispute between the two countries over
raw materials from Russia.
South Korea suddenly reveals that it has been secretly co-operating with
North Korea on a nuclear bomb. The two Koreas explode the device on a
deserted island near Tokyo as a warning and Japan surrenders. Korea has
obtained just revenge for Japan's harsh colonial rule of the Korean
peninsula in the early 20th century.
The popularity of the novel suggests that one unexpected result of the North
Korean nuclear dispute may be growing public acceptance for South Korea to
possess its own nuclear arsenal.
'Many people wonder if South Korea should try to inherit the North Korean
bomb once reunification occurs or try to develop our own since it would
improve our security and status,' said one Korean journalist. 'We would no
longer be the Korean shrimp among the whales of Japan, China and Russia.'
South Korea tried to develop a nuclear bomb in the 1970s under its former
military president, Mr Park Chung hee, to counter the north's military
strength. It was forced to abandon the programme under US pressure.
In contrast, it is the left that is now leading the call for South Korea to
acquire nuclear capability to counter what is perceived to be a potential
Japanese atomic threat.
There is concern in South Korea about Japan's growing stockpile of
plutonium, the key ingredient in manufacturing a nuclear weapon. Japan is
also building a plutonium processing plant and recently began operating an
experimental fast breeder reactor that can produce additional plutonium.
North Korea has tried to exploit the south's fears by suggesting that its
suspected nuclear programme is meant to contain Japan, which it accuses of
racing 'headlong toward nuclear armament'.
Moderate South Korean politicians are also beginning to argue that their
country should acquire the potential capability to enter the nuclear club in
response to possible atomic threats from either North Korea or Japan.
Mr Park Chan-jong, an opposition MP who is one of South Korea's most popular
politicians, recently proposed that the country should acquire enrichment
and reprocessing facilities that could extract plutonium from the nuclear
waste generated by its 20 current and planned commercial reactors.
The reprocessing facilities would enable South Korea to obtain plutonium for
possible nuclear weapons in the event of an national emergency.
Although Mr Park supports strict international inspection procedures for the
South Korean reprocessing facilities, their existence 'would serve as a
check against North Korean tactics.
'We can talk on equal terms with other nations which have similar nuclear
facilities,' he said. 'Though Japan is exemplary in terms of its nuclear
transparency, no one can deny its potential for nuclear weapons capability.'
South Korean nuclear industry officials favour reprocessing facilities on
practical grounds since the country is having difficulty finding sites to
store nuclear waste.
But one obstacle is that the US has barred South Korea from reprocessing
spent nuclear fuel since the 1970s as part of its policy of stopping Seoul
from developing nuclear weapons.
'South Korean nuclear and missile sovereignty should be restored,' says Mr
Park. 'Our sovereign rights over the peaceful use of nuclear energy and
missile development have been unjustifiably suppressed by the US.
Consequently, this nation now has no alternative but to depend on the US for
its security whenever threatened by the North Korean strategic capability.'
The government has strongly condemned any suggestion that it is considering
building nuclear reprocessing facilities, explaining it would increase
tensions in the region. It would also violate the 1991 North-South Korean
denuclearisation treaty, which bans plutonium-separation facilities.
The proposal to acquire reprocessing capabilities is an 'irresponsible idea
being promoted by the opposition,' says one aide to President Kim Young-sam.
But that may not be true much longer if the government decides to nullify
the inter-Korean denuclearisation treaty because of North Korea's
construction of a suspected nuclear reprocessing facility and its refusal to
allow international nuclear inspections.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (7): Europe's chance - The defence market
opens up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Korean War museum, opened earlier this month, commemorates the tragic
conflict which convulsed the peninsula more than 40 years ago and left the
country divided, one of the last legacies of the cold war. But next to the
maps and diorama of the struggles of yesteryear is also a proud display of
the nation's contemporary arms industry, the fruits of Seoul's Yulgok
Project, a programme estimated to be worth more than Dollars 37bn that is
aimed at establishing a technology-based domestic arms industry.
Seoul's ambition to build up its weapons manufacturing capabilities is
unsettling the South Korean military equipment market, irritating the US,
which has been the overwhelmingly dominant supplier, and providing
opportunities and risks for groups from Europe and elsewhere.
At stake is a great deal of money. South Korea's defence budget is between
Dollars 12.5bn and Dollars 13bn a year, of which about half is spent on
equipment. Of that procurement budget, on average between a quarter and a
third is spent overseas - more than Dollars 3bn a year.
Until the late 1980s, the US market share of the overseas procurement budget
was as high as 95 per cent according to western diplomats. That proportion
has fallen to about 80 per cent, although the figure changes from year to
year, varying when large contracts are awarded, and has been as low as 60
per cent.
Seoul's desire to build up its military manufacturing capability is partly
motivated by the reluctance of Washington to supply its most sophisticated
hardware. 'The Americans have a tendency to supply the Koreans with what
suits the US, rather than with what the Koreans want,' explains one European
diplomat. 'Washington doesn't want its technology exported to third parties,
and doesn't want the Koreans to be competitors in the arms bazaar in 10
years' time.'
The reluctance of the US to supply South Korea with sophisticated technology
is accompanied by Seoul's desire to reduce its dependence on Washington. In
the short term, the alliance between the US and South Korea remains firm.
But in spite of American officials' denial of any desire to withdraw US
forces from the peninsula, European diplomats say the presence of US troops
in a united Korea would probably be an anomaly.
Washington's willingness to supply arms after such a withdrawal would be
more equivocal than at present, they claim. 'If the US has to choose between
supporting Korea or Japan, there's no doubt who would lose out,' says one
European diplomat.
As a result, Seoul is hunting for military technology wherever it can find
it, a policy which offers significant opportunities for non-US arms groups.
European countries, less reluctant than the US to transfer technology, have
already been able to snap up an increasing number of contracts. The market
leaders are probably Germany and the UK, followed by France, Spain and
Italy.
The areas where European manufacturers can compete most effectively are
mostly where the US has no equipment available to meet Korean requirements.
The most obvious example was the contract for nine diesel submarines
concluded by Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft of Kiel, Germany. The US does not
manufacture such vessels. Similarly, American suppliers were unable to meet
Seoul's requirements for transport aircraft with short runway capabilities.
The contract was eventually was given to Casa of Spain which will supply 12
CN-235s at a cost of about Dollars 200m.
On occasions the Europeans can win against US competition, however. Matra of
France won a contract for about 150 Mistral man-portable surface to air
missiles in a deal initially valued at Dollars 180m, which could eventually
be worth up to Dollars 720m. Although the cheaper Stinger missile offered by
US company General Dynamics was preferred by the South Korean army, the
Pentagon was reluctant to release the technology. Matra's willingness to
supply Lucky Goldstar with technology and allow it to participate in about a
quarter of the project won the day with the South Korean government.
The Europeans' efforts would perhaps be more successful if they worked
together. At present, European suppliers, sometimes from the same country,
virtually slit each other's throats in their efforts to win contracts.
'It's ridiculous that we have two European helicopter companies competing
with each other,' says one European diplomat. 'It's difficult enough just
competing with the US.' He gives the example of a consortium between British
Aerospace and Sema of France which recently won a contract to supply the
electronic combat system for Korean navy's destroyer programme against Atlas
Elektronik, a German competitor, and Ferranti of the UK. Other diplomats
agree that Europe's lack of co-ordination hinders its efforts, but there
remain few signs of greater co-operation.
Meanwhile, US military authorities in South Korea argue that buying European
systems could lead to problems of compatibility with US hardware stationed
on the peninsula. European suppliers say this fear has been exaggerated,
pointing out that most European weapons are configured to Nato standards
anyway.
A further danger highlighted by US officials is that non-American suppliers
may prove unwilling to supply materials and spare parts during a conflict.
The status of the Dollars 66m PC-9 trainer programme which was due to be
supplied from Switzerland by Pilatus remains in doubt because of Swiss
concerns that the 20 aircraft could be converted to carry weapons. Seoul's
inexperience in dealing with non-US contracts has led to expensive bills for
spare parts, according to one diplomat.
Most European diplomats concede it will be impossible for the Europeans to
compete with the US for contracts for major platforms, such as jet fighters
or tanks. Washington's political clout, and the dominance of US military
thinking on the peninsula, put such huge deals out of bounds.
However, Europeans could supply components or the entire programme for
projects such as:
* Electronics equipment for about eight reconnaissance aircraft, smaller
than the American Awacs, but capable of offering airborne early warning
capabilities. The South Koreans are almost completely dependent on the US
for information about movements in North Korea.
* Trainer aircraft. After the failure of Daewoo Heavy Industries' indigenous
KTX-I trainer, Lockheed of the US is offering help for early development for
the KTX-II programme in a deal worth about Dollars 700m. The next stage of
development could be worth up to Dollars 2bn. The UK wanted to supply a
cheaper redesigned version of the BAe's Hawk.
* Frigates: South Korea's admirals have aspirations to a blue water navy,
capable of operating beyond coastal waters. European diplomats say the US is
offering reconditioned ships, but the South Korean navy wants new vessels of
possibly up to 8,000 tonnes.
* Deep water submarines. The UK is understood to have offered four
second-hand Upholder class vessels, but the South Korean navy is not
particularly interested.
* Naval helicopters.
* Mine-hunters.
* Ground-based electronics, particularly in the field of command, control
and communications. This might include military satellite communications.
* Land-based helicopters.
* An upgrade of the K1 tank. Most of the equipment would probably be
provided domestically or by the US, but European suppliers could ship some
components.
The extent to which the Europeans can capture market share remains unclear.
This is partly because in recent months few deals have been concluded. A
purge of the armed forces and an anti-corruption campaign instigated by
President Kim Young-sam has led to a virtual paralysis in military
procurement. During 1993, only 20 per cent of the overseas procurement
budget was actually spent.
'Nobody wanted to make a decision,' explains one diplomat. The disincentives
to take action received a further boost last year after a Dollars 6.67m
fraud involving a French-Korean, counterfeit bills of lading and a
non-existent cargo of artillery shells. The affair cost Mr Lee Kyong Jae his
job as defence minister. However, diplomats say the decision-making process
is now loosening up.
Although South Korea represents an opportunity for European companies,
diplomats admit there are risks. In the first place, the contracts may not
be particularly profitable. Some non-US suppliers have succeeded by offering
low prices or even throwing in free samples. In addition, nearly all deals
over Dollars 5m include a mandatory offset of 30 per cent.
Another problem is that by winning a contract through technology transfer,
the Europeans could create a future competitor. 'The main advantage the
European makers have is their willingness to offer technology, but they
mustn't offer too much,' says one European diplomat.
However, most European observers discount such dangers. 'What the Koreans
have done in the automotive industry is extraordinary,' says a European
diplomat. 'But there's a big difference between assembling a submarine or a
trainer aircraft, and developing one for yourself.'
Another explains: 'The clever stuff is really beyond them. On a submarine,
the sonars, weapons and controls to propel and direct the boat are all too
sophisticated. It's worse in aerospace.'
Indeed, the track record of the Korean Agency for Defence Development (ADD),
responsible for acquiring technology and then developing indigenous weapons
systems, is particularly patchy in that sector.
The most disastrous example is Korea's KTX-I trainer aircraft, developed by
the ADD. The aircraft was underpowered and overweight, making the trainer
difficult to manoeuvre, and there were problems with the landing gear.
The ADD is continuing to persevere, however. After the failure of the KTX-I,
it is co-ordinating development of the KTX-II. Samsung, Lockheed of the US,
and Casa of Spain are collaborating to develop a twin jet-engined trainer.
'The Koreans will keep pushing for technology,' says one diplomat. 'The
Europeans will give it to them. But it's more likely to be the older
generation kit - say the mark VI rather than the mark VII. The question is
whether the Koreans, using all those PhDs to vacuum up technology from
whatever source, will eventually be able to catch up on their own. In the
short term, the answer is no. In the longer term, the question is rather
more difficult to answer.'

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (6): Pyongyang must wait - Investment in the
north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though it sounds unlikely, North Korea hopes to compete successfully with
ther Asian countries in attracting foreign invest- ment.
For the moment, the policy is on hold as the US attempts to co-ordinate UN
sanctions because of the ref- usal of Pyongyang to allow inspectors access
to its nuc- lear facilities. But in the long term, the government hopes
foreign investment will save the economy and incidentally sustain North
Korea's polit- ical system.
Pyongyang needs overseas investment because the North Korean economy has
moved into sharp reverse. The collapse of the former Soviet Union has cut
off the nation's most important sources of foreign trade, previously
representing half of all trade.
The North Korean economy shrank in 1990, 1991 and 1992, according to Dr
Hongstack Chun, fellow of the Korea Development Institute. Latest figures
from the South Korean central bank suggest it fell 4.3 per cent last year.
Professor Aidan Foster-Carter of Leeds University estimates North Korea's
GNP last year at only Dollars 20bn, the same as a single year's GNP growth
in South Korea.
Faced with a growing economic crisis, the Pyongyang government has been
mesmerised by the success of reforms across the border in China.
The North Koreans have already emulated Chinese legislation to create the
right legal environment for invest- ment, according to Dr Chun.
Special investment areas, similar to Chinese special regions, have also been
created. These include a site at Nampo near Pyongyang aimed at South Korean
inv- estment, and another near the Chinese border. Tourist areas are also
being created in the Kumgang mountains near the demilitarised zone, and
Paektu on the Chinese border.
However, the most advan- ced project is the Tumen River Area Development
Programme which has been co-ordinated by the United Nations Development
Prog- ramme. This region is at the junction of the borders of North Korea,
Russia and China. The rationale is that the North Korean coastal zone would
provide sea-access to northern China, explains Mr Jacob Guijt of the UNDP.
However, progress has been slow and recently the Chinese and Russians have
proved less than enthusiastic partners, he admits.
Indeed, the North Koreans' efforts have not proved part- icularly successful
anywhere.
So far, the only invest- ments have been small-scale projects by Korean
Japanese sympathetic to Pyongyang. 'The North Koreans been really
disappointed,' says Mr Anthony Michell of Hong Kong-based consultants
Euro-Asian Business Consult- ancy . 'However, it takes about two years
between considering an investment and actually putting building the plant.
The programme only really started recently, so there's still time.'
One reason for the absence of investment is the north's continuing
unwillingness to repay loans to the inter- national banking community. The
principal sum amounted to Dollars 747m, although that has doubled because of
interest. In addition, some loans to the former Soviet Union dating back to
1949 still remain unpaid.
Another reason for the international community's reluctance is the failure
of most of the Japanese-Korean joint ventures. Some North Korean business
practices have also been questionable.
Infrastructure, or rather lack of it, is another concern. 'There are no
container facilities at the ports,' explains Dr Chun. 'More than 80 per cent
of travel is by rail and the trains have an average speed of 40kph.'
North Korea does have some advan- tages, how- ever. Mr Michell points out
that labour is well- educated, disciplined and highly productive. The
internal market represents about 22m potential con- sumers. In addition,
there are huge mineral and forestry resources. The north, a cheap
manufacturing location at the heart of one of the world's fastest-growing
regions, would also provide access to nearby markets in Japan and China.
In the long term, all agree the north and south will be united. North Korea
would offer a cheap point of entry to a market of about 70m consumers, says
Mr Michael Breen of Merit, the Asian consultancy.
'There would be no tariffs from the north to south - they're the same
country. There's bound to be investment over the next six months, although
it depends on the Asian investment cycle. By 1996, North Korea could be on
the cover of Newsweek as the new Vietnam,' enthuses Mr Michell.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (5): Uphill battle for investors - The
south's bid to attract foreign companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea is on the hunt for foreign investment and technology. The rapid
rise in wages since 1988 means it can no longer compete as a low-cost
manufacturing centre. Compared with the Philippines, Vietnam and China,
costs are high. Instead, South Korea must compete in high-technology areas.
But although the country is now one of the leading manufacturers in the
shipbuilding and automotive sectors, its technological base remains weak.
Korean companies, on average, spend only 3 per cent of turnover on R&amp;D,
compared with about 7 per cent among their western counterparts.
The government is also anxious to attract investment from foreign companies,
particularly Japanese component manufacturers. South Korea runs a hefty
trade deficit with Japan, mostly caused by imports of sophisticated machine
tools and automotive components.
But the hunt for foreign investment and technology is proving an uphill
battle. Foreign investment in South Korea has fallen in recent years.
Investment by Japanese companies fell from a peak of Dollars 697m in 1988 to
only Dollars 155m in 1992, rising to Dollars 286m last year. European
investment peaked at Dollars 824m in 1991 and fell to only Dollars 307m last
year.
The reason is that South Korea has a poor reputation as a location for
foreign investment. A recent report by Political &amp; Economic Risk
Consultancy, the Hong Kong-based group which canvassed opinions of 95
corporate managers and bankers, was damning of South Korea's attractions.
The study suggested South Korea:
was the most nationalistic country in Asia;
was the most bureaucratic after China and Indonesia;
had an economy dominated by cartels and state-owned companies;
discriminated more than any other nation against foreign investment;
was the most protectionist nation in Asia;
had the highest potential for labour unrest;
and had a greater potential for social unrest even than China.
However, companies operating in South Korea believe there are two main
obstacles hindering foreign investment - labour and tax.
Foreign investors have been concerned both by the high cost of labour as
well as the number of industrial disputes. Admittedly, the latter has fallen
by nearly three-quarters since the peak of 1988, but the legacy remains.
'Many Japanese companies were put off by the bitter experience of trade
disputes a few years ago,' says Mr Yoshiaki Onuki, chairman of the Japanese
Association in Seoul. 'Although the number of disputes has fallen, labour is
still a problem. Pay is at a very high level. Japanese companies in Seoul
pay their workers, on average, Won3m a month, compared with an average of
Won900,000 in non-Japanese companies. Retirement costs are double those in
our Tokyo headquarters,' he says.
The other main problem facing foreign companies is the National Tax
Authority. This body, working under the finance ministry, has recently
launched investigations into as many as 25 European and US companies
operating in South Korea. Huge tax bills have been imposed on some, leading
to complaints that the measures were retroactive - dating back up to five
years - and less than transparent.
'The economic co-operation bureau at the finance ministry is saying 'invest
here, all is sweetness and light', but the tax authority is imposing five
years' worth of retroactive taxes together with penalties and interest that
wipe out your profits. It's ludicrous,' says the chief executive of a
European multinational.
Japanese companies have also been affected by an iniquitous tax regime, says
Mr Yoshiaki Onuki, director general of the Korean subsidiary of Mitsui, the
Japanese trading group. 'Most of the Japanese banks and trading houses are
losing money in South Korea. But the tax authorities then impose taxes on
what they think you ought to be making. You end up making unexpected
losses,' he says.
Other issues include the high cost of land. Mr Byong-Seok Chang, president
of Sony Electronics of Korea, explains that land near Seoul costs about
Dollars 200 for 3.3 sq metres. That compares with Dollars 85 in Taiwan and
Dollars 55 in Malaysia, while in Singapore the same space rents at Dollars
30 a year and at Dollars 15 in China, near Beijing.
Intellectual property is another concern. 'South Koreans are reputed to
cheat on intellectual property. That reputation may lag reality, but it
remains,' says a European businessman.
Mr Duck-Koo Chung, director general of the economic co-operation bureau at
the finance ministry, insists the intellectual property problems have been
resolved. Nevertheless, western and Japanese groups are concerned that by
setting up joint ventures and offering technology transfer, they may give
away their crown jewels.
Mr Onuki doubts if many Japanese component makers will invest. 'Much of the
technology they own was developed with the co-operation of the Japanese car
manufacturers. The latter would take a dim view of handing over that
technology to the Koreans.'
However, President Kim Young-sam's government is anxious to make the country
more attractive for foreign investors. This month its inter-agency task
force for foreign investment will announce a series of measures that
continue the deregulation process, ensuring greater competition.
The measures include faster approval of investment permits; more rapid
approval of land purchases; special investment areas for foreign investors;
easier access to short-term overseas loans; and a special tax tribunal for
overseas groups. As for labour relations, Mr Chung insists the country's
reputation is based on outdated attitudes - there are now fewer disputes in
South Korea than in Japan.
The policy of attracting investment has paid some high-profile dividends.
The most significant have included the Dollars 2.1bn deal concluded by GEC
Alsthom, the Franco-British consortium, for South Korea's high-speed
railway, and Samsung Heavy Industries's contract with Nissan Motor of Japan
to import car technology.
Nevertheless, not all companies are convinced. 'Many long-established
residents just do not perceive a great deal has changed,' says Mr Alan
Twist, president of the EC Chamber of Commerce.
'They seem to be trying to remove disincentives, but are not providing any
incentives,' complains one European businessman. 'A radical shift is
required even to start catching up with Vietnam or China.'
Few Japanese companies seem set to leap back into Korea. 'They need Japanese
technology and management expertise, but until they sort out the main
problems, I don't think there will be much interest,' says Mr Onuki.
Even if such practical concerns are addressed, there remain cultural
problems. 'A number of Japanese companies set up joint ventures, but there's
a real difference in management styles. The Koreans take so many holidays,
and they expect special bonuses all the time,' complains Mr Onuki.
Others remain cynical. One European chief executive laments: 'They still
want your technology. They still want your money. Then they still want you
to get out.'

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (4): Hunger strikers' faith may deter
foreigners - Though there are fewer disputes than in past years, labour
relations remain tense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Visitors to the Federation of Korean Trade Unions in Seoul these days will
find their nostrils assailed by a thin, acrid smell redolent of sick rooms.
A series of crude primary colour posters gives details of the hunger strike
taking place on the sixth floor.
Here, in a large bare conference room, a handful of men lie around, reading
comic books and computer manuals. One worker, in a suit, has not eaten for
20 days. 'It is very painful but I have a strong faith that we will win,' he
says.
If the strikers' 107 colleagues who were fired for union activities are
reinstated, faith will have proved a more powerful adversary than the FKTU
and President Kim himself. But either way, the outcome will give little
faith to foreign investors, who cite Korea's turbulent labour relations as a
reason to avoid equity participation deals in the peninsula.
Mr Lee Jun-wan, general secretary of the FKTU - which, he says, takes in
1.4m of the country's 1.8m organised union members - adds his support to the
strikers. The dispute, affecting workers at the automobile insurance arm of
Tongpu, one of Korea's 30 biggest chaebols or conglomerates, has been going
for over a year and is, he suggests, a symptom of the stronger power wielded
by the chaebol's head, Mr Kim Jung-ki, a relative of President Kim.
A court ruling early last month found Mr Kim not guilty, and the president
is powerless to overrule the decision. Mr Lee says: 'FKTU offered to solve
this problem. President Kim ordered the Ministry of Labour very strongly to
solve this problem. But there is still no solution.'
Despite Mr Lee's protestations as to the FKTU's strength, the hunger
strikers on the sixth floor suggest otherwise. If those lethargic figures
represent hope to anyone, it is to the Korea Council of Trade Unions, a new
illegal union that plans to give FKTU a run for its money from next year.
KCTU, owing no loyalties to government (unlike FKTU, which reaps some W7.5bn
from government for educational purposes), claims it will more truly
represent the workers' interests. It will certainly have a more militant
edge, and stands to put a spanner in the works of labour relations which Mr
Lee believes could be entering a more peaceful, non-violent era.
Korea has been a crucible of labour strife and disputes since 1987, when the
Great Workers' Struggle erupted. A strike involving about 1m workers, it
lasted from June to September and was one of the factors behind the
emergence of a new democratic trade union, set up in January 1990. However,
government pressure weakened the new union, and a more loose-knit,
organisation sprang up to fill the gap: the Korean Congress of Independent
Industrial Federations (KCIIF).
KCTU seeks to bring together KCIIF and the dissident Korea Trade Union
Congress (KTUC), which was formed by the Democratic party. Its proponents
believe it will win over 600,000 members.
Mr Shin Eun-cheol, the chain-smoking executive secretary of the KTUC, says:
'The union movement is still powerful. We are facing a challenge so if we
work well the union maintains its strength but if we fail to meet the
challenge then we may also be ruined.'
The government still has uneasy relations with unions that do not come under
FKTU. KTUC says some 300,000 workers have been dismissed for union
activities: there is even a Struggle Committee for Dismissed Workers'
Reinstatement. Former KTUC president Pan Byung-ho remains in hiding -
allegedly with a Dollars 1m price on his head - after lecturing union
leaders during the 52-day Hyundai strike last summer.
Even the government steers clear of putting a brave gloss on labour
relations. An official at the Ministry of Labour says: 'The major problem is
how to succeed in completing this year's wage negotiations between labour
and management. In some enterprises we are afraid there could be labour
disputes which will cause strikes.
'It is not only a question of wages. Workers in some big enterprises are
making various demands, such as workers' participation in management. That
is why management feels it is very difficult to succeed in signing labour
contracts.'
Two years ago, in deference to workers' demands, the government set up an
18-member labour reform study committee, which duly came up with a clutch of
recommendations. The labour ministry insists: 'We are going to try to make
these amendments, but it is very difficult to say now what the timeframe
will be.'
However, some changes to labour policy have been effected under the civilian
government, and statistically labour strife is on the wane: from 3,617
labour disputes in 1987 to 200 last year and just 26 'small scale' disputes
in the first five months of 1994. Wage rises have been negotiated at an
average 8.7 per cent (the consumer price index stands at around 6 per cent);
and almost half of the 5,500 biggest companies' wage negotiations had been
concluded by June 9 - more rapidly than in previous years. In the same
period last year 35.7 per cent had been concluded.
The new government swooped on labour policy shortly after coming into power.
The prompt was economic rather than social: increasing international
competition and a slack domestic economy were eroding profit margins and
highlighting gross inefficiencies within the workplace. Productivity growth
was failing to keep pace with spiralling wage increases.
But the hunger strikers' action shows that Korea still has much work to do
on the labour front. As Mr Lee Hahn-koo, president of the Research
Institute, says: 'I don't think we are safe from disturbances. There's still
some unrest. The workers are not so rational in Korea.'

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (2): A hard climb up the ladder / A look at
progress towards industrialising the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once known as the Miracle on the Han, the Korean economy has reached a
crossroads. It can adapt and join the ranks of the industrialised nations;
or, crippled by dwindling productivity and com- petitiveness, the heavy hand
of government intervention and restrictive regulations, it can follow the
downward track of Japan, its neighbour.
Mr Il Sakong, a former minister of finance and now chairman of the Institute
for Global Economics in Seoul, says: 'Korea has reached an awkward stage of
development. It is a Newly Industrialised Economy but not quite yet an
industrialised economy. It is about to enter this new stage of
industrialisation to join the ranks of the industrially advanced nations.
The question is how it will move up this ladder.'
For Korea to become a mem- ber of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, as it plans to do in 1996, it must adhere to its programme
of deregulation, especially in financial markets; improve labour com-
petitiveness and efficiency; maintain downward pressure on both wage and
price inflation; open domestic markets to outside competition and introduce
housing and land reforms.
There are also public sector issues to be tackled. To do so will not only
win Korea credits in the eyes of the OECD; it will also secure the next
phase of economic growth.
It is a tough task, but one which the government at any rate believes it is
up to. South Korea's first civilian president in 30 years, Mr Kim Young-
sam, is regarded as reformative and forward-looking, although whether he can
overcome the vested interests and lower ranks of ministry officialdom is a
question over which many analysts harbour doubts.
Last April, Mr Kim's administration unveiled a five-year economic plan to
restructure the fiscal system, slapping taxes on speculative property gains
and scaling back taxes charged to foreign investors, and to liberalise
financial markets, turning the present government- orchestrated system into
a market-based version more akin to those in the rest of the developed
world.
The five-year programme for financial liberalisation, introduced last year,
aims to overcome the inefficiencies bred by the non-price allocation of
credit, both in the economy as a whole and in the financial sector itself.
Under the plan, lending rates and then deposit rates will be freed at the
same time as the government loosens its grip on international capital
movements.
However, the guiding principle is for gradualism - a policy which, while
avoiding all the mayhem of a 'big bang' approach to deregulation, may not
best serve Korea at a time when so many of its neighbours are attracting
foreign cash and technology.
Industrial development may also come too slowly to keep up with the rest of
the world. Korean industry has lost its competitive edge at a time when
world demand is on the upswing. Economists reckon there are too many vested
interests and interlinked issues to allow for speedy progress.
Mr Lee Hahn-koo, president of Daewoo Research Institute, says: 'We need
foreign investment, and the govern- ment wants to reduce the obstacles to
investment. But it cannot be so speedy because the public mentality does not
change so speedily. I believe we are now starting to get out of that vicious
circle, but not so fast.'
The government is eager to avoid any currency apprec- iation, which would
hurt trading competitiveness. Mr Shin Myoung-ho, assistant minister of
finance says: 'There is a trend towards liberalisation, and so foreign
governments and companies want us to speed our pace. But we have also to
take into consideration some disturbances to the macroeconomic variables.
'There is still a substantial gap between domestic interest rates and
international rates, so if we open up capital movement at this stage, we
could suddenly have a huge inflow resulting in a sharp appreciation of our
currency, or excessive liquidity causing inflationary trends.'
For now, inflation is pitched to end the full year at under 6 per cent,
despite a bad harvest which sent food prices soaring - although many Korean
economists expect it to rise sharply next year. This is twinned with an
upturn in the economy, which this year is forecast to grow at 7.6 per cent.
Interest rates, now close to the record lows of 1982, are also expected to
remain soft until 1996. Less positively, the current account is on track to
move back into the red this year (after posting a modest Dollars 500m
surplus in 1993, which ended a three-year run of deficits) as imports,
largely capital goods, surge. However, Baring Securities is looking for
improvements in the second half of the year which will contain the 1994
deficit at a manageable Dollars 1.9bn, or 0.5 per cent of GNP.
Mr Lee, who is not confident of Korea's ability to continue riding this wave
after two years' stagnant growth, points to several factors which could
further undermine Korea's climb up the industrialisation ladder.
He says that if the yen starts to depreciate against the dollar, so
enhancing the price of Japanese exports, and demand from China retreats as
its growth slows and its own industry becomes an ample source of oil and
steel, Korea could find its trade flows are penalised. He also questions
whether Korea can adapt to compete in the national arena.
Wage rises are out of line with improvements in productivity. Korea boasts
the most expensive workforce in Asia after Japan, and Mr Lee estimates wages
this year will rise around 12-13 per cent, in line with union expectations.
However, Mr Il believes that a restructuring of industry into more
sophisticated value-added areas will enable Korea to regain its competitive
edge, and says companies have started out on this path by upping their
investment in R&amp;D in acknowledgement of the changing nature of competition,
which now comes from the developed world.
'Companies themselves are in a transitional period. In financial structure
terms, Korean companies have a high debt to equity ratio compared with the
advanced countries, while R&amp;D capabilities are not as high.
'But they realise they can no longer remain competitive the way they are
now, so they are taking steps towards intensified R&amp;D and restructuring -
but it is just beginning. If they are successful, of course the Korean
economic restructuring will succeed, but it all depends on the companies'
performance. And, based on our track record, I think we will do it. The
question is how long it will take,' he says.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Survey of Korea (1): Seoul tries to throw open the doors -
South Korea is striving to overcome its legacy of isolationism and to push
for economic liberalisation. But it is a hard struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In his second year in office, President Kim Young-sam is struggling against
South Korea's traditional isolationist attitude toward the outside world.
He is trying to open his country's economy to full international competition
for the first time in its history.
But bureaucratic resistance and public doubts about the benefits of
increased foreign economic influence on Korea could undermine Mr Kim's
latest crusade to 'internationalise' the country, which follows his
successful political reform programme last year.
Moreover, the campaign for domestic economic reforms has been overshadowed
in recent weeks by the North Korean nuclear dispute, whose origins lie in
the xenophobic nationalist doctrine preached by Pyongyang.
The challenges confronting Mr Kim reflect the fact that Korea has never
completely escaped from the legacy of the Hermit Kingdom, when the country
went into self-imposed isolation almost 400 years ago in response to
repeated invasions by the Japanese and Manchus. It was one of the last
countries in the world to establish contacts with the west in the late 19th
century.
Subsequent colonial exploitation by Japan during the first half of this
century re-enforced a defensive mentality among Koreans that still exists
today.
The clearest example of this can be seen in North Korea, which has adopted
juche (self-reliance) as its guiding principle. But the Korean peninsula's
tragic history has also produced considerable psychological resistance in
South Korea to accepting the full rigours of the modern global trading
system in spite of the considerable benefits that the country has reaped
from it.
One recent survey found that almost half of South Koreans opposed direct
foreign investment in the country, while two-thirds were against the
lowering of trade barriers.
But Mr Kim has tried to turn the historical record to his advantage in
persuading Koreans to accept foreign competition. 'A century ago, we failed
to internationalise on our initiative and were thus forced by others to open
up our country. This was why Korea remained backward, soon to be reduced to
a colony of a foreign power (Japan),' said Mr Kim in a speech on the first
anniversary of his inauguration in February.
'We must learn the lessons of history. Instead of deploring the fact that
our doors are unlocking, we should ourselves throw open our doors and march
out into the wider world,' he urged.
Several opportune factors support Mr Kim's push for economic liberalisation.
The economy is once again booming after two years of the slowest growth
since 1980. The GNP growth rate is expected to exceed 7 per cent this year
as exports increase due to a weak Korean won and industrial invest- ments
grow in response of overseas demand.
Labour disputes, which have disrupted industrial production in the past
several years, are on the wane as living standards rapidly improve. Wage
negotiations are being settled at an unprecedented rate this year, although
troubles may still lurk in the car and shipbuilding sectors, two of Korea's
main export industries.
Mr Kim and his Democratic Liberal party enjoy a solid political position
with a secure parliamentary majority. The opposition is in disarray, with
the Democratic party failing to reinvigorate itself under the somewhat
hapless leadership of Mr Li Ki-taek.
The president does not have to worry about immediate electoral
considerations since the next parliamentary elections will not occur until
1996, one year before his mandatory single term ends.
This should give the Kim administration enough time to lay the foundation
for its economic reforms and make South Korea eligible to join the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by its desired
deadline of 1996.
The government wants to reduce strong state intervention in the economy. The
myriad barriers to foreign investment and goods are gradually being lowered
as Korea seeks technology and capital from abroad to improve its global
performance.
Korea neglected research and development as it concentrated on building an
impressive industrial base. The country consequently needs foreign
technology if it is to achieve its goal of becoming an advanced industrial
power. It is now actively seeking foreign partners as it builds high-speed
rail systems, advanced telecommunications networks and an indigenous defence
industry.
Korea is also overhauling its antiquated and tightly regulated financial
system that has created distortions in economic development, particularly at
the expense of small businesses, and prevented large industrial concerns
from obtaining cheaper credit abroad.
The government argues that the reforms will make the economy more efficient
as it switches from governance by bureaucrats to market forces. Foreign
competition in the home market will help to improve the performance of the
large conglomerates, or chaebols, as they increase their operations abroad.
It has even used the 'Visit Korea 1994' campaign primarily as a means to
encourage Koreans to accept internationalisation by playing host to foreign
visitors.
But Mr Kim is already discovering that he lacks the public support for trade
liberalisation that he enjoyed on political reforms. Public attention has
focused on the immediate disruptive impact of the changes.
Farmers have protested about the decline of the agricultural industry caused
by the opening of their protected market under the Uruguay Round of Gatt.
Labour-intensive industries as well as the service and financial sectors are
also ill-prepared for foreign competition.
Public opposition, encouraged by bureaucrats afraid of losing power, remains
a potential obstacle to the successful introduction of the reforms. But an
even bigger threat is now emerging with the North Korean nuclear dispute,
which could eventually throw the economic liberalisation programme off
course.
A military conflict, though still unlikely, would obviously force the
government to re-orient its priorities. A possible economic collapse of
North Korea, caused by stiff international sanctions, might also force the
government to scale back the reforms as it concentrates the country's
economic resources on reconstructing a post-communist North Korea.
Even if these two worst-case scenarios do not occur, the nuclear dispute is
creating suspicions among some South Koreans that the looming crisis is the
result of international meddling, primarily by the US, on the Korean
peninsula. That is likely to increase public scepticism about the
government's calls for internationalisation.

FT  23 JUN 94 / 'Historic' EU accord on works councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All European Union member states except the UK yesterday agreed after 24
years of wrangling on a law to set up elected works councils in up to 1,500
large trans-European companies.
The councils are intended to ensure that workers' representatives in
companies employing more than 1,000 people, and more than 150 in at least
two member states, are consulted and informed on cross-border business
decisions that affect them.
A jubilant Mr Padraig Flynn, EU social policy commissioner, acclaimed
yesterday's decision as 'a historic breakthrough' for workers' rights in the
border-free single market.
'This flexible legislation is good for business and will improve
competitiveness through better industrial relations,' Mr Flynn said.
The UK is exempt from the directive through its opt-out from the Maastricht
social chapter, under which yesterday's legislation was passed. However,
just under 100 British companies operating on mainland Europe will be
affected.
A recent German study suggests that 450 German companies, 250 US
corporations operating in Europe, and 220 French companies will be the most
affected. Nearly 300 UK companies would have been in the net had it covered
British territory.
Attempts to count UK-based employees of British multinationals into the
threshold at which the directive applies were jettisoned by the European
Commission in April, then reinstated by the European Parliament, and
rejected by EU labour and social affairs ministers meeting in Luxembourg
yesterday.
Mr David Hunt, UK employment secretary, said: 'I'm very pleased that it has
now been accepted that the UK will not be forced to accept trade
union-dominated works councils' which 'will impose unnecessary costs and
bureaucracy on companies'.
The revamped directive approved yesterday replaces the original Brussels
plan for a uniform structure of compulsory consultation with provision for
individual voluntary agreements at company level.
The process is triggered when 'at least 100 employees or their
representatives in at least two member states' ask for information and
consultation procedures.
If negotiations fail after three years, then a set of minimum standards in
an annex to the directive will apply; if management refuses talks, the annex
will be imposed after six months.
Assuming the measure is rubber-stamped by ministers in October after a
second reading by the European Parliament, and allowing two years for
transposing the directive into national law, the councils should be up and
running by the end of 1999 at the latest.
Unice, the Euro-employers' lobby, said on the eve of the decision that 'this
directive is being imposed on industry. . . thus violating the very
principle of consultation that it seeks to endorse.' The European Trade
Union Confederation (ETUC) said working people had waited a long time for
this decision, which gave 'a new push to EU social policy'.
This was the first Euro-law passed under the Maastricht social chapter,
which could now be used to expedite proposals such as extending parental
leave rights or the rights of full-time workers to part-time employees, both
blocked by the UK.
The UK yesterday also secured its four year derogation - a time-limited
exemption Mr Hunt insisted on describing as an opt-out - for paper-boys and
girls, covered by the directive ministers passed limiting the hours children
can work.

FT  23 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Builders strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a positive tone again evident in the construction and building
materials sector, with the good news flow continuing. Construction group YJ
Lovell said price levels in the residential sector were showing an upward
trend and sales incentives were being steadily reduced as it reported an
interim loss of Pounds 1.13m, against Pounds 3.93m in the previous year. The
shares slipped 3 to 83p.
There were also encouraging words from John Laing as it announced a Pounds
72.5m property deal. The shares rose 13 to 287p. The building group said it
believed prices for new houses in the UK had stabilised and Laing Homes was
beginning to see some price increases in the south east.
Elsewhere, Beazer Homes added 5 at 147p, Taylor Woodrow 9 at 133p, Barratt 6
at 201p - with NatWest Securities said to be positive on the latter two -
and Berkeley Group 7 at 403p. Among materials suppliers, Caradon gained 13
at 293p, BPB Industries 10 at 292p, Blue Circle - being recommended by
Panmure Gordon - 16 at 285p and RMC 19 at 828p.
News that Singapore Airlines had placed a firm order for 10 of the Airbus
A340-300 aircraft and also 20 options helped British Aerospace firm 4 to
465p. The company builds the wings of the aircraft and is a 20 per cent
stakeholder in the Airbus consortium.
Sentiment was further boosted by reports that BAe has renewed talks with
Taiwan Aerospace Corporation over a joint venture to produce regional
aircraft. Overseas interest in the stock continues and the group said
foreign holdings in the company stood at 28.7 per cent, just shy of the 29.5
per cent permitted under the company's articles of association.
The engine order for the new Singapore Airlines aircraft went to US group
Pratt &amp; Whitney, dampening sentiment in Rolls-Royce. The latter eased 1 1/2
to 182p in trade of 5.4m, with reports of a delayed order from Malaysia also
hurting the stock.
Conglomerate Tomkins edged a penny forward to 224p, with Smith New Court
reported to be recommending the shares.
A stock overhang in engineering group GKN, which returned to the list of
FT-SE 100 companies this week, saw the shares relinquish 7 to 574p. The
stock was initially hit by vague talk of a profits downgrading.
Royal Bank of Scotland trod water as the bank said there were no strategic
implications over what it would do with the cash raised from the sale of its
7.3 per cent stake in venture capital group 3i, which was floated yesterday.
Royal Bank shares closed steady at 428p. The offer of Pounds 711m of equity
in 3i was 1.7 times oversubscribed and the shares will be placed with
institutions at 272p each, a 13.5 per cent discount to net asset value.
Lloyds Bank slipped 1 1/2 to 548p as Smith New Court turned seller and cut
its current year forecast by Pounds 150m to Pounds 1.1bn. Mr Richard Coleman
of Smith's banking team said: 'Even if they get Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, it
does not transform Lloyds into a high growth dynamic stock.'
Chemicals group ICI jumped 17 1/2 to 756p in response to a positive
presentation by the company to analysts and subsequent recommendations. ICI
said that conditions in its Tioxide subsidiary were improving. Many brokers
were recommending the shares, including Smith New Court, UBS and Kleinwort
Benson.
BAT Industries fell sharply in early dealing as the market digested news
that its Brown &amp; Jackson unit in the US had sneaked through a high nicotine
tobacco and used it in some cigarettes. However, the shares recovered later
to close barely changed at 390 1/2 p.
Mildly disappointing results from First Leisure was the signal for a
sell-off in the shares, which finished the session 19 off at 289p, although
turnover was a measley 380,000. Analysts lowered their full-year profits
forecasts by around 5 per cent, representing largely the fall in margins in
the ten-pin bowling division.
Relief over the result of the George Michael versus Sony court case lifted
Thorn EMI, with investors likely to be further heartened by the publication
of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's report into compact disc prices,
due today. The commission is widely expected to exonerate the record
companies, although retailers are thought more likely to come in for some
muted criticism. Thorn gained 11 at 1045p.
Drinks shares were subdued, although Guinness managed a rise of 5 to 453p on
reports of a five-fold increase in Guinness sales due to the soccer World
Cup, as well as a Bell's whisky presentation to analysts.
Good results from Carpet- right could not stop the shares from being subject
to profit-taking and they retreated 6 1/2 to 249 1/2 p.
Freight group NFC continued to be powered by a James Capel buy
recommendation issued on Tuesday. The shares added 3 1/2 at 190 1/2 p. The
company said after the market closed that it is to terminate plans for a
scrip dividend in respect of the first interim dividend for the year
1993/94.

FT  23 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo out of favour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals heavyweight Glaxo led the sector down on speculation that
the company had, as one dealer put it, 'taken a bath in the bond market'.
These suggestions were accompanied by a downgrade of Glaxo shares by one US
bank and rumours of negative comments by another.
Analysts have been scrutinising Glaxo's investment portfolio over the past
few days as the group approaches its year-end and some believe that as much
as half of its Pounds 2bn securities investments are in the badly hit global
bond market.
Yesterday there were whispers that the company might have lost heavily in
bonds. Although some analysts were sceptical, the shares were marked down in
early trading.
Then, dealers heard that Goldman Sachs had cut its Glaxo profits forecast
for the current year by Pounds 50m to Pounds 1.9bn, telling clients that
sales growth of both Zantac, the top-selling anti-ulcer treatment, and also
of its anti-emetic treatment for cancer patients, were slowing more than
anticipated. Finally, there were reports that Lehman Brothers had prepared a
negative report on weekly prescriptions for Zantac.
The stock ended the day 14 1/2 lower at 538p. The fall unsettled SmithKline
Beecham, whose 'A' shares slipped 5 to 403p, and Zeneca, off 4 at 712p.

FT  23 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Confident close as dollar sentiment
improves - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports that President Clinton planned to make a statement on the US dollar
reached London towards the close of trading, underpinning a rally in share
prices as British government bonds rose sharply. The stock market, already
encouraged by a steadier trend in the dollar and by the minutes of the
latest meeting between the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor
of the Bank of England, moved higher in the final hour of trading to finish
at the day's best levels.
President Clinton's statement followed comments from Mr Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve, that the inflation outlook in the US
appeared very reasonable. Bond markets, taking the view that defence for the
dollar might exclude higher interest rates in the US, advanced strongly.
The FT-SE 100 Index ended 20.2 higher at 2,960.4, the first recovery after
four sessions of losses. By Tuesday's close, the index had fallen by about
3.5 per cent since the market began to slide in the middle of last week.
After a slow start, equities began to edge ahead early yesterday with the
help of a steadier trend in the US dollar and in Federal bonds at the close
of the New York session. But an early Footsie rise of 19.5 was not held. In
the absence of genuine investor support, gains were halved as investors
waited for Mr Greenspan to begin his testimony to the House Budget
Committee.
Seaq volume was very slow to develop, and barely reached 200m shares by
mid-morning. Underlying confidence continued to improve when the minutes of
the May 4 meeting of the UK chancellor and the Bank of England Governor
indicated that fears that domestic interest rates were poised to rise might
have been overdone. Another modest reduction in money market repo rates in
Germany also helped to cool nervousness.
However, the London market was still no more than quietly firm when New York
opened and Mr Greenspan began his testimony by saying that he would not
speak about the dollar. It was late in the session when the President's
statement reached London, and the sudden recovery in share prices owed as
much to technical factors as to genuine investment buying. Marketmakers were
only too happy to buy stock to meet the wave of selling commitments taken
aboard on Monday and Tuesday.
Second line stocks were left behind as the market turned, and the FT-SE Mid
250 Index remained in the doldrums, closing 0.7 down at 3,461.2.
There were strong recoveries in some interest rate-related stocks which had
been hit hard in the market shakeout. Oil shares, too, returned to favour as
crude prices continued to make progress. Among the market's bid features,
Enterprise Oil moved higher, reflecting growing belief in the stock market
that its bid for Lasmo will fail; shares in Lasmo gave ground but remained
well above their level at the time of the Enterprise approach.
The late rush to buy stock caused delay in the Stock Exchange calculation of
total Seaq business. At 4.30pm, the Seaq total stood at 462.4m shares,
compared with 544.5m in the previous session, with non-Footsie shares making
up only about 52 per cent of the day's equity business. However, retail, or
customer, business on Tuesday was worth only Pounds 926.4m, indicating that
the big investment funds had not been heavy sellers of stock as the market
plunged.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Footsie futures rallied strongly on the back of a recovering bond sector and
talk of an impending statement on the US dollar, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the September FT-SE 100 contract was struck at 2,948. But
for a brief decline to 2,941, buyers carried the contract forward throughout
the day. The smaller broking houses and independent operators (locals) were
reported to have been the main buyers in the first half of the session. The
reduction in interest rates in several European countries and the
improvement in bonds underpinned the buying activity, helping September to
maintain a premium to cash.
Reports that the US President was to make a statement on the dollar, and the
strong buying on Wall Street, gave further encouragement to derivatives
traders in London which brought a squeeze on the contract towards the close.
September ended at 2,968, up 30 from its previous finish and at a premium to
the cash market, although at a slight discount to its fair value premium to
cash of 13 points. Dealers reported a further rise in after-hours' trading.
Closing volume was 14,304.
Turnover in traded options improved to reach 33,792 contracts. FT-SE 100
option volume was 12,720 lots, and 2,154 were traded in Land Securities to
make it the busiest stock option.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Steadier dollar, bond rally
end equity slide
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks ended a three-day slide yesterday as the dollar steadied and the
bond market rallied, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 16.80 firmer at 3,724.77, after
dropping more than 103 points since last Friday morning. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 1.75 better at 453.09. New York SE turnover
was a moderate 251m shares.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite recouped 1.35 at 433.22
and the Nasdaq composite, battered in the previous session amid a sell-off
in computer-related issues, recovered 3.95 to 712.74.
The dollar again set the direction for stocks. Yesterday the tone was
positive, as the US currency steadied, finishing New York trading at Y101 a
day after dropping below the Y100 mark for the first time since World War
II.
The bond market, concerned about the likelihood of an early move to higher
interest rates, was relieved, and Treasuries rallied after a long drop.
Meanwhile, investors cast an eye towards Capitol Hill to glean hints about
monetary policy from Mr Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony. Although
the Federal Reserve chairman revealed little, his appearance had a
reassuring effect.
His appearance coincided with the release of the Fed's Beige Book summary of
economic conditions, which found a moderation in growth and no reason to be
concerned about inflation.
However, a profits warning issued by Sun, the energy group, called attention
again to the impact of higher rates on corporate earnings. After the energy
group said it expected to break even in the second quarter, its share price
was marked down Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 .
Tesoro Petroleum made a rare appearance on the New York SE's most active
list after filing for an offering of 5.35m new common shares priced at
Dollars 10 3/8 . The stock added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 11 3/8 in heavy
volume.
The previous session's three big losers stabilised yesterday. Caterpillar
gained Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 102 5/8 after falling Dollars 4 1/4 a day
earlier. But SG Warburg downgraded the issue, citing risks related to a
strike by the United Auto Workers.
Ouaker Oats crawled Dollars  5/8 lower to Dollars 72 5/8 . Its share price
went into a Dollars 8 1/4 tailspin after Nestle deflated investors' hopes
that it would launch a takeover bid for the food group.
Lotus Development, whose profits warning had prompted Tuesday's flight from
technology issues, dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 36 3/8 , adding to a 28
per cent decline in the previous session.
However, relative calm returned to the sector, and several leading stocks
rebounded smartly. On the Big Board, Compaq climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
33, Micron Technology recovered Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 5/8 and IBM put
on Dollars 1 at Dollars 62.
Silicon Graphics gained Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 21 3/4 after announcing the
formation of a product development venture with AT&amp;T Network Systems.

Gold shares lost ground and held back a fledgling recovery in Toronto, the
TSE 300 index closing just 4.6 points better at 4,052.2. The slight increase
in the index followed six straight days of losses.
Overall declines still held an advantage over advances, by 421 to 354.
Volume contracted to 54.1m shares from Tuesday's 64.9m, and trading value
amounted to CDollars 663.4m.
Turnover was boosted by heavy trading in the shares of Falconbridge, which
today completed its initial public offering for proceeds of about CDollars
750m. Falconbridge shares lost CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 17 1/2 .
Ten of the 14 stock groups rose, led by real estate and forestry, which
gained 2.22 and 2.09 per cent respectively.
Carena Developments rose 26 cents to CDollars 1.75 on reporting higher
six-month earnings.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa eases on 'neutral' budget
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The budget had little effect on the country's financial markets, the initial
reaction being that it was broadly 'neutral'. Among the proposals was a 5
percentage-point cut in corporation tax to 35 per cent.
Brokers reported that gold stocks were aided in the afternoon session by a
further advance in the price of bullion. The overall index receded 15 to
5,706, industrials declined 11 to 6,583 and the gold shares index dipped 2
to 2,243.
Remgro, which had lost ground recently on fears that the budget might
contain proposals lifting cigarette and alcohol taxes, improved 75 cents to
R28.25.
Among gold issues, both Vaal Reefs and Kloof lost R1, to R56.75 and R429
respectively.
De Beers relinquished R1.25 at R113.75 on rumours that negotiations with
Russia concerning the sale of diamonds had been called off. Barlows finished
25 cents softer at R35.25.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Asia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chinese equity market has been one of this year's disappointments,
reflected in a 37 per cent fall in dollar terms. Both the Shanghai and
Shenzhen B markets - which trade in stocks available to foreign investors -
have slipped back to the levels seen at the start of 1993, while H stocks,
traded in Hong Kong, are down almost 40 per cent so far this year.
James Capel Asia has identified a number of reasons, some of them, in its
view, misguided, why the investment community has been fighting shy of
China: the effect on earnings per share growth of a depreciating local
currency; the fear that a tax advantage currently available to companies
with B shares will be removed; and the perception that the level of company
disclosure is below average.
Dealing in the H stocks has become the preferred method of gaining exposure
to China, given that the Hong Kong market is itself well established and
regulated. A new tranche of 22 H stocks, estimated to raise a total of
HKDollars 48bn, is due to be listed in Hong Kong and New York before the end
of the year.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weaker on
dollar's low against yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The rise of the yen, and the fall in the dollar to a new post-war record low
of Y99.85 late on Tuesday in New York took Japanese equities to their third
successive decline yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 231.84. or 1.1 per cent, lower at 20,581.32 in
rising activity, volume climbing from 318m shares to an estimated 500m.
Brokers said there was heavy arbitrage selling, but that the Bank of Japan's
active intervention in the currency markets, in support of the dollar, had
invited buying on the dips in equities.
This 'bottom-fishing' allowed the index to close well off the day's low of
20,371.37, although it also registered a high of 20,742.65 in the process.
The broad market was also weak, the Topix index of all first section stocks
closing 15.00 down at 1,648.97. Declines led advances by 887 to 152, with
115 issues unchanged.
The Nikkei 300 fell 2.24 to 299.28 and the second section index shed 22.44
to 2,407.27 in 17.15m shares, but later in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
finished 3.43 up at 1,346.99.
Japanese equities had risen this year on hopes that the economy would
improve dramatically, said an analyst at a Big Four brokerage; but this
scenario was formed on estimates that the dollar would stay at around Y105.
Many companies would be forced into downward earnings forecast revisions if
the yen stayed around Y100.
Failing a recovery in the dollar, said brokers, the Nikkei 225 could fall to
20,000. Foreign investors were net sellers of Japanese stocks yesterday, and
it took active domestic buying linked to the launch of new investment trusts
and other institutional investment requirements to prevent equities from
falling further.
The key declines were in the transportation, rolling stock, fishery and
steel sectors. Also, many high-technology issues were weaker as investors
sold off exporters' shares on a higher yen. Oki Electric dipped Y7 to Y779
and Sony, in spite of its legal victory in the George Michael case in
England, fell Y90 to Y6,070.
Mitsubishi Oil, which performed well on Monday and Tuesday, closed unchanged
at Y1,050: it announced on Monday that it had drilled a successful test well
yielding 10,346 barrels per day of oil off the coast of Vietnam.
Roundup
Interest rate uncertainties remained, but the region offered indications of
recov-ery. Colombo was closed for a holiday.
PAKISTAN climbed on bullish sentiment in blue chips, as institutions moved
in before the close of corporate books on June 30.
The KSE 100 index rose 38.21, or 1.65 per cent, to 2,348.70.
Higher cement prices, and privatisation in the fuel and energy sector, took
constituent stocks into an uptrend.
SYDNEY rose for the first time in a week on a steadier bond market and an
advance in the gold price. The All Ordinaries index was ahead 17.3 at
2,010.9, after slipping to 1,988.1.
Industrials, resources and golds were strong performers, the golds index
putting on 35.1 at 2,259.1 after the rise in the bullion price on Tuesday
night.
HONG KONG overcame overseas selling and negative sentiment to end modestly
higher. The Hang Seng index closed 19.06 better at 8,876.84 after falling
below the 8,800 level in the early morning. Turnover was a light HKDollars
2.57bn.
Uncertainties about US interest rates and gloomy financial markets worldwide
kept foreign investors at bay.
SINGAPORE was mixed. It featured a strong rebound in Malaysian shares traded
over the counter, but the Straits Times Industrial index, composed of
domestic blue chips, ended 6.57 easier at 2,255.30.
Brokers said Malaysian OTC stocks benefited from bargain hunting, and from
rumours that a date for Malaysia's general election would be announced this
week.
BANGKOK finished 1.3 per cent down in moderate trade, with stocks falling
across the board. The communications sector was the biggest loser, while the
finance group was the most active.
NEW ZEALAND tested its 2,012.82 low for 1994, the NZSE-40 index bottoming at
2,017.9 before ending 14.21 down at 2,029.53. Turnover was healthy at
NZDollars 51.6m.
TAIPEI was mixed in thin trade. The weighted index edged forward 8.64 to
5,957.61 as turnover shrank to TDollars 40.6bn from Tuesday's TDollars
46.7bn.
United Microelectronics continued its run of strength with a rise of
TDollars 3 to TDollars 128.50.
SEOUL ended fractionally lower, fearing that the South Korean central bank
was about to cap money supply which would result in heavy institutional
selling. The composite index dipped 0.44 to 936.39.
MANILA broke a nine-day slide as the composite index firmed 1.36 to
2,815.95, but the market was still subdued by global concern over the
possible rise in US interest rates. Volume eased to 1.15bn shares.

FT  23 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses recover on better news
from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The news from America was better. Mr Stanley Fischer, the future IMF deputy
managing director, said the world economy was 'in great shape'; Mr Alan
Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, made the requisite noises about
domestic inflation as he testified in Congress to the House Budget
Committee; and President Clinton raised hopes by saying that a statement on
the dollar would be forthcoming later in the day.
In Europe, bonds responded, equities followed and short- covering did the
rest, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT regained Tuesday afternoon's losses, rose further to close the
session with the Dax index at 1,994.42, and climbed again in the post-
bourse to 2,004.93, up 47.85, or 2.4 per cent, over 24 hours.
Ms Barbara Altmann of B Metzler in Frankfurt said the recovery started in
the bond market, encouraged by Tuesday's M3 figures which were lower than
generally expected and by yesterday's further cut in the repo rate, 5 basis
points to 5.00 per cent.
Germany has high long bond yields and a reducing inflation rate, said Ms
Altmann, indicating high real yields on the longs and, potentially, a
profitable switch from short-dated instruments.
In that context the chances for equities, after a Dax fall from nearly 2,300
in mid-May to just above 1,950 this week, were better than the risks, she
maintained.
Financials, however, were weak, looking at the prospect of end-June figures
based on bond trading performance to date. Deutsche Bank fell a further DM7
to DM686.50 and Allianz DM17 to DM2,285.
Turnover edged up from DM8.3bn to DM8.5bn. The best rise of the day came
from Deckel Maho, up DM5.70, or 20 per cent, to DM34.20 on talk of a rescue
plan for the ailing machine tool maker.
MILAN's strong rebound surprised most observers, although the equity market
took its more positive outlook mainly from strength in bonds. Sentiment was
also helped by expectations that the government would make an announcement
today on proposals to restrict growth in this year's budget deficit.
The Comit index improved 13.00 to 691.63.
There were gains across the board, with no specific stories predominating;
but the good rises were seen especially in the industrial sector. One of the
day's best performers was Montedison, up L86 at L1,473.
PARIS made gains in line with the more optimistic picture throughout the
Continent.
The CAC-40 index advanced 26.26, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,917.04, but brokers
cautioned against reading too much into the rise as sentiment remained edgy.
Peugeot gained FFr8 at FFr783, although the vehicle manufacturer forecast a
slowdown in market growth during the rest of the year.
Skis Rossignol put on FFr95 to FFr1,940 as it said that it expected to cut
its debt burden this year, and forecast a rise in turnover.
Eurotunnel ended up FFr1.15 at FFr25 with the group due to announce the take
up of its rights issue by the weekend.
ZURICH was among the best bourseperformers with a rise of 2 per cent, the
SMI index ending 51.5 higher at 2,595.7. The recovery was led by banks, UBS
rising SFr33 to SFr1,119, CS Holding by SFr21 to SFr539 and SBC by SFr16 to
SFr389.
Pharmaceuticals also gained with Roche certificates rising SFr55 to
SFr6,405.
However, the recovery was said to be vulnerable. Volume was low and dealers
said that the gains were too fragile to lay the basis for a new upward
trend.
AMSTERDAM needed little encouragement to break out of the downward trend
experienced for more than a week and, drawing inspiration from bonds, the
AEX index gained 6.05, or 1.6 per cent, at 382.74.
KLM added 10 cents at Fl 45.70, the stock having been upgraded recently to a
buy by Paribas Capital Markets. In explanation Mr Chris Avery, the analyst,
said the airline's results for the year to March had confirmed its recovery
story, even though it had benefited from a pension holiday. He added that
Northwest, in which KLM has a 20 per cent stake, was now making a positive
contribution to the group.
MADRID's technical recovery, tentative for such a volatile market, left the
general index just above the 300 mark again with a rise of 3.78, or 1.3 per
cent to 300.76. A reduction in block trades left turnover considerably lower
than in recent days at Pta34bn.
Utilities were relatively strong, Iberdrola recovering Pta25, or 2.7 per
cent to Pta950 after recent losses aggregating around 10 per cent. Banks
were mixed, even after some late buying interest.
ISTANBUL fell 2.4 per cent on profit-taking following the market's recent
strong run last week when it gained more than 20 per cent in dollar terms.
The composite index lost 490.58 to 19,703.93, after an early high of
20,402.14.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar above its yen low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar bounced off its post-war low against the yen yesterday as markets
hoped that comments from US Treasury Secretary Mr Lloyd Bentsen would give
an indication of central bank intentions, writes Motoko Rich.
As the US Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan refrained from
commenting directly on the dollar in his testimony to the House budget
committee, the dollar held above the Y100 level, closing in London at
Y100.695, from Y101.225. Against the D-Mark, it ended at DM1.6006, down from
DM1.6009. In New York the US currency improved to end at Y101.00 and
DM1.6053.
Sterling turned in a gloomy performance, shadowing the dollar's downward
trend against the D-Mark and responding negatively to the publication of the
minutes of the May 4 meeting between the UK chancellor and the Bank of
England Governor.
The dollar was fluctuating close to its post-1945 low, around Y100.70, after
Mr Bentsen said he was 'concerned by recent movements in the exchange
markets' and that the G7 partners were 'prepared to act as appropriate'.
After overnight intervention from the Bank of Japan, the dollar had
retrieved some of its Tuesday losses. The markets were hesitant to drive the
dollar back down as they watched Mr Greenspan's testimony for clues about
the Fed's intervention plans. The US currency was not on the agenda,
however, and the Fed chairman kept largely to his script.
The dollar skipped up when Mr Greenspan said he and Mr Bentsen were
'following currency movements'. Although inflationary pressures were
subdued, he warned of a future re-emergence of inflation.
Publication of the Fed's beige book, which helps the Fed evaluate the state
of the US economy, gave the dollar a boost. It showed the US economy still
expanding but at an easier pace.
Analysts predicted that the dollar's bounce would not hold, however. 'I do
not think there has been any convincing strength,' commented Mr Brian
Hilliard, economist at SGST. 'I would expect the markets to have another go
at the dollar to test the resolve of the central banks, but I do think a
half per cent rise from the Fed would be neither here nor there.'
The US currency's recent slide against the yen has been helped by strength
in the Japanese currency. Ms Jane Edwards, economist at Lehman Brothers,
said good export figures, and worries that a vote of no confidence in Prime
Minister Tsutomu Hata's government will set back trade talks between the US
and Japan, have driven the yen up against the dollar.
Sterling was near its eight-month low against the D-Mark after the minutes
of the May 4 meeting between UK chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of
England Governor Eddie George revealed a neutral stance on UK interest rate
policy.
Although both Mr Clarke and Mr George appeared to have abandoned their 'bias
towards easing' rates, the minutes showed that an interest rate rise is not
imminent.
The pound was hit by traders who were hoping for a near-term rise. Sterling
closed in London at DM2.4579 from DM2.4612, and against the dollar at
Dollars 1.5356 from Dollars 1.5374.
Analysts said that while the minutes helped to push the pound down, it was
mainly trading on the dollar's weakness. 'The pound's performance against
the D-Mark is just a reflection of the dollar's fall against the D-Mark,'
said Mr Mark Geddes, economist at Midland Global Markets.
The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with Pounds 340m liquidity
at established interest rates and late assistance of Pounds 90m after
forecasting a shortage of Pounds 600m. Overnight lending rates traded
between 6 and 4 3/4 per cent.
As attention was focused on the fragile dollar, the D-Mark ended little
changed against most of the European crosses. In London, it closed against
the French franc at FFr3.422 from FFr3.418, against the Belgian franc at
BFr20.58 from BFr20.59, and against the lira at L983.3 from L987.4.
The Bundesbank's five basis- point cut in the repo rate to 5.00 per cent was
largely expected and had little effect on the markets. German call money
remained at 5 per cent, largely unchanged from Tuesday's levels.
The futures market was characterised by volatility as rumours of a
no-confidence vote in Mr Hata's government in Japan sparked off selling of
yen and helped the long end of the markets in bunds, gilts and futures
contracts.
'We have seen a dramatic change in what has been a bearish market,' said Mr
Richard Phillips, broker at GNI. The December Euromark contract traded
44,000 lots and rose to 94.87 from 94.78, discounting the short-term
interest rate at 5.13 per cent.
The short-term sterling contract for December was trading at thin volumes of
19,000 lots. 'Short-sterling has seen a reasonable rally very much led by
the longer end of the yield and the gilts market,' added Mr Phillips. The
December contract closed at 93.74 from 93.68.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Buyers come to copper's rescue
after early fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The copper market burst into life again late yesterday after pausing for
breath earlier this week. However, analysts warned that the copper price -
and prices of other London Metal Exchange-traded metals - might be heading
for a fall in the third quarter.
Copper for delivery in three months, which at one point yesterday dropped to
Dollars 2,417 a tonne, closed on the London Metal Exchange at Dollars
2,451.50, up Dollars 18.25 a tonne from Tuesday's close.
Traders said that some Japanese buying stopped copper's price fall and later
the Chinese also came in with 'buy' orders.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, said the market was still unsure
whether there would be the usual summer lull in business. He added: 'I
suspect that there will be a lull and the onset of the third-quarter
seasonal demand weakness will indeed witness lower metal prices in the
coming quarter. These lower prices will, however, offer a period of
consolidation as a prelude to a fresh acceleration (in copper's price) in
the final quarter'.
At GNI, analyst Mr Lawrence Eagles suggested that, if copper should begin to
fall back, other metals would follow. The sell-off was likely to be most
aggressive for those metals, such as zinc, which had the worst over-supply
problems.
Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, remained more bullish.
Although he accepted that the copper market might be very volatile in coming
weeks and he would not be surprised to see daily trading ranges of 3 to 5
cents a pound, he forecast that three-month copper would trade over the next
two to three months between Dollars 2,250 and Dollars 2,550 a tonne (Dollars
1.02 to Dollars 1.16 a pound).

FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee and cocoa prices fall
sharply - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE futures fell sharply at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday
afternoon, emulating a drop in New York.
The September delivery position finished Dollars 66 lower at Dollars 2,278 a
tonne, slightly off the lows, mainly on profit-taking, with little news to
drive the market one way or the other.
'I don't think anyone has a genuine idea of where the price is going,' one
trader commented.
The LCE COCOA market, which was also influenced by the trend in New York,
had a lacklustre day, nudging below the opening lows and finishing Pounds 15
down at Pounds 1,000 a tonne, its low of the day, in the September position.
A trader said the producer selling seemed to be largely 'on hold', with much
of the activity dominated by speculators following general commodity market
trends.
At the London Bullion Market GOLD finished unchanged after fixing at a 5 1/2
 month high in the morning in response to New York's overnight rise. But the
US market weakened yesterday as the dollar put in a stronger performance.
Dealers said gold was still tied to currency markets but had shaken off its
allegiance to moves in the Commodity Research Bureau index.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US official attacks Canadian
wheat marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A top-ranking official of the US Department of Agriculture took aim at
Canada's entire wheat marketing system in a speech made in Fargo, North
Dakota on Tuesday, calling the Canadian Wheat Board's operations
'monopolistic' and incompatible with the new free trade climate in North
America.
The comments, made by Mr Eugene Moos, Undersecretary for International
Affairs and Commodity Programmes at the US Department of Agriculture, may
indicate that the US will push for an overhaul of Canada's entire grain
marketing system, rather than just a short-term fix to a cross-border grain
trade dispute, when US agriculture secretary Mr Mike Espy and top trade
negotiator Mr Mickey Kantor meet with their Canadian counterparts in Chicago
on Monday.
The Clinton administration, under pressure from congressmen from farm states
bordering Canada, is threatening to impose emergency quotas on wheat imports
from Canada, and Canada has promised to retaliate. The US claims Canada is
unfairly marketing into US wheat-producing regions, although US flour
millers and pasta processors contend that short supplies of high-quality US
wheat have forced them to buy from Canada.
Mr Moos went beyond the domestic trade issues in his remarks on Tuesday,
saying: 'The predatory practices of the Canadian Wheat Board must end'.
Although Canada does not directly subsidise grain exports in the way that
the US and the European Union do, Mr Moos said the Wheat Board's pricing
policies allowed it to undercut subsidising competitors.
He said he had asked to be allowed use the US grain export subsidy program,
known as EEP, against trade competitors other than the EU, warning: 'We in
the USDA intend to use all of the tools at our disposal to encourage other
competitors to trade fairly'.
Although national grain marketing boards like those in Canada and Australia
were not addressed in the recently-concluded Uruguay round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, they have recently become the focus of
unfair trade practice complaints. Mr Winston Wilson, president of the
largest US wheat export trade group, said: 'I think it boils down to the
fact we are now involved with two free trade agreements with Canada, and we
have two different systems of grain marketing that are not very compatible'.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Computer model could cut
nitrogen applications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Predictions of the nitrogen needs of crops on different fields at varying
times of year can be made available to farmers on a computer model developed
by Horticulture Research International, the company said this week.
It claimed the computer programme would enable farmers to target their
nitrogen applications more accurately so that crops grew well. It should
help eliminate the environmental damage and waste of money associated with
using too much nitrogen fertiliser.
The company said the computer model, which had been tested over 3,000
hectares, offered nitrogen predictions for a wide range of crops. The model
comes as farmers face mounting pressure from environmentalists about cutting
their use of nitrogen fertilisers.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India clears way for private
forestry boost - Moves to allow wood-based industries to join in the
replanting effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
India, which is far from achieving its target of bringing at least one-third
of the total land area under tree cover has finally seen the merit of
allowing the wood based industries to start forestry plantation in degraded
forest land.
Captive plantation by industries calls, however, for major amendments to the
national forest policy of 1988.
Mr Kamal Nath, minister of environment and forests, had given manufacturers
of paper, plywood and viscose fibre to understand that the government will
allow them to take large tracts of degraded forest on leases of at least 30
years to grow an ideal mix of long and short maturing trees. The lessees
will also have the right to grow cash crops in among the trees.
Of India's total waste land of nearly 160m hectares, the share of degraded
forest is about 40m ha with a crown density of less than 20 per cent. The
National Wastelands Development Board was given a target to bring 5m
hectares under tree plantation every year. But the resources at its command
have not allowed the board to plant on more than 2m hectares a year.
According to Mr SP Goenka, president of the Federation of Indian Plywood
Industry, the induction of the private sector into forestry plantation would
not only 'ease the pressure on the government, which is short of funds, but
it would also create millions of job opportunities in the Indian villages'.
The forestry plantation industry, a totally new concept in India, will
create jobs for three workers a hectare. So the policy initiative would
appear to have the potential to create 120m jobs.
As the forest cover in India is barely 12 per cent and forestry productivity
is only one-fifth that of Europe, the government has imposed severe
restrictions on the procurement of wood and bamboo by industries. It is,
however, the demand for fuel wood by the poor villagers and illegal felling
of trees to make room for food production that have actually played havoc
with Indian forests.
The government has sought to give relief to the wood-based industries by
allowing them to import timber, pulp and waste paper. Some paper and plywood
manufacturers have gone in for social and farm forestry by establishing
direct contact with the farmers, as allowed by the 1988 forest policy.
According to the Indian Paper Mills Association, 'the social and farm
forestry cannot be a dependable source of raw material for the industry
since the farmers are free to sell the trees to anybody'.
Mr Goenka says the success of private sector participation in forestry
plantation will call for an 'attitudinal change of the official agencies at
the federal and state level. The government financial institutions should be
ready to provide adequate funds by accepting mortgage of trees'.
Tree plantation has a seven year cycle. If the private forestry plantation
work is flagged off soon, then the Indian wood based industries, which have
not seen much growth in recent years, will have the confidence to plan for
new capacity. India could also emerge as an important exporter of wood and
wood based products within ten years, says Mr Goenka.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK boffins breed a better lupin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lupins, the early summer stalwarts of most British gardens, could soon
proliferate over much of the country's farmland, and contribute to reducing
the trade deficit.
Government research has developed a new strain of white lupin that is
suitable for growing in Britain on a commercial basis and can be made into
animal feed. The white flowers could be grown by farmers for sale to cattle
feedmakers in two to three years.
The new variety grows seed pods that are rich in protein - unlike the
poisonous seeds of their country garden counterparts. The seeds, which
contain almost 40 to 50 per cent edible protein and 10 to 12 per cent oil,
can be crushed to make animal feedstuff.
Much of Britain's animal feed is now made from soyabeans, which are imported
from the US at an annual cost of around Pounds 350m. Some 30,000 tonnes of
lupins are imported from Australia as an additive to livestock feeds.
Research at Cranfield University has shown that the new strain of lupin
would be suitable for growing on 43 per cent of farmland in England and
Wales. 'In the past we had a go at growing the old varieties of lupin, but
they couldn't stand the cold and frost,' says Mr John Hollis at the
university's Soil Survey and Land Research Centre.
The new hardier variety can be planted in September to produce a flower the
following summer. The plants have also been genetically manipulated so that
the flowers grow closer to the top of the stem and are exposed to the
maximum amount of sunlight, with the result that they ripen more quickly.
The plants are partial to acid, or poorer soils, but will not grow on
lime-rich soil. 'Providing you don't have a natural limey soil and you hit
the crop planting window right at the beginning of September, you can expect
yields of 4 to 5 tonnes an acre,' says Mr Hollis.
Lupins are grown commercially in Australia and parts of South America. In
Chile the seeds are fried up and eaten as a snack.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Italy to import more Algerian
gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy has signed a new gas deal with Algeria, committing Snam, the gas
supply subsidiary of ENI, the Italian state oil concern, to buy 2bn cubic
metres of liquefied natural gas a year from 1996 from Sonatrach, the
Algerian state oil company.
Algeria already accounts for about 40 per cent of Italy's gas supplies. The
latest contract will bring to 26bn cu m the annual imports as of 1996, when
the second leg of the Tunis-Sicily Trans-Mediterranean pipeline becomes
operational. Coming at a time of increasing political uncertainty in
Algeria, the contract is seen as evidence of Italy's strategic choice of
this North African supplier.
The LNGs will be transported from Skikda in Algeria to Panigaglia near La
Spezia. By 1996 21.5bn cu m of gas a year will be contracted through Snam
while an additional 4bn cu m is being bought directly by Enel, the Italian
state electricity authority, but transported by Snam.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasury prices recover ground as dollar
firms

<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds made up lost ground yesterday, prodded by a steadier
dollar and softer commodity prices.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  31/32 higher
at 86 1/4 . The yield eased to 7.40 per cent, well below the 7.50 per cent
barrier breached the previous session. At the short end, the two-year note
was  1/16 better at 100 1/32 , to yield 5.966 per cent.
The improvement followed a firming trend by the US currency, which had
fallen to a post-war low against the yen during Tuesday's trading session.
Modest gains by the dollar yesterday allowed traders to take advantage of
bond prices driven lower in recent days by fears of an imminent tightening
of monetary policy.
The market's attention was focused on Capitol Hill, where the Federal
Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, testified before the House banking
committee. However, fixed-rate investors searched in vain for meaningful
clues about the timing of the central bank's next rate increase, or about
the implications of the dollar's weakness.
Meanwhile, commodity prices were co-operating again, with gold and the
Commodity Research Bureau's 21-product index both extending their recent
string of declines.
The surprising level of demand which surfaced for Wednesday's Treasury
auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes was a second source of strength.
Bond prices across the board extended their earlier gains during the
afternoon, amid retail buying and short-covering by traders who had bet the
market would have difficulty absorbing the fresh supply.
The European rally, which came late in the afternoon, saw German government
bonds rise by about one point. It followed an earlier technical squeeze
upwards in most European markets, as traders moved to cover short positions.
'The rebound was largely technical, and a result of the largely bullish
noises coming from the US,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Midland
Global Markets in London.
'There was nothing new from the Fed, but in a bear market where people are
expecting only bad news, reassurance that what the Fed is doing is moving
monetary policy into neutral to combat inflation is welcome,' he said.
German government bonds moved higher in response to Mr Greenspan's comments,
and as a result of the slightly firmer tone to the dollar.
The market moved higher in early trading, as investors moved to cover short
positions. 'It broke through important technical levels around 90.65 and
found support to move higher from there,' said one trader in Frankfurt.
Analysts said attention would be on today's Bundesbank meeting at Potsdam,
near Berlin, after which there will be a press conference. They will be keen
to hear the Bundesbank's latest views on inflation and M3 money supply
growth. Also of interest is US durable goods data published today.
The Bundesbank yesterday allowed the repo rate to fall 5 basis points to 5
per cent. This was in line with expectations and had little impact on the
market. The September bund contract was up 1.93 points at 92.29 in late
trading.
UK government bonds moved higher, taking heart from Mr Greenspan's remarks
and the fact that the published minutes of the May 4 meeting between the UK
chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England showed no immediate
inclination to raise interest rates.
'There was some relief, especially for the short-end of the market, that a
rate rise was not considered and, after Mr Greenspan side-stepped the issue
of the recent dollar weakness, fears of an imminent rise in US rates (were
allayed),' said one analyst.
The long gilt future was up 1 27/32 points in late trading at 100 1/16 .
The French and Italian government bond market moved higher in line with the
rest of Europe. Italy in particular performed well, buoyed by remarks from
Treasury and Bank of Italy officials concerning the need to control the
Italian budget deficit.
The September notional French bond futures contract on Matif closed at
113.44, up 1.14 points on the day. The Italian September BTP futures
contract on Liffe was up 2.50 points at 103.85 in late trading.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan groups on the road

<TEXT>
Two big stock market-listed Taiwanese companies are launching global
roadshows this week for equity-linked bond issues worth Dollars 700m. The
deals reflect the increasing appetite of local companies for overseas funds.
President Enterprises, Taiwan's biggest foods conglomerate, will kick off an
international roadshow in Hong Kong today aimed at promoting the Dollars
100m issue of what will be Taiwan's first exchangeable bond issue.
The issue will be lead-managed by Bankers Trust, with Banque Paribas as
co-lead, a senior finance manager at the group said.
To avoid dilution of shares in the parent company, the bonds may be
exchanged into shares in Tonyi Industrial Corp, a listed subsidiary and
Taiwan's biggest producer of tin plate.
Formosa Chemical &amp; Fibre and Nanya Plastics, part of the Formosa Plastics
group, earlier this week began a joint tri-continental tour in Singapore to
raise Dollars 300m each through a convertible bond issue.
The coupon rate is expected to be between 1.75 and 2 per cent, and the
conversion premium will be set at between 5 and 10 per cent, according to a
manager in Formosa Plastics' finance department.
The funds will be used to finance a Dollars 7.8bn naphtha cracker complex.
Formosa Plastics is Taiwan's biggest private-sector conglomerate.
Formosa Plastics itself plans to issue another Dollars 300m in convertible
bonds later this year.
Euroconvertible bonds have now been issued by 16 Taiwanese companies, and
five have issued global depository receipts.
Under existing Taiwan securities regulations, foreign holders of
equity-linked bonds issued by Taiwanese companies are not permitted to
convert them into listed shares.
However, it widely understood the government is considering a change in the
conversion laws, possibly within the next two years.

<TEXT>
Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank, Germany's fifth largest bank, has
postponed a DM1bn rights issue indefinitely because of weak stock market
conditions, writes David Waller in Frankfurt.
The 1-for-10 issue was announced in early May, shortly after the
Bavaria-based bank reported a 33 per cent rise in earnings for last year.
Since then, bank shares have underperformed the DAX index of leading German
shares.
Meanwhile, Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, insisted it
would not pull its DM3bn international offering. This is in spite of a
narrowing of the gap between the price of the new shares and the market
price, from 20 per cent when first announced to 13 per cent yesterday.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Warm reception for Fannie Mae global
debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fannie Mae, one of the world's biggest issuers of long-term debt, could
become a regular borrower in the international bond market following its
successful debut yesterday.
With extensive pre-marketing, the triple-A rated US mortgage agency's
Dollars 1.5bn offering of 10-year global bonds was received favourably by
investors. The warm reception enabled the bonds to be priced to yield 25
basis points over US Treasuries, in line with market expectations.
Joint lead manager Merrill Lynch said strong demand from European investors,
and the fact that the bonds were not callable, had allowed Fannie Mae to
achieve better funding rates than in the domestic US market, where its bonds
traded at a yield spread of around 29 basis points over Treasuries. Many of
Fannie Mae's domestic bonds are callable.
Ms Linda Knight, Fannie Mae's treasurer, said the agency had delayed its
entry into the international bond market to await the fruits of its efforts
to build up a domestic market in callable bonds. This market was now a
powerful funding tool for the agency, which last year issued Dollars 46.4bn
worth of long-term debt. It is likely to raise similar amounts this year.
However, Ms Knight said the change in the interest rate climate this year
had prompted Fannie Mae to increase its issuance of non-callable debt. She
said she had opted for the global bond market, where spreads were tighter
than at home and where the lack of high-quality borrowers worked in Fannie
Mae's favour. 'Now that we have developed the capability in the global bond
market, we could well come back,' she said.
J. P. Morgan, the other joint lead manager, said at least 60 per cent of the
offering had been placed with European and Asian investors.
However, other syndicate managers said only time would tell whether or not
such a large proportion would stay outside the US in the long run.
Fannie Mae's smooth entry bodes well for Freddie Mac, the other US mortgage
agency scheduled to launch its first global bond offering early next month.
This deal is likely to raise at least Dollars 1bn, but have a shorter
maturity.
The market was less enthusiastic about Austria's Pounds 200m offering of
10-year eurobonds, which several syndicate managers said was hampered by
continuing fragility in the UK government bond market. They also thought the
pricing, to yield 22 basis points over comparable gilts, was at least five
basis points too tight.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international rating agency, has lowered the
long-term senior rating of Credit Lyonnais, to A-minus from single-A, to
reflect the severe asset quality pressures which have affected the French
bank. The outlook on the rating is negative.

Burns Philp, the Australian group which has been pruning its diverse
business interests to concentrate on 'core' food and ingredients operations,
is buying Deutsche Hefewerke, a German baking yeast and yeast extract
business, for around ADollars 117m (USDollars 90m).
DHW is being sold by Veba, the large German energy, chemical and trading
group, and comprises three factories, in Hamburg, Nuremberg and Leipzig. It
has annual sales of around DM100m (Dollars 61.3m) and employs some 315
people.
In Sydney, Burns said that the deal, which is still subject to approval by
Germany's Federal Cartel Office, would lift its share of the global yeast
extracts market to around 15 per cent. Its share of the German baking yeast
market would be around 30 per cent.
Burns Philp already owns Mauri Products, a yeast manufacturer in the UK and
has been aggressively building up overseas food ingredient interests
recently.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Searching for consensus on risk
assessment - Traders and market regulators are changing their focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears about derivatives risk have tended to centre on credit risk,
potentially snowballing into systemic risk and bringing about the collapse
of the international financial system.
But there is a growing school of thought which argues that this focus is
misplaced. According to many market participants, market risk is a much more
fundamental danger than credit risk, and existing measures for risk
management are often misguided.
Because derivatives are highly leveraged, losses on market positions have
been exaggerated, and volatile conditions have caused assumed correlations
between markets, on which hedging is often based, to evaporate.
Consequently, volatile markets can prove more dangerous for the derivatives
trader than for the cash market trader.
In fact, many derivatives specialists argue, credit risk in the derivatives
market only becomes a serious problem as a result of market risk: in most
cases where heavy losses have been incurred, it has been as a result of a
lack of understanding of market risk. Credit risk, on the other hand, is
arguably the same for derivatives as for other markets. In its recent report
on derivatives, the US General Accounting Office concluded from its survey
of 14 US participants that the net credit risk from derivatives at the end
of 1992 was only Dollars 68bn - much smaller than for loans. (This assumes
that netting of derivatives is enforceable).
Regulators who are primarily concerned about credit risk could be barking up
the wrong tree. Many market participants think they are, arguing that
regulators pay too little heed to the way that derivatives specialists look
at risk. For a derivatives trader, the key issue is the present value of a
particular position, and an important part of the job is to create models to
calculate this, using historical data.
The Basle Committee is currently working on new capital rules for market
risk, but the approach detailed in consultative papers circulated last year
has been widely criticised by market participants as bureaucratic and
antiquated.
In a recent speech, Mr William McDonough, president of the New York Federal
Reserve, noted that market participants are arguing that 'the market risk
measurement models the banks had developed for their own risk management
offered a means to measure capital requirements with greater precision and
with much lower regulatory burden than the proposed supervisory model.' Mr
McDonough described the consideration of a models-based approach as 'a major
step for the international supervisory community,' but did not rule it out.
The problem, though, may extend beyond regulators, touching the entire
conceptual approach to derivatives. Many regulators come from a loan officer
tradition or an accounting tradition, and therefore their approach may be
fundamentally at odds with the way the market actually functions.
This explains, too, the growing sense of dissatisfaction with the accounting
treatment of derivatives, which means that information in company reports on
derivatives business is often meaningless.
'Accounting should reflect economics,' argues Mr Flavio Bartman, managing
director, commodity derivatives at Merrill Lynch. 'We have principles of
accounting that were drafted for a world where you only had bonds and
stocks.'
According to Mr Michael Black, head of consultancy at CSC Index, who advises
firms on derivatives risk management, 'accounting systems define value in
terms of capital; derivatives in terms of the net present value of a
position: these are apples and pears.'
Similar problems may arise within the senior management of banks, which
often focus too closely on return on capital, according to Mr Black.
Derivatives traders have their vested interests and preconceptions. But,
increasingly, finding transferable values which allow traders, regulators,
accountants and senior managers to discuss risk management in the same terms
is becoming one of the goals of the debate.
This is the first of a weekly column on derivatives.

<TEXT>
Parker &amp; Parsley, the Texas-based oil independent which is bidding for
Sydney-based Bridge Oil, has begun legal proceedings against Gantry, the
rival suitor for Bridge, in the Dallas district courts.
Gantry is the bid vehicle used by Jedi, an investment partnership owned
jointly by Enron, the US natural gas company, and the California Public
Employees Retirement System, one of the biggest US public pension funds.
On Monday, Gantry entered the bidding for Bridge, offering 85 cents a share
in cash and valuing the Australian company at ADollars 356.7m (USDollars
274.3m).
This topped the P&amp;P offer, increased only minutes previously, of 80 cents at
share.
P&amp;P said that its suit alleged breaches of the US Securities Exchange Act,
under which companies making a tender offer are prohibited from purchasing
shares outside that offer, unless a waiver has first been obtained from the
US Securities and Exchange Commission.
It has sought an order barring Gantry/Jedi from buying shares in Bridge,
outside of the tender offer.
P&amp;P said it planned to examine data related to Bridge Oil's US subsidiary
with the aim of 'fully evaluating options regarding the current offer of 80
cents a share'.
P&amp;P claimed Gantry, whose bid has been recommended by the Bridge board, had
access to additional, non-public information at Bridge Oil (USA).
It has demanded similar access.
The ADollars 500m bid by Mr Graeme Hart, a New Zealand businessman, in
conjunction with Coles Myer, for Australia's Foodland Associated has been
referred to the federal Treasury, 'to examine potential implications for
competition policy'.
Under the deal, Coles could end up owning the Australian assets of Foodland.
This could give Coles a large stake in the West Australian grocery market.

Conservation Corporation, the South Africa eco-tourism group, plans a R66m
(Dollars 18m) expansion into east Africa through the purchase of two
wildlife lodges in Kenya and Tanzania and a share of an important hotel
group in the region.
The two lodges, Kichwa Tembo Camp in Kenya and Ngorongoro Crater Lodge in
Tanzania, and the hotel group, Windsor Hotels, are part of the Abercrombie
and Kent Group.
The deal has been financed through a R15m issue of new Conservation ordinary
shares to the vendors and R51m in cash, which was raised through rights
issues partially underwritten by Hambros Bank in London.
Mr Geoffrey Kent, Abercrombie and Kent chairman, will become joint chairman
of Conservation with Mr David Varty, the current chairman. Mr Steve
Fitzgeral, former chief executive of Halcyon Hotels, has been appointed
managing director.
According to Mr Alan Berstein, Conservation's deputy chairman, the move
signals a belief in the strong potential of African tourism.
'We expect to be very well positioned to take advantage of a positive trend
in the South and east African tourist markets,' he said.
Conservation, which was founded four years ago, is regarded as one of the
premier eco-tourist operations in South Africa, where it runs four game
lodges.
The Abercrombie deal is widely seen in South African financial circles as a
precursor to a stock market listing in the next couple of years, either in
London or Johannesburg.

Three former executives of CS First Boston's Prague operations yesterday
launched the first fully Czech-run investment bank catering to the country's
growing number of corporate and private clients.
The new bank, Patria Finance, is headed by Mr Zdenek Bakala, who once worked
in corporate finance with Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York.
Patria Finance has start-up capital of Kcs100m (Dollars 3.57m), and is 75
per cent owned by its management. A group of Swiss investors owns the
balance.
Mr Bakala said Czech corporate clients are largely ignored in the country's
financial services market. Investment banking services are currently offered
either by commercial banks as a supplement to their core lending activities
or by international investment banks which cater to overseas clients and
operate with 'little regard for the specifics of the emerging local capital
market'.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Zambia Consolidated Copper falls
into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the world's fourth-largest copper
producer, yesterday revealed a net loss of K72.6bn (Dollars 99m) for the
year ended March. It had previously warned of a poor result.
In the previous 12 months there was a net profit of K41.6bn.
However, Mr Edward Shamutete, chief executive, said last month that although
production difficulties caused a loss in 1993-94, ZCCM expected to break
even in the current year and to be profitable in 1995-96.
ZCCM, which is listed in London, is being prepared for full privatisation by
the Zambian government which owns 60 per cent, but the timing is far from
clear. Anglo American Corporation of South Africa owns 27 per cent of ZCCM
via Zambia Copper Investments.
At the operating level, ZCCM made a profit of K4.9bn last year down from
K108bn. Copper production fell from 432,000 tonnes to 392,000 tonnes.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Liberation movement lifts Latin
America - The region has been one of the main beneficiaries of free capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There have been many liberation movements over the last 30 years. But while
women and some national minorities may still be battling for their freedom,
there is one constituency which has been remarkably successful in liberating
itself - capital.
Before the breakdown of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system in the early
1970s, it was time-consuming, expensive and difficult for citizens of most
industrialised countries to buy foreign assets.
Now, after two decades of liberalisation and deregulation, freedom to own
capital abroad has extended beyond the industrialised countries to include
the 'emerging markets' of Asia and Latin America.
Figures from the Bank for International Settlements' annual report,
published last week, show the sheer scale of today's international capital
markets.
In the first half of the 1980s, gross capital outflows from the larger
industrial countries (excluding official and short-term banking
transactions) were around Dollars 100bn a year. By 1993, flows reached
Dollars 850bn.
While the recent falls in world bond and equities markets may have slowed
the relentless acceleration of such flows, it seems likely that growth will
resume.
Institutional portfolios in the UK may be internationally diversified, but
there is still plenty of scope for overseas purchases by US and continental
European funds.
In the 1990s, the emerging markets have been the fashionable home for
international investments.
According to the BIS, net inflows into the developing world rose to around
Dollars 160bn in 1993, from an average of Dollars 37bn a year in the period
from 1986 to 1990.
The BIS said that capital has been particularly directed to Latin America
(where inflows amounted to almost 5 per cent of gross domestic product last
year) and to lower wage Asian developing countries (about 4 per cent).
These capital inflows have been broadly welcomed as a return to the
'correct' flow of capital between developed and developing countries - a
trend which was interrupted by the debt crisis of the 1980s.
But the BIS warns that there were important differences in the nature of the
inflows to the two regions - differences that, they say, might create
problems for Latin America in later years.
According to the BIS report: 'A large proportion of Asian capital inflows
has been closely linked to increased domestic investment and imports of
investment goods. This has contributed to real exchange rate stability in
the region and has also helped to prevent excessive increases in domestic
liquidity.
'In Latin America, by contrast, the influx of foreign capital - dominated by
portfolio and short-term financial flows - was less directly associated with
increased imports of investment goods and there was a greater degree of
upward pressure on real exchange rates.'
One reason why so much short-term capital flowed in to Latin America was
high real interest rates.
Combined with the liberalisation measures taken by local governments, this
encouraged the repatriation of some of the flight capital which left the
region during the 1980s.
Many currencies in the Latin American region failed to depreciate against
the dollar as quickly as inflation differentials suggested.
As the BIS comments, 'this made investing in short-term assets denominated
in local currency attractive at a time when US short-term interest rates
were unusually low.'
The real appreciation of the Latin American currencies was probably boosted
by the scale of the continent's economic and financial reforms. The Asian
countries had been much better at controlling inflation and restraining
their fiscal deficits.
In Latin America, however, policies in both areas had been lax, and
accordingly the change in sentiment, which followed the implementation of
reform programmes, created sharp upward pressure on the region's currencies.
But the impact of an appreciation in the real effective exchange rate,
according to the BIS, is likely to be a deterioration in the competitiveness
of an economy's tradable sector and therefore a deteriorating current
account deficit.
Investment in Asia has been much higher than in Latin America, helped by
high domestic savings rates.
By investing in the export-creating manufacturing sectors, some (but not
all) Asian countries have been able to offset pressure on their current
accounts. Latin American countries, by contrast, have experienced a marked
rise in their current account deficits.
The BIS says further reforms are needed in Latin America if the region is to
hold on to the benefits achieved through recent stabilisation programmes.
The report says infrastructures need to be improved in many countries; the
problem of poverty needs to be tackled, to prevent social unrest undermining
the reform climate; and domestic financial markets need to be reformed to
help countries cope with the effects of the massive capital inflows they
have received.
Furthermore, the inflows have increased Latin America's vulnerability to
external shocks, such as higher international interest rates.
This problem has already been seen this year in the sharp fall in Latin
American debt markets, which followed the US Federal Reserve's decision to
push up short-term interest rates.
To date, the developing countries have mostly seen the positive side of the
expansion of the international capital markets.
The strength of their financial systems (and their commitment to
liberalisation) may be tested when the flows start to reverse. In this
regard, Latin America may be more vulnerable than Asia.

<TEXT>
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, put another question mark over the
top credit rating of Exxon after last week's jury verdict that the US oil
company had acted recklessly in the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in
1989.
The agency affirmed Exxon's triple-A rating, but changed the outlook to
negative. This echoed an earlier move by Moody's, the other leading US
rating agency.
The jury verdict leaves Exxon open to an assessment for punitive damages of
up to Dollars 15bn, in addition to actual damages claimed of Dollars 1.5bn.
The company has argued it should not pay any punitive damages.
Exxon, with Royal Dutch/Shell, has long been seen as one of the strongest
credits in the energy industry.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Air France asked to speed up
sale of hotels chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government has asked Air France, the state-owned airline, to
re-open negotiations with bidders for a controlling stake in its Meridien
Hotels chain for a rapid conclusion of the sale.
The negotiations will be based on a report by France's privatisation
commission, an independent body which advises the government on the sale of
public sector assets, according to the economics ministry yesterday.
Forte, the UK hotels group, and Accor of France, are vying for control of
the Meridien, in which Air France holds a 57 per cent stake. A decision on
their bids was delayed in April and the dossier was sent to the
privatisation commission for its opinion.
The economics ministry said Mr Edmond Alphandery had recently received the
views of the privatisation commission on the relative merits of the two
bids.
The ministry said the report identified the questions which needed to be
discussed in greater detail with the bidders. However, it indicated that it
did not express an overall preference.
Once an agreement has been reached between Air France and the successful
bidder, the choice will be presented to the privatisation commission.
No deadline has been set.
Yesterday's announcement coincided with news that the Meridian hotels group
fell into a net loss of FFr29.7m (Dollars 5.3m) for 1993, compared with a
profit of FFr112m for 1992.
The battle for control of Meridien has become highly sensitive.
Forte's is the higher bid, valuing the luxury hotel chain at FFr1.8bn
compared with the FFr1.6bn offered by Accor and its partner, Prince
Al-Waleed Bin Talaal of Saudi Arabia.
Meridien's management has expressed a preference for the Forte bid, but
political pressure has been brought to bear to keep the hotels chain under
French control.
Forte yesterday welcomed the French government's call for the decision to be
taken quickly. It said that further delay could lead to Meridien managers
leaving and the chain losing contracts to manage hotels.
It said it expected to be given further details of the government
announcement in the next few days.
Air France, which suffered losses of FFr8.48bn last year, needs to raise
cash to reduce debts.

<TEXT>
NTT, the Japanese telecommunications company, and Microsoft, the US software
group, have agreed to co-operate in developing an interactive multimedia
system that could take Japan's ambitions in this area a step further towards
realisation.
Multimedia provides interactive text and video services to the home and
office.
The two companies are to develop the hardware and software, such as
video-on-demand, from both the supplier and customer ends.
The agreement follows a deal announced in March for the two companies to
develop a software distribution system. It brings together two of the most
powerful companies in their respective industries.
Under the deal, NTT will participate at the end of this year in an
interactive multimedia system being tested by Microsoft and TCI, the US
cable company.
Microsoft, in turn, will provide its multimedia system software for tests by
NTT, which will begin in 1995. The outcome of the joint development will be
used for these tests.
The interfaces the two companies will co-operate to develop could include
the links between the set-top box and telecommunications networks, the
server and networks, applications and set-top boxes, and the server and
service programmes, Microsoft said.
The set-top box is the hardware connected with the terminal, typically a
television set, to allow users to send and receive interactive information.
The server is a storage and processing unit that stores information such as
video, sound, voice and data and sends such information to users or receives
information back from users.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace and transport group, has been buying
Eurotunnel shares on the stock market.
Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, speaking at Bombardier's annual meeting, said
he regarded Eurotunnel's share price following the rights issue as highly
attractive. Bombardier would not reveal the size of its purchases.
'We may well buy more Eurotunnel shares in the near future, though we don't
have any specific target,' he said.
'We are convinced Eurotunnel shares will rally sharply as the Channel Tunnel
system comes into full operation in the next year and revenues build up. We
are confident the stock will prove an excellent investment for Bombardier
shareholders.'
Bombardier took delivery of 25m Eurotunnel shares following the completion
of the Eurotunnel rights issue as partial compensation for design changes
and cost over-runs on its Dollars 600m shuttlecar contract for the tunnel.
It also has received CDollars 157m (USDollars 120.7m) in cash.
However, it cannot sell any of the block of Eurotunnel shares until the last
shuttlecar is delivered next year.
Mr Beaudoin announced a 34 per cent increase in Bombardier profits for the
1994 first quarter and said the gain was indicative of results for the full
year.
Business is strong in all divisions from aerospace, transit equipment to
snowmobiles, watercraft and financial services. Losses on the transit
equipment side have been reduced and aircraft deliveries will total more
than 100 units this year.
Bombardier is close to approving plans to build a 70-seater regional jet. Mr
Beaudoin said the decision would be made before the end of the year.

unit

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Police yesterday seized documents from the Milan headquarters of Gaic, the
finance company controlled by Ferruzzi Finanziaria and the family of Mr
Camillo De Benedetti.
The move was ordered by Ravenna magistrates investigating the parallel
accounting and alleged illicit financial operations of the Ferruzzi group
that forced its collapse last June.
It is a potentially important development, in that part of their
investigation concerns the behaviour of Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank,
which was given a mandate to restructure the Ferruzzi group's L30,000bn
(Dollars 18.7bn) debts on June 4 1993.
Until a year ago, Gaic held a majority stake in Fondiaria, the insurance
group. The documents seized relate to a board meeting of June 29 1993, which
decided to raise L1,000bn for Fondiaria. Since Gaic lacked the funds to
subscribe to the issue, the capital move in effect removed Fondiaria from
Ferfin's control. The Ravenna magistrates are trying to establish at what
point Mediobanca was given full control over the Ferruzzi rescue, and the
role played by the merchant bank in the Fondiaria affair.
Executives at Mediobanca and three other banks involved in the Ferruzzi
rescue have been questioned as to whether they had prior knowledge the
group's accounts were false, concealing losses of L430bn.
All have denied improper banking conduct.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Nasdaq seeks partners to set up
European exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nasdaq, the US screen-based exchange which is the world's second largest
stock market by turnover, is holding talks with potential partners about
creating a pan-European exchange for small and medium-sized companies.
Mr Joseph Hardiman, Nasdaq president, said the new exchange could be formed
quite quickly, perhaps in the next 12 to 15 months. Nasdaq would seek to be
a minority shareholder, he said.
The potential participants included the European Venture Capital
Association, the UK-based City Group for Smaller Companies and several
European bourses, he said.
Before Nasdaq would commit itself, he said, 'we have to make sure there are
no overwhelming regulatory hurdles and we have to make sure there is a
critical mass of buyers of these securities'.
Mr Hardiman expressed disappointment that the London Stock Exchange had
rebuffed his suggestion that it become a participant. The LSE recently
announced its own plan to promote trading in shares of smaller companies in
the wake of its intended closure of the Unlisted Securities Market in early
1996.
Mr Michael Lawrence, the London exchange's chief executive, said: 'Our
proposals can, and will, be put into action speedily and without undue cost.
The case for a pan-European venture capital market is far from proved.'
Separately, Mr Jean-Francois Theodore, president of the Societe des Bourses
Francaises, confirmed that he is one of the parties in the Nasdaq
discussions.
Should the bourse participate in a pan-European exchange, it too would hope
to hold a minority stake.
The bourse said there was a particular need to provide an exchange for
companies for which the Paris unlisted securities market was inadequate but
for which full listing was not feasible.
'We are hoping to develop jointly a true international securities market,'
Mr Hardiman said, adding that the ability to trade its securities at 'all
hours' might be one of its attractions.
One possibility might include the opportunity for companies listed on the
exchange to be simultaneously listed on Nasdaq, if regulatory and other
requirements could be met.
Such a move would give guarantee companies who list on the new exchange
access to the US capital markets. While Nasdaq attributes much of its growth
to its specialisation in the shares of small, entrepreneurial high-growth
companies, it is not clear that a European version would be equally
successful.

<TEXT>
Louis Vuitton, the French luxury luggage manufacturer, is rationing
customers to one or two purchases at a time because of a surge in demand for
its products, Mr Yves Carcelle, chairman, said yesterday.
The company, part of the LVMH group, saw sales of more than FFr5bn (Dollars
890m) last year - an increase of more than 20 per cent on the year before.
New factories are under construction to meet the demand, which is
particularly strong from Japanese customers who buy up to half of the 2m
exclusive items a year.
The rationing means that customers visiting any of Louis Vuitton's 175 shops
around the world are being told politely they can only buy one or, for some
lines, two of an item.
Handbags are typically priced at Pounds 250-Pounds 400, while cabin trunks
are upwards of Pounds 4,000 (Dollars 6,080) apiece.
The rationing harks back to bullish era of the mid-1980s when Chanel, the
Paris fashion house, faced so much demand from Japanese tourists for its
classic quilted leather handbags that it limited them to one bag each. One
group of tourists was caught trying to bribe passers-by outside Chanel's
flagship store on Rue Cambon in Paris to persuade them to go in and buy more
bags from them.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Lotus enters the persuasion
market - The computer group is convinced it is taking the right path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is Lotus Development Corporation suffering one of those bouts of technical
gaucherie which overtakes every software house from time to time, or is its
predicament evidence of a deeper malaise?
If the latter, is it a local difficulty or one that is afflicting the entire
packaged software industry? There is growing speculation that Lotus's
troubles are harbingers of a wave of change which will reshape the global
packaged software industry.
Lotus warned on Monday that its quarterly earnings to the end of June were
likely to be only 20-25 cents a share compared with 34 cents a year ago and
analysts' expectations of nearly 50 cents.
The market reacted by marking the shares down Dollars 14 3/8 to Dollars 37,
some Dollars 50 off the peak for the year. It queried whether Lotus was
losing market share to Microsoft, its principal rival.
Lotus this week brazened it out, claiming that the slippage was a one
quarter issue, the result of delays in upgrades to a number of its software
products. The underlying strength of its communications products business
was not in doubt, it said.
Mr Ed Gillis, Lotus chief financial officer, said yesterday that software
houses find their sales boosted for the two quarters after new product
introductions. Lotus intended to launch six new products in July and August,
so he was confident of an improved financial performance in the later part
of the year.
It is a persuasive argument. Every software house experiences technological
difficulties which force them to delay or postpone products and upgrades. It
took Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company, five
years, for example, to bring a commercially successful version of 'Windows',
the best-selling graphical interface for its MS-Dos operating system, to
market.
According to Mr Gillis, the present delays are because of the complexities
of integrating suites or collections of programs so they interwork with one
another; a change to one program means further work on all the others.
Lotus, furthermore, seems to be an exception to the rule that software
houses are 'one product wonders' which cannot replicate early successes.
After making its reputation in the 1980s with the market leading spreadsheet
'1-2-3', it had a fallow period in terms of new, exciting products until the
past couple of years when 'Notes', software which makes it possibles for
groups of people to share information, began to find favour with large
organisations. Andersen Consulting has installed Notes worldwide and AT&amp;T
has formed a joint venture with Lotus to market Notes to a broader audience.
Notes is the undisputed leader in this 'workflow' software which now
accounts for 30 per cent of Lotus' Dollars 1bn revenues.
The larger threat, however, which applies to every software house, including
Microsoft, is pricing. The cost of packaged software is falling in a fashion
reminiscent of the collapse in computer hardware prices.
The pattern is evident in the US, where software publishers have taken the
lead in offering software at seemingly unprofitable prices. Borland
International, for example, cut the price of its spreadsheet to Dollars
49.99. It has since sold its spreadsheet product line to Novell.
A second approach, pioneered by Microsoft, has been to sell a bundle of
programs at a heavily discounted price.
Lotus is advertising a suite of five of its most popular programs for Pounds
299 (Dollars 454) (Pounds 199 to existing Lotus users), a price which one
analyst described as 'suicide'. One of the programs, 1-2-3, has a
recommended retail price in the Pounds 300 region.
Analysts believe that the trend to lower prices is inexorable and that
software houses must branch out into services, a tack now being adopted by
most hardware companies, if they are to maintain margins and survive. Mr
Gillis says Lotus is already moving in that direction with its Notes
workflow products. The decline in Lotus' share price over the past year
indicates that investors may not share his confidence.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Foster's joins Wheelock in China
brewing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foster's, the Australian brewery group, is joining forces with Wheelock, the
Hong Kong-based trading house, to make a push into the brewing business in
China.
The companies yesterday said evaluation of potential projects in the cities
of Tianjin, Wuhan and Chengdu had already started. They will spend a total
of USDollars 1bn over five years, if initial plans are fully implemented.
Foster's already has two joint ventures in Guangdong Province and Shanghai,
and said its own aims fit neatly with Wheelock's strategy, which centres on
the development of five 'regional hubs' - Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan,
Chengdu/Chongqing and Beijing/Tianjin.
In a recent internal reorganisation, Foster's elevated the importance of
Asian markets by creating a new Foster's Asia division. This incorporates
the existing Foster's China interests.
The decision by the Australian brewer to increase its focus on Asian
expansion opportunities comes as Foster's existing UK and North American
interests are suffering from sluggish demand and extremely competitive
conditions.
Yesterday, by contrast, Foster's pointed out that the beer market in China
grew by about 23m hectolitres in 1993, to around 123m hectolitres  - making
it the world's second-largest beer market after the US and easily surpassing
the Australian beer market of 17m hectolitres.
It also pointed out that the Chinese brewing industry remains fragmented,
with more than 800 breweries, only 10 of which produce more than 1m
hectolitres and none more than 2.5m hectolitres.
The move marks Wheelock's first foray into brewing. Mr John Hung, executive
director, said the group had been looking into the brewery business because
of its potential in China, and that Foster's geographical targets - in the
regional hubs of Tianjin, Wuhan and Chengdu - coincide with Wheelock's own
strategic plans for the mainland. Less than 10 per cent of Wheelock's assets
are in China, but there are plans to increase this to a maximum of 20 per
cent.
The venture will marry Foster's brewery skills with Wheelock's China
know-how and expertise in property development expertise.
Mr Hung said: 'Wheelock has always been the party, in any joint venture,
that brings to the table a number of things: local knowledge, financial
strength, corporate muscle in Hong Kong and China connections, and will help
seek sites.'
The market leader is Tsingtao, the local brewer whose shares are traded in
Hong Kong. However, foreign brands are jockeying for market share.

<TEXT>
Tetra Laval, the leading Swedish packaging group, yesterday announced a
shake-up of senior management following the sudden departure of Mr Uno
Kjellberg as chief executive of the group's biggest division, Tetra Pak.
Tetra Laval said Mr Kjellberg was quitting due to differences with the group
board over strategies at Tetra Pak, which makes systems for liquid food
processing, packaging and distribution.
The privately-owned group gave no further details on the decision. 'We
cannot go into details without revealing information about our future
strategies to our competitors,' the company said.
It said Mr Gunnar Brock, head of Alfa Laval, which makes packaging
machinery, would succeed Mr Kjellberg at Tetra Pak. Mr Lars Hallden, Tetra
Laval group chief executive, would head Alfa Laval until a new chief
executive was appointed.
The shake-up was the first sign of differences at the top level since Tetra
Laval was created when Tetra Pak, owned by the Rausing family, acquired Alfa
Laval for Dollars 2.5bn in 1991 in Sweden's biggest-ever takeover deal.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft HQ for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the heavily-indebted German metals, mining and
industrial group, has entered negotiations to sell its headquarters site in
the centre of Frankfurt.
The site could have a market value of DM750m (Dollars 469m),
Metallgesellschaft said, but cautioned that not all the proceeds would flow
to the company as the land is jointly owned with a company controlled by
Dresdner Bank.
The group said it had entered into negotiations to sell the land as it made
no business sense to have administrative offices, a car park and research
laboratories on such a valuable site. The move follows the sale last week of
its 80 per cent stake in its Buderus engineering subsidiary which raised
DM1.2bn.
The disposal of the Buderus stake, together with the planned sale of the
land and of other subsidiaries, come against the background of continuing
business problems at MG Corp, the New York-based trading subsidiary of the
German group whose speculative trading in oil derivatives brought
Metallgesellschaft to the brink of collapse in January.
MG Corp was still a 'machine for losing money,' Metallgesellschaft's
chairman Mr Kajo Neukirchen warned yesterday.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Salary boost for Thorn head
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jim Fifield, head of Thorn EMI's music business, is guaranteed to see his
basic salary rise from Dollars 3m this year to Dollars 3.5m in April, 1996,
and to Dollars 4m in April, 1999.
The guarantee is contained in Mr Fifield's service contract, one of the most
complex and generous ever awarded to an executive director of a UK public
company.
It emerged on Tuesday that Mr Fifield last year trebled the worth of his
total pay to about Pounds 13.5m.
This included a Pounds 5.046m performance-related bonus, of which Pounds
1.5m was paid in ordinary shares. The details came from Thorn EMI's annual
report.
A summary of Mr Fifield's service contract states that his compensation
package is 'to be more than that paid to the next highest paid employee of
EMI Music.' Other contractural benefits include:
A bonus of up to 50 per cent of base salary, paid in cash, if certain sales
and profit performance criteria are meet and another bonus based on EMI's
market share in Europe and the US.
An entitlement to share options totalling 300,000 in the three-year period
from April 1, 1993, and thereafter on a basis no less favourable than other
Thorn EMI music executives.
A Change in Control clause entitling Mr Fifield to a substantial payoff if
he terminates his contract in the event of a takeover of EMI or Thorn EMI.
He is guaranteed 36 months notice in the event of termination of his
contract by the company.

FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Aer Lingus lays off 850 staff as
dispute continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE

<TEXT>
Team Aer Lingus, the aircraft maintenance division of Aer Lingus, the Irish
state airline, yesterday laid off more than 40 per cent of its workforce,
amounting to 850 of its 2,000 employees, as trade unions warned that the
dispute over pay and staffing cuts could spread through the whole airline.
The division has been losing IPounds 1m (Pounds 980,000) a month and
currently has no heavy maintenance contracts as airlines have transferred
business elsewhere over concerns that the simmering dispute would leave
their air-craft stranded in Aer Lingus maintenance hangars.
Earlier this week craft unions rejected a rescue package for the subsidiary
recommended by the Labour Relations Court, arguing that their own proposals
to return the company to commercial viability had not been considered by the
management or the LRC.
The LRC recommended a pay freeze until July 1996, rather than pay cuts
sought by the management.
Backbenchers of the Labour party, which forms part of the coalition
government, yesterday criticised Aer Lingus for its handling of the dispute.
The government, however, has backed the management and recommended
acceptance of the LRC proposals. Senior politicians are to question Aer
Lingus today on the dispute in a special Dail sub-committee hearing convened
at the request of the unions.
Mr Dennis Smith, chief negotiator for the craft unions, said that strike
action was not planned for the time being, but Siptu, one of the trade
unions involved in the dispute, said yesterday that if non-union labour was
taken on while staff were laid off 'there certainly will be a reaction'.
The government and Aer Lingus are meanwhile facing pressure from another
direction. Aeroflot, the Russian airline, is to begin non-stop flights from
Russia to the US this summer as new long-range aircraft come into service,
bypassing the refuelling stop at Shannon in the west of Ireland.
It has offered to continue the Shannon stopover if passengers from other CIS
airlines can transfer to Aeroflot there. But the government and Aer Lingus
are opposed to this as it is seen as a threat to Aer Lingus' transatlantic
business.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: FT-Actuaries World Index
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At its last quarterly meeting, the FT-Actuaries World Index Policy Committee
decided that Thailand and Brazil should be added to the World Indices with
effect from October 1 1994, subject to satisfactory resolution of several
outstanding technical issues.
Users of the World Indices are invited to contact the compilers (below)
detailing any factors they would wish to be considered before the
calculation of these new country indices.
Other stock markets that may comply fully with the Construction and
Maintenance Rules of the World Index will be added as fast as practicable.
The Committee does not intend to change its policy regarding the inclusion
of 'emerging' markets in the daily calculation of the World Index for the
time being, since it does not wish to introduce a second, less demanding set
of rules for countries which cannot meet current World Index criteria.
In response to recent changes in investment patterns, publication in the FT
of the World Ex-South Africa index will cease at the same time that Brazil
and Thailand are added to FT-AWI.
In addition, the North America index will be renamed Americas and will
consist of the US, Canada, Mexico and Brazil. The Mexico index will then be
based on the most up-to-date prices, rather than on prices taken one day in
arrears as is currently the case.
A clarification of the wording of the guidelines falling within Section II
of the Construction and Maintenance Rules has been proposed by the Committee
with effect from October 1 1994, subject to confirmation at the next
meeting:
'When a government is a holder of shares but either the shares are not
listed or the government is constrained through requiring legislation before
being able to sell them then a weighting factor will be applied.'
Changes to the Construction and Maintenance Rules are announced after the
quarterly meeting at which they are agreed, but will not be put into effect
until after they have been confirmed at the following quarterly meeting, in
order to allow for comment.
There are no quarterly changes to current FT-AWI constituents. A list of
constituent changes to the FT-AWI Large Cap and FT-AWI Medium-Small Cap
Indices as a result of the half-yearly rebalance will be available from
NatWest Securities Limited and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co on July 5 1994. The
changes will be effective July 15 1994.
The FT-Actuaries World Indices are jointly compiled by The Financial Times
Limited, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, and NatWest Securities Limited in conjunction
with the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
All enquiries should be made to Symon Bradford, NatWest Securities Limited,
on 031-243-4258 or to Barbara Mueller, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, on
0101-212-902-6777.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: King &amp; Shaxson declines 17% to Pounds 2.6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An initial Pounds 2.46m from Greig Middleton Holdings, the recently-acquired
stockbroking firm, contributed the bulk of pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.6m at
King &amp; Shaxson Holdings for the year ended April 30.
The result, however, was 17 per cent lower than the previous year's restated
Pounds 3.15m.
After-tax profits of the financial services group slipped 10 per cent to
Pounds 1.7m, and earnings per share came to 9.8p (11p). A recommended final
dividend of 5p makes an unchanged total of 9p.
Mr David Pearce, chairman, said the discount house had an unsatisfactory
year with operating losses of Pounds 113,000 against an 'exceptional' profit
of Pounds 2.59m. Profits from money broking dropped from Pounds 971,000 to
Pounds 781,000 while there was a Pounds 152,000 loss from futures
management.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wagon slips less than expected to Pounds
15.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Wagon Industrial Holdings last year declined less than
the materials handling, engineering and automotive products group had
predicted as productivity rose and trading conditions improved in the UK and
continental Europe.
In the 12 months to March 31, pre-tax profits were Pounds 15.6m, against
Pounds 18.1m. The group last June warned that its results would be similar
to those of the previous year before meeting restructuring costs of Pounds
3m at Forkhardt, its German power chuck subsidiary.
Although earnings per share dipped from 29p to 19.58p, the dividend is
slightly increased and only just covered; the final is 11.5p, making a total
of 17.825p (17.308p).
Wagon would like to have the dividend twice covered by the end of the next
financial year. That implies an increase in profits over two years of 33 per
cent.
There has been a strong start to this year, reported Mr John Hudson, chief
executive. Trading conditions started to improve last year. 'The important
thing was an acceleration of the improvement towards the end of the year,
which is exactly the opposite of the previous year,' he said.
Turnover was Pounds 279.9m, of which Pounds 9.07m came from acquisitions,
against Pounds 247.6m. But operating profits, largely because of Forkhardt,
fell from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 14.7m.
In the automotive division, where recently Wagon has been concentrating its
expansion, operating profits fell while turnover increased. This reflected a
tailing-off of profits in France. But, said Mr Hudson, 'we see the
automotive division being our strongest division this year'.
COMMENT
Wagon rode the UK recession with aplomb. Everything it might have done it
did: kept cash in the bank, reorganised management, raised productivity,
made acquisitions to build up market position. It was Europe which made it
look more ordinary: takeover of Polypal in Belgium only to see the markets
tumble, capacity at Forkhardt far too high for reduced demand. Last year it
grasped the European nettles. Manufacturing sites for materials handling
equipment have been concentrated and Forkhardt is back in profit, albeit
small. With its European markets starting to bounce back and demand in the
UK rising, recovery should be swift enough to justify the company broker's
prediction of Pounds 22m pre-tax and earnings per share of 30.8p for the
current year. On a price, up 3p yesterday, of 479p, that would put the
shares on an unchallenging prospective multiple of 15.5.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: New stores and organic growth boost
Carpetright to Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carpetright, Sir Philip Harris's carpet retail chain, yesterday announced a
79 per cent jump in profits for its first full year as a public company.
The pre-tax return rose from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 14m for the year to April
30 on sales ahead 40 per cent to Pounds 110.4m (Pounds 78.6m).
Sir Philip, chairman and chief executive, said the profits performance was
satisfactory against a background of stable prices.
The improvement was due both to the addition of new stores and organic
growth, with like-for-like sales ahead 16 per cent in the year. Sir Philip
implied that the rate of sales growth had slowed in the first few weeks of
the current year. 'We would be very happy if we get that again', he said.
The housing market remained flat and any substantial improvement in prices
was not expected.
Sir Philip was confident, however, that Carpetright would generate
substantial growth through net margin improvements and its increased share
of the UK carpet market.
Since flotation in June operating margins had risen from 9.5 per cent to
12.2 per cent and market share had risen from 6 per cent to 9 per cent. Sir
Philip said his ambition was for a 20 per cent share with 250 outlets.
Carpetright opened 31 new stores in the year, taking the total to 149. A
further 26 stores are scheduled to open this year. The group ended the year
with cash of Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 8m).
There is a final dividend of 4.3p, for a total of 7p. This compared with
1.23p, adjusted for the capitalisation issue. Earnings were 12p (6.25p).
COMMENT
The impressive performance in the first year may be hard to sustain in the
longer-term, given the glaring absence of any substantial recovery in the
housing market. Yet Carpetright is generating cash - some Pounds 6m in the
current half - which should help fund the aggressive expansion programme and
give comfort on the thin dividend cover. Forecasts are for profits of Pounds
19m this year, for a prospective p/e of 15. This is not aggressively priced,
but the share performance may be constrained by concerns over whether the
company's strategy can be sustained.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hardys &amp; Hansons rises by 10% to Pounds
3.66m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hardys &amp; Hansons, the Nottingham-based independent brewer, yesterday
reported a 10 per cent increase in interim profits.
On turnover marginally ahead to Pounds 15.6m, trading profits advanced to
Pounds 3.35m (Pounds 2.94m); after reduced net interest receivable of Pounds
292,000 (Pounds 338,000) the pre-tax line for the half year to April 1
amounted to Pounds 3.66m, up from Pounds 3.32m last time.
Mr Richard Hanson, chairman and managing director, attributed the 'very
satisfactory' improvement to the contribution from new or recently
modernised houses.
The outcome was also aided, he added, by an early Easter with sales in the
run-up to the holiday falling in the first half.
The interim dividend is raised 13 per cent, from 3p to 3.4p, payable from
earnings of 9.827p per share, compared with 8.975p.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank explains 3i decision - Company
will realise Pounds 52m net profit from sale of entire holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank of Scotland's chief executive, yesterday
explained the bank's decision to dispose of all its 7.3 per cent stake in
3i, the investment trust company which was floated yesterday by the high
street banks.
Royal Bank, one of seven banks which owned 3i jointly with the Bank of
England before the offer of Pounds 711m of its equity yesterday, was the
only bank to dispose of its entire stake. In contrast, Bank of Scotland did
not sell any of its existing stake.
National Westminster Bank will retain the highest stake of the banks, with
its stake falling to 17.94 per cent compared with the previous 22.9 per
cent. All the stakes were diluted by a Pounds 288m rights issue element of
the flotation.
Sir George Russell, 3i chairman, said that NatWest wanted to be a 'major and
long-term shareholder, which we certainly welcome'. The bank said that it
viewed 3i as a good company which it wanted to retain as a long-term
investment.
Mr Mathewson said that Royal Bank had sold its stake in a placement because
the rights dilution of its stake would have prevented it from continuing to
equity account the holding, and so include rises in 3i's net assets in
profits.
He said that after deducting the already accounted rises in 3i's net assets,
Royal Bank would be left with a net profit of Pounds 52m from its sale. This
would be taken as an exceptional item in the second half of its financial
year.
Mr Mathewson said that Royal Bank had decided to sell its stake immediately
rather than 'leak it out in little bits', because although 3i was a good
company, 'we are not in the business of outguessing the equity market'.
He emphasised that the raising of extra capital had no strategic
implications for the bank, which indicated its interest in buying a building
society. 'This has no broader tactical implications whatsoever,' he said.
The banks have agreed not to sell any further part of their remaining stakes
within a year without the agreement of Baring Brothers, the merchant bank
sponsoring the issue. Any bank selling more equity will consult the others
first.
Mr Hugh Young, general manager of Bank of Scotland, said the bank's stake
had fallen to 2.47 per cent from 3.02 per cent because of dilution. It had
never equity accounted its stake, taking only 3i dividends into profits.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: BTP jumps 48% to Pounds 30.3m - Speedy
input from MTM purchase and good start to current year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTP, the speciality chemicals group which paid Pounds 106.7m for most of
MTM's assets a year ago, beat City expectations with a 48 per cent jump in
annual pre-tax profits, from Pounds 20.5m to Pounds 30.3m.
Earnings per share of 15.8p (12.7p) topped the previous record of 15.4p set
in 1991.
Mr Frank Buckley, chairman, described the figures for the 12 months to March
31 as 'not a bad performance' considering that most of the group's markets
were in recession for a large part of the year. 'The results from the MTM
acquisition have come through more quickly than the market anticipated.'
The shares rose 8 1/2 p to 309 1/2 p, helped by Mr Buckley's comments on
trading: 'There has been an encouraging start to the current year and there
are positive signs that the recessionary conditions experienced in a number
of our markets are now behind us.'
The MTM assets contributed profits of Pounds 7.76m in nine months on sales
of Pounds 56.8m out of total group turnover up Pounds 81m at Pounds 289.8m.
US operations had performed 'very much better than expected'. BTP introduced
some of its biocides, leather and textiles chemicals into the MTM plants in
the US, replacing UK imports which attract duty of more than 16 per cent.
US sales were also boosted by BTP's new industrial biocide in the last
quarter. Annual growth in the global industrial biocide market is about 15
per cent, largely due to environmental pressures.
Profits from biocides and fine chemicals jumped to Pounds 12m (Pounds
4.84m), including Pounds 5.35m from the MTM assets. Sales more than doubled
to Pounds 81.1m.
Performance chemicals, which includes tanning products, contributed Pounds
8.4m (Pounds 5.79m). The mainly UK-based industrial division turned in
Pounds 6.63m (Pounds 4.21m) but adhesives and textile coatings slipped to
Pounds 5.66m (Pounds 6.49m).
A 6.55p final dividend gives a 10p (9.3p) total, covered 1.6 times. Mr
Buckley said the long-term aim was for dividends to be twice covered by
earnings.
COMMENT
Shareholders who supported last year's rights issue at 185p have been well
rewarded for their faith. The MTM deal has paid off as predicted, giving BTP
under-used capacity almost tailor-made for its needs. The full benefits are
yet to come and combined with strong growth in areas such as industrial
biocides and recovery in other markets BTP looks well-placed for the next
couple of years. Assuming profits of about Pounds 39m this year, the shares
are trading on 16 times forward earnings. Not expensive for the sector and
there is a yield of 4 per cent.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Redland floats Belgian arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Benelux brick interests of Redland, one of Britain's biggest building
materials companies, have been floated on the Belgian bourse with a
valuation of BFr8.2bn (Pounds 161m).
The flotation raised about BFr1.5bn, which will be used to pay off debt
incurred in expanding the business.
Redland said that its beneficial interest in the company, which has been
renamed Terca Brick Industries, had been reduced to 35 per cent.
The Benelux interests were known as Redland Koramic Bricks, jointly owned by
Redland and Koramic, a privately owned Belgian industrial group.
Last April Redland Koramic merged with the brick interests of Van Biervliet,
also a privately owned Belgian group, reducing Redland's interest to 42 per
cent.
Terca will have annual turnover of Pounds 135m and produce more than 1bn
facing bricks a year from 25 sites in the Netherlands, Belgium, France and
Germany.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Emap bids for Trans World
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap yesterday launched its expected 181p a share hostile bid for Trans
World Communications, the local radio group where it owns or has agreement
to buy 51.7 per cent of the shares.
The bid, which values Trans World at Pounds 70.8m, follows the agreement by
Mr Owen Oyston to sell his 22 per cent stake to Emap at the offer price.
Mr Robin Miller, Emap's chief executive, said the final cash offer
represented a 'generous' price for Trans World. It is pitched at 58 times
last year's earnings and 5.3 times turnover, both higher than any previous
deal in the sector.
However, earlier this week the Trans World board declined to recommend such
an offer, arguing that the price was too low and that the bid could face
legal problems.
This is because a full takeover would breach the legal limit on the number
and size of commercial radio licences that can be held by one company.
However, Emap plans to sell two of its licences to a joint venture with
merchant bank Schroders, which the Radio Authority has said would comply
with relevant legislation.
The authority has reconfirmed its position following an announcement by the
Guardian Media Group, which owns 20 per cent of Trans World, that it intends
to ask for a judicial review of the decision.
Mr Miller said:'We have no idea whether they will get leave to proceed or
what the timetable would be, but meanwhile the offer goes ahead.'
Emap said the acquisition would ehance its earnings per share in the first
full financial year of ownership.
Trans World shares added 2p to 175p.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel take-up may be 'adequate'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 3pm deadline for Eurotunnel's Pounds 858m rights issue passed yesterday
with the shares still weak, but underwriters expressing confidence in the
likely level of take-up.
Figures for the UK-listed portion of the issue, representing 25 per cent of
Eurotunnel shares, will be released today. Analysts suggest that between 10
and 20 per cent of the UK shares may not be taken up.
Shareholders were offered new units on a 3-for-5 basis at 265p, which
compared with the price of 275p at 3pm. The shares rose at the end of
trading and closed at 279p. Having maintained a 10p premium, underwriters
expect the response to be 'adequate'.
The more significant figure, acceptances from the 75 per cent of bearer
shares traded (and primarily owned) in France, will not emerge until the end
of next week, but the figures should be better.
One underwriter expressed confidence in the heavy trading in the nil paid
bearer shares, since buyers would be almost certain to take up rights
shares. Under the French system, investors who take no action lose their
rights.
For Eurotunnel itself, the take-up makes little difference. It has raised
its money and is adamant this is the last rights issue. Its only concern is
that its warrants are converted.
Next year the company is anticipating revenues of Pounds 198m from warrant
conversions. Following the decline in its share price, the shares are at
least 10 per cent below the likely adjusted conversion price for the 1993
warrants (the largest tranche), and conversion cannot be automatically
assumed.
This underlines the still precarious nature of Eurotunnel's finances, until
it can demonstrate real traffic flows at least in line with projections.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Shanks &amp; McEwan cuts dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, yesterday cut its dividend by
43 per cent and warned that uncertainty over government plans for bans on
imported hazardous waste could lead to further disappointment in its Rechem
business.
Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, was announcing the group's plunge into the red
with pre-tax losses of Pounds 6m (Pounds 10.2m profits) for the year to
March 26. The swing into loss was the result of a Pounds 20m exceptional
charge, which was flagged in a letter to shareholders in March, for losses
on construction contracts and rationalisation.
Sales were down by 9 per cent to Pounds 120m, largely due to declines in the
construction division and Rechem, the hazardous waste business.
Mr Waddell said Rechem's results had been disappointing, with lower waste
tonnages and technical problems in the plants. This division would continue
to be plagued by uncertainty until it became clear whether the government
would ban imports of hazardous waste.
The UK incineration industry faces a difficult period over the next few
years. Currently the government can ban hazardous waste imports, on which
the group increasingly relies for revenue, but regulations to stop the
dumping of treated hazardous waste into landfill sites are not expected for
some time.
The dumping ban is widely expected to prompt a surge in demand for
incineration.
Mr Waddell welcomed a recent government comment that incineration of
imported waste could continue in limited quantities for up to three years.
This was not enough, however. 'Until we get some clarity, we are in serious
trouble,' he said.
To reflect this uncertainty, the final dividend is cut from 3.44p to 1p, for
a total of 3.24p (5.68p). Losses per share were 5p against earnings of 4.1p
last time.
The other businesses were doing well, Mr Waddell said. The solid waste
division had pushed through price increases of up to 15 per cent in the
south of England without any reduction in volume.
COMMENT
Mr Waddell's blunt warning on the regulatory risks surrounding the high
margin hazardous waste business overshadows a further problem - volumes are
falling as well. While this may be offset by rationalisation and an improved
performance from landfill and construction, the shares will almost certainly
reflect the above difficulties. Forecasts are equally uncertain, ranging
from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 19m for this year. A prospective multiple of
12.5 on the most optimistic forecast might just attract high risk/high
reward investors.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Reduced deficit at ERF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERF (Holdings), the truck maker, returned to profitability in the second
half of last year for the first time since the UK truck market collapsed
into recession in 1990.
However, it was not sufficient to offset the first-half loss and for the
full year to April 2 there were pre-tax losses of Pounds 26,000, compared
with Pounds 4.12m.
Mr Peter Foden, chairman, said ERF had begun recruiting more workers to
allow a 40 per cent rise in output rates over the next three months.
The increase is mainly to cater for rising demand in the UK, where the truck
market is firmly into recovery after its steepest decline since the second
world war. Output is to rise from 10 to 11 trucks a day to 15, with the
workforce increasing by nearly 100 to 840.
Prospects for continental markets were likely to remain bleak until next
year, said Mr Foden.
However, ERF expects to receive a boost from the changed political situation
in South Africa, where it has an assembly plant. ERF is predicting a rise in
demand there of 50 per cent over the next 12 to 18 months.
The Cheshire-based company, the UK's last remaining publicly quoted truck
maker, made a profit of Pounds 453,000, after interest payments, in the
second half.
For the full year, losses per share were cut to 4.98p (46.25p) while the
proposed final dividend is held at 2p.
Gearing was reduced to 44.7 per cent at the year end after peaking at nearly
60 per cent half-way. The latter figure was inflated, however, by the Pounds
2.5m cost of launching new trucks designed for continental Europe and the
setting up of a network to sell them. These costs were treated as an
exceptional item last time. But the venture could hardly have been worse
timed, with continental truck markets declining sharply last year. ERF sold
only about 50 trucks on the Continent but in the next few years hopes to
capture 1 to 2 per cent of the region's heavy truck market, representing up
to 1,000 trucks a year.
Turnover rose by 34 per cent to Pounds 149.5m (Pounds 111.7m) with unit
sales 20 per cent up at 2,339 (1,942). There was exceptionally high pressure
on profit margins as continental truck makers discounted heavily, said Mr
Foden.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Standard Life diversifies into health
insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, is to diversify into
health insurance with the purchase of Prime Health from Municipal Mutual,
the local authority-owned insurance company, for an undisclosed amount,
writes Alison Smith.
Prime Health policies cover some 250,000 people. Last year it had gross
premium income of Pounds 54m making it the fifth largest health insurer in
the UK.
The move is Standard Life's first venture outside life and pensions
policies. Mr Scott Bell, managing director, said the acquisition would allow
the group to move quickly ahead in the rapidly growing health insurance
market.
Standard Life will lose an important element of its UK distribution next
year, when Halifax Building Society ends its agreement to sell Standard Life
policies and sets up its own life subsidiary.
Prime Health is the latest in a string of subsidiaries to have been sold off
by MMI, which transferred most of its continuing local authority business to
Zurich Insurance.

FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Allen expands as profits double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allen, the construction and property development group, yesterday announced
the acquisition of DJ Ryan &amp; Sons, a cable laying, civil engineering and
building contracting business, for about Pounds 6.9m, to be financed by the
issue of 4.34m shares.
The Wigan-based group also reported a doubling of pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 3.05m, on turnover up 23 per cent, from Pounds 51m to
Pounds 62.7m, in the year to April 3.
The group ended a two-year dividend freeze, recommending an increased final
of 3.6p for a total of 5.25p (5p). Earnings per share rose from 5.05p to
8.67p.
Gearing at the year-end was 16.7 per cent, against 38.8 per cent last time.
Mr Donald Greenhalgh, chairman, said that house completions, which had risen
from 208 to 305 over the period, were expected to rise by some 25 to 30 per
cent in the current year.
The acquisition issue will represent 14 per cent of the enlarged share
capital. Some 2.55m shares are to be placed at 150p apiece. Of the balance
of 1.79m shares, Ryan has agreed to retain 1.2m for one year.
Ryan, based in Preston, Lancashire, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.02m
on sales of Pounds 34.8m in the year to March 31. At that date its net asset
value was Pounds 3.6m.
Mr Greenhalgh said the acquisition would allow Allen to expand into a
related market in the north-west.
Ryan has fixed-term contracts with British Gas, with which it has a 26-year
relationship, as well as North West Water and Severn Trent to lay, replace
and repair gas and water pipes.
The company recently won its first contract to lay cables in the UK for
Nynex, the east coast US telecommunications group.
After completion of the acquisition by Allen, Ryan's building contracting
and housebuilding divisions will be sold.

FT  23 JUN 94 / AT&amp;T enters European alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the largest US tele-communications operator, will today announce an
alliance with Unisource, the joint venture between the Dutch, Swedish and
Swiss national telecommunications groups. The deal is the third and
potentially most far-reaching of the recent alliances between US and
European telecoms groups.
Unisource will become the European arm of Worldsource, AT&amp;T's international
venture launched last year to provide one-stop telecoms services for
multinationals. AT&amp;T has enlisted several Asia-Pacific operators for
Worldsource, but until now lacked a European partner.
Last week the state telecoms operators of France and Germany signed a
Dollars 4.2bn (Pounds 2.8bn) alliance with Sprint, the third-largest US
long-distance operator. Also, British Telecommunications gained US
regulatory approval for its Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, the
second-largest US operator.
All three alliances are geared to providing one-stop telecoms services to
multinationals, a market expected to grow rapidly with the opening of
Europe's telecoms services industry to competition.
An industry source said: 'Last week's Sprint deal forced AT&amp;T to stop
dithering. It believes it is in danger of missing the European boat
entirely.'
The tie-up between AT&amp;T and Unisource is expected to be much looser than
those between the other two US-European groups.
Unlike MCI and Sprint, AT&amp;T is larger than its European partners, and the
deal is not expected to involve any exchange of cash or equity. It may not
be exclusive, although Unisource will agree to market AT&amp;T-branded services
in Europe.
For AT&amp;T, the deal follows a year of painful negotiations to find a European
partner. Until late last year it was negotiating with Deutsche Telekom and
France Telecom; however, problems about the shape of an alliance, and fears
of regulatory barriers are believed to have scuppered the talks.
Although it comprises three of Europe's smaller operators, Unisource has
made an impact in the multinational corporate market. Earlier this year it
bid successfully with AT&amp;T to provide telecoms facilities for more than 30
European multinationals.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Head of Kidder Peabody replaced by GE
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric yesterday replaced Mr Michael Carpenter as chairman and
chief executive of Kidder Peabody, its troubled securities subsidiary, in a
move intended to shore up sagging confidence in the firm on Wall Street.
Mr Dennis Dammerman, GE's finance director, has taken over full-time
management of the firm. GE also created the additional post of president and
chief operating officer at the securities company for Mr Denis Nayden, an
executive vice president at GE Capital, the group's financial services arm.
Mr Welch said the management changes had been made to restore confidence in
Kidder, which had been hit by reports of financial difficulties and
questions over GE's support for the business. He added that the firm had
lost Dollars 30m on its mortgage-backed securities business since the end of
March, a figure which is lower than most rival dealers had speculated.
Kidder was rocked by the discovery two months ago of what it says were
fictitious profits of Dollars 350m created by the head of its government
bond trading desk. The trader, Mr Joseph Jett, has said that he acted under
instruction from senior Kidder executives.
More recently, Wall Street's attention has switched to Kidder's involvement
in the mortgage-backed bonds market, where it is the leading firm. These
bonds have fallen further than US government bonds during the recent
downturn in the fixed income markets.
Mr Welch said that Mr Carpenter's resignation was not directly linked to
either issue. However, he said that Kidder was beginning to lose business as
reports spread that it was in difficulties, prompting GE to take action now.
'Kidder's fundamentals are strong and we intend to provide whatever
financial and human resources are appropriate for the firm to realise its
potential,' Mr Welch said.
GE called Mr Dammerman's involvement at Kidder 'a transition role', and said
that Mr Nayden would eventually take over the top job at Kidder.
The management shake-up at Kidder comes two months after Mr Welch expressed
confidence in Mr Carpenter and his management team in the wake of the
phantom profits scheme.
The company came close to selling Kidder two years ago, and the recent
troubles have led to speculation that it may try again to dispose of the
business.

FT  23 JUN 94 / ICI picks outsider as chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries, the bulk chemicals company demerged from the
old ICI a year ago, has underlined its break with the past by appointing an
outsider as chief executive.
Mr Charles Miller Smith, an accountant, will join ICI from the Anglo-Dutch
consumer products group Unilever. A former finance director, he now runs its
food operations in southern Europe. He will take over next April on the
retirement of Sir Denys Henderson as chairman. Sir Denys will be succeeded
by the present chief executive, Mr Ronnie Hampel.
The appointment of an outsider to such a senior post in ICI is thought to be
unprecedented. The finance director, Mr Colin Short, was brought in from the
US oil company Chevron in 1990. However, Mr Miller Smith will be in
day-to-day charge of ICI, as Mr Hampel's job as chairman will be part-time.
In the old ICI, the tradition was for the top job to be contested by rival
barons from the operating divisions. However, the demerger and retirements
have largely swept away the old guard. Besides Sir Denys, Mr Hampel and Mr
Short, the members of the slimmed-down executive board are all recent
arrivals, and most are under 50.
Mr Miller Smith, 54, is thought to have been an unsuccessful candidate last
year for the chief executive's job at Barclays Bank, which went to Mr Martin
Taylor of Courtaulds. In December he was pipped for the job of chairman
elect at Unilever by Mr Niall Fitzgerald. His present job at Unilever
involves running a business with a turnover of some Pounds 4bn, about half
the size of ICI.
ICI described Mr Miller Smith yesterday as 'somebody different' from most
other ICI directors. However, there are points in common. He has worked in
Unilever's speciality chemicals division and spent time abroad, in India and
the Netherlands. Like Sir Denys and other ICI bosses, he is Scottish. He has
also been a non-executive member of the ICI board for the past year.
Nevertheless, the appointment is seen as signalling the company's desire to
shake up its traditional culture.
Mr Miller Smith might be expected to succeed Mr Hampel, 62, as chairman on
his retirement in about three years' time.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Rocky road offers no respite for bonds: A continuing bear
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bond fund managers have had a rough ride in the first half of this year, and
the second half is shaping up to be just as difficult.
Most investors expected last year's bull run to continue, fuelled by further
cuts in European short-term interest rates and low-inflation economic
growth. Instead, government bond markets have experienced a collapse in
sentiment which has pushed up nominal 10-year yields in Europe by between
170 and 250 basis points since the end of 1993. Reversing last year's
convergence trend, yields have diverged sharply, with the higher-yielding
markets worst hit.
The yield spread of the UK 10-year gilt over the German bund has widened to
about 150 basis points, from 41 at the start of the year; the French spread
has expanded to plus 62 from minus 9; and the Italian yield premium has
jumped to more than 350 from 256 in April.
The sell-off began early in the year, when hedge funds and other highly
leveraged players took profits, offloading massive bond holdings. When on
February 4 the US Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates, this
signalled the end of the low interest rate era and inflation fears prompted
further selling.
Since then every piece of data showing strong growth in the US economy and
recovery in Europe has triggered further falls in the bond markets. Rising
commodity and oil prices have further fuelled fears of inflation.
In this bearish environment, most bond funds have put in a sorry
performance. According to Micropal, the fund performance measurement
service, 96 UK-based global bond funds posted an average loss of 6.4 per
cent in the first five months of the year, with performances ranging between
plus 5.2 per cent and minus 15.8 per cent.
So, what now? 'Judging by the fundamentals, with low inflation and low
interest rates, bonds everywhere look extremely cheap,' says Mr John
Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. 'Yet we have been
saying that for three months now and they are still getting cheaper by the
day.' After getting their fingers burnt, ling markets, most investors have
embarked on a 'buyers' strike' and are refusing to take on new positions.
Many say the markets' inflation paranoia is overdone. They point to the
current benign environment - with inflation rates in the US, Germany and the
UK at or below 3 per cent - and to forecasts that inflation will remain
subdued for the rest of 1994. Yet bond markets continue to fall, and implied
future interest rates in the money markets indicate that dealers expect
European interest rates to rise before the end of the year.
But while inflation fears and other perceived risks may have contributed to
the rise in nominal yields, 'the key is the rise in real yields', says Mr
Shepperd.
Real yields - over and above inflation - have risen to about 4 per cent in
the UK from 2.9 per cent at beginning of the year. The main reason is a
sharp increase in supply: investors offloading their bond holdings,
financial institutions offsetting losses in their marketmaking and
proprietary trading activities, and, most importantly, government issues to
finance large budget deficits.
Real yields have also been driven higher by the pick-up in world economic
growth. Capital will be needed to fuel that growth, and there is talk of an
impending global capital shortage.
What is more, 'there has been a sea change in the international economic
policy environment', says Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in
London. 'Governments' commitment to keeping inflation down, rather than
stimulate growth to reduce unemployment, is being doubted.'
Political uncertainty in Europe's election year, further fiscal slippage,
continued growth of German money supply and hints of disagreement in the UK
between the central bank and the Treasury are fuelling doubts. 'My advice to
investors is to use any rally to reduce exposure to bonds,' says Mr
MacKinnon.
Ironically, the sharp rise in long-term yields may turn out to be a
blessing. Higher long-term interest rates, to which a large amount of
borrowing is pegged, may damp some growth optimism and resulting inflation
fears that initially contributed to the bond sell-off. Mr John Lipsky, chief
economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, says the increase in European
yields 'will undermine growth expectations directly'.
Moreover, 'the latest bond yield rise up will increase the pressure on
European governments to tighten fiscal policy further, rather than watch
passively as higher debt financing costs push budget deficits - and real
long-term bond yields - still higher', Mr Lipsky argues.
Some take an even gloomier view. 'The risk is high that the world will sink
back into recession before the end of the year,' warns Mr Stephen Lewis,
director of research at the London Bond Broking Company.
Many say the outlook for the second half hinges on US developments. If
growth there shows signs of slowing, fears of further interest rate
tightening may ease, allowing treasuries to stabilise. Until then, European
bond markets are expected to be volatile.
'We are running defensive positions consisting of cash, short-dated paper
and reduced exposure to the peripheral markets in favour of the core
markets,' says Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed income at fund managers
Lombard Odier. Historically, bear markets have lasted for two to three
years. By that standard, the current bear market is still in its early days.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Royal Bank sells Pounds 116m stake in 3i
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday disclosed that it had sold its entire
Pounds 116m stake in 3i, the largest European investor in unquoted
companies. The announcement came as 3i set a price of 272p per share for the
flotation of Pounds 711m of equity.
Royal Bank sold because a diluted stake would have stopped it taking
increases in 3i's net assets into profits. Bank of Scotland retained its
shares, while National Westminster remained the biggest holder, with 17.9
per cent.
3i confirmed that it was pricing the shares at a 13.5 per cent discount to
net assets, and that it was selling 45 per cent of its equity - rather than
40 per cent - because of strong demand.
The company, jointly owned by seven high street banks and the Bank of
England since its formation in 1945, revealed details of a Pounds 36m share
option scheme for 140 senior managers intended to discourage them from
leaving. The options would cost Pounds 18.7m to exercise and net the
managers
Pounds 17.3m at the offer price. The scheme has been in place since 1984 and
requires managers to wait for three to 10 years to exercise options.
Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive, said that although 3i had a unique
franchise, it was 'an extremely good training ground for a variety of other
companies'.
3i confirmed it had received bids of Pounds 1.2bn from mainly UK
institutional investors during the bookbuilding exercise. This was more than
twice the Pounds 533m placed firmly with institutions.
The remaining Pounds 178m is to be offered to retail investors, of whom
385,000 have registered for details. The public offer, underwritten by
Baring Brothers, closes on July 6, and share dealing is due to start on July
18.
Sir George Russell, chairman, said he was 'delighted' with the response.
'The fact that we are able to come to the market under such difficult and
volatile conditions sets us apart,' he said.
3i is to float as an investment trust, so gaining tax advantages. Mr Simon
Borrows, a Barings director, said that the 13.5 per cent discount had been
chosen to ensure liquidity in the shares.
With a market value of Pounds 1.58bn, 3i may enter the FT-SE 100 Index later
this year. The gross dividend yield at the offer price is 3 per cent.
Mr Brian Larcombe, finance director, said the 13.5 per cent discount had not
necessarily been narrowed by the stock market's fall since March because
3i's net assets had gained from flotations since then and companies'
earnings were growing.

FT  23 JUN 94 / SIB sets deadline for applications to investor watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, yesterday
set a deadline of October 1 for independent financial advisers to decide
whether to apply for membership of the new Personal Investment Authority.
The move gives fresh impetus to the PIA, which will be the watchdog for
Britain's private investors, and came as the SIB gave the go-ahead for the
body to begin operation in mid-July.
Yesterday's moves bring to a close a long period of debate on the
controversial new watchdog.
The SIB's decision to set a firm deadline just over three months away will
force independent financial advisers to choose between three options. They
can apply for membership of the PIA, seek direct regulation by the SIB, or
leave the investment business by the end of the year.
Fimbra, the existing regulator for independent financial advisers, and
Lautro, the existing regulator for the life insurance industry, are intended
to disappear in October 1995.
Mr Andrew Large, the SIB chairman, yesterday called on financial advisers
and life companies which had not yet applied to the PIA to do so
immediately.
Moreover, the trade associations for independent financial advisers, which
had previously urged their members to delay applications, now say they
should not wait any longer. They had previously been among the most vocal
opponents of the PIA, claiming that new regulatory arrangements reflected a
'hidden agenda' to cut the numbers of independent financial advisers.
As it completed the formal process of approving the PIA as a suitable
regulator, the SIB emphasised it would exercise close supervision.
Explaining its decision to approve the PIA, the SIB said it had put
particular importance on the PIA's arrangements for monitoring its members.
In answer to some of the widespread criticisms of the PIA, the SIB said:
it would keep a particularly close watch on the costs of regulation;
the maximum award which could be ordered by the PIA ombudsman - criticised
for being too low - would be kept under review;
the PIA must behave fairly towards all the different elements of retail
financial services which it would regulate.
Along with hundreds of individual financial advisers who have not yet
applied, some high-profile companies have also not yet committed themselves.
They include Allied Dunbar, the life insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries,
the Lloyds Bank group, and Halifax Building Society, which is to set up a
life subsidiary next year.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Row widens over government intervention in rail dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The row over the extent of government intervention in the rail dispute grew
yesterday as Labour claimed that Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, had
threatened to veto any deal for signal staff that breached the government's
freeze on the public-sector pay bill.
The claim, which came as the second one-day rail strike brought chaos for
travellers, followed a BBC radio interview in which Mr MacGregor appeared to
agree with the interviewer's assertion that he would block any deal he did
not like.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT rail union, said Mr MacGregor's
intervention was 'unhelpful' and made negotiation of a settlement 'much more
difficult'.
Aides of Mr MacGregor said he never used the word veto and his remarks had
been misinterpreted. The row was dismissed by a Downing Street official as a
media invention.
The transport secretary said the government was 'asking Railtrack to
negotiate on the basis of the approach to public-sector pay that the
chancellor set last autumn'. He agreed that he was in regular contact with
Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, the state-owned rail infrastructure
company.
Mr Horton said he was being driven by a 'business and commercial imperative'
and he would not 'buy peace' to end the signalling dispute.
About 1,000 trains ran yesterday in spite of the one-day strike. Normally,
about 15,000 trains run each day. They carried few passengers. Travellers
either did not know the services were running or feared they might not be
able to use them to return home.
The rail union said it was alarmed about reports that unqualified managers
had been used to operate the signal boxes.
Mr Knapp has written to the Chief Inspector of Railways, urging him to
investigate the allegations. Citing reports from Rugby, the Trent area,
Shoeburyness and Paisley, he said: 'The possible disastrous implications of
such practices are quite apparent and need no explanation.'
Railtrack said the Health and Safety Executive was content with the
competence checks applied to the staff working yesterday. Union officials
said RMT headquarters were being 'bombarded' with calls from signalling
staff opposed to the company's productivity package, which was rejected by
union negotiators on Monday.
'They are being asked to swallow a huge package of new working practices for
no gain,' a spokesman said. The RMT, which is holding its annual conference
next week, has announced two further 24-hour strikes for Wednesday June 29
and July 6.

A recent study by management consultants McKinsey argued that the only
reliable way to win price wars was to avoid them. On that reckoning, the
Daily Telegraph can only lose heavily by cutting its cover price. The
Telegraph accepts it could lose Pounds 40m in annual circulation revenue,
although that will be partly offset by increased advertising and lower
costs. The more worrying thought is that the Telegraph has ceded control of
its destiny to its chief competitor. The Telegraph's move only makes sense
if The Times now stops hostilities. Sadly, Mr Rupert Murdoch is not renowned
for such generosity.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A pan-European market for smaller company shares of the type being discussed
by Nasdaq, the US market, is an attractive idea. Institutions tend to be
interested in the minnows only at the top of the investment cycle, so retail
investors are required to underpin liquidity. Yet no single European country
has a deep enough pool of retail money to allow the lower echelons of
national markets to flourish. Harnessing interest across Europe might
provide enough liquidity to replicate the success of Nasdaq in the US.
But in practice it is not clear that European investors have the same
enthusiasm for equities as their US peers. And though the technology to run
such a market is available, persuading national exchanges to back the
venture will be hard. The London Stock Exchange for one is determined to go
it alone. Even if a number of existing markets could be convinced in
principle, ticklish problems of accounting harmonisation and regulation
would have to be overcome. None of this amounts to an argument against
trying to establish such a market. But there are powerful reasons to doubt
whether it is an idea whose time has come.

It is not only pharmaceutical companies that catch colds when the US Food
and Drug Administration sneezes. BAT's shares, too, have spluttered after
the FDA attacked high-nicotine tobacco. Whatever the rights and wrongs of
the latest row, the trend towards tighter regulation is unmistakable. BAT
describes the FDA as an 'agency with an agenda' aiming 'to acquire
jurisdiction over tobacco so that it can regulate it out of existence'. That
makes its Dollars 1bn acquisition of American Tobacco appear all the more
heroic - or foolhardy.
BAT's shares have underperformed the market by 8 per cent since it moved to
increase its exposure to US tobacco, although other unsettling factors have
been at work. BAT has been hit by the dollar's weakness and it has only
recently become apparent how badly Farmers was knocked by the Californian
earthquake. Yet if BAT's tobacco worries are confined to the US, its rating
looks decidedly mean. Its tobacco interests are valued on an earnings
multiple of around five when insurance is given a market rating. That may
only reinforce the logic of hiving off tobacco, even though Philip Morris
has just baulked at the idea. After all, cigarette sales in the developing
world should more than offset shrinking US demand.

The stock market's reaction to the appointment of an outsider as ICI's chief
executive was muted compared to the celebration which greeted Mr Martin
Taylor's arrival at Barclays last summer. But Mr Charles Miller Smith, who
is moving to ICI from Unilever and was rumoured to be in the running for the
Barclays job, should not feel slighted. The process of cultural change is
already well established at ICI following last year's demerger of Zeneca.
The main comfort in the appointment is that there is less danger of ICI
sliding back into complacency now that profits are starting to improve.
Mr Miller Smith may also be able to add value to ICI's investment decisions,
which will be just as important for the company's long-term success. The
chemical group's record on this score has been patchy. With its balance
sheet restored to health thanks to the demerger, ICI has money to spend. But
without the cash flow from the bioscience side, it cannot afford expensive
mistakes.
While Mr Miller Smith will not bring specialist knowledge to investment
decisions, ICI is not short on chemicals industry experience. The
chairman-designate and most other executive directors have risen through the
ranks. Neither has specialist knowledge always brought the right result in
the past. It may be more important that Mr Miller Smith brings a
dispassionate view, unencumbered by the past.

FT  23 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Investors in 3i
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stormy financial markets have forced 3i to trim its sails a touch but not
prevented its flotation. The issue has been priced at a 13.5 per cent
discount to net asset value, which is somewhat higher than the venture
capital group's existing bank shareholders were originally looking for.
Barings, 3i's merchant bank, has also thought it wise to choose a price
which will mean that institutional shareholders will on average receive less
than half the shares they apply for. That should ensure a healthy
aftermarket provided equity prices do not take another dive in coming weeks.
But it would be wrong to conclude that the pricing offers investors the
prospect of quick profits. Though the bulk of 3i's portfolio is unquoted, it
is valued by reference to market price/earnings ratios. Similarly, the
drying up of new issues means it will take longer for 3i to realise the
value of its assets. The 272p issue price merely reflects these factors. It
is not particularly generous.
3i's main attraction is as a long-term investment. The company has
out-performed average venture capital and smaller company investment trusts
over the past decade. The source of this success is a branch network that
enables 3i to invest in a much broader range of small companies than rival
investment trusts are able to tap. Though there are costs in maintaining
3i's network, they have been cut in recent years. Because the competition in
supplying finance to this sector is not severe, the prospective returns are
higher.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Dumping of the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dollar weakness is an old story. Until 1971, the once all-conquering
greenback was worth 360 yen. Until 1969, it was worth four D-Marks. How has
the mighty fallen] The questions to be asked are why this latest bout of
weakness has occurred, whether it is possible to do something effective
about it and, finally, whether action should even be attempted.
The problem in explaining the dollar's weakness is not that there are too
few explanations, but that there are too many. While movements in relative
interest rates in 1994 should have been favourable to the dollar, fingers
can still be pointed at external balances, at fears of inflation, at the US
fiscal deficit, at the Federal Reserve's somewhat modest monetary tightening
since February and at the current caution of investors. It is tempting to
draw the sage conclusion that the dollar has been weak because too few want
to buy it.
Can one do better than that? Perhaps. If the dollar is to remain stable, the
rest of the world must be a net buyer of claims on the US, at existing
exchange rates, of some Dollars 140bn in 1994, says the IMF in its latest
World Economic Outlook. Similarly, Japan must be a net buyer of claims on
the rest of the world, to the tune of Dollars 133bn this year. Unless the US
offers relatively attractive returns on assets (including on the dollar) and
Japan relatively unattractive ones, these capital flows will occur only
after exchange rates reach self-evidently under- or overvalued positions.
Convinced investors
Until then, current account flows are likely to become overwhelmingly
important. They are still more likely to determine the fate of the dollar
once the US authorities have convinced investors that they do, foolishly,
hope to eliminate the bulk of the Japanese current account surplus. The US
current account deficit must then also fall, which suggests the dollar's
real exchange rate will have to decline.
Is there anything the authorities can do about that decline? The answer is
yes. The central bank in charge of the strengthening currency can always
stabilise the exchange rate, by purchasing the weakening one, without limit.
This was pretty well what the Japanese did, following the Louvre Accord in
February 1987, not an experience they wish to repeat. The problem is that
they can stabilise the dollar only by abandoning domestic monetary control.
As Professor Ronald McKinnon pointed out in the FT on Tuesday, the two
countries must, in effect, form a joint monetary policy.
Frighten speculators
The effectiveness of all other measures is uncertain, limited intervention
particularly so. If central banks hit the markets unawares, they can
frighten speculators for a while. They can make announcements, as secretary
of the Treasury Bentsen did yesterday, about how strong the US economy is.
Such talk is cheap and will not work for long. That leaves changes in
monetary policy itself. But the effects even of that are uncertain. They
depend on what happens to prospective returns on longer-term assets. If
higher short-term interest rates are thought to prove that a central bank is
hysterical about inflation, they may harm the cause of the currency as much
as they help.
The final question is whether the authorities should, in fact, try to do
something about the dollar's decline. A partial answer to this question is
that the dollar's decline is probably not particularly harmful. But the
policy changes suggested by the foreign exchange markets are, in any case,
in the right direction. Developments in the US economy and bond markets
would justify somewhat higher short-term rates of interest and a tighter
fiscal position, the latter underlined by Mr Alan Greenspan yesterday.
Despite faint signs of recovery, there also is a case for a more
expansionary monetary policy in Japan, something that unsterilised foreign
exchange intervention would ensure.
Why is the dollar weak? We are not certain. Can something be done about it?
Yes, but nothing decisive will be. Should something be tried? Yes, because
the required changes in policy would push the two main players in sensible
directions. Does dollar weakness matter that much? Probably not. However
unhappily, the world economy has survived 25 years of it. It can, no doubt,
survive a few more.

George Mathewson is not the only ex-3i veteran at the Royal Bank who
clearing bankers love to hate.
Derek Sach, recruited by Mathewson to run the bank's intensive care ward
after 20 years at 3i, has even dared challenge the usefulness of the
floating charge, an ancient banking method whereby banks can get their money
back even if no one else can.
He told the FT earlier this week that it should be abolished. As one pained
clearing banker noted yesterday, this would mean that students of Institute
of Bankers exams would no longer be able to answer the stock question:
'How do you secure a ship mortgage?' with the hoary old answer 'with a
floating charge and a sinking fund'.

Always thought that George Mathewson, the restless chief executive of the
Royal Bank of Scotland, was a bit of a rum cove.
On the day 3i celebrated its stock market launch, Mathewson's bank dumped
(sorry sold) its entire Pounds 115m stake in the venture capital company.
Given that Mathewson spent nine years learning his trade at the old ICFC,
the forerunner of 3i, it doesn't sound much like a vote of confidence in his
old employer.
'I hope nobody thinks that I am saying 3i is a bad company. It is a very
good one,' says Mathewson who blames less favourable accountancy rules for
his change of heart.
Quite so. But it probably would not have happened if the Royal Bank was
still run by old-fashioned clearing bankers.

Anyone wishing for an instant assessment of the state of the South African
economy need look no further than the attire of finance minister Derek Keys.
Yesterday he was sporting what he calls his 'good news' tie, a truly
appalling confection of broad stripes in yellow, purple, maroon and blue.
This garish combination heralded an upbeat introduction to yesterday's
budget: an economic recovery boosted by a higher gold price, solid export
earnings, improved access to foreign markets, favourable agricultural
conditions, improving local and international business and consumer
confidence 'with each day that passes'.
If on his next public appearance Keys sports an even more spectacular choice
of neckwear, brace yourselves: he'll most likely be announcing the abolition
of the financial rand.

It's all change at the American University of Beirut where Richard Debs, the
ex-New York Fed man and more recently Morgan Stanley hot-shot, has taken
over as chairman of the board of trustees.
The only problem is that Debs, plus his new vice-chairman, Occidental's Ray
Irani, and Tom Morris, former chief executive of New York's Presbyterian
Hospital, are not allowed to walk AUB's tree-lined squares.
Three years after Lebanon's civil war, which brought bombs, killing and
kidnapping to AUB, the state department still bars Americans from travelling
to Beirut.
'I suspect we'll be able to go back in a year or so,' says Debs, who learnt
his Arabic when he was a Fulbright Scholar in Cairo back in 1952.
Until the state department decrees Lebanon safe, therefore, daily running of
the oldest US institution in the Middle East remains in the hands of its now
non-American staff.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Observer: Warsaw's honeypot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This weekend Warsaw plays host to an event that would have warmed the
cockles of the heart of Jacques Attali, former president of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
International aristocrats, Citibank, Burger King and, yes, the EBRD are
helping with the organisation of a series of events - including a ball and
candle-lit dinners - to raise funds for a new children's cancer hospital,
which will receive almost half the proceeds.
The EBRD in London says it's providing 'no financial support whatsoever',
though it thought it may have given permission for its name to be used.
Warsaw's Royal Castle, rebuilt in the 1970s by Edward Gierek, then Communist
party leader, will, for the first time since it was destroyed during the
second world war, be the scene of a 'Red and White' dance - 'carriages at
two' - on Saturday. Sunday will be devoted to visiting stately homes.
Serena Balfour - her husband Neil has been acting as an EBRD consultant in
Warsaw since 1992 - is the gala's moving spirit.
She has assembled a glittering crowd of the great and the rich, including
Rocco Forte, whose Bristol Hotel will be housing some of the prominent
guests.
Balfour says that, besides charity, the aim of the exercise is to erode
Poland's foreign image as a desperately dull and dreary place.
In a personal capacity, Guy de Selliers, a deputy vice-president of the
EBRD, is one of 200 guests, including Wieslaw Kaczmarek, Poland's
privatisation minister, who has been invited to attend at a reduced rate.
Other guests will be paying Dollars 1,310, plus Dollars 290 for their room
in the Bristol; not exorbitant, but still rather beyond the average monthly
Polish salary, equivalent to Dollars 200.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Leading Article: South Africa's balancing act
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's government of national unity has passed its first test.
Yesterday's budget is a brave attempt to reconcile two critical
constituencies. The concerns of the business community, looking for evidence
of fiscal discipline, were met with the pledge to cut the budget deficit
from 6.9 per cent to 6.6 per cent of GDP. It will be harder to satisfy a
domestic constituency anticipating a liberation dividend. The provision of
Dollars 685m for the first year of the country's development plan may seem
modest at first sight, but it will be hard to spend this amount efficiently
in the time available.
This cautious approach suggests that the new ANC-led government is
determined not to repeat the mistakes that have proved so costly elsewhere
in Africa. But the toughest tests are yet to come: controlling spending
while keeping promises to provide a better life for the country's black
majority. The budget will come under pressure from several sources including
the costs of an expanding civil service, of a multi-tiered system of local,
provincial and central government, and of integrating the armed forces.
Winding up the old apartheid structures and replacing them with a new system
will almost certainly prove more costly than anticipated, even if in the
long run it will prove more efficient.
Apartheid's legacy
Redressing the legacy of apartheid involves undoing one of the 20th
century's most radical experiments in social engineering, involving the
forced removal from so-called 'white areas' of more than 3m people. Making
restitution to the dispossessed, making available state-owned land to ease
pressure in former 'black areas', and redirecting financial and other
assistance from commercial farmers to peasant farmers without disrupting
agriculture will be an awesome task for a government most of whose members
have no previous administrative experience. Scarcely less demanding is the
target of meeting a housing backlog of more than 1.5m units while keeping up
with annual extra demand of some 200,000 homes.
The new government must also resolve unfinished constitutional business:
determining the relationship between the central government and the nine
provincial governments. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be
a tussle for power between the provincial premiers and the executive,
involving some of the most critical issues such as the allocation of state
resources for housing, health and education.
Working relationship
Fortunately, the four-year transition which culminated in President Nelson
Mandela's inauguration last month has helped forge a working relationship
between the ANC, Deputy President de Klerk's National party, and the
business community. It is significant that both Mr Alec Erwin, the deputy to
finance minister Mr Derek Keys, and Mr Jay Naidoo, the minister responsible
for the social upliftment programme, are preaching the virtues of fiscal
discipline as enthusiastically as Mr Keys himself. This has allowed much of
the important groundwork for development to take place. The foreign debt
burden, dating back to the freeze on further lending imposed by commercial
banks in 1985, has been eased. Similarly, the transitional team has
negotiated an International Monetary Fund facility and made trade
liberalisation proposals to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Now what Mr Keys called the 'golden triangle of government, business and the
unions' has to deliver jobs and improved living standards. As he
acknowledged, success in a challenging international environment requires
liberalisation of South Africa's exchange controls, a significant obstacle
to investor confidence, as soon as conditions are right. But first South
Africa needs to build up its foreign reserves, which currently cover barely
six weeks of imports. Above all, restored access to international financial
markets should not be seen as a way of funding a larger budget deficit.
If South Africa can realise the vision set out by Mr Keys in yesterday's
budget - an open society, trading freely with other nations, investing
liberally to increase productive capacity, and creating more jobs and an
attractive domestic market - it will have broken the African mould.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Personal View: Europe's pensions quandary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN HOFFMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The question of how pensions should be financed and who should pay them
remains at the top of the policy agenda across the world. In the UK, today's
white paper in response to the Goode report will propose new solvency
standards and regulatory reforms, while in Italy the government is faced
with a budget 'hole' of perhaps one-fifth of the planned 1994 deficit as a
result of a court decision this month on state pensions. There is a
widespread feeling that something has to change but - as demonstrated by
last week's abandonment of the troubled European Union pensions directive -
no agreement as to what.
But the problem cannot be swept under the carpet. The adverse demographic
trends at the heart of the pensions quandary are a source of strain for
public sector budgets already swollen by unemployment due to an explosion of
low-cost competition. The extent of the strain cannot be gauged from
published public sector statistics, which are purely backward-looking, with
no inclusion of unfunded pension liabilities.
Researchers at ABP, the Dutch civil service pension fund, have quantified
the present value of unfunded pension liabilities in Europe. If the present
value of tax receipts from public and private pensions is deducted from this
sum, and the conventionally measured debt burden is added, the result gives
a measure of 'true' debt (see chart). While this does not represent a
complete set of adjustments to gross public debt data - which would include
assets to be sold off, as well as future liabilities - there is merit in
singling out pensions. First, pensions are among the most important
categories of public expenditure. Second, to the extent that they are
unfunded, they are most vulnerable to demographic trends.
The 'true' debt/gross domestic product ratios are more than double
conventional ratios almost throughout the EU. The UK - with both the lowest
public pension in the EU and one of the best developed private-funded
sectors - stands out as having the smallest unfunded liabilities in relation
to GDP, and that ratio will have fallen after the 1993 announcement of a
phased rise in the pension age for women.
Financing problems are not confined to pensions promised by the public
sector. In Germany, private schemes are usually of the defined benefit type
and more than 60 per cent of private pension obligations are held within
company balance sheets. But under the pressure of redundancies, some
companies have begun to create separate pension funds, partly because the
employee contributions which are proving increasingly necessary must by law
be made into a hypothecated fund.
Some means of encouraging savings needs to be found. An alternative solution
to underfunding is to reduce the real value of pensions, but there are clear
political limits to this; in the Netherlands the Pensioners' party won six
seats in May's elections. In the UK the state earnings related pension
scheme became less generous in 1988, and since 1981 the basic pension has
been linked to prices rather than wages. Greater availability of
appropriately supervised private sector pension funds, free to invest as
their managers see fit, is the only realistic way forward.
Make no mistake, governments will progressively renege on their pension
payments. The only way to head off political consequences is to encourage
saving, particularly via private pensions. In continental Europe, where
cross-border sales and investments are commonly constrained, Sir Leon
Brittan gave the lead in 1991 with the draft Pensions Directive. But
although all European leaders support free capital movements in principle,
in practice the ERM and the Maxwell crises, coupled with lingering
resentment of the UK's tactics during the Maastricht negotiations, destroyed
the political support for the directive, and it has been abandoned.
Europe's pensions quandary is not a suitable case for 'muddling through'. A
directive which genuinely liberates capital would radically improve the
allocation of savings, raising growth and generating jobs. In stark contrast
to last year's Commission white paper, free cross-border pensions in Europe
could help finance investment without adding to high government debts - both
revealed and hidden.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Steady as she goes but watch bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaving aside politics and the bond market, the UK recovery is doing better
than might have been expected. Output is rising at trend rates or slightly
above: that is sufficiently fast to make inroads into unemployment and
unused capacity, but not so fast as to stoke up inflation. Indeed, the April
increase in earnings growth has, for the moment at least, reversed itself.
The official index of underlying retail price inflation is 2.5 per cent,
lower than predicted in any of the Bank of England Inflation Reports. The
Bank's own index, stripped of indirect tax increases, is even lower, at
around 2 per cent or less.
Moreover inflation worriers should be reassured by recent evidence that the
pace of home demand is moderating. Retail spending, although well up on a
year ago, is increasing less quickly. Monetary conditions have tightened
themselves owing to the rise in bond yields; and an increase in the cost of
fixed interest mortgages has taken the edge off the housing market. Thus, as
the world economy recovers, there should be room for exports to take over
some of the momentum from home spending.
What, then, are the financial markets worrying about? The political weakness
of the British government is not a good explanation. There have been plenty
of bull markets under Labour governments and bear markets under Conservative
ones. Labour leaders are, if anything, hypersensitive to international and
financial market sentiments. Have financial analysts already forgotten the
prawn cocktail offensive in the City before the last election to persuade
the City of Labour's financial responsibility? The real dangers of a Labour
government are from the harm it might inflict on its natural supporters
through devices like minimum wages.
Another false worry is that the present government will refuse to tighten
monetary policy when the Bank of England advises it to do so. The
chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, is 'philosophically' in favour of central bank
independence, but does not think the time right for a full-frontal move.
Meanwhile, the publication of the minutes of his monthly meetings with the
governor has put the latter in the driving seat. If the Bank of England is
really intent on raising interest rates  - which it is not at present - the
most that the chancellor is able to do, as he well recognises, is to
interpose a minor delay. Moreover, a Blair-Brown Labour government would not
reverse the moves made so far to give the Bank more scope. Indeed Labour's
mood at the moment is to settle for a transitional set of arrangements quite
similar to the government's own.
What then is worrying markets? The source of the trouble is clearly the US.
Even here, there may not be anything all that fundamental. We may simply
have seen the bursting of a moderate speculative bubble. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average is still much higher than in most of 1992 and 1993. The
same applies to the FT-SE 100 Index in the UK. The German Dax index has seen
nothing more than a hesitation in a two-year upward trend.
Similar remarks apply to bonds. In the US and the UK, bond yields have more
than reversed their 1993 fall, but are still lower than two years ago. The
rise in German yields has been less, but sufficient to put a brake on the
succession of short-term interest rate cuts. One way of putting what has
happened is that, a year ago, inflation was widely held to be dead and
deflation declared to be the new problem. Today's perception is of a normal
upward phase in the business cycle, bringing with it the familiar need for
vigilance against any inflationary take-off.
The most striking feature of world financial markets is the weakness of the
dollar against the yen. But this is not yet a generalised dollar weakness.
The US currency is a good deal higher, for instance, against the D-Mark than
it was in the closing months of the Bush administration, when it touched
DM1.39. Sterling has weakened less than the dollar and it is still well
above the low levels it reached after the 1992 ERM exit.
But having said all this, the weakness of bond prices will indeed become a
severe warning signal if it goes much further. The rise of nearly 3
percentage points in UK bond yields since last winter can be decomposed into
two elements. There has been a rise of over 1 point in the return on
index-linked securities, which now yield around 4 per cent. This is an
approximation to the real rate of interest not only in the UK, but in the
world - for real rates tend to equality in a worldwide capital market.
This real component of the rise in rates could be a sign that the world
capital shortage, which was prematurely diagnosed after the fall of the
Berlin wall, has at last really arrived. In the words of David Hale of
Kemper Financial Services, 'the potential exists for the old industrial
countries to experience a cyclical economic recovery coincident with rapid
economic growth in countries making the transition to market-based economic
systems. This is likely to put upward pressure on real interest rates,
because it will generate investment activity and credit demand from
countries which have not been players since the first world war.' In
addition, there will be the need to finance budget deficits in most western
countries.
On top of these structural forces, there is an apparent rise of more than 1
percentage point in the UK 'inflation premium', derived by subtracting the
yield on indexed gilts from that on normal gilts.
The one worldwide force suggesting the possible return of inflation has been
a 25 per cent jump this year in commodity prices. In fact, a sharp rise here
in the course of a world recovery is quite normal. An occasional bump of
this kind is an illustration of the point by former UK chancellor Lord
Lawson that we cannot expect either output or prices to move in a straight
line. However, a continued commodity price increase of recent dimensions
could not be so readily explained away and would be a sign of worldwide
pressures on capacity.
I can still hear critics saying that the true constraint on UK recovery is
not inflation but the balance of payments. Let us cut out the scholastic
argument about how much this matters and conduct the argument in terms of
capacity instead. For what could make it necessary to slow down the recovery
well before a reasonable level of employment had been reached, would be a
shortage of capacity. Here the former Nedo economists, whose book Britain's
Economic Performance was reviewed by Edward Balls in the FT last Thursday,
have a point. With the cost indices showing Britain being highly competitive
against the rest of the world, further devaluation would just be
inflationary.
Despite the peculiar left-right coalition which regards such a prospect with
indifference, if not joy, continuing depreciation of sterling is not an
option for governments even half serious about a 1 to 4 per cent inflation
rate. Admittedly, in the Treasury model sterling is not a good predictor of
inflation for up to two years ahead. But this is just a question of
forecasting techniques.
There can be little doubt that, if sterling continued to drop year after
year against the world's main currencies, the UK inflation rate would be
correspondingly higher. Britain has already had, when it left the ERM, the
one-off devaluation which might be benign.
Where, however, the ex-Nedo economists are obstinately wrong is in failing
to see that the capacity shortage is at bottom a labour market problem. For
in the end businesses will install the amount of capacity that they regard
as profitable. In the long run extra workers are taken on, and the capacity
to employ them installed, if the gains from so doing exceed the extra costs
involved. If labour markets were more flexible, it would pay to add capacity
and employ more people. (Readers who disagree should write 'to the editor',
not to me.)
It is at least a good sign that the chancellor is using the present respite
from monetary controversy to investigate ideas for improving the workings of
the labour markets in a humane way, so that it becomes possible to create
low-paid jobs for the less skilled, while topping up their pay by other
means.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Held up on the western line: Latvia's tough citizenship
rules are a blemish on its international image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Closer than Switzerland' says the advertisement for a large private bank in
the newly independent state of Latvia, which nestles between Russia and the
Baltic Sea. The slogan could apply to the entire country, as it tries to
rejoin the capitalist west from which it was torn by Stalin in 1940. With a
strong currency and hopes of becoming a financial centre, Latvia is emerging
as an island of relative economic stability within the former Soviet Union.
However, Latvia's ambitions for a speedy reintegration with the west are
threatened by a political problem which has festered for the past three
years: whether non-Latvians, who make up almost half the population, should
be given citizenship. On Tuesday, the Latvian parliament finally passed a
law giving non-ethnic Latvians born in the country a chance to apply for
naturalisation by 2000. But it imposes draconian citizenship quotas on
non-Latvian residents who were not born in the country.
These quotas mean Latvia is unlikely to join the Council of Europe, the
32-nation forum for human rights and democracy regarded as a stepping-stone
for integration into western Europe. This is because such organisations, as
part of their membership requirements, insist countries should not leave
residents stateless. More importantly, the Latvian parliament's decision
means any longer-term ambition to join the European Union and Nato - which
Latvia sees as its best guarantee of security and independence - has been
pushed further into the distance.
Mr Hugh Hamilton, local representative of the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe, the 52-nation forum regulating borders and security,
said yesterday: 'International opinion in general will be expressing concern
that this law really does not accord with the norms of the western community
which Latvia has been seeking to associate itself with.'
Mr Valdis Birkavs, Latvia's prime minister, recognised the new difficulties
created by parliament's vote when he told deputies: 'Let us cherish no
illusions that we will wriggle out, that nothing bad will happen. These
quotas can only complicate matters.'
The ramifications are considerable. The curbs on citizenship will hinder
economic progress because citizenship brings the right to own land as well
as to vote. They are also hampering Latvia's attempts to mend relations with
Russia and restore trade ties damaged by the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Had it been able to devise a more internationally palatable solution to the
citizenship issue, Latvia would have been better placed to build on its
economic strengths. Since recovering its prewar independence in 1991, Latvia
has run a near deficit-free budget. Its currency, the lat, is fully
convertible and last year appreciated against the main western currencies.
Under the monetarist stewardship of a fiercely independent central bank,
Latvia's inflation and recession have been milder than in all its former
Soviet neighbours other than Estonia.
Latvia's GDP contracted by 12 per cent last year but has returned to modest
growth this year. An inflation rate of 35 per cent last year is forecast by
economists to fall to about 20 per cent this year - low by the standards of
the former Soviet Union. High real interest rates and lack of foreign
exchange controls have attracted capital fleeing instability elsewhere in
the former Soviet Union. Mr Alexander Rannikh, Russian ambassador to Latvia,
described the country as 'a Switzerland for second-class capital which is
not ready for Switzerland but unsafe in Russia'.
But the financial orthodoxy which has made Latvia a favourite of the
International Monetary Fund contrasts sharply with its clumsy handling of
its demographic arithmetic. As a result of the migration of Russians,
Ukrainians and Belarussians to work at factories built under Soviet rule,
ethnic Latvians today account for only 52 per cent of the population,
compared with three-quarters before the country's annexation in 1940.
Fearing Latvians could be swamped by 'Russian-speakers', parliament decided
in the run-up to independence to restrict citizenship to pre-1940 citizens
and their descendants. This arrangement effectively disenfranchised 700,000
people who had the vote when Latvia was part of the Soviet Union.
The legislation approved this week will enable spouses of citizens, plus
more than 200,000 Russian-speakers born in Latvia, to apply for citizenship
by 2000. But Mr Hans-Peter Furrer, the Council of Europe's director for
political affairs, said the quotas in the new law would mean only about
2,000 people born outside Latvia (out of a total of 300,000 in this
category) would qualify for citizenship each year after 2000.
Latvia can argue that it faces a unique dilemma - few countries' demography
have been so radically altered in a relatively short period. But while
sympathetic to its circumstances, Mr Furrer and the CSCE's Mr Hamilton
believe Latvia could have protected its national identity and security
without quotas - via, for instance, a requirement that citizens can speak
Latvian.
Mr Nils Muiznieks, a US-born academic, explained the reluctance to grant
citizenship as a mixture of a desire by extreme nationalists to encourage
Russian speakers to leave, and fears among more moderate politicians that
giving them the vote could 'slow' Latvia's market reforms and create a
'fifth column' of potentially disloyal citizens. Many Russian speakers work
in Soviet-era factories now likely to close and are regarded by ethnic
Latvians as inclining to the east rather than to the west.
The irony is that many Russians, who constituted the local elite in the
Soviet era, have become akin to the Jews of the Tsarist empire. Excluded
from government posts, they have thrived on business, which they dominate.
Local Russian-language radio in the capital Riga plays locally produced pop
songs with lyrics about the delights of going into 'biznez'. Mr Boris
Tsilevich, a Jewish writer who has taken up the cause of non-citizens, said
a large segment of the population was being unnecessarily alienated. 'If
Russian-speakers turn out to be the 'fifth column' Latvians talk about, it
will have been built by Latvian hands.'
Perhaps more worrying is the reversal of progress in repairing relations
with Russia which could ensue from parliament's decision this week. Last
month the two countries signed an agreement on the withdrawal of the
remaining Russian troops by August 31. In return, Latvia agreed to give
residence permits to retired Russian officers who decide to stay. Russia
made clear its displeasure at the reappearance of quotas in the draft
citizenship law earlier this month when it postponed indefinitely a planned
visit to Latvia by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister. In
anticipation of the visit, a trading agreement between Russia and Latvia,
halving import and export duties on trade between the two countries, came
into force at the beginning of this month.
Latvia's eagerness to recover markets in the east is being spurred by fears
that, in spite of its pro-western outlook, overpowering competition from
more developed capitalist economies could see its national interests
subjugated to those of foreign investors. The danger Latvia faces is of
upsetting both east and west. On the one hand, the citizenship law may fuel
the demands of Russian nationalists in Russia, thus creating greater
regional instability. On the other hand, Latvia has harmed its chances of
winning acceptance by the western organisations that could protect its
independence - and bring economic benefits - whatever happens in Russia.

<TEXT>
Sir, Many of your readers expect to find valuable and useful information in
your pages. Some of them are not too happy to be patronised by an
interviewer (Lucy Kellaway) who plonks her magnificent ego between them and
a subject they might like to learn more about ('Put on your thinking caps',
June 17).
Since 'parallel thinking' has now been taken up by many corporations which
find it more constructive than traditional argument, the personal opinion of
your interviewer is probably of less value to your readers than an
opportunity to find out about the method. Your readers can make up their own
minds without being nannied as to what to think.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lottery and fair competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL ROWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported in your story, 'EU seeks views on Cadbury link with
lottery' (June 15), on the European Commission's examination of the Camelot
joint venture agreements. The Commission wishes to ensure that the
agreements in no way contravene EU rules on free and fair competition. It
seems likely that Camelot will have taken great care to formulate its
agreements in such a way as to minimise the risk of their being overturned
by the EU.
I wonder, however, whether as much consideration has been given to
potentially serious competition issues by those who will be distributing the
proceeds of the National Lottery. Such issues could arise if the
distributing bodies grant funds to companies or other organisations which
compete in genuine markets. The lottery legislation may have excluded
private individuals and companies from receiving grants from the National
Heritage Memorial Fund, but I am not aware that any such exclusion applies,
for example, to Arts Council or Sports Council funds. Competition among
theatres and among sports venues, to name just two examples, could thus be
affected.
Companies which bid for grants and propose to co-finance the projects
concerned will surely be seeking some competitive advantage as a result. An
effective subsidy for a capital project provided to just one player in a
market but not other (potential) competitors, might constitute a significant
barrier to the competitors' entry or growth. Grants could directly or
indirectly support changes in pricing, investment or other competitive
behaviour.
I believe that such effects could well be thought of by some non-recipients
of grants as distortions of competition in their markets. The chances of
this are increased by the National Lottery's high profile and the
substantial funds likely to be distributed. Complaints to competition
authorities seem distinctly possible.
My experience is that they consider the disbursement of subsidies carefully.
Some of the distributing bodies may need to think equally carefully about
developing appropriate guidelines to deal with these issues if they are to
avoid the authorities' investigations.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Standard not necessarily to do with
product quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN W BATEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a former business director for commodity chemicals in one of the
world's largest chemical companies, the attacks on BS 5750/ISO 9000 provide
me with a belated sense of 'I told you so' ('Quality under fire', June 21).
I regarded the so-called standards as one of the biggest con games ever
perpetrated on the chemical industry, since they did not necessarily have
anything to do with the quality of the final product or its fitness for use.
If the BS/ISO certification defines a process which is less than optimal,
product quality can be affected.
For chemical products the physical and chemical specifications agreed
between the customer and the producer should be the prime criterion. The
manner by which the producer makes the chemical or acquires it in the event
that his plant cannot produce for any reason should be irrelevant to the
customer. The guarantee to the customer must be that the product supplied is
'on spec'.
The only winners in the BS/ISO game have been those that carried out the
certification process which is unbelievably time-consuming and expensive.
An American friend of mine (also in the chemical business) assured me that
the initials 'BS' had a meaning other than 'British Standard' when the
number 5750 was involved.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fears about biotechnology are not
based on ignorance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ALAN WRELTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I feel I must take issue with David Richardson's assertion (Farmer's
Viewpoint, June 21) that fears about the adequacy of biotechnology
safeguards are 'probably based on ignorance'. While I would not dispute that
genetically modified organisms offer great potential, it is important to
appreciate that, once released into the environment, such organisms will be
outside our immediate control and, potentially, will be subject to
evolutionary and adaptive processes. One does not have to assume a
worst-case scenario, involving the transfer of genetic material between
species, to foresee problems.
For example, it is obvious to anyone that oilseed rape is colonising
set-aside land and marginal habitats, such as motorway verges. A genetically
modified, herbicide-resistant strain of this crop could prove difficult to
eradicate, presenting an insidious competitive threat to the native flora
and hence the fauna. History is littered with the good intentions of
scientists who failed to consider fully the implications of their actions.
I do not regard myself as an ignorant Luddite because I have no desire to
see the mistakes of the past repeated - I have a PhD in biology.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Book Review: Enigma at the heart of the bloke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENNETH CLARKE By Malcolm Balen Fourth Estate, 302 pages, hardback Pounds
18.99
He's blokeish, with a hail-fellow-well-met quality, always popping up on our
television screens or disturbing a quiet breakfast by trying to outshout the
presenter of BBC radio's Today programme. But Kenneth Clarke, Britain's
chancellor, is still a puzzle.
He defies easy categorisation. He hails by tradition and intellect from the
left of the Conservative party, but has nevertheless spearheaded some of the
most bruising confrontations between government and recalcitrant employees
such as doctors, ambulance workers and teachers. Although a stickler for
upholding the powers of Parliament, he has facilitated a steady increase in
the Bank of England's say in monetary policy. Then there is the sartorially
challenged Clarke with his famously crumpled suits and suede Hush Puppy
shoes. These are shouting out a message of some sort: but what?
This book, in spite or perhaps because of being 'completed with Mr Clarke's
full co-operation', leaves the reader still unclear as to what really makes
this ambitious politician tick. However, author Malcolm Balen, the editor of
BBC TV's Nine O'Clock News, has provided the next best thing in this
readable account of the ups and downs in a career that put Clarke in charge
of the UK's health, education, law and order and now the Treasury.
It would be a heroic story if John Major had not already overcome greater
handicaps in his background to become prime minister. But the tale of the
Nottinghamshire watch-repairer's son (from what Tory canvassers would
identify as a C2 skilled working-class family), who resolved early in life
to become an MP and who has climbed high enough up the Tory party's greasy
pole to eye the prime minister's job, is still sufficiently unusual and
topical to be worth telling.
Of obvious importance were the scholarship successes to the upmarket
Nottingham High School and to Cambridge, and the discovery of like-minded
souls at university who were later to form a 'Cambridge mafia' of friends
and rivals in the Tory governments of the 1970s and 1980s. A stable family
life, which Clarke takes care to keep out of the public eye, and outside
interests such as jazz have doubtless given him greater stay-ing power than
many politicians.
But the story is not without its dark moments. Clarke's mother developed a
drink problem when he was in his teens and, according to his younger brother
Michael, died an alcoholic. While Clarke's childhood appears to have been
happy enough, Balen suggests that he started early in life to fashion a
tough outer shell.
Many people in these pages describe Clarke as 'self-contained'. Balen says
his subject is 'a gregarious man who is intensely private' and 'an
uncomplicated enigma'. For Michael Clarke, 'Ken is like an iceberg. Seventy
five per cent of him is underwater. To get where he's got, he must be like
that. I'm not saying his personality is a facade - it isn't - but there's a
very large inner person. He can be very emotional. But he tends to detach
himself.'
That submerged 75 per cent no doubt helped Clarke through the frustrations
of the 1980s. As not 'one of us' he failed for many years to prosper under
Mrs Thatcher. He only entered the cabinet in 1985 and then as Commons
spokesman for the employment secretary, Lord Young. Once in high office,
Clarke developed a talent for getting into fights.
A love of controversy had always been there. The book recounts how, as head
of the Cambridge University Conservative Association, Clarke had caused an
almighty row by inviting Oswald Mosley, the head of the British fascists in
the 1930s, to speak. He rode out the storm but it delayed his rise to the
politically important post of president of the Cambridge Union, the
students' debating society. Similarly, Balen says Clarke's later battles
with doctors and ambulance workers 'set back his career and ultimately cost
him a place in the leadership race when Mrs Thatcher resigned'.
That Clarke is now chancellor is a measure of the policy failure that
culminated in sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism and
the presentational ineptitude of Norman Lamont, his immediate predecessor.
Balen's book, which finishes with Clarke's tax-raising Budget of last
November, wisely steers clear of predicting whether the chancellor will move
next door to Number 10 Downing Street. For Clarke's performance at the
Treasury will be crucial in determining whether he will one day succeed John
Major as prime minister or leader of the opposition.
Clarke has so far been both lucky and skilful in running his second (after
the Home Office) of the three great offices of state. From the hapless
Lamont, he inherited an economy with low inflation and low interest rates
that was recovering from recession. He had the guts to tackle the problem of
the annual Pounds 50bn deficit head-on through unpopular tax rises.
True, 'Clarkes' took a pounding earlier this year on the Westminster gossip
exchange when the import of the tax increases dawned. But with the economy
still growing and the setback that John Smith's death caused to the
leadership hopes of Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
Clarke's stock appears to be rising again - at least within the Tory party.
The nagging worry, which Balen's book does nothing to dispel, is whether
Clarke is an accident waiting to happen. The book chronicles how ill-
considered remarks when health secretary exacerbated his disputes with the
doctors and ambulance service. There was also the television debate after
Black Wednesday's ERM exit in which he admitted that he had never read the
Maastricht treaty.
Such mishandling can be excused and overcome in a battle against vested
interests. But will financial markets be so forgiving if they turn against
the pound and this chancellor?

FT  23 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Labels of candidates confusing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr KEITH CAMERON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, On May 12, immediately after the close of nominations, the Devon branch
of the European Movement held a public meeting at which six of the eight
candidates for the Devon and East Plymouth Euro-constituency were given
equal opportunity to speak.
One candidate, named to us over the telephone from the returning office
shortly after 4pm as the Direct Democracy Candidate, arrived at our meeting
some three hours later as the Literal Democrat. As a result of concerns
raised after the meeting, we sent a fax on May 13 to the returning officer
about the clear scope for confusion between the labels of two candidates,
already both described in Express and Echo of May 13 as Liberal Democrat. We
pointed out that this could have 'a not inconceivable pernicious effect on
the representation of this area in the European Parliament'. Our request for
clarification of the descriptions was not acted upon.
The election result fully justifies our concerns; the Literal Democrat,
unknown and with no campaigning literature, obtained some 10,000 votes by
deceiving large numbers of understandably very upset electors. The Liberal
Democrat was a mere 700 votes behind the Conservative. It should be noted
that the misleadingly described candidate was in a higher position on the
ballot than the Liberal Democrat.
In the interests of fair and proper representation my committee considers it
necessary for a new election to be held in this constituency.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Arts: Storey's 'Home' revived - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You should have seen it with Gielgud and Richardson: the people who said
that two years ago about David Leveaux's staging of Pinter's 1976 No Man's
Land can say it again now about his staging of David Storey's 1970 Home.
They are, of course, right - yet they miss the point. Home, like No Man's
Land, is less substantial without its great original double-act, but it
still holds together remarkably well. Its new cast, led by the well-known
double-act of Paul Eddington and Richard Briers, completely holds the
attention, shifting between comedy and poignance with consummate ease.
This is the more impressive, since nothing happens in Home more eventful
than a minor character lifting furniture and removing it from the stage. The
'home' of the title, the play gradually allows us to realise, is an
institution for the mentally disturbed. A large part of the play's comic
entertainment consists of wandering small talk between the two men, and a
large part of its painful impact lies in what they leave unsaid - with the
anguish they can never bring themselves to address in words.
Harry and Jack are educated and clubbable upper-middle-class types, so
sensitive that, if someone else so much as suggests that a spade might be a
spade, they hasten to discuss the weather. The play's most striking irony
lies in their conversations with the dissimilar Marjorie and Kathleen, who
are lower-class, outspoken, quite prepared to air sexual, lavatorial, and
psychological issues - and thereby expose the pathetic evasiveness of the
two men.
It was Gielgud, as Harry, whose performance left the most indelible and
affecting impression on me when in my teens I saw a TV broadcast of the
original cast. Yet Paul Eddington's account of the same role is so fully
alive to the larger mental issues that dwell amid the details of the play,
that Gielgud's ghost never haunts the stage: an exorcism even more
successful than his account of the Gielgud role in No Man's Land.
Eddington's Harry is a ravaged shell. It helps that he now looks far more
haggard than two years ago; more vital, however, is the beautiful weight of
sorrow he conveys. It is there before he speaks a word, simply as he closes
his eyes on first sitting down alone. And it is there at the end in the hush
in which he says 'The sun has set'. His mastery of comedy surfaces to
marvellous effect in tiny crises of uncertainty, as when Jack asserts that a
friend of his 'was introduced to George VI at Waterloo'. With utter tact,
yet also with appalled bewilderment, Eddington simply echoes 'Waterloo?'
'The station', Jack explains, and relief returns.
Every device in Richard Briers's armoury works to characterise Jack to fine
effect: light charm, merry chuckle, mouth hanging open in pleasant
stupidity, ingratiating cuteness, spiffing delivery of ordinary banter.
Briers does nothing wrong, but his way of tackling the role's inner misery
is flyweight. Richardson brought to the role, among other things, gravitas;
and my ear kept telling me how he surely delivered the lines. Briers's
mental pain remains hidden from us, as Eddington's does not. Nor is anything
in Briers's performance a surprise.
The roles of Marjorie and Kathleen are harder to achieve with complete
success. Storey gives them a kind of verbal shorthand, with few pronouns or
verbs, that seems mannered now. This apart, both Brenda Bruce and Rowena
Cooper catch the contradictions that make each role interesting. Bruce's
Marjorie is hard, sceptical, only occasionally revealing the tenderness that
has made her sometimes wail for days; Cooper's Kathleen hardly ever lets a
radiant grin leave her face, even as she talks of her several suicide
attempts.
In terms of the larger history of modern theatre, Home is not a momentous
play. It has clear echoes of Beckett (Waiting For Godot, Happy Days), and
its treatment of mental disturbance is scarcely radical. But so what? It is
written with such skill that the attention never flags, and its ambiguity of
tone is compelling. I have a few minor cavils about Leveaux's staging. (Some
pauses should have been weightier; the women are sometimes too close to
caricature; the role of Alfred is miscast; and one change of lighting says
too obviously 'The mood darkens'.) But everything about this 24-year-old
play is alive; the ensemble playing is exemplary; and Eddington gives one of
the finest performances now before the London public.

THE INNOCENT (18) John Schlesinger
SHOPPING (18) Paul Anderson
BEVERLY HILLS COP 3 (15) John Landis
ROBOCOP 3 (15) Fred Dekker
The tug-of-war custody hearing over the British film industry continues this
week, with important new testimony from both sides.
The evidence produced on behalf of the first party, Mr America, is the movie
Shopping. Paul Anderson's urban thriller - a loud, dark-toned, pacy British
film made in the style of that currently popular retro-genre, 'film noir' -
will be used to show that Hollywood has been powerfully influential in the
forming of modern UK screen culture.
But Miss Europe, who was of course Mr America's common-law partner until a
recent quarrel involving a Gatt, will claim that John Schlesinger's The
Innocent proves the opposite: that this version of Ian McEwan's Cold War
novel set in moody murder-prone Berlin shows that the last best hope for
British film is an alliance with our friends across the Channel. Look at the
evidence. Exhibit A: British director and leading man (Anthony Hopkins).
Exhibit B: Italian leading lady (Isabella Rossellini). Exhibit C: German
locations and co-funding.
Each side is then expected to attack the other mercilessly for its poor
record of care and guardianship. Mr America will accuse Miss Europe of
involving Britain in the deadly quagmire of the 'Euro-pudding' and will
point out certain specific shortcomings in The Innocent. Its peculiar
compote casting, for starters. Why is Sir Anthony Hopkins playing an
American army officer - with an appalling sub-James Cagney accent - while
America's Campbell Scott (better accented) plays the young British telephone
engineer Leonard, brought to Berlin in 1955 to help with an anti-Soviet
surveillance scheme?
McEwan's novel was a bizarre blend of Le Carre spy stuff with sex, passion
and murder. When Leonard falls for the German Maria (played in the film by
the Italian Miss Rossellini), a nasty encounter with her husband ends in
death and dismemberment. 'What will the lovers do with the body?' becomes
the novel's big question, until finally the object is folded cunningly,
ironically into the espionage plot.
Schlesinger's film is best when most intimate. Scott excels as the fussy,
virginal communications boffin marooned in a cut-off world - his dingy love
nest - with the distraught, high-strung girl and the carnage she brings him.
But whenever the film moves out into the 'real' world, all reality ceases.
Schlesinger promises much with a virtuoso opening tracking shot through a
crowded, babbling hotel lobby. But then the individual voices start.
Hopkins's 'You dirdy rat' American; a number of German supporting actors
dubbed into transatlantic; and finally Miss R herself, who is fine right up
to the last scene when she too is tipped into the open air. Her scene of
foggy-voiced tearful parting on a foggy airfield seems like a crazed reprise
of her mother's finest hour in Casablanca.
After Mr America has had his say about The Innocent, and the mish-mash of
vagabond ingredients typical of Euro-puddings, Miss Europe will have her say
about Shopping. She will attack the delinquent tendencies of an ex-colonial
culture based on the worship of crime and violence. Shopping which stars
Sadie Frost and Jude Law as two car-stealing 'ram-raiders,' who like to
enter shops through the shop window, is, she will point out, like Bonnie And
Clyde meets Absolute Beginners, possibly over the prone body of Blade
Runner.
Over-the-top visual atmospherics - mist and smoke, Stygian chiaroscuro,
drizzle-haloed street lights - are wedded to daft script-lines. The exchange
earning the largest giggle at the press show came when Mr Law ventures to
plant a tentative kiss on Miss Frost's lips and she says 'Cut it, Joe, this
is the 90s. Sex isn't safe anymore.' Nor, in the wrong hands, is portentous
epochal dialogue. The film is a second-rate, second-hand thriller in debt,
far beyond repayment, to its Hollywood paradigms.
The judge presiding over the custody hearing will admit that he finds this
case difficult to resolve. Each side, America and Europe, has powerful
arguments concerning the decrepit artistic standards of the other. After
long consideration, though, he has made his decision. He will award custody
to neither party. He will instead urge and if necessary compel the British
film industry to become self-reliant. For a short time it will be made a
ward of court. Then it will be required to make its own way in the world
with no more than a minimal reliance on any other nation.
It will not be allowed to beg at Number Ten Downing Street, nor to spend its
life creeping towards the EC or US for cultural resuscitation. Soon rather
than late it must learn how to please and interest other cultures and
societies, without compromising its own culture or treating its own society
as a charity institute.
After all (sums up the judge), if Four Weddings And A Funeral and The Crying
Game and A Fish Called Wanda and My Beautiful Laundrette can do it, so can
everyone else. Case dismissed.
In the week of Beverly Hills Cop 3 and Robocop 3, what better time to
distance ourselves from Hollywood? When sequel sagas hit stage three, three
things happen. Script invention plummets. Plots reach for tortured novelties
of location or motivation: in BHC3 a theme park, in R3 a whole lot of
inner-city anarchy requiring emergency policing. And favourite actors drop
out.
So no Peter Weller as Robocop. His lips and jaw - nothing else being visible
below the hydraulically whining visor - are replaced by those of Robert
Burke. And over in Beverly Hills no John Ashton, who for two films played
fat-solemn police sidekick (alongside tall-slim Judge Reinhold) to Eddie
Murphy's grinning dementia praecox case from Detroit.
Mr Murphy has now been seconded to California so often that we wonder why he
does not keep a hotel room there. Beverly Hills Cop 3 is an exhausted replay
of the old tics. Its desperation is most evident in the wheeling forth of
Bronson Pinchot, who stole Cop 1 with his fluttery, shrieking art gallery
owner and who is asked to do it again here - no, to overdo it - so that he
becomes victim rather than saviour.
Robocop 3 features another cop called Murphy (hero's name not performer's)
and also begins in Detroit. But this film has the sense to stay there. Here
is the much-loved Motown sound: not Diana Ross but the music of crashing
cars, screaming extras and our hero's bullet-zapping bio-metallic arms. Here
too, for 20 minutes of tolerable reacquaintance, is Hollywood's attempt to
force the futurist vision of Lang's Metropolis into intimacy with the
weaponry of the Star Wars era. Then, like the other film, it tailspins into
diminishing circles.
Should they not have combined the two trequels and given us Beverly Hills
Robocop? That way familiarity could have been spiced with hybridisation. And
we would have warmed to the idea of a knockabout black cop clamped in a
head-to-toe metal casing from which only the best wisdoms and witticisms
would be allowed to emerge.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Arts: Sanderling's Brahms - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gigantic themed festivals that towered over London's musical life in the
late 1980s have disappeared. In the present economic conditions the nearest
one comes to anything similar is the short series, which is never so
adventurous: the Philharmonia has scheduled a Beethoven symphony cycle next
season and a Brahms cycle to end this one.
These would not be of any import, were it not for the conductors -
Harnoncourt for the Beethoven, Kurt Sanderling for the Brahms. Keen record
collectors may have come across a cycle of the Brahms symphonies with
Sanderling and the Dresden Staatskapelle. Although the sound quality from
the original East German tapes was poor, there was no mistaking that here
was one of the two great Brahms conductors of the day.
Those performances were characterised by a strict, almost fierce, adherence
to the ideal of Brahms as a classicist. Over the years Sanderling's outlook
seems to have mellowed a little (can he really be 81 when he is only just
starting to go grey?) but the classical discipline is still in place. His
Brahms now is very much the product of maturity - wise and noble, absolutely
unforced.
What a splendid move on the part of the Philharmonia to bring him to London
for these four concerts, featuring the symphonies and the concertos. In
Tuesday's opening programme he held the First Symphony to a steady pace,
though without digging into the rhythms as trenchantly as he used to. He
also kept the Philharmonia's enthusiastic timpanist firmly under wraps.
There was to be no over-emphasis, no hammering home of climaxes too early.
Only a conductor who had years of experience would dare restrain the
symphony for so long, holding off the resolution right until the triumphal
brass chorale of the finale. In these last years Sanderling's mastery
becomes ever more subtle and unpredictable, but it is there nonetheless. The
Philharmonia, significantly Klemperer's old orchestra, played well for him.
The First Piano Concerto was more problematical. Sanderling set out at a
magisterial pace, sinking down foundations of granite. Unfortunately, the
pianist, Mitsuko Uchida, needed speed above all to compensate for her lack
of weight. The result oscillated uneasily between one type of Brahms and
another, hers headlong and shallow-toned, his patient and massive. Despite
some exquisite moments in Uchida's slow movement, I know whose side I was
on.

Prokofiev, it seems, believed that his best opera was The Fiery Angel which
he wrote in the early 1920s, though he had to wait 30 years to see it
produced. Performances are still infrequent, and those in the original
Russian very rare. However, Radio 3 provides one of those rare occasions
today with a broadcast of a performance from La Scala, Milan (7.30). It is a
five-act work, about black magic and murder in 16th century Germany. A
predominantly eastern European cast is led by soprano Galina Gorchakova. On
Radio 4 the often excellent Analysis asks whether public scares over matters
such as global warming and toxic waste are rational and why environmental
concerns take precedence over more obvious and immediate hazards (8.00). The
second episode of BBC1's drama Roughnecks, about life on a North Sea oil rig
will show whether this is just another forgettable middlebrow, middleweight
series or whether there is a bit more to it (9.30). In its True Stories slot
C4 shows an over long American home video documentary about living and dying
with Aids (9.30).

FT  23 JUN 94 / Technology: Global gallery for Irish art - Plans to use the
Internet to display paintings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIALL MCKAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Technology is an unlikely ally of art, but two private organisations in
Ireland hope to change this. They aim to promote Irish art abroad by using
digital technology to display paintings over the Internet, the international
information network.
Toppsi is a Dublin-based bulletin board system, which has its roots in
providing information systems for social services. Its founder, Martin
Maguire, wants to hold an international art exhibition over the Internet. It
will be initially targeted to 15 EU capitals and extended to include
Toronto, New York, and Los Angeles, featuring local artists from each city.
Fifty paintings will be scanned in at each site, stored on a central server
in Dublin, and then relayed over the Internet to art galleries and museums
in each city. Each site will have a high-quality printer and prints will be
sold for around Pounds 35 each.
Internet users will later be able to dial into the server in Dublin and
download images of the paintings. Maguire also plans to publish the
exhibition on CD.
Another Internet provider based in Galway on the west cost has already taken
steps to bring Irish art to the rest of the world. Ireland On-line is
running a pilot scheme for Kennys book shop and art gallery.
Kennys is well known in academic circles as a provider of Irish-interest
books. Its customers include US universities and libraries.
Kennys is also famous among the artistic community for its exhibitions of
Irish artists. Driven by the need to communicate with its US customers and a
desire to promote its art exhibitions, Kennys will put a database of all its
books on the Internet and offer a free service for people who want to go
on-line and get a sneak preview of the next exhibition. The service provides
biographies of the artists and examples of their work.
One of the artists whose work is displayed on the system is Kenneth Webb,
known for his watercolours and depictions of rural Ireland.
'In the early '60s and '70s I travelled a lot between Ireland, New York,
Paris, London and even Africa, but now I am not interested in all that. I
have my painting and my interests here so I think this is a great
opportunity to display my paintings. The beauty is that this is a visual
medium. I have never read anything that has done justice to my or anybody
else's paintings, but with this people can see for themselves.'
Webb believes there are further advantages in the concept of exhibiting
paintings on an international network. 'International art has become very
sterile; there is a sameness between paintings from almost anywhere in the
world. It's made up of the sort of paintings that architects like. I see
myself as more of an ethnic painter. I like to express the peculiarity of
the landscape around me. This (Internet) will allow painters from anywhere
in the world to be exhibited internationally.'
Barry Flannigan, head of Ireland On-Line, sees a trade-off between the
quality of the image exhibited and the cost of downloading that image. 'It's
a balance really; most computer screens have a resolution of about 75 dots
per inch but we provide 150 dots per inch and include about 250 colours,
which is a long way off being good enough to print lithographically. It's
just a taster, if the user likes the painting then they can buy it.'
Maguire has approached the problem from a different perspective, mainly
because as well as providing the images over the Internet, he plans to
produce CDs of the paintings. 'The solution is so simple and already tried
and tested. It's share ware. If people like the images then they can pay a
licence fee to the artist.'
Maguire has teamed up with the artist Paddy Graham, who says the potential
of the Internet for artists is staggering.
'The question is whether technology will inhibit the intuitive process of an
artist or simply expand it.'

FT  23 JUN 94 / People: Turton takes up arms for Citizens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A woman tipped as a future permanent secretary in Whitehall has been given
the high-profile job of fronting the prime minister's drive to smarten up
the public services. Genie Turton, deputy secretary in the environment
department, becomes director of the Cabinet Office Citizen's Charter unit on
July 11.
Turton, 48, is currently head of the cities and countryside group in the
environment department and a member of the Chancellor's Private Finance
panel.
She is one of the growing number of senior mandarins with experience of
business, gained through the Cabinet Office programme for strengthening
links between the public and private sectors. After a secondment to Midland
Bank, she was a non-executive director of the Woolwich Building Society
between 1987 and 1991.
A graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, Turton joined the ministry of
transport as a fast-stream entrant in 1970. After a spell in the Cabinet
Office as head of the machinery of government division in the early 1980s,
she became director of heritage and royal estate in the environment
department with responsibility for royal palaces such as Hampton Court and
the Tower of London. In 1991 she was promoted to deputy secretary in charge
of the department's housing and urban group. She lists her hobbies as books,
music and shopping.
She replaces Brian Hilton, who returns to his old department, Trade and
Industry, to take charge of the research laboratories. Hilton, 54, was
spirited from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1991 to
create a unit that would implement Major's Citizen's Charter. He says he has
hugely enjoyed the task of giving life to the charter: 'It is now common
currency in the language. It is inconceivable that we should ever return to
the days when there were no standards of service in the public sector, and
nobody cared whether performance targets were met.'

FT  23 JUN 94 / Technology: On-line for a speedy sale - Louise Kehoe
continues a series on electronic retailing with a look at the growth of
shopping by home computer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Want to send roses to your sweetheart, buy a new car, choose a cookbook for
your mother's birthday or purchase computer software? One of the quickest,
if not the cheapest, ways to make these purchases in the US is via on-line
computer information and communications services.
On-line computer shopping has been around for several years, but until
recently most of the products available were aimed at computer hobbyists.
Now the proliferation of home computers, with about one-third of US
households equipped with a personal computer, is attracting the attention of
a broad variety of retailers to on-line shopping as a potentially important
new sales channel.
Prodigy, the on-line service jointly owned by Sears Roebuck, the US
retailer, and International Business Machines, offers products from 125
merchants including Sears, Spiegel, Patagonia, L'Eggs tights and the US
Postal Service. On CompuServe, another on-line service, choices range from a
Brooks Brothers suit to contact lenses, life insurance or a honey-baked ham.
America On-line allows subscribers to offer their homes for sale.
Shopping centres are also being built on the Internet, a global network that
links an estimated 20m computer users. The Internet Shopping Network, for
example, offers an 'electronics superstore', offering more than 15,000
computers, software and related products.
Global Network Navigator, a free on-line service for explorers of the
Internet, has its own 'marketplace' which is supported by advertising
revenues. While nobody is predicting that computer shopping will replace
every trip to the mall, on-line merchandising is expected to grow rapidly
over the next few years as multimedia technology becomes cheaper and more
accessible to consumers.
To date, on-line shopping has generated only modest sales. Less than Dollars
200m (Pounds 132m) in goods were sold on-line in the US last year, compared
with a total of Dollars 1,500bn retail sales (of which mail order catalogues
accounted for Dollars 53bn) and Dollars 2.5bn in sales by television home
shopping channels that take orders by telephone.
However, on-line shopping will generate about Dollars 4.8bn per year by
1998, Forrester Research, a US market research company, predicts. Growth
will be driven by the proliferation of home computers and by improvements in
on-line product presentation, Forrester researchers say.
The largest US publishers and retailers are rushing to offer their products
on-line, says Gene DeRose, head of research at Jupiter Communications, a
market research company that specialises in the on-line services market.
'For media companies, getting on-line means instant communication, new
revenue streams and access to a fast-growing, high demographic customer base
hungry for new services.
'More importantly, getting on-line prepares companies for all forms of
electronic distribution while selling their products today to millions of
on-line consumers.'
The low costs of selling on-line are a big incentive for merchants. In
contrast to mail order marketing, which has high upfront costs for the
publication and distribution of catalogues, retailers selling on-line have
minimal start-up costs and typically pay only about Dollars 15,000 to
Dollars 30,000 annually to reach millions of subscribers.
The market for on-line retailing is expanding as commercial on-line computer
information and communications services such as Prodigy, America On-line and
CompuServe expand. At year-end 1993, there were 3.9m subscribers to these
services and this number should grow to about 5.2m by the end of 1994,
according to Jupiter.
And the on-line services say their shopping centres are drawing more
customers every year. The number of people coming into CompuServe's
'Electronic Mall' has increased 80 per cent this year and sales are up by
more than 30 per cent.
For consumers, the main attraction of computer shopping is convenience. The
services draw 'too busy, two-income families', say the merchants that are
selling on-line. The computer can also provide new shopping opportunities
for the house-bound or disabled, notes Peapod, a Chicago-based venture
offering grocery shopping by computer in the Chicago and San Francisco
areas.
With home computer software supplied by Peapod, San Francisco consumers can
shop at their local Safeway supermarket without leaving home. On-line
shoppers can either wander through the 'virtual supermarket' aisle by aisle,
as they might when making a weekly shopping trip, go directly to specific
types of products like coffee or cereals, or type in the name of the product
they want. Personal shopping lists, with the items you buy regularly, can
also be created.
Special requests, such as ripe bananas or fine ground coffee beans, can be
added to the shopping list. Special offers available in the store are
highlighted on-line and money-off coupons are accepted. The grocery order is
delivered at the shopper's convenience.
Bargain hunters may not, however, be impressed by computer shopping. Most of
the merchandise available on-line is priced at, or above, the prices
available in stores and delivery charges are typically added to the selling
price.
Another shortcoming of computer shopping is that it usually lacks the
pictures of products that are typically found in mail order catalogues.
Although some on-line shopping services make pictures of products available,
it typically takes several minutes to 'paint' these pictures on to a home
computer screen.
Multimedia PCs are, however, beginning to make computer shopping malls more
attractive. CompuServe, for example, recently launched a CD-Rom catalogue to
augment its on-line shopping service with pictures and videos of products
available. The combination of CD-Rom and on-line ordering may be a winner,
Forrester's market researchers believe. While each approach has its
limitations, in combination they provide the immediacy of on-line shopping
and the multimedia capabilities of CD-Rom.
Today's computer shopping services are, however, quite primitive in
comparison to the 'interactive shopping' planned by several US cable
television companies. These services will feature full video and sound and
may provide customers with 'agents' to help them shop.
You might, for example, have decided to purchase a sweater and trousers but
be unsure about which colours would look best together. Your personal
shopping 'agent' could lend a hand by displaying various combinations, or
even make the decision for you.
It may be several years, however, before interactive television shopping
becomes widely available because it will require substantial investments by
the cable television or telecommunications industry in broadband networks.
In the meantime, on-line computer shopping is drawing both retailers and
consumers in increasing numbers.
 --------------------------------------------------
         1998 MARKET MAY BE EVEN BIGGER IF:
 --------------------------------------------------
More women are attracted to on-line
Grocery delivery becomes profitable
Big-ticket items such as cars catch on
Stores give away PCs to consumbers for ordering

FT  23 JUN 94 / People: LWT millionaire quits for the BBC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nick Elliott, managing director of LWT Productions, has become the latest
senior executive to leave London Weekend Television since its takeover by
Granada earlier this year.
Elliott, who has worked at LWT for the past 22 years and played a leading
role in developing programmes such as London's Burning, Agatha Christie's
Poirot and The Charmer, is moving to the BBC as head of drama series. The
head of the drama group is Charles Denton, himself a former ITV executive.
Elliott, 50, is a close friend of John Birt, the BBC director general but it
is believed that Birt was not involved in the appointment. Elliott was
approached by a group of BBC executives including Alan Yentob, controller of
BBC1.
He made it clear yesterday that he was not leaving because of the Granada
ownership; he had actually begun his career with Granada.
After working for LWT for more than 20 years, he had decided some time ago
that he would like to change his job but for the past four years was
prevented by LWT's 'golden handcuffs' from moving.
As the former head of drama and director of programmes, Elliott benefited
greatly from a management share scheme; he made around Pounds 3.5m from it.
He says he will miss LWT greatly, but adds 'the job the BBC has asked me to
do is an exciting challenge that I could not resist'.
His appointment is an indication that the BBC is trying to strengthen its
popular drama and maintain its ratings on BBC1.
Meanwhile, the LWT board is in the process of reviewing the top management
structure of the company and says a key objective is to facilitate the
development and growth of LWT's programme production business.

FT  23 JUN 94 / People: 'Minister without portfolio' becomes chairman of
Barclays Metals Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Metals Group, part of the UK banking organisation, is gearing up
for a further phase of expansion with the appointment of Chris Green, one of
the best-known personalities in the London metals business, as chairman. It
is also recruiting Peter Sellars, at present managing director of the metals
division of BICC Cables.
Sellars becomes deputy chief executive, working alongside Laurence Jones,
also deputy chief executive of BMG, as well as managing director of Barclays
Metals Ltd, a ring-dealing member of the London Metal Exchange.
BMG has grown quickly since Barclays decided to enter the metals business
about three years ago.
Green, now 59 and with 36 years' experience in the industry, joined as a
director soon afterwards. He had previously been forced out of Cerro Metals,
where he was chief executive, because the new American owners were unhappy
about his spending so much time as chairman of the LME board.
Leaving Cerro meant that Green was no longer eligible to serve as an LME
director so he ended up losing not just one job, but two.
He said yesterday he no longer harboured ambitions for an LME appointment
and, in any case, the BMG chairmanship would give him a 'higher profile' in
the industry. He had been 'like a minister without portfolio' since joining
Barclays, in that he had no particular responsibility.
Meanwhile, Sellars' role at BMG will be to concentrate on strategic
development and Jones will continue to have responsibility for, among other
things, Barclays' LME activities. Both report to Robert Mainprize, the chief
executive.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Charged up over
competition law Why American Express's credit card promotion hit legal
barriers in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Produce a credit card in a German shop or restaurant and it is likely that
the proprietor will look at you with consternation, before explaining that
plastic is strengst verboten and that D-Marks or Eurocheques are the only
means of payment allowed.
There are just 8.9m credit and charge cards in Germany, compared with 37m in
the UK, making Germany one of the least developed plastic card markets among
Europe's leading economies. Relative to the size of the economy and its 80m
population, Germany is the most important plastic card market in Europe,
says Colm Lorigan, senior counsel for Europe at American Express
International in Frankfurt.
Cracking the market is no easy matter, though, and not only because of
deep-seated cultural hostility to credit and charge cards. Marketing tactics
which are standard in other countries can hit legal barriers in Germany, as
American Express found after launching a promotion for its product in
November last year.
That month, cardholders in Germany received with their monthly statement a
brochure outlining American Express Membership Miles, a promotional scheme
which the company has introduced in the US and other European countries. The
scheme offered members bonus points for each D-Mark they spent on the card.
These points could be used towards air travel with three airlines and hotel
accommodation.
Although the programme was successful - spending by cardmembers enrolled in
the scheme rose by 50 per cent - the promotion had to be quickly halted.
Within a week of the launch, American Express was sued by an organisation
called the Zentrale zur Bekampfung unlauteren Wettbewerbs, the Centre for
Combating Unfair Competition, a Wiesbaden-based body which has policed
Germany's competition law since early this century. The company was charged
with breaching the so-called Zugabeverordnung, a law which prevents the
offer of free gifts in connection with the sale of goods.
The Zugabeverordnung goes hand in hand with the Rabattgesetz, forbidding the
offer of certain types of discounts, and is connected with the
Ladenschutzgesetz, which limits shops' opening times.
All three laws were introduced in the early 1930s to protect small
shopkeepers from free competition, and are still popular with shopkeepers
today. Last year the government unveiled plans to abolish all three as an
unnecessary impediment to competition.
But so great was the uproar from shopkeepers and unions that Chancellor Kohl
intervened personally to ensure that Ladenschutzgesetz would remain until
after this autumn's elections. Contrary to the government's original plans,
the Zugabeverordnung and the Rabattgesetz were not abolished but merely
amended.
The amendments, passed by the German parliament last week, leave American
Express 'stranded', complains Lorigan.
Under the revised Rabattgesetz, service providers such as the Bundesbahn,
the federal railway network, or Lufthansa, the soon-to-be-privatised German
airline, can offer discounts to their own customers. But American Express is
caught by the Zugabeverordnung, which still holds that the offer of another
company's products (in this case, flights) is not permitted as a means to
boost your own sales (in this instance, spending on the American Express
card).
Lorigan said that American Express introduced the product - with launch
expenses of at least DM1m - knowing that there could be legal difficulties.
But it had hoped that the Zugabeverordnung and the Rabattgesetz would be
abolished.
The legal structure of the offer was also designed to take advantage of EU
legislation guaranteeing free trade of goods and services across European
borders: the offer to German card-members is technically administered out of
France.
But recent European Court case law has gone against American Express,
suggesting that foreign companies operating in a second country cannot claim
that their freedom to trade is being muzzled if domestic competitors suffer
the same restrictions.
While American Express prepares an intensive lobbying campaign in the US and
Europe to support its case, Lorigan claims that it has suffered
discrimination at the hands of the Zentrale because it is a foreign company.
He notes that the bonus scheme started by Lufthansa - the Miles and More
promotion which has attracted 900,000 members since last year - was
permitted by the Zentrale last year even when it was manifestly in breach of
the Rabattgesetz.
Marcel Kisseler, head of the Zentrale, dismisses the claim. He says the
American Express scheme is in breach of the Zugabeverordnung.
After an unsuccessful appeal against the original lawsuit, American Express
is now permitted to continue with the service, but not to advertise it. This
means that it is effectively dead as a promotions tool, and will remain so
for years as litigation with the Zentrale continues.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Back from the brink
 -Norwich Union's troubles in an increasingly tough regulatory market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At least there was no army of aggrieved consumers. But the public relations
crisis facing Norwich Union this summer in the wake of its highly
embarrassing regulatory troubles has been serious by any standards.
The problem first surfaced publicly on 29 March when the company, one of the
UK's largest insurers, announced that its 600-strong direct life insurance
and pensions sales force, as well as some 200 sales agents in companies
acting for the insurer, were being temporarily suspended for retraining.
That statement came some months after NU had identified serious weaknesses
in its selling process which it had begun working to rectify. Unfortunately
for the company its initial plans were overtaken by Lautro, the regulator
for the life insurance industry, which insisted on more radical remedial
action, including taking the sales force off the road for a month.
The March announcement meant that NU had to deliver an effective training
programme within a short space of time. It then had to cope with another
blast of bad publicity at the end of April, when Lautro imposed a record
fine of Pounds 300,000 on the insurer for its failures to meet proper
standards.
The new training programme is made up of three elements. The first entails
sitting the Financial Planning Certificate, the basic qualification for
independent financial advisers, which is administered by the Chartered
Insurance Institute.
The second is a test of knowledge of Norwich Union products, covering both
regulatory issues and the products themselves.
The third test involves a residential sales skills course, based on videoed
role play: a sales agent interviews a colleague acting as a client and has
to gather enough information to make a recommendation. The following day
there is another videoed interview, in which the recommendation is put to
the 'client'.
While the sales skills assessment has been praised by those who have taken
part in it, NU has faced some criticism from participants for relying too
much in the rest of the programme on sales agents studying by themselves and
not enough on lectures.
Gary Cornish was among the 60 per cent of NU sales agents who passed all
elements of the course at the first attempt. 'The (sales skills) course was
very well done. Before that course it was ludicrous, we were just told to
read the manuals,' he says.
One extra difficulty faced by NU was managing the introduction of a single
training programme for both the direct sales force and appointed
representatives - firms of financial advisers who do not work for NU
directly but act solely for the insurer. Previously there had been two.
Philip Scott, NU life and pensions general manager, says that the appointed
representatives, used to running their own businesses, were in some cases
less inclined than the direct sales force to be told by NU how they should
sell life insurance and pensions.
Significantly perhaps, the pass rate for all elements of the training
programme at the first attempt was lower among appointed representatives -
at 40 per cent.
Robin Sainty, who runs Integrated Business Analysis which acts for NU, has a
rather different perspective. His team of advisers has all passed the
training programme and is enthusiastic about the changes to the training.
But he is sharply critical of the way in which NU reached this point.
'We were very angry, particularly because we felt it was avoidable,' he
says. 'There were enough people telling NU they were not happy with the
quality of training.' He believes the failure to act earlier was a symptom
of a more general malaise of 'corporate arrogance'.
Scott and Jayne-Anne Gadhia, who set up the training arrangements, emphasise
the benefits to those who have passed the programme. 'The vast majority of
them are proud of their achievement because they know they have been through
a testing process,' Scott says.
Whether that sense of pride is as strong for those who manage to succeed
only at later attempts remains to be seen. Over the coming weeks the final
stragglers will return to selling, while those who have failed at their last
chance lose their authorisation.
Even among the first successful sales agents, there have been mixed feelings
as they meet negative reactions from customers.
'When I first came back I was very pleased to have passed all the exams, but
that has been followed by several lows,' says Stewart Davidson, who joined
NU last autumn, as he talks of decisions deferred and customers who have
gone elsewhere in the meantime.
Sainty reports some negative feedback from potential, if not existing,
customers, though he sees a longer-term benefit from the improvements in the
sales process. 'The next couple of months will inevitably be a bit sticky,
but then we will be back beyond where we were: September is my target date
for getting back into full swing,' he says.
NU can take comfort from knowing that although it has been the first to face
this difficulty, in an increasingly harsh regulatory climate, it is unlikely
to be the last life insurer to do so.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Accountancy: Independence not a suitable case for treatment
 -Walter Schuetze discusses the tensions he sees between companies and their
auditors on this issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WALTER SCHUETZE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As chief accountant of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, I want to
raise a matter that I have found personally very troubling: the issue of
auditor independence.
The commission has stated repeatedly that the independence of auditors, both
in appearance and in fact, is crucial to the credibility of financial
reporting and to the capital formation process.
Independence is an abstract concept, and it is difficult to define either
generally or in its peculiar application to the certified public accountant.
Essentially it is a state of mind. It is partly synonymous with honesty,
integrity, courage and character.
Objective standards of independence have been introduced into the
accountancy profession's ethical codes. It is not enough for members to do
what they think is right. They must also avoid behaviour which could lead to
an inference that they might be subject to improper influences. The
profession must be like Caesar's wife. To be suspected is almost as bad as
to be convicted.
One issue that has vexed and bewildered me since I came to the commission
two years ago is that of auditors not standing up to their clients on
financial accounting and reporting issues when their clients take a position
that is, at best, not supported in the accounting literature or, at worst,
directly contrary to existing accounting pronouncements.
To me, auditors giving way to their clients or subordinating their views to
their clients', raises a nasty issue about independence, both in appearance
and in fact. In my opinion, an auditor's independence is jeopardised as much
by his or her subordinating judgment about a financial accounting and
reporting issue as it is by investing in securities issued by a client,
loaning money to a client, or borrowing money from a client - perhaps even
more so.
At least insofar as money matters are concerned, if there were disclosure to
the investor about that fact, then the investor would be on notice and could
be guided by the facts, although I would definitely not advocate such an
approach.
Not so with the subordinated judgment, which is insidious. There is no way
to communicate impaired or coloured judgment. No disclosure about it ever
could be complete, or be trusted. Nor is there any way for an investor to
make judgments about the effect of impaired judgment on the part of the
auditor.
It is true that many new and complex issues reach my desk because there is
an honest difference of opinion based on well-reasoned positions on all
sides. In these cases, the staff works with the registrants and their
auditors to resolve those issues through discussion, analysis of analogous
literature, and compromise in many cases. Addressing those kinds of issues
is a challenging and interesting part of my job, and I encourage registrants
and their auditors to continue to bring these issues to the staff.
I also am aware (because I worked in public practice for many years) of the
thousands of decisions that are made by auditors in their work where they
insist on adjustments to financial statements that reduce net assets and
income, or otherwise insist on financial statement reporting and disclosures
that managements of their clients would rather not make - none of which is
ever publicised.
However, there have been too many times when accounting arguments made by
registrants lack any reasonable foundation and, without being able to cite
any authoritative support for the registrant's position, the auditor has
acquiesced.
In the last two years, many such proposals have reached us from registrants
and their auditors. And they are not supported by just an engagement partner
in a firm without consultation within the firm, but by partners from the
national offices of the firms as well.
Take the airline company which, with the support of its current and
replacement auditors, proposed to classify as a current asset at the most
recent balance sheet date the portion of the deferred costs on aircraft
overhaul that were to be amortised to expense in the next year. Or the
company that proposed to report an adjustment to tax liabilities that it
discovered had been understated in a business it bought; not in its income
statement in periods prior to the business combination, but in the
adjustments arising in purchase accounting.
It also appears to me that accountants may have become cheerleaders for
their clients on the issue of accounting for stock options issued to
employees. In 1978, six of the then Big Eight accounting firms wrote to the
Financial Accounting Standards Board suggesting that it should reconsider
the accounting rules for stock options granted to employees.
In 1984 and 1985, when the FASB began reconsidering the issue, all but one
of the Big Eight wrote supporting both a reconsideration of the accounting
rules and a charge to compensation cost/expense for all options granted to
employees.
But, in February 1993, even before the FASB issued its exposure draft on the
subject on June 30 1993, all of the Big Six accounting firms joined forces
with certain members of industry and a group of users to recommend to the
FASB that there be no formal recognition for the cost of stock options.
The firms did not offer an explanation for their change of mind. Anyone
could change their mind; I have done so on several accounting issues over
the years. But I think the public deserves an acknowledgement by the firms
and the reason why.
Such a change in position, without a corresponding change in the underlying
concepts and issues that led the firms and the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants initially to support the board's project, has
left some members of the public with the impression that the switch was in
response to the fear of losing clients or other forms of retaliation.
Could continuation of these trends be anything other than an invitation to
Congress, the SEC and other regulators to regulate more heavily, and
directly, the auditing profession in particular and financial accounting and
reporting in general? Could it lead investors, particularly institutional
investors, to find alternative ways to corroborate issuers' representations
in their financial statements?
The examples cited represent a small - some might even argue insignificant -
number of exceptions to the generally outstanding manner in which the
profession carries out its duties as public watchdog. But individual
practitioners and firms need to be mindful that the number of such instances
that may poison the well with regulators, legislators, investors, and the
public is small indeed.
These comments do not come from an ivory tower. I have lived and worked in
the accounting profession for more than 30 years. I know the realities of
saying 'no' to a client. I know the disappointment some clients express when
the auditor makes a decision to support an accounting proposal that may
reduce those clients' reported earnings. I know the long and often heated
phone calls and client visits, the strain, and the financial cost that
follow such decisions.
But I also know the rewards: a clean conscience and not having to worry
about losing law suits based on the merits, and pride in the profession and
the credibility of financial accounting and reporting.
I hope that the profession and registrants will, through self-restraint,
take a fresh look at these independence issues and let nothing stand in the
auditor's way of telling the truth as he or she sees it.
The views expressed by Mr Schuetze are a condensation of a speech given by
him in January in his personal capacity and are not necessarily those of the
SEC.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Traffic 'defies road-cash solution'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 50 per cent increase in government road spending would not be enough to
prevent an increase in traffic congestion, says a report commissioned by the
British Roads Federation.
The report, by Professor Douglas McWilliams, head of the Centre for Business
and Economic Research, says that increasing the road budget of about Pounds
2bn a year by a further Pounds 1bn would still lead to a 4 per cent rise in
congestion by the year 2010. If present spending plans were maintained
congestion would increase by just more than 10 per cent.
The federation said it wanted to quantify the impact of road spending to
head off the threat of cuts in the next Budget.
Ms Joan Walley, who speaks for Labour on transport, said the report failed
to take account of the need to set roads in a wider policy framework
including improved public transport and better land-use planning.
The report, which was issued yesterday, says more road spending would have a
positive impact on the economy with a 50 per cent increase leading to an
annual saving of Pounds 4bn on the costs incurred by road users by 2010. A
50 per cent cut in road spending would increase annual costs to road users
by Pounds 6bn by 2010. Just over half of these costs would be incurred by
industry.
The report says higher road spending would have environmental implications
but these would be far outweighed by cost savings. Much new building
involves improvements to roads which reduce congestion and cut pollution. If
road spending were to increase by 50 per cent the environmental cost would
amount to only 2 per cent of the cost savings.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Immediate rate rise unlikely: Treasury minutes show 'broad
agreement' between Clarke and George
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'bias towards easing' in monetary policy appears to be over, but an
immediate increase in interest rates is unlikely, the Treasury disclosed
yesterday.
Minutes of the monthly monetary meeting held on May 4 show that Mr Kenneth
Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England,
agreed that 'it was not appropriate to change interest rates at the moment'.
When the first set of minutes was published in April, it was revealed that
the chancellor and governor had adopted a 'bias towards easing' in monetary
policy, indicating that further rate cuts might be made. But at the May
meeting the two men seemed to move towards a more neutral policy.
The minutes show Mr George saying that 'it now seemed less likely (although
still not impossible) that interest rates would need to be cut further in
order to prevent an increase in spare capacity. There was no longer a clear
bias towards easing policy, but also no case (at least for the present) for
a tightening either'. The chancellor is then described as being 'in broad
agreement'.
The governor has since indicated, in his Mansion House speech, that a
pre-emptive rise in interest rates, designed to prevent inflationary
pressures from building, might be necessary at some point.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg, said: 'The conditions are not
yet in place for a rate rise. To get one in the next three to four months,
we need something fundamental to change in the economy.'
The May minutes, however, show the governor and chancellor as still having
different views on inflation.
Mr George said that 'while inflation was likely to remain subdued in the
near term, there were some risks surrounding the prospect further ahead'. He
pointed to strong monetary growth, inflationary expectations and the rise in
average earnings. But the chancellor said 'the rise in earnings growth in
recent months had been anticipated'.
They concluded that there was little evidence that tax rises had derailed
the recovery. Indeed, it was possible that the level of output was being
under-recorded in official estimates. 'The strength of M0 and the continuing
falls in unemployment could be consistent with stronger activity.'
Mr Clarke said: 'It would not be surprising if there was some short-term
reaction to the tax changes. But at this stage there were no signs of a
sharp fall in consumption.'

FT  23 JUN 94 / Funds invest record Pounds 15bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net investment by UK institutions rose by Pounds 2.2bn in the first quarter
of this year to a record Pounds 15.4bn, the Central Statistical Office said
yesterday.
The main beneficiaries were UK government securities with a net inflow of
Pounds 5.2bn, the highest quarterly figure since at least the fourth quarter
of 1992. UK pension funds accounted for the majority of this inflow,
investing Pounds 3.3bn - more than the figure for the whole of 1993.
Mr Neil Badger, a CSO statistician, said it was unclear what had accounted
for the shift, although the perception that the UK stock markets were
overvalued may have played a role, as well as the higher yields offered on
the government's heavy calendar of gilts offerings.
Anecdotal evidence from the pensions industry suggests that increasing use
of asset/ liability models may have been a factor.
An increasing proportion of UK pension-scheme members are receiving pensions
or have frozen pensions after redundancy or a move to a new employer.
Pension-scheme actuaries have called on schemes to match liabilities to
these current and deferred pensioners to fixed-income securities and pare
their holdings of equities.
The CSO said pension funds had a net disinvestment in UK equities of Pounds
561m in the first quarter, continuing a trend which began in the third
quarter of last year. They increased holdings of overseas equities by a net
Pounds 178m, reducing holdings of foreign government bonds by Pounds 289m.
Net investment by pension funds increased in the first quarter to Pounds
2.3bn from Pounds 0.9bn in the fourth quarter of last year, the highest
level for investment since the second quarter of 1992.
Anecdotal evidence from the industry suggests that corporate pension
'contributions holidays' financed by hefty surpluses are running out.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Clarke stays tough on public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will tell cabinet colleagues today that
improvements in the public sector deficit do not signal a trend change and
give no room for easing the government's tough approach to public spending.
When the cabinet gathers to discuss the spending plans for 1995-96 and the
two following financial years, the chancellor is expected to underline that
the 'control totals' of Pounds 263bn for the coming financial year and
Pounds 272.3bn for 1996-97 are ceilings which the government should try to
undershoot.
The Treasury is taking no comfort from the final 1993-94 public sector
borrowing requirement of Pounds 46bn compared with the November Budget
target of Pounds 50bn, nor from the drop in the PSBR for the first two
months of 1994-95 to Pounds 8.5bn from Pounds 9.4bn in April and May last
year.
Today's cabinet meeting comes amid growing pressure both inside and outside
Whitehall for a tough new line on public expenditure.
It is a time-honoured ritual to forecast very tough bargaining at the
beginning of every spending round. But officials say the state of the public
finances will make for especially difficult negotiations between the
spending departments and the Treasury between now and the Budget at the end
of November.
Pressure from Tory MPs for tax cuts before the next general election will
reinforce the need for a new clampdown on spending. In spite of the
Conservatives' poor performance in the European elections, Mr Clarke has
insisted that taxes can only be cut if a firm lid is kept on expenditure.
Today's meeting will review policies and prospects. It will confirm the
membership of the powerful EDX cabinet committee, which is chaired by the
chancellor and has the final say about how to share out spending totals
among departments.
More detailed analysis of departmental spending programmes will come later
this year. But the Treasury's fundamental expenditure reviews of Whitehall
departments have already thrown up areas which will be closely examined.
The Department of Social Security, whose Pounds 85bn of annual expenditure
makes it the biggest-spending ministry in Whitehall, may come under pressure
to reduce its housing benefit budget. Other areas being examined include
legal aid, the costs of running the courts and the merging of work done by
the Inland Revenue and Customs &amp; Excise.
One minister suggested yesterday that there would also be a tough clampdown
on departmental running costs and, in particular, public-sector pay next
year.
On the public finances, Treasury officials have said that the 1993-94 budget
deficit was smaller than expected for special reasons. Measures announced in
late 1992, for example, encouraged local authorities to boost receipts from
council house sales in the period to the end of 1993 and encouraged a large
Pounds 2.9bn debt repayment by them in 1993-94.
The Treasury believes it is too soon to draw any positive conclusions from
the fall in the PSBR so far this year or predict an undershoot of the
1994-95 target of Pounds 37.9bn. Government officials say it is 'striking'
that faster-than-expected economic growth has so far failed to increase
revenues or lower government spending, while lower-than-expected inflation
is depressing government receipts.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Sickert nude is sold for Pounds 155,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The Beribboned Washstand', one of the first major nude studies by Walter
Sickert, sold for Pounds 155,000 at Sotheby's yesterday. Painted in 1904 in
Venice it shows a pensive model in a cheap bedroom and sold at the top of
its estimate.
It came from a collection of 16 works by Sickert, and all but two found
buyers, while 'La Bonne Fille' almost doubled its estimate at Pounds
106,500.
'Dockside Cafe, Marseilles', painted by Edward Burra in 1929, and depicting
sailors in a bar, made Pounds 111,500, while 'The Striped Blouse' by Henry
la Thangue sold at the bottom of its estimate for Pounds 84,000.
The auction of 20th-century British art totalled Pounds 1.84m and was 32 per
cent unsold. There were signs that confidence is slowly returning to this
sector of the art market. For example, 'The Green Gate' by Paul Nash found
no takers when Sotheby's offered it at auction last year with a Pounds
20,000 reserve. Yesterday it sold for Pounds 31,050.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Four vie for docks project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Docklands Development Corporation has shortlisted four developers
to submit proposals for a Pounds 100m exhibition centre in the Royal Docks.
The London International Exhibition Centre; Earls Court and Olympia; SAIR
(Studi di Architettura &amp; Ingegneria Ruiniti); and Collective Development
Consortium International are due to submit detailed design and financial
proposals by the end of September.
A study for the development corporation concluded that the Royal Victoria
Dock site had potential to accommodate about 100,000 sq m of exhibition
space, with adjacent conference and hotel facilities.
The corporation may invest its land in return for an equity share in the
project.
It said it intended to announce the successful bidder before the end of the
year. Work is expected to start on the site late next year, and the first
phase of the exhibition centre could open by 1998.

FT  23 JUN 94 / CBI urges cut in government's 1995-96 public expenditure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday urged the government to cut
Pounds 5bn from its 1995-96 public expenditure control total of Pounds 263bn
as part of a programme to support the recovery, Peter Norman writes.
The CBI said the government should:
Stick to the goal of holding central government running costs constant in
real terms.
Make spending departments more accountable for their budgets, so that cost
overruns in one area would be funded by savings elsewhere.
Bear down on the public-sector wage bill while allowing pay rates to reflect
improved productivity.
Such steps would allow the government to cut the contingency reserves which
are part of its spending totals. The CBI suggested a cut of Pounds 5bn in
next year's reserve to Pounds 2bn.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Obituary of Jocelyn Hambro: Innovative merchant banker and
dauntless risk taker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jocelyn Hambro MC, of Hambros Bank and JO Hambro, died on Sunday aged 75.
His death ends the era of merchant bankers based in a family bank and
prepared to take risks in all areas of investment.
He once said: 'Merchant bankers aren't supposed to be conventional bankers;
merchant bankers are supposed to be risk takers, as opposed to joint stock
(clearing) bankers who rarely take a risk and still manage to lose money.'
Jocelyn Olaf Hambro was born on March 7 1919 in Upper Brook Street, London.
His father Olaf was a director of Hambros Bank and chairman from 1932 to
1960. His mother Winifred (nee Martin-Smith) - who drowned in a boating
accident on Loch Ness in August 1932 - was also from a banking family.
Jocelyn was sent to Summerfields and then to Eton.
At Eton he was a capable student and developed his taste for horse racing,
at one time becoming the school bookmaker. In 1936 he went to Heidelberg to
study languages before going to Trinity College, Cambridge.
In August 1944, having landed with the Coldstream Guards in Normandy, he was
wounded by a British shell. Both legs were severely damaged: the right was
saved but the left was amputated.
In 1945 he joined Hambros Bank in Bishopsgate. He was sent to America to
promote UK exports. After a spell with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York,
he travelled extensively selling franchises for MG cars and setting up the
Hambro Automotive Corporation in 1947, with sales of Pounds 61,000 growing
to Pounds 90m by 1960.
Throughout the 1950s, as a director of Hambros, he gathered expertise in
loans, flotations and public offerings.
But in 1959 the bank faced a crisis of identity as Hambros lost the fight
with Warburgs for British Aluminium in the 'Aluminium War' which set the
'gentlemen' merchant bankers against the new 'players'.
Jocelyn Hambro learned from this, and as director and chairman of the bank
(1965-1972) aggressively developed the bank's investment and corporate
finance capacity. He initiated the Eurobond and Eurodollar market with a
Eurodollar bond for Norges Kommunalbank in January 1963. The market grew
with Hambros, SG Warburg and NM Rothschild as leaders.
In 1968 Hambros formed the first consortium bank in London.
In 1970 he founded Hambro Life - the unit-based life assurance company  -
with Mark Weinberg and his team from Abbey Life. By 1975 Hambro Life assets
were Pounds 335m, and in 1976 the bank sold its share to cover losses on
Norwegian tanker loans after the oil crisis of the early 1970s.
Jocelyn Hambro was a diverse merchant banker: he developed the bank's direct
investment and venture capital divisions; maintained an interest in diamond
and bullion broking through I. Hennig &amp; Co and Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid; in mining
though his directorship of Charter Consolidated; and in insurance through
his directorship of Phoenix Assurance (1952-77) and his chairmanship from
1978.
In 1986 after 14 years as chairman and president of Hambros plc, Jocelyn
Hambro, with his three sons, Rupert, Richard and James, decided to leave the
family bank to set up the investment house JO Hambro. They sold their shares
in Hambro Trust, which controlled Hambros plc.
In business, Jocelyn Hambro was a calm, discreet man with a dry wit. He
welcomed new ideas and fitted them to old traditions. He had capacity and
vision to take risks and explore new forms of investment.
He was a supporter of several charities, including Henry Smith's charity,
for which he was chairman from 1978 to 1990. He also supported the Cancer
Relief Macmillan Fund and the Britta Dolan Memorial Cancer Fund. His first
wife, Silvia Muir, and his second wife, the Duchess of Roxburghe (who was
chairman of The Cancer Relief Macmillan Fund for 25 years) both died of
cancer.
He established the National Cancer Day Society in 1967 and the Hambro
Businessman of the Year Lunch in 1969.
He leaves a wife, Margaret, and three sons from his first marriage.
Andrew St George is the author of JOH, the privately printed biography of
Jocelyn Hambro.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Bottomley sparks row over hospital beds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, was yesterday at the centre of
a political row over the National Health Service after she forecast a
reduction of 50,000 beds by the year 2002.
Mrs Bottomley told the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts
conference in Brighton that surgical advances would make many hospital stays
unnecessary.
She said keyhole surgery would account for 80 per cent of operations by
2002, while 60 per cent of operations would be carried out on a day-care
basis.
The figures demonstrated a 'dramatic shift in the balance between the
hospital and the community', she said. A reduction of 50,000 beds would
amount to 40 per cent of existing capacity.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said Mrs Bottomley was right
to draw attention to the potential impact of techniques such as keyhole
surgery on demand for beds. But he said the NHS internal market in health
services had made sensible planning impossible because hospitals were
'obsessed with commerce and accountancy'.
Mr Blunkett said hospital waiting lists had risen by a third in 10 years
because of the government's 'muddled' approach to the NHS. 'All we have to
show for the Tory vision of the NHS is a vast increase in management and
bureaucracy. Cutting so many more beds while waiting lists remain so high
will not help patients.'
The row over beds follows sustained criticism of Mrs Bottomley's handling of
a reorganisation of London's health services, which involves closing some
well-known hospitals.
She is also involved in a dispute with Mr Peter Lilley, the social services
secretary, over the treatment of single mothers.
The growing criticism of her performance has fuelled persistent rumours that
Mr John Major, the prime minister, will move her to another portfolio in the
cabinet reshuffle expected soon.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Council performance varies widely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some local authorities in England and Wales promise to answer the telephone
within four seconds - but others are prepared to leave it ringing for a
minute.
Several other examples of widely varying targets for councils are revealed
today by the Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog, in a report
preparing for the compulsory publication of performance indicators this
year.
Targets for answering letters also show inconsistencies. The Isle of Wight
undertakes to answer all letters within three working days. Sunderland aims
for five weeks and Easington, in County Durham, has a target of six weeks
for a full response - although acknowledgements must be sent within seven
working days.
Surrey county council undertakes to answer the telephone within 60 seconds -
although the authority now realises this was unambitious, and will cut the
target to 20 seconds. North Yorkshire expects its staff to answer within
four seconds.
Typical targets are for letters to be answered within 10 days and telephones
within 15 seconds. Councils will have to publish details of how often they
achieve the targets.
Mr Paul Vevers, associate director of the commission, said 93 per cent of
authorities had set targets, which mostly compared well with private-sector
targets - for example, British Gas aims to answer telephone calls within 30
seconds.
He said response times could often be cut with minimal investment in
electronic logging systems for telephones, or extra staff training.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Blair's manifesto to stress continuity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair will today seek to consolidate his lead in the contest to
succeed John Smith as Labour leader with a personal manifesto focusing on
individual opportunity and civic responsibility, Kevin Brown writes.
Mr Blair, shadow home secretary, will present himself as the candidate best
able to blend continuity with the leadership of John Smith and fresh
policies to carry Labour into the next century.
In a passage inspired by the success of President Bill Clinton's election
campaign, Mr Blair will stress the need for Labour to develop ways of
managing the industrial and social changes facing the UK.
He will also argue that Labour should explicitly commit itself to achieving
a balance of rights and responsibility within the community, expressly
rejecting the view that society owes an automatic debt to individuals.
The manifesto will argue that individual rights, distorted by 15 years of
Conservative government, can only be fully realised in the context of a
community in which individuals accept responsibilities to each other and to
the state.
But Mr Blair will also stress the need for Labour to offer security to
individuals in a rapidly changing world in which people of all social
classes have suffered dislocation.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Political Notebook: Shattered dreams of job security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Politicians always take time to catch up with the real world. So we should
not be surprised that they are only now beginning to grasp the political
implications of the revolution in Britain's employment market.
Rapid technological advance, deregulation and below-trend economic growth
have created an unnerving new force in society that will shape politics into
the next century.
It is called job insecurity. Its advance into the ranks of the affluent
working and the middle classes marks the end of the post-war life plan: the
reassuring assumption that the employed could rely on an uninterrupted and
steadily rising stream of income throughout their working lives.
Mortgage repayments, comfortable retirement pensions and school fees can no
longer be taken for granted. Long-term employment prospects have replaced
house prices as the favourite topic of conversation around the dining tables
of the tortured middle classes.
The economics have been obvious for some time. As the former chancellor
reminded us in a lecture this week, employment market flexibility was at the
heart of Lord Lawson's supply-side revolution during the 1980s.
The erosion of trade union powers, decentralisation of pay bargaining and
globalisation of markets all pulled in the same direction. So too did the
shifts in business organisation, led by the explosion of information
technology. Government policy and market outcomes have been mutually
reinforcing.
The low paid were the first to be hit. For unskilled workers the hope, let
alone the expectation, of a job for life evaporated in the 1980s. Wages have
been driven down to levels that worry even the most fervent apostles of the
market.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, acknowledged this week the
disturbing impact of low pay on family life. Lord Lawson floated the idea of
a large-scale extension of income support payments.
But it is the impact higher up the income scale that has real political
implications. The aspirant classes are discovering that the obverse of
flexibility is insecurity.
The economy's emergence from recession has confirmed the change as
structural rather than cyclical. Short-term employment contracts, part-time
working and early redundancy have become permanent features of the labour
market.
They no longer affect only the poor. The computer manager is as likely as
the contract cleaner to discover his or her job is guaranteed only for the
next two or three years.
The trend is irreversible. A return to fuller employment in the recovery
stage of the economic cycle will not bring with it the security that
post-war generations have taken for granted.
Politicians on left and right have begun to explore the implications. Mr
Kenneth Clarke devoted his recent Mais lecture to the subject. Mr Tony Blair
has made it a theme of his leadership campaign.
Both men set out their goal as full employment. They defined it in terms of
the 1944 white paper: a commitment to a high and stable level of employment.
But politicians have been more comfortable describing what is happening than
offering analysis or prescription.
The Conservatives have the most to lose. The party's political success in
southern England has been based largely on meeting the aspirations of
skilled blue-collar and white-collar workers. Now the market will no longer
deliver. British workers are about to learn the lesson faced by their US
counterparts during the 1980s: there is no longer a guarantee that their
children will have a better standard of living than they have had.
In the US, President George Bush paid the price when Mr Bill Clinton
promised 'managed change'. In Britain the Tories face the same threat. A cut
of 1p in the basic rate of income tax does not have quite the same resonance
for a family wondering how long it can rely on a stable income.
Mr Clarke recognised the danger with a strong defence in his Mais lecture of
the welfare state. He offered a commitment to 'active' labour market
intervention: the education and skills training essential to frequent career
changes.
Mr Blair, though, has the advantage. He will not find solutions in
re-regulation of the employment market or in old-fashioned industrial
interventionism. But the language of individualism has lost its appeal in
the uncertain 1990s.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Patten threatens schools with closure: Ultimate sanction may
be used if curriculum test results are not produced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday threatened schools in
England and Wales with closure if they did not provide results of national
curriculum tests.
His comments led to fierce responses from opposition politicians and
teachers' unions. Most schools appear not to have taken the tests this year
after a boycott by the National Union of Teachers.
Under Mr Patten's plans, released in a consultative document, schools in
areas which already have large numbers of surplus places may be closed.
However, he aims to maintain 'choice, quality and diversity', and will use
test results, among other criteria, to determine quality.
He said: 'If I haven't in a certain school got any indication of quality
because I don't have any test results, then it's impossible for me to say
that a school deserves to be expanded.'
But some schools will be allowed to expand - and new schools could be
started - in areas with surplus places if they were judged to be of high
quality.
The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities described the
threat as 'outrageous' and said that Mr Patten would be open to a legal
challenge if decisions on school closures were made on the basis of test
results.
Mr Doug McAvoy, the NUT general secretary, described the threat as
'blackmail'.
The school population in England and Wales is expected to rise by 14 per
cent by the end of the decade.
Mr Patten's plan provoked claims that he would add to the national total of
1.3m surplus school places, which were estimated in January 1991 to cost the
exchequer Pounds 313m.
Government loans will be available for parents' associations that wish to
promote their own new schools.
Under rules announced in December the government will fund 85 per cent of
the costs of setting up a new school, if promoters - such as businesses, and
religious or parents' groups - produce the remaining 15 per cent.
In April Mr Patten said that 700,000 surplus places could easily be shed in
England and Wales.
Mrs Ann Taylor, who speaks for Labour on education, said the change in
policy flew in the face of 'all that ministers have said about the urgent
need to reduce surplus places'.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said that growing popular schools would need funding guarantees if
they were allowed to expand, while neighbouring unpopular schools would
suffer a 'slow, lingering death'.

FT  23 JUN 94 / C&amp;G gains room for manoeuvre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society appeared to have been given some
more room for manoeuvre yesterday in devising a lawful way of distributing
the Pounds 1.8bn cash offered by Lloyds Bank for the society.
Sir Donald Nicholls, the Vice-Chancellor, said C&amp;G depositors and staff
could be given cash payments, whether or not they were members of the
society.
The point at issue had been the position of depositors and staff of the
society who could vote on the Lloyds offer but could not lawfully receive
cash payments as members.
Two weeks ago Sir Donald ruled that Lloyds could not pay cash to C&amp;G
investors who had been shareholders for less than two years, or to borrowers
who were members of the society.
He also said then that in principle if members were prepared to approve
payments to employees, depositors and pensioners, that was up to them.
C&amp;G needs the consent of 75 per cent of its shareholders for any takeover to
proceed. Its borrowing members must approve the deal separately.
Yesterday's decision marked the formal conclusion of the legal challenge by
the Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, to the
Lloyds bid.
Sir Donald emphasised that his declaration related only to the particular
C&amp;G scheme that had been the subject of the action.
Mr Jonathan Sumption QC, putting the case for C&amp;G, had said that the issue
arose where someone had more than one relationship with the society. He gave
the examples of an employee who had recently become a shareholder through
opening an investment account, and of someone who had a deposit account but
also had a mortgage with the C&amp;G.
In each case, the person would qualify for a payment in their first
capacity. In their second capacity they would have a vote on whether to
approve the Lloyds offer but would not qualify for a cash payment under the
terms of the previous judgment.
Mr Sumption said it would be artificial to give different treatment to
people who were identically placed as employees simply because one had
opened a share account more than two years ago, and one had opened a share
account less than two years ago.
Mr Phillip Heslop QC, for the commission, said that since the original
scheme could not proceed unless there were a successful appeal against the
judgment, it would be better to make no specific ruling on this issue so
that the matter could be addressed in the context of an amended C&amp;G scheme
or a future transaction.
Mr Heslop said that even though the terms of the court order would be
directed to the C&amp;G scheme, a ruling that someone could receive a cash
payment in a non-voting capacity while being excluded from such a payment in
their voting capacity brought the possibility that other transactions might
seek to circumvent the judgment's intention.
But Sir Donald said that he had to focus on this point in making his
judgment, and that it would be wrong not to make it plain.
Either C&amp;G or the commission could seek leave to appeal.

FT  23 JUN 94 / 'Bias' in Labour authority slammed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Helen Liddell, the Labour candidate in the Monklands East by-election
caused by the death of John Smith, said yesterday she would fight to rectify
bias in the allocation of spending by the district council.
She confronted the most explosive issue of the campaign for Labour - the
long-standing allegation that Labour-controlled Monklands district council
favours the town of Coatbridge at the expense of next-door Airdrie in its
capital spending. Airdrie is at the centre of Monklands East constituency,
near Glasgow, where polling takes place next Thursday.
The issue, sometimes known as Monklandsgate, has been simmering since 1992.
Newspapers and dissident Labour councillors allege that a clique on the
council favours predominantly Roman Catholic Coatbridge over Protestant
Airdrie. It is also alleged that over several years a dominant group of
Labour councillors, who are mainly Catholic, allocated 40 council jobs to
their relatives.
Mrs Liddell, having initially tried to stay aloof from the issue, wrote to
the council on Tuesday asking for a breakdown of capital spending between
Coatbridge and Airdrie, which are of similar size. After receiving the
figures she said they proved that spending on major projects was
concentrated on Coatbridge.
She said: 'I'm determined to make sure that Airdrie, the outlying villages
and the Coatbridge parts of the constituency are receiving their fair share
of spending.'
Mrs Kay Ullrich, the Scottish National party candidate, said the electorate
would not be duped by Mrs Liddell's 'amazing conversion'.
Mrs Susan Bell, the Conservative candidate, said Mrs Liddell's words
vindicated what the Tories had been saying.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Pledge on Post Office sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is satisfied that privatisation of the Post Office would not
lead to the imposition of value added tax on stamps, trade and industry
minister Mr Patrick McLoughlin told MPs yesterday, David Owen writes.
He said the changes being considered posed no threat to the universal
nationwide tariff structure of the Post Office, nor to the commitment to
maintain a nationwide delivery service. A green paper setting out options
for Royal Mail and Parcelforce, the parcels arm of the Post Office, would be
published shortly.
Mr John Major recently asked Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, to redraft the green paper, which was understood to have leaned
heavily in favour of privatising 51 per cent of the Post Office, leaving the
rest in government hands.
Some Tory backbenchers would prefer to leave the Post Office entirely in the
public domain. Ministers are considering whether to include a bill to change
its status in next year's legislative timetable.
While Mr McLoughlin's comments on VAT will reassure backbenchers, they may
worry the private-sector competitors of the Post Office, some of whom are
concerned that the organisation might secure an unfair competitive edge.
Questioned by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, on what
the government's reaction would be if consultations revealed that most
customers did not want to see the Post Office privatised, Mr McLoughlin said
the government would 'take note' of what was said.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Minister defends Pounds 2.2bn aid budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Pounds 2.2bn overseas aid programme was the sixth largest in the
world and was targeted closely on the needs of developing countries, Mr
Alastair Goodlad, Foreign Office minister, told the Commons last night, Ivor
Owen writes.
He said statistics to be published by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development would show that UK aid last year was above the
average at 0.31 per cent of gross national product.
Mr Tom Clarke, Labour's shadow overseas aid minister, condemned the link
between British aid and the sale of arms. He cited the Pergau dam project in
Malaysia as an example of the government's failure to target aid on
countries in greatest need.
He said that if appraisal documents had been made public the aid for the dam
would never have been approved.
Sir David Steel, foreign affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, called
for the register of arms sales instituted by the United Nations to be
upgraded into an instrument to control the trade.
He said: 'There is no more appalling hypocrisy in international politics
than seeing the countries in the developed world compete in the sale of arms
to unstable regimes and then stand around wringing our collective hands the
moment they are used.'

FT  23 JUN 94 / Insurer set up for London buses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Transport has been forced to set up its own insurance company to
provide affordable cover to the 10 London bus companies which are due to be
privatised later this year.
Dublin-based Routemaster Reinsurance, named after the best-known of London's
red buses, is intended to fill a gap in the insurance market. Mr Clive
Pracy, head of risk management at London Transport, said the company would
allow newly established management buy-out teams, which had no operating
record to put to the insurance industry, to buy insurance at reasonable
rates.
Insurance premiums are expected to be the largest cost item in the bus
companies' accounts after wages.
The move by London Transport will be watched closely by the soon-to-be
privatised train-operating companies which will also face difficulties in
obtaining affordable insurance.
Initially each of the 10 bus operators will become a shareholder in the new
company, although membership could be widened to include bus companies from
other parts of the UK.
The company has been set up with Willis Corroon, an insurance broker, which
will act as manager for Routemaster in the Irish Republic, and with Zurich
Municipal, an insurance company which will provide cover in the UK.
For many years London Transport covered its own insurance risks. In 1991 it
moved to Municipal &amp; Mutual, now the Zurich Municipal, but it still carried
a large 'excess', meeting the first Pounds 250,000 of each claim. Under
Routemaster Reinsurance bus companies will meet only the first Pounds 5,000
of each claim.

FT  23 JUN 94 / More trains fail to stop commuter jams
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Twice as many trains ran on the strike-bound rail network yesterday than
last Wednesday but jams still built up around the large cities as commuters
attempted to get to work.
British Rail estimated that about 1,000 out of a total of 15,000 trains ran,
though many were only lightly used because travellers were unaware that
services were running or feared being unable to return home.
The InterCity Great Western operating company, which ran no trains last
week, managed to provide an hourly service between London Paddington and
Didcot with bus connections on to Swindon, Bristol and Cardiff.
ScotRail estimated that it had been able to run 15 per cent of its normal
service including trains between Edinburgh, Fife and Glasgow and from
Glasgow to Paisley. It calculated that it had lost more than Pounds 300,000
in revenues. Other train companies to provide services included the recently
modernised Chiltern Line, Great Eastern, Thames, Midland Mainline and the
London, Tilbury and Southend railway. The Cardiff Valleys and Northeast
Regional Railways both ran limited replacement bus services.
Some lines faced a complete shutdown, however, including the Gatwick Express
service between London Victoria and the airport which lost Pounds 75,000 to
Pounds 85,000 in revenues.
AA Roadwatch said London had by far the worst of the bad road conditions,
and police said main roads and motorways in the Midlands were busier than
normal with severe congestion on the M6 near Birmingham. Traffic elsewhere
was said to be no worse than usual. Jams built up on approaches to the
capital, especially in Essex and Kent, and the 10,000 extra parking spaces
set aside in London parks and in Docklands soon filled.
BR said disruption today over trains in the wrong positions was not likely
to be as bad as last Thursday.
Coach operators, particularly those running between Birmingham and London,
said there were few vacant seats and many additional services were full.
Hotels in the Midlands said bookings were up.
The Institute of Directors said reports of heavy traffic in London and other
parts of the country suggested that fewer people worked from home.
'Experience shows that the longer this type of strike goes on, the greater
the determination to get to work,' it said.
The strikes were putting enormous extra costs on companies thought to have
made arrangements to lay on alternative transport for staff or put them up
in hotels, it added.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Train companies claim strike compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The second one-day strike by signalmen ended last night with the train
operating companies still unclear about what level of compensation they can
expect from Railtrack for its failure to provide an operating network.
Train operating companies said the details of a compensation scheme had yet
to be worked out and they were reluctant to comment on how their claims
might be resolved.
One train operator said: 'The contracts are at an early stage and are being
developed. We don't know exactly how they will be concluded but we don't
want to make too much fuss about compensation.' Another said: 'We don't want
to prejudice further discussions.'
In spite of a doubling in the level of service provided by the train
operators yesterday compared with last Wednesday, the train companies still
lost about Pounds 10m of revenues after allowing for the fact that their
operating costs were also much lower.
Train operators and Railtrack confirmed that the train companies would not
have to pay access charges for the two days lost due to strikes but it
remains unclear what level of compensation Railtrack will pay on top of
that.
Railtrack said payments would relate to claims made on the train operators
by their customers under the government's passenger charter and not to the
gross levels of revenue lost.
This is likely to mean that passengers booked to travel on a strike day
would seek reimbursement of their ticket cost while season ticket holders
would have their tickets extended or obtain a discount when they renewed
them.
An additional complication is that the train operating companies are
operating under temporary access agreements which will be replaced by new
ones from April 1995.
The train operators are running as 'shadow franchises' still owned by
British Rail. They will obtain their full independence next year when
managers stage buy-out bids and other private-sector bidders put in offers.
But the train operators have said that Railtrack, which has a monopoly of
BR's track, signals and stations, is striking a very hard bargain in its
contract negotiations. Some have said that the penalties for Railtrack of
failing to provide a railway network are not sufficiently tough.
Some senior managers in the operating companies have said they will seek to
modify the original contracts both when they are incorporated as BR
subsidiaries later this year and when they are sold off to the private
sector.
One manager said: 'The franchising director should not think that the train
operating companies will simply buy a pile of contracts. We will want to
renegotiate them. The contracts have been drawn up by civil servants and are
too theoretical.'

FT  23 JUN 94 / Black concedes battle but aims to win the war: The reasons
behind the Telegraph's price cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Conrad Black's decision to cut the price of the Daily Telegraph from 48p
to 30p from today is the most dramatic in the newspaper's history since Lord
Camrose halved the price from 2d to 1d in 1930.
Within two weeks Mr Black's distinguished predecessor had increased sales
from 100,000 to 190,000 with at least some of the increased readership
coming from The Times.
The price cut this time is designed more to halt a gradual circulation loss
to The Times since Mr Rupert Murdoch cut its price to 30p last September.
Telegraph executives have always insisted that they had no intention of
following Mr Murdoch's example. Indeed, when The Times move was first
announced Mr Joe Cooke, who retires as managing director at the end of this
month, said it was sad to see a great British institution marketing itself
not on its editorial quality but on its cheapness.
But at least with The Times Mr Murdoch has confounded the critics, although
the 20p Sun remains a financial burden.
Before the experiment began The Times had a circulation of about 370,000. In
the 10 months afterwards sales have continued to rise gradually but it was
the 35,000 leap in May to a new record of 515,000 at a time when the Daily
Telegraph had slipped below the psychologically important 1m mark that
convinced Mr Black he would have to react.
'He (Murdoch) has won in so far as he has convinced us of the wisdom of
following him,' said Mr Black, who believes a certain amount of pandemonium
in the market is now inevitable.
The Independent, still priced at 50p, cut today's cover price to 20p to try
to get more readers to sample it and read an attack on the behaviour of the
large newspaper proprietors. The paper has already been testing 40p and 45p
cover prices in a number of areas and the 50p cover price is clearly under
review.
The Guardian said last night it was considering the impact of the Telegraph
decision but seems unlikely to take any early action. The Guardian has a
relatively committed readership and sales, which fell to 397,172 in April,
rose to 401,831 in May.
The Telegraph concedes that in a full year the effect of the price cut will
be more than Pounds 40m, although this will be offset by cost reductions and
growth in advertising revenue. The company is believed to be keeping the
wholesalers' margin at 26.5 per cent but making up the loss with a
performance bonus.
One national newspaper editor suggested last night that Mr Black could have
attacked Mr Murdoch more cheaply and more effectively by greatly reducing
the price of the Sunday Telegraph in the hope of luring readers away from Mr
Murdoch's highly profitable Sunday Times, which conspicuously has not cut
its price.
Mr Max Hastings, the Telegraph editor-in-chief, said that the new cover
price meant the paper would be able to build circulation 'by appealing to
readers of mid-market titles and to a greater number of new and non-regular
readers'.
This week Mr Hastings has shaken up his top editorial staff by appointing Mr
Simon Heffer as one of two deputy editors - an appointment that is likely to
presage a move to the right in the Telegraph opinion columns.
Mr Murdoch always made it clear he was aiming at the Telegraph's attractive,
affluent 1m circulation.
Now that Mr Black has fired off his missiles in retaliation it will be the
autumn before it is clear whether 'Darwinian chaos' has been unleashed or
whether the overall market for national newspapers can be expanded,
reversing years of gradual decline.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Economic case for equality
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies have to be convinced there is a good business case for them
providing equal opportunities in the workplace, Ms Kamlesh Bahl, who chairs
the Equal Opportunities Commission, said yesterday.
She added: 'Employers must understand the economic arguments for equal
opportunities. Our aim is to ensure we make the most of human potential and
individual choice and that such strategies are cost-efficient.'
The commission has established an advisory group with the Department of
Employment, the Confederation of British Industry, the Institute of
Directors and the Trades Union Congress to look at the economic case for
equal opportunities in the workplace.
Its annual report published yesterday reported a 58 per cent increase in
complaints of sexual harassment to 793 last year compared with 502 in the
previous year. There was a 40 per cent drop in the number of cases
concerning maternity leave and related issues to 1,184 from 2,903.

FT  23 JUN 94 / TUC chief talks to CBI council
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress addressed the council of
the Confederation of British Industry yesterday for the first time in its
history.
Mr John Monks told business leaders that employers and unions could become
partners in making the economy successful and in creating a better-trained
workforce.
His appeal to private-sector employers may upset some leftwingers in unions
who are already concerned about Mr Monks' strategy to widen the appeal of
the TUC.
Mr Monks told the CBI there were still differences between them. He pointed
to the need to treat public-sector workers fairly because there was 'a real
danger of creating second-class, badly paid jobs in the public sector'.
He also urged the CBI not to be negative about the introduction of works
councils under European rules.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Move to dismiss Names attacked as 'diabolical'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Lloyd's insurance market's relationship with new institutional investors
could be damaged by Lloyd's agents who attempted earlier this year to
dismiss some Names from their syndicates, a senior corporate financier said
yesterday.
The agents had acted in anticipation of new rules that guarantee Names
continued participation in syndicates.
Sir Laurie Magnus, deputy head of UK corporate finance at Samuel Montagu,
the merchant bank, told a London conference on corporate capital that
failure by agents to 'respect the spirit' of the new rules on pre-emption
rights would be seen as 'diabolical' by the investment community.
The rules are designed to allow the Names, whose assets support the market,
to increase their participation in line with any overall increase in
syndicate capacity.
Pending introduction of the changes last May, eight agents are understood to
have written to Names - both individual and corporate - giving them
provisional notice, effectively cancelling their participation as of
December 31 this year.
Sir Laurie last year co-ordinated the launch of the London Market Investment
Trust, the biggest of more than 12 new investment vehicles at the market. He
said the action of the agents, which affects corporate as well as individual
Names, put 'the credibility of the centre (the Lloyd's corporation which
manages and regulates the market) at stake'.
Corporate investors pressed hard for Lloyd's to introduce pre-emption rights
last year, when they supplied more than Pounds 800m to support syndicates.
Lloyd's syndicates obtain about 10 per cent of their capacity from corporate
sources, but are seeking more funding as a result of the expected fall in
the number of individual Names.
Lloyd's last month, reported losses of Pounds 2bn for the 1991 year of
account, under its three-year accounting system. This brought its cumulative
deficit since 1988 to Pounds 7bn and is expected to force many individuals
to leave the market.
Sir Laurie said that most corporate investors were now focusing on new
so-called 'dedicated' investment funds in which they would back syndicates
managed by one agency. Last year most money was invested in trusts which
support syndicates managed by a range of agencies.
The change was partly due to investors beginning to understand Lloyd's and
wanting to build closer links with syndicate managers.

<TEXT>
The Society of Practitioners of Insolvency yesterday defended the practice
by which bankers can appoint as receivers the same firm of accountants they
initially hired to investigate a troubled company.
Critics have said there may be a potential conflict of interest in the
arrangement and have called for an independent inquiry. The society said a
consultation it carried out with the accountancy profession's joint ethics
committee two years ago concluded that the 'overwhelming majority' of those
asked supported the position. But details from the survey submitted to the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales last year show that
30 per cent believed there was a conflict.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Horse Racing Board yesterday altered its rules to let racehorse
owners sell advertising space on the sleeves and collars of jockeys' silks.
The board, the governing body for horse racing in England, Wales and
Scotland, will also allow advertising on paddock blankets and the backs of
stable lads' jackets.
Up to 10,000 horse owners will be able to take advantage of the scheme,
which has been cleared with broadcasters and the Independent Television
Commission. The board says the 'multi-million pound' revenue will go to
owners. Under a separate scheme race courses will be able to sell space on
horse number cloths. The proceeds will go to owners, jockeys, trainers and
stable lads.
The number cloth scheme is expected to begin tomorrow at Wolverhampton. The
scheme for owners should start next month.
Miss Lucy Weaver, the board's marketing assistant, said: 'It will be up to
owners to decide what sponsorship is worth.'
The announcement follows talks last year between the thoroughbred industry
and Customs &amp; Excise. Both sides were anxious to allow registered owners to
develop their businesses and to claim back value added tax.
The Market Racing Agency, an independent consultancy, said it was already in
talks with potential sponsors.

FT  23 JUN 94 / Music industry set to be cleared on CD prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is expected today to clear the music
industry of over-charging consumers for compact discs.
The commission is also expected to say that although a small group of
retailers accounts for a substantial share of the market, this does not
operate against the public interest.
The commission report will be the second important victory for the music
industry this week.
On Tuesday the High Court rejected an attempt by pop star George Michael to
have his recording contract with Sony declared unenforceable. The music
industry feared that if George Michael had won other artists would have
tried to have their contracts changed.
The commission's decision on CD prices was widely expected, but retailers
were uncertain whether action would be recommended against them. A finding
that retailers are acting properly in selling CDs will come as a relief to
the companies concerned.
A report last year from the Commons national heritage committee said WH
Smith, Our Price, Virgin, Woolworth, and HMV together controlled 54 per cent
of music stores. In March, WH Smith, which owns Our Price, said it was
merging the chain with Virgin Retail, with which it had previously had a
joint venture.
The commission's inquiry, launched last year, is expected to find that CD
prices in the UK are the lowest in Europe. Although CDs cost more in the UK
than in the US, the commission is expected to conclude that this is in line
with differences in the price of other consumer goods.
The commission's findings are expected to contradict a report by the Commons
national heritage committee last year. The committee, under the chairmanship
of Mr Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP for Manchester Gorton, severely
criticised both record companies and retailers for charging excessively high
prices for CDs.
The committee said that while it had 'found no evidence of formal or overt
collusion, it considered that the major record companies and the retailers
are effectively cartels, and indeed partly interlocking cartels'.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, referred the music
industry to the commission last May, shortly after the committee published
its report. Sir Bryan said he had not been satisfied with the industry's
explanations for what he saw as the high price of CDs.
Sir Gordon Borrie, Sir Bryan's predecessor, had said in 1992 that CD prices
reflected what consumers were prepared to pay.
