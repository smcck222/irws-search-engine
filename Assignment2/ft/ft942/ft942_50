FT  07 APR 94 / South African Elections April 26-28: ANC Leader rules out
any postponement of forthcoming all-race elections
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, yesterday ruled out
any postponement of South Africa's forthcoming all-race elections, despite a
report from the country's Independent Electoral Commission saying it would
be impossible to hold elections in violent Natal province, Patti Waldmeir
and Michael Holman write from Johannesburg.
'Let me tell you there will be no postponement of elections  ..either in the
province of Natal or in any of the provinces,' Mr Mandela told a youth
conference in Durban.
Some 700 additional troops were last night on their way to bolster the 2,000
soldiers already enforcing the state of emergency in Natal, where over 100
people have died in six days. A government spokesman said last night the
Natal crisis required a political solution, which will be the focus of
tomorrow's peace summit between Mr Mandela, President F W de Klerk, Inkatha
leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini.

The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed yesterday when their
aircraft crashed while landing at Kigali, the Rwandan capital. The aircraft
was hit by rocket fire in a double assassination, according to Rwandan
diplomats.
Rwandan President Major-General Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi President
Cyprien Ntaryamira were flying back from a regional meeting in Dar Es Salaam
on ways to end conflict between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups in both
countries. Their deaths are a blow to peace moves.
In Burundi more than 100,000 people are believed to have died since the
killing last October of the country's first democratically elected
president.
Mr Ntaryamira, from the majority Hutu tribe, was recently nominated by a
cabinet of both Hutus and Tutsis, although he had been unable to halt
sporadic clashes. More than 400,000 Burundi refugees remain in squalid camps
in neighbouring countries.
Although the cause of the air crash was not officially confirmed, diplomats
believe Gen Habyarimana had amassed enough political enemies during his 20
years in power in Rwanda to give credence to assassination claims. Gen
Habyarimana, a Hutu, signed a ceasefire with the rebel Rwandese Patriotic
Front in 1992 but there have been delays in implementing peace. In spite of
the presence of 2,500 UN peacekeepers, there has been rising tension in the
army and population over the country's rapid slide into bankruptcy.
Diplomats believe it is unlikely the RPF is involved in an assassination as
it was close to negotiating a share in power.

FT  07 APR 94 / South African Elections April 26-28: South Africa throbs to
an electoral beat - Rap groups, game shows, TV soaps are all being used to
educate voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR

<TEXT>
Related, members of the Soweto Mothers' Union shove for a place at the mock
polling booth outside Johannesburg's Anglican cathedral. In three weeks, the
vast majority of them will enter a real polling station to vote in a general
election for the first time, and they want to be ready.
Myopic grandmothers crane their necks to glimpse the mock ballot papers
being distributed by Ms Lerato Mabitsela of the Matla Voter Education Trust,
and strain to hear her patient explanation of how to avoid spoiling the
paper.
Over and over again, she explains that no, they must not sign the paper, and
no, they must not print their address in the box next to the party of their
choice. One old woman worries that her mark on the paper is not a perfect X.
Ms Lerato reassures her it will do nicely.
Over the past few weeks, millions of first-time electors throughout South
Africa have received some kind of voter education to prepare them for the
April 26-28 poll. Some have attended mock elections held by community and
church groups, political parties and businesses. Millions more have been
reached by TV and radio, where voter education has taken surprising forms.
These have included a prime-time voter education game show, complete with a
black master of ceremonies dispensing deep freezes and electric frying pans
to those who correctly answer questions such as: 'Where do you go to vote?'
and 'If you spoil your paper, do you get another chance?'
The same channel carries an election soap opera, featuring a black comedian
as the main character in a drama revolving around issues such as democracy
and political intimidation.
A local rap group, Prophets of the City, has taken their own brand of voter
education to black schools, where they rap out the message 'You gotta vote,
you gotta vote'. The children are expected to pass the message on to their
parents.
Travelling concerts and roadshows, some of them funded by an election
initiative launched recently by South African business, take the message
deep into rural communities. Music cassettes combining a message of
tolerance and goodwill with popular music have been distributed to the tens
of thousands of minibus taxis which provide the main form of transport for
black South Africans.
Because there is no central co-ordination of the voter education effort,
nobody knows how many people have been reached or how much money has been
spent. From overseas, the European Union has contributed R20m (Pounds 2.7m)
and the South Africa Free Election Fund, a US business initiative, at least
Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m). Foreign voter educators say they believe it is one
of the most ambitious such exercises conducted anywhere.
The task is daunting: some 70 per cent of South Africa's 22.7m eligible
voters have probably never voted before (some may have voted in black local
elections, but turnout at these polls was always minuscule).
South Africa's voting system is relatively simple: the ballot shows each
party's name, logo and the picture of its leader; voters need mark only one
box (representatives are then chosen automatically from each party's
electoral list). But matters have been complicated by the recent addition of
a second ballot for regional parliaments.
Most voters have no idea of the purpose of the second paper: some said they
would not mark it, as they had been told it was illegal to vote twice. But
by far the greatest problem has been political violence, especially in Natal
Province where the Inkatha Freedom party is boycotting the election. Voter
educators from the rival ANC have been targeted by Inkatha, with several
murdered.
Natal voter education groups say they have been unable to operate in Inkatha
areas since mid-February. They believe the recent imposition of a state of
emergency will only spark further resentment in Inkatha areas.
But voter educators complain that the ANC, too, is inhibiting their work in
Natal. 'We're having problems in ANC areas as well. We're being told that if
we're not teaching people to vote ANC, we're not to be doing voter
education,' says Ms Carole Baekey of the Community Law Centre in Durban. But
Inkatha's name will not appear on the final ballot.
No amount of voter education can solve South Africa's real problems, which
remain political.

mobile stations to vote
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On April 26-28, 22.7m South African voters will be eligible to vote at any
one of 9,000 polling stations. Some of them will be mobile stations, to be
moved in and out of areas where violence could interfere. There are no
constituencies. Representatives are chosen from national party lists, so
voters can attend any polling station.
Some 80m ballot papers are being printed by De La Rue, the UK security
printer, and can be placed in 126,000 ballot boxes. Some 193,706 voting
officers will staff the polling stations; 90,838 enumerators will count
votes.
The Independent Electoral Commission plans to deploy 10,000 monitors by
mid-April; the UN says it expects 5,000 foreign observers. The commission
(11 eminent South Africans and five international commissioners under the
chairmanship of Judge Johann Kriegler) will conduct the poll and decide
whether it is free and fair. There is no appeal against its decision.

the future of his monarchy by promising to protect his salary and status
under a new constitution. ANC officials believe they can offer the king a
deal which will persuade him to break with his ally, Chief Buthelezi, and
accept the constitution, seriously undermining Inkatha's election boycott.

FT  07 APR 94 / UN's Somalia military role attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Nations troops had been 'a little more trigger-happy than they should
have been' during Operation Restore Hope, the peace-enforcing operation in
Somalia, a UN envoy to the country said yesterday.
Mr Michael Harper, director of the United Nations Association UK, said on
his return from a Unicef-funded mission to Somalia that the UN had 'come
unstuck at the military level'. The humanitarian effort had been largely
successful, but the military operation had failed to achieve its aim of
disarming the Somali warlords, and had alienated the Somali people.
He criticised the role of the US soldiers in Somalia, saying that 'for the
past six months, the Americans have been looking after the Americans,'
seeking to minimise casualties. He would recommend to Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general, that there 'should never be a UN military
presence and a unilateral non-UN international military presence, be it the
US or anyone else, working simultaneously.'
His criticisms indicate the degree to which the operation has damped UN
peace-enforcing ambitions. He acknowledged Amnesty International's
allegations of human rights abuses by UN personnel, saying he suspected they
were 'basically founded'.
He stressed the absence of military wisdom in New York combined with
disorganisation in Somalia. 'The individual national units ..tended to
operate in their own way and decide which bits of the (UN) mandate they
would or would not implement.'
Mr Harper's attack came amid allegations of a cover-up of a report on the
massacre in June last year of 23 Pakistani soldiers serving as part of the
UN forces. The UN-commissioned inquiry has never been released.

FT  07 APR 94 / Kenya central bank defrauded of Dollars 210m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kenya's monetary authorities yesterday revealed that the central bank was
defrauded of Dollars 210m (Pounds 141m) last year - an amount equivalent to
6 per cent of the country's gross domestic product - in what probably counts
as the biggest embezzlement of public funds in Kenya's history.
As a result, the central bank recorded a net loss of 4.5bn shillings (Pounds
47m) in the year to June 1993, according to the bank's auditors. The losses
were incurred in foreign exchange trading and on unsecured advances to three
local banks which have ceased operations.
Mr Micah Cheserem, who became the central bank governor in July, after the
losses were detected, says his main priority is to recover KSh6bn owed to
the central bank. Mr Amos Wako, the attorney-general, has meanwhile launched
an investigation into the financial activities of the local Exchange Bank,
which is in liquidation.
Mr Cheserem says the central bank entered into a forward foreign exchange
contract with Exchange Bank last April in which the central bank advanced
KSh9.9bn against a future payment of Dollars 210m. Subsequently, it is
claimed, central bank officials and Exchange Bank conspired to erase the
latter's liabilities by setting up bogus bank accounts in the name of the
central bank with two international banks in London.
The alleged fraud was discovered when the International Monetary Fund
questioned the apparent Dollars 210m central bank funds held abroad. 'The
accounts were discovered to be false, in an apparent attempt to conceal the
fact that Exchange Bank had defaulted on the contract,' Mr Cheserem said in
an interview yesterday.
Mr Cheserem is surprised that such a large contract was approved at a time
when Exchange Bank was already under investigation for the alleged
falsification of export documents for a related company.
The central bank ordered Exchange Bank into liquidation last year after an
independent audit of its activities. The audit has never been made public,
compounding the widespread belief that senior politicians in the ruling Kanu
party benefited from Exchange Bank's activities.
Former central bank employees are being questioned in connection with the
affair.

FT  07 APR 94 / Mexican interest rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican interest rates rose sharply yesterday, pushed up by the rise in US
bond yields and instability in the domestic political arena.
Short-term rates on 28-day paper rose to 14.31 per cent, an increase of 2.7
percentage points on the day, and up from 8.81 per cent in late February.
One year rates also rose to 13.66 per cent, a level not seen since last
August.
The steep rise in interest rates threatens to cut economic growth when the
government had been hoping for a rapid recovery from recession before this
August's presidential elections.
However with the peso about 8 per cent weaker against the dollar than at the
start of the year, and close to the limit permitted by the central bank,
there was little choice but to let interest rates rise.
A peso devaluation outside the current exchange rate band would be a serious
political blow to the government.
Yesterday the local currency strengthened slightly after the rise in rates,
but closed at 3.36 to the dollar.

FT  07 APR 94 / Canada Liberals dismay markets: Turmoil laid at new
government's door
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's Liberal government has sought to soothe the financial markets with
promises of economic rectitude since it came to office last November, but
its response to their recent turbulence has raised doubts about its
commitment. Market sentiment has taken a heavy toll in recent weeks.
The Bank of Canada set its trend-setting Bank rate, or discount rate, at
6.21 per cent this week, sharply above the low of 3.87 per cent in early
February. Commercial banks have raised their prime lending rates twice in
the past three weeks to 6.75 per cent and another rise is expected soon.
Yields on long-term government bonds reached 8.6 per cent this week, from
7.1 per cent in early February and mortgage rates have jumped.
But the interest rate rises have been too little and too late to prevent a
run on the Canadian dollar which has sunk to its lowest level in eight
years. The currency has slid by almost four US cents in two months, touching
a low of 71.62 on Tuesday. The slide began with the US Federal Reserve
Board's landmark tightening of monetary policy in early February, which
resulted in greater changes north of the border than in the US itself.
The gap between US and Canadian 10-year bond yields has widened over the
past two months from about 7/10s of a percentage point to 1.25 points. The
spread on short-term securities has opened up even further. This divergence
does not appear justified by the relative performance of the two economies.
Canada's inflation rate, at a year-on-year rate of 1.3 per cent in February,
is well below the US. The business recovery has also been far less robust in
Canada, where unemployment remains over 11 per cent.
Economists place much of the blame for the rattled markets on the Liberal
finance minister, Mr Paul Martin, and on Mr Gordon Thiessen, whom the
Liberals named as Bank of Canada governor last February to replace Mr John
Crow. The stated aim of both men is to balance low inflation and fiscal
restraint with steady growth and job creation.
'The balanced approach is a code word for getting nothing done,' says Mr
George Vasic, chief economist at securities firm Bunting Warburg.
Mr Thiessen has certainly displayed a less single-minded commitment than Mr
Crow to attacking inflation. 'Crow would have left no room for doubt,' said
one unhappy finance ministry official.
Mr Thiessen on Tuesday did reaffirm an inflation target of between 1 and 3
per cent for the next three years - in his first keynote speech. And Mr
Martin raised half a cheer in the markets with his first budget last
February, in which he promised to bring down the federal deficit from
CDollars 45.7bn in the year to March 31, 1994, to CDollars 39.7bn in fiscal
1995 and CDollars 32.7bn in 1996.
Closer examination of the budget and subsequent statements by Mr Martin and
Mr Jean Chretien, the prime minister, suggest the Liberals are reluctant to
achieve targets through unpopular spending cuts.
The previous government's budget projections were blown off course by
stagnant tax revenues rather than unexpectedly high outlays. Mr Martin and
his advisers are banking heavily on an accelerating recovery to push up
revenues.
'We are going to hit our target,' Mr Martin said on Tuesday. 'There is
sufficient room to manoeuvre in our budget in terms of the projections that
we have made.'
Some economists question this conclusion. The budget assumed an average
long-term government bond yield of 6.4 per cent this year, which is far
below yesterday's level of 8.3 per cent. With debt-service payments
accounting for about a third of all government outlays, any jump in interest
rates can quickly undermine budget projections.
Mr Thiessen and Mr Martin do appear to have calmed the markets for the time
being. In the past two days, bond prices and the Canadian dollar have
recovered part of their losses.
But the turbulence of the past few weeks has revealed the fragility of
investor confidence in Canada and several more potentially unsettling events
are on the horizon.
Quebec separatists are confident of a strong showing in elections later this
year. If they win, they have promised to hold a referendum on independence
for the francophone province within 12 months.
The ten provinces will present their 1994-1995 budgets over the next six
weeks. Their combined borrowings now exceed those of the federal government.
'You've got to be betting on a weak currency,' Mr Michael Manford, chief
economist at ScotiaMcLeod said yesterday. Scotia has lowered its 1994
forecast of the Canadian dollar to between 71.4 and 73.5 US cents.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Justice Harry Blackmun, the US Supreme Court's leading liberal, yesterday
announced his retirement at the end of the court's summer term, giving
President Bill Clinton the chance to name his successor.
Mr Clinton yesterday gave a brief and moving tribute to Justice Blackmun,
famous for his ruling upholding abortion rights. But he gave no clues on who
would get his second nomination to the bench since coming to office. 'This
is Justice Blackmun's day,' Mr Clinton said.
The president is thought likely to pick someone close to Justice Blackmun's
views, meaning little immediate change in the political balance of the
Court. The prospect of right-wing domination of the bench, which seemed on
the cards during the Reagan and Bush presidencies, has receded.
But the delicate mechanisms of the bench may persuade Mr Clinton to seek a
nominee more inclined to conciliation and consensus than the
independent-minded Justice Blackmun, who took pride in his own principled
dissent.
Mr Blackmun was appointed to the bench by President Richard Nixon in 1970 as
'a strict constructionist' following the failure of two earlier conservative
nominees to pass muster.
However, although a lifelong Republican leavened by the progressive
traditions of his native Minnesota, Justice Blackmun quickly emerged as a
liberal bulwark. On the current Court he is aligned with Justice John Paul
Stevens, another Republican appointee, with the middle ground occupied by
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David
Souter and the right by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
Justice Blackmun will always be known for two judicial stances. He was the
principal author in 1973 of the 7-2 Roe v Wade ruling protecting the right
to abortion. Unapolegetic to the end for this ruling, for which he has been
much vilified by conservatives, he simply said yesterday he thought it 'a
necessary step on the road to the full emancipation of women'.
He also remained an adamant opponent to capital punishment on the grounds he
could find no evidence that it served as a deterrent. But he frequently
conceded that he was swimming against a national tide, with two-thirds of
the states now employing the death penalty (proudly, he would point out that
Minnesota had legally executed nobody in more than 80 years).
'It hasn't been much fun on most occasions,' Justice Blackmun wryly noted
yesterday of his frequent status in the Court's minority. But Mr Clinton, an
old acquaintance, saw it otherwise: 'Justice has not only been his title, it
has been his guiding light.'
Senator George Mitchell of Maine and Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary,
are among the leading candidates to replace Justice Blackmun. Other
candidates include three federal judges - Mr Jose Cabranes from Connecticut,
who, if selected, would be the first Hispanic justice, Mr Stephen Breyer
from Massachussetts and Mr Richard Arnold from Arkansas. All were mentioned
in last year's search for a nominee, a position filled by Mrs Ginsburg.

President Eduardo Frei of Chile yesterday threatened to convoke the National
Security Council to force the resignation of his chief of police, General
Rodolfo Stange, writes David Pilling from Santiago. Under the 1980
constitution, drawn up by the military, the president cannot dismiss
commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, of which the police chief is one,
although President Frei has made it clear he believes Gen Stange's position
to be untenable. The chamber of deputies added weight to President Frei's
cause by passing an emergency motion describing as 'regrettable' Gen
Stange's refusal to resign after being implicated in an alleged cover-up of
the 1985 murder of three communists.

The Honduran army says it is investigating a foiled plot to assassinate
President Carlos Roberto Reina and kidnap a businessman, Reuter reports from
Tegucigalpa. Lt Col Napoleon Santos, an army spokesman, said one of four men
implicated in the conspiracy had told the Interior Ministry that a Honduran
citizen with links to the drug trade had offered the group Dollars 400,000
to kill the president and more than Dollars 800,000 to kidnap the
businessman.
President Reina won the election in November and took office on January 27,
pledging to carry out a 'moral revolution' in Honduras, weed out corruption
and curb the army's power.

FT  07 APR 94 / Teamsters start haulage strike
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Picket lines went up across the US yesterday as the once powerful Teamsters'
union launched its first big strike in 15 years against 22 road haulage
companies, but little immediate effect was felt on deliveries, George Graham
reports from Washington.
Mr Ron Carey, Teamsters' president, called about 75,000 members out on
strike after talks broke down over haulage companies' plan to use more
part-time workers and to send more goods by rail. 'We have no other choice
but to strike,' Mr Carey said.
The companies targeted by the Teamsters' strike, which belong to a
negotiating consortium called Trucking Management Inc, handle about half of
all consolidated road freight in the US - single loads made up of
consignments that on their own make up less than a full truck-load. They
include haulage companies such as Consolidated Freightways, ABF Freight
Systems, and Roadway Express, which have faced increasing competition from
parcel delivery companies such as UPS.
The strike is most likely to affect deliveries of manufacturing components,
small finished goods and non-perishable groceries, but is not expected to
constrict food supplies, since most supermarket chains have their own truck
fleets.
The trucking companies ship between 5 and 15 per cent of their freight by
rail, but had proposed a new contract allowing up to 35 per cent to move by
rail. They also wanted a quarter of the work in their terminals to be done
by part-time workers, giving them more flexibility to deal with peaks in
demand.
Mr Carey's leadership has been challenged, and the union's finances, notably
its strike fund, are in poor shape.

<TEXT>
Mexican interest rates rose sharply yesterday, as the government sought to
stem an outflow of foreign capital which is threatening the stability of the
exchange rate.
Short-term rates on 28-day paper rose to 14.31 per cent, an increase of 2.7
percentage points on the day, and up from 8.81 per cent in late February.
One year rates also rose to 13.66 per cent, a level not seen since last
August.
The stockmarket reacted badly to the interest rate rise, falling 1.4 per
cent by mid-session, to 22,203. Mexico's economy was formally in recession
in the second half of last year, and the government had been hoping for a
rapid recovery before August's presidential elections.
But the peso strengthened slightly, to 3.35 to the dollar yesterday morning,
although it remained close to its permitted limit, and about 8 per cent
weaker than at the beginning of the year.
A devaluation of the peso outside the central bank's exchange rate band
would come as a serious political blow to the government.

FT  07 APR 94 / Greek fiscal bill targets tax evaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's socialist government yesterday unveiled a fiscal package designed
in part to counter what it believes to be rampant tax evasion.
The bill, due to go before parliament this week, raises the top income tax
rate from 40 to 45 per cent, places an additional 15 per cent tax on
dividends from mutual funds and investment companies, and sets criteria for
taxing self-employed professionals like architects, doctors and lawyers,
groups who are considered to grossly underestimate their income in order to
avoid tax.
The new dividends tax comes on top of a 35 per cent tax on equity income
which is withheld at source. Greeks are nevertheless required to declare all
their equity holdings, together with other non-taxable assets, which are
considered indicators of wealth for future tax assessment.
'Probably fewer than 10 per cent of investors put down their holdings on
their income tax forms,' said one fund manager yesterday.
Mutual funds are currently the fastest growing sector of Greece's financial
market with about 80 companies, mostly private Greek banks and insurance
concerns, controlling more than Dr1,300bn (Pounds 3.55bn). The new fiscal
measure is expected to put a temporary brake on that growth and drive
liquidity into tax-free government securities.
The socialist administration faces problems in financing the public sector
deficit, with a serious revenue shortfall projected this year - the increase
in tax revenues for the first two months of this year was less than half the
budget projection. The government borrowing requirement is forecast to
exceed 15 per cent of gross domestic product against a target of 12.9 per
cent.
Other measures included in the new bill are a requirement for taxpayers to
disclose the source of funds used to buy property, an important repository
for income from the black economy, now estimated to be worth close to 40 per
cent of gross domestic product.
Personal income tax receipts in Greece amount to only about 4.5 per cent of
GDP, the lowest percentage in the European Union, while the average income
declared by self-employed businessmen and professionals is only half that
declared by wage earners.
Mr Alexandros Papadopoulos, finance minister, made a point when introducing
the new measures yesterday of stressing that they were not intended to damp
growth in the financial sector. He noted that the bill did not require
disclosures on the source of funds used to buy shares on the Athens stock
exchange. To stimulate more flotations of Greek companies, which still tend
to be tightly controlled by family owners and managers, the corporate tax
rate for unlisted companies will be raised from 35 to 40 per cent.

FT  07 APR 94 / Shares shake off political worries in Italy

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets yesterday generally shrugged off the threat by Forza
Italia, the political party formed by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi to
force Italy back to the polls if a new government could not be formed. They
had earlier been unsettled by bickering within the right-wing alliance which
won last week's general elections.
Despite the prospect of continued political uncertainty, the main Milan
stock market index closed nearly 1 per cent higher yesterday, although the
lira lost ground against the US dollar and the D-Mark. It closed in London
at L1,654.83 against the dollar from L1,640, and at L965 from L960.8 against
the D-Mark. Analysts said they were surprised equities had not suffered, but
predicted that Mr Berlusconi and his allies would eventually form a
government.
On Tuesday night, Mr Berlusconi raised the political stakes by suspending
talks on forming a government. He said negotiations with his ill-matched
allies - the federalists of the Northern League and the centralising
far-right of the National Alliance - would restart only when President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro had decided who should be prime minister.
The Northern League's leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, has spent most of the last
week sniping at Mr Berlusconi, claiming he should not be prime minister.
Forza Italia's spokesman hit back yesterday, saying: 'If Umberto Bossi
betrays the will of the people once again, preventing the formation of a
government, there will be no alternative except a return to the polls.'
Forza Italia officials believe that if Mr Bossi does not fall into line,
several of the League's newly elected deputies could defect to Mr
Berlusconi's party.
Mr Bossi was expected to hold talks in Rome yesterday with representatives
of the weakened centre parties.

FT  07 APR 94 / Turkish package fails to put doubts at rest

Moody's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday reacted to Turkey's new
austerity package by warning it might lower the country's debt rating
further. It currently rates Turkey Ba1, considered a sub-investment grade or
'junk' rating.
'The package is positive,' said Mr Guillermo Estebanez, senior analyst at
Moody's. 'The reason for the review is whether it is sufficient and whether
it is implementable. It is not too late, but it is well into the crisis.'
The decision by Moody's reflected a general uncertainty in international and
Turkish markets yesterday over the ability of Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime
minister, to implement the tough package of economic reforms she outlined on
Tuesday.
While the interbank overnight interest rate, which has been as high as 1,000
per cent in recent weeks, dropped back to 70 per cent yesterday, dealers
said they expected the fall to be shortlived. 'We think you will see
overnight rates move straight back up to a range of 150 per cent to 170 per
cent,' said one trader at a large US bank. The overnight rate ended the day
at about 80 per cent.
However, dealers were slightly more optimistic on the outlook for the
currency, which ended the day at about TL40,000 to the dollar. At the start
of the year it was trading at around TL15,000. 'The lira was looking
overvalued, but at this level it may have overshot the mark,' said one
currency trader.
But investors in Turkey's Dollars 8.5bn of foreign bonds are more nervous
about the country's ability to service its debt, since recent lira
depreciation means Turkey's foreign currency debt has more than doubled.
Dealers said Turkey would not be able to return to the international market
in the foreseeable future.
The austerity package comprises inflationary price rises, including those of
petrol and sugar, and longer term structural reforms such as privatisation,
much of which has already been announced. But the key to this package is Ms
Ciller's commitment to a three-month fiscal target. 'No sensible government
is going to commit itself to such a short-term programme if it is not
serious. There would just be too much egg on its chin,' says Mr Emre Yigit,
head of research at Global securities in Istanbul.
Nevertheless, the costs will be impressive. The package calls for the
closure of several state companies, including the Karabuk iron and steel
works, and says that others, such as the coalmines at Zonguldak and the
textile conglomerate Sumer Holding, will close if buyers cannot be found.
The privatisation target of Dollars 3.5bn this year seems very ambitious,
particularly as economic austerity will hit demand for the output of some
companies, such as the Erdemir Iron and Steel works on the Black Sea.
The government will struggle to close mines at Zonguldak. They employ 26,000
in a region with little alternative employment and a long history of union
militancy.

FT  07 APR 94 / Brussels Cup a three-horse race: Lionel Barber gives a form
guide to runners in the contest to succeed Jacques Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan turned up in Brussels on Tuesday night for the latest leg
of his twin-track mission for 1994: to make the best-seller list and become
the next president of the European Commission.
After suffering in (near) silence during the UK government's hapless
performance in the European Union voting rights row, the senior British
commissioner addressed more than 150 people at WH Smith who had gathered for
the continental launch of his book 'The Europe We Need'.
Sir Leon's publicity campaign is impressive but misleading. The real
struggle over the succession to Mr Jacques Delors is taking place in secret,
among the EU's 12 heads of government. They will decide who gets the top
executive job in Brussels, most likely when they meet at the European summit
in Corfu in June.
Mr Ruud Lubbers, the long-serving Dutch prime minister, remains favourite.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, his Belgian opposite number, is a dark horse making
late strides. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister often rumoured
as a candidate, was probably never in the starting-gate.
The secretive nature of the selection process is typical of the way the EU
runs much of its business. It is a mixture of patronage, horse-trading, and
arm-twisting which offers the European citizen few clues as to the
importance of the job.
The Commission president is responsible for an annual budget of Ecu70bn
(Pounds 53bn). He is in charge of more than 10,000 international civil
servants in Brussels, regularly attends international summits, and is the
public face of the Union.
He also heads an institution with a monopoly on proposing Euro-legislation,
something which no national or international service can rival.
Increasingly, Brussels is acquiring new responsibilities in social policy,
the environment, and research, as well as dispensing aid to eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union.
These myriad tasks require someone with high-class administrative and
management skills together with a grasp of economics and a presence on the
international stage. A Commission president lacking them risks seeing his
role as umpire and power-broker in the Union diluted by the 12 (soon likely
to be 16) heads of government.
For most of the past year, Mr Lubbers seemed the natural choice for the job.
He could draw on 12 years' experience as Dutch premier and his small-state
credentials. This last asset is important because the presidency usually
alternates between large and smaller states.
A Lubbers victory seemed even more likely after last October's special
summit in Brussels, where EU leaders agreed a wide-ranging deal on the
location of a host of new institutions. It was assumed that Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's success in winning the European Monetary Institute for
Frankfurt - against the rival Amsterdam - had come at the price of a promise
to back Mr Lubbers. When Mr Gonzalez revealed he was committed to Mr Lubbers
two months ago, the contest appeared over.
Then, the dynamics of the race changed. A report in the Guardian newspaper
stated that Chancellor Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand had grown cool
toward Mr Lubbers and had urged Mr Dehaene to make himself available. The
next day, Mr Dehaene's office declined to confirm or deny that he was a
candidate, heightening speculation.
Rumours in Brussels and Bonn persist that Mr Kohl is not as keen on Mr
Lubbers as was first thought. Memories linger of the Dutch presidency's
shaky performance in the run-up to the Maastricht treaty, notably its
ill-judged attempt to force the pace on federalism in the autumn of 1991.
Another worry is that Mr Lubbers, a prime minister, may turn out to be too
big for his boots. Mr Delors, after all, acquired head of state status
during his 10 years in Brussels.
Yet Mr Dehaene would undoubtedly be a bit of a gamble. His international
exposure is minimal, though he chaired effectively two European summits last
year. He has won plaudits as the head of a fragile coalition government
struggling to contain linguistic and political rivalries between the French
and Flemish population; but his favourite tactic of promising something for
everybody and then doing the unexpected could backfire on the the European
stage.
Mr Dehaene's biggest disadvantage is that his departure from the domestic
scene would risk destabilising the government. The same applies to Mr
Gonzalez who is struggling to keep his Socialist party together. The
Spaniard looks a more likely contender in 1999, when the EU budget must be
renegotiated and Spain risks losing out to the east Europeans hammering to
join.
So the race appears to come down to Mr Lubbers, Sir Leon, and possibly Mr
Dehaene. Sir Leon's biggest weakness is his passport. He must convince
others that he is a European first and British a distant second. His test
will come when Mr Lubbers reveals his intentions, probably after the Dutch
general elections on May 2.
A close associate of Mr Lubbers says he is staying silent because he does
not want to risk charges that he is putting personal ambition ahead of his
duties as premier.
That associate adds: 'Lubbers wants the job. Kohl and Mitterrand may not go
down on their knees to ask him to take it. They may be irritated that he has
not declared his candidacy. But they are well aware that he is running.'
To which one of Sir Leon's aides says: 'The more the merrier.'

<TEXT>
Greek consumer price inflation fell to 10.2 per cent year-on-year in March
from 11 per cent in February. In March the consumer price index rose by 2.9
per cent against February because of sharp rises in clothing, footwear,
consumer durables and household goods after the winter sales.
East German industrial orders rose 14.8 per cent in December and January
against the same period a year ago, suggesting that recovery in the five
eastern Lander is gathering pace. Orders for investment goods rose 10.1 per
cent in the period, while consumer goods orders rose 24.1 per cent. Foreign
orders fell 20.6 per cent, mainly because of a drop in Soviet orders.
Belgium's budget deficit in the first quarter was BFr274.2bn (Pounds 5.3bn),
up from BFr327.9bn a year earlier. The deficit narrowed by BFr52bn between
the first quarter of 1994 and 1993.

The European Commission yesterday gave Greece an ultimatum to lift its trade
embargo against the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia within seven days
or face legal action in the European Court of Justice, writes Lionel Barber
in Brussels. The decision in principle to go to the court was combined with
a plea to Greece and Macedonia to resume efforts to resolve the dispute over
Macedonia's constitution and flag. Athens claims that both amount to
territorial claims on the northern Greek province of Macedonia. The
Commission said that the trade embargo breaches Greece's obligations under
the Treaty of Rome, particularly in the area of a common commercial policy,
internal market and customs union.

The decision by the UDF, one of parties in France's ruling coalition, to
choose a strongly pro-European candidate to lead the government list for
this June's European parliament elections has created problems within the
coalition. The Gaullist RPR party had favoured a less pro-European
candidate. While the RPR is likely to endorse the nomination of Toulouse
mayor Dominique Baudis, the choice might drive some Gaullist voters towards
a dissident conservative list.

credits to prop up its economy. The spending was meant to boost investment,
including housing construction, and to encourage exports, the government
said. It would also increase the weight of indirect taxes in the structure
of revenues.

<TEXT>
Sweden's borrowing requirement for the 1993-94 budget year is likely to be
SKr220bn (Pounds 19bn), well below the government's forecast of SKr270bn
published in January, Mr Staffan Crona, director general of Sweden's
National Debt Office, said yesterday. The National Debt Office also
forecasts that the borrowing requirement in 1994-95 will be SKr210bn, down
from an estimate of SKr220bn in January. Mr Crona told journalists in London
that the lower 1993-94 forecast reflected the impact of Sweden's economic
recovery on the budget, likely privatisation receipts, including the planned
sale of the state's holding in Pharmacia, and the end of the financial
crisis in Sweden.

<TEXT>
The Bundesbank yesterday continued its gradual easing of lending costs by
shaving a further three basis points off the securities repurchase rate at
which it supplies financial markets with short-term funds. The move down to
5.73 per cent was seen as a further signal that reductions in the
internationally important 5.25 per cent discount lending rate could still be
expected. But analysts were divided on the timing. In the recent past the
German central bank has developed a knack for making cuts when markets least
expect them.

<TEXT>
The Dutch prime minister, Mr Ruud Lubbers, cut short an official visit to
Indonesia and returned home last night in an effort to defuse differences
between his ruling Christian Democrat (CDA) party and the Labour coalition
partners, with a general election only one month away. The coalition today
faces a parliamentary debate over its handling of a police corruption
scandal.
The opposition may table a motion of no confidence in the run-up to the May
polls. Yesterday, an independent NOVA/ANP opinion poll suggested that
support for the CDA had plunged by a third since the 1989 elections to 19.5
per cent, putting it in last place among the four top parties now led by
Labour. The main beneficiaries of voter dissatisfaction have been D66, a
centrist party, the right-wing Liberals, and a number of smaller groups
including those of the far-right.

<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin sought to avert a breakdown in the fragile calm in
Russian politics by asking all parties to sign up to a 'civic accord',
published yesterday. However, opposition figures have rejected the
president's attempt to get agreement on what he sees as the basic principles
of political life.
The draft proposes that signatories make no proposals to change the
constitution; refrain from seeking pre-term elections at the federal level;
desist from stirring passions connected with the failed coups of August 1991
and October 1993, the ringleaders of which have all been freed under an
amnesty. Mr Yeltsin is proposing that party and regional leaders, union and
enterprise heads, ministers and the president himself sign the document.
Mr Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, has already dismissed the draft
as unacceptable because of the moratorium on constitutional change.
As the draft was published, Mr Yeltsin again cancelled meetings yesterday
and on Tuesday, raising fears of a recurrence of the ill health which has
kept him from his office five weeks already this year. However, his press
spokesman maintained that his health was good.
Russia will keep around 30 military bases in former Soviet republics -
including one in the Baltic republic of Latvia.

FT  07 APR 94 / Brussels warns audio-visual sector

<TEXT>
The European film and television industry is in a state of financial crisis
and will decline steadily against its US competitors unless it is radically
overhauled, the European Commission has warned.
The diagnosis, made in a discussion paper on the audio-visual industry
adopted by the commission yesterday, calls on governments to provide more
effective funding and co-operation to operate on a trans-national basis. The
document appears to reflect the divisions which remain among member states
over Europe's audio-visual policy in the aftermath of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade negotiations and the commission's own uncertainty about
how far it can endorse protectionism in the European industry.
Instead of proposing a single strategy for investment, the paper poses
questions about the future of regulation, financial stimulus, and national
convergence in the industry.
This rhetorical formula is intended to 'generate debate among the industry's
practitioners and member states', according to Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EU
cultural commissioner.
The vagueness of the paper is likely to disappoint some producers hoping for
more urgent and concrete proposals.
Commission green papers, however, deliberately avoid being proscriptive and
do not contain precise proposals.
Both Mr Pinheiro, and Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, are
expected to put their political weight behind the document at a press
conference today . Both have been keen to stress the political significance
of the report, pitched as a cornerstone of the commission's manifesto for
developing Europe's 'information highways'.
A group of leading European television and film producers and directors,
including Mr David Puttnam, were among those who submitted much more precise
proposals to the Commission.
They argued for a levy on every sector of the audio-visual industry to help
fund more commercially-orientated production and 'soft loans' to help create
a number of competing European-wide distribution organisations each
capitalised at up to Ecu1bn (Pounds 780m).
Nearly 80 per cent of the films shown in Europe are now of US origin, the
paper notes, with US film distributors enjoying a huge advantage over their
fragmented and under-funded European counterparts, currently split between
1,000 different operators.
The Commission is due to submit the paper to the European parliament for
discussion in the autumn, before drawing up proposals for possible new
legislation at the end of the year.

FT  07 APR 94 / Hungary paves way for power sell-off
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's parliament yesterday voted through an act regulating the
electricity industry and creating the conditions for eastern Europe's first
wholesale power privatisation.
The law breaks the national monopoly on electricity generation and
distribution held by the electricity utility, MVM, allows for independent
utilities and establishes the basis for a division along British lines
between power generators and distributors.
Crucially, the legislation, on which the UK merchant bank Schroders has
advised the Hungarian government, establishes a legal framework for setting
prices. This gives foreign investors the pricing stability they need to bid
confidently in the privatisation tender due this summer.
The electricity industry as a whole has a book value of Ft570bn (Pounds
3.76bn), the government claims. Its partial sale will be of roughly the same
order of magnitude as Hungary's telecommunications privatisation.
Last December, Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of the US paid
Dollars 875m for 30 per cent of national telecoms operator, Matav, in
eastern Europe's largest single privatisation.
But the crucial determinant of the size of the transaction is the detailed
pricing regulation of the electricity sector, which will flesh out the act
passed yesterday and is due in the coming weeks. Tariffs may have to nearly
double if the industry is to cover its forecast capital costs, and advisers
hope that price rises can close the gap in 3-5 years.
In preparation for the electricity sale, the government has split MVM into
eight generating companies and six regional distributors. West European
utilities may be permitted to acquire majority stakes in six regional
distribution companies.
The authorities also intend to allow complete foreign ownership in four
generating companies which rely largely on coal-fired power plants and
require modernisation.
The state plans, however, to retain a stake of 25 per cent in three larger
conventional power complexes and to keep full control of the Paks nuclear
power station.
Hungary has taken a liberal approach to foreign investment in the utilities
because of the pressing need to develop infrastructure neglected under
communist rule. The industry ministry estimates that the electricity sector
must invest Ft220bn-Ft250bn by the year 2000 to replace outmoded capacity
with more efficient, cleaner stations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's second-largest forestry and packaging group, SCA, yesterday tore up
a FFr2bn (Pounds 230m) plan to buy 89.8 per cent of Otor Holding, one of
France's biggest packaging companies.
SCA also scrapped plans for a SKr1bn (Dollars 127m) share issue to foreign
investors which would have provided some of the funds for the purchase.
The company said: 'SCA and the principal shareholders of Otor have not been
able to agree on final terms for the acquisition of Otor by SCA.'
The Swedish group appears to have become disenchanted with the deal after
Stora, its leading domestic rival, claimed to have first refusal rights over
the stake being sold. Stora is the minority shareholder in Otor with a 10.2
per cent holding.
SCA said that Otor's main owners, Mr Jean-Yves Bacques and family, had shown
that the pre-emption rights did not exist. However, Stora was sticking by
its position yesterday.
SCA stressed that it was not blaming Stora for the collapse of the deal,
noting that the companies had had a 'constructive dialogue'.
Stora insisted it had not planned to exercise its first refusal option and
said it had been willing to sell its existing stake to its rival.
SCA announced the preliminary agreement to buy Otor less than three weeks
ago. It would have been the largest European acquisition by a Swedish
forestry group for three years.
The acquisition would have increased group share in the European packaging
market in products such as corrugated board to 11 per cent from 9 per cent,
assisting its wider ambition of building a 15 per cent market position. SCA
would have increased its packaging market share in France from 4.5 per cent
to nearly 17 per cent.
The group maintains that its expansion strategy will continue. However,
analysts interpreted the announcement as a setback for SCA.
SCA would have paid FFr1.77bn initially, and up to FFr255m more under a
profits-related formula.
Mr Bacques and family would have subscribed to SKr300m of the share issue.
SCA's B shares yesterday closed SKr4 higher at SKr134 on the Stockholm
exchange.

FT  07 APR 94 / Sharp rise in new mortgage lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of loans approved by Britain's mortgage lenders rose sharply in
February, giving further evidence of renewed activity in the housing market.
Another sign of recovery came in a further slight rise in house prices in
the latest Halifax Building Society index. This showed prices in March 0.2
per cent higher than in February - the third monthly increase running.
Monthly figures released by the Bank of England yesterday showed there were
88,000 loans approved in February, against 74,000 in January. The total
value of loans amounted to Pounds 4.65bn, compared with Pounds 4.33bn in
January. Loan approvals are an important indicator of the future strength of
the housing market.
The Bank's figures also show building societies gaining a higher share of
the mortgage market than last year. Within total net lending of Pounds
1.53bn in February, societies lent Pounds 1.19bn, while banks lent Pounds
587m. Other specialist mortgage lenders continued to reduce their net
exposure to the market.
This resurgence by building societies is in line with a new forecast from
stockbrokers UBS that societies' market share will rise to 65 per cent this
year from 58 per cent in 1993. This would still be a lower market share than
in any other year since 1988, when specialist centralised lenders were still
active.
The UBS forecast envisages a sharp drop in the banks' market share for 1994
to 30 per cent from 39 per cent. Banks' fixed-rate mortgages proved
particularly popular last year.
Abbey National has already said it expects its share of UK mortgages to drop
from 19 per cent to a more typical level - it gained a 14 per cent share in
each of the three years to 1992.
Mr Peter Williams, head of research and external affairs at the Council of
Mortgage Lenders, said that confidence in the market had begun to grow now
that house prices were more stable.
Provided there were 'no other shocks' beyond the tax rises and reduction in
mortgage interest relief which took effect this week, a further
strengthening in housing market activity could be expected, said Mr
Williams.
But Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS, warned that the loan
approval and house price figures could have been distorted by buyers' desire
to seize attractive fixed-rate mortgages before they were withdrawn.
Halifax and the CML, which represents banks, building societies and
specialised lenders, believe the latest figures are consistent with a
forecast 5 per cent rise in house prices this year.

<TEXT>
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's embattled prime minister, has discovered that
telling jokes to comedians can backfire.
He was obliged yesterday to deny that he wanted to resign after two
comedians, also independent members of the upper house of parliament, said
Mr Hosokawa had quipped, during dinner, that he was so exhausted he wanted
to stand down.
The professional comics divulged their revelation in a television interview
after dining with Mr Hosokawa in central Tokyo on Tuesday.
Mr Yasushi Shimomura - stage name Columbia Top - expressed surprise that
anybody took Mr Hosokawa's outburst seriously. Mr Kiyoshi Nishikawa, who
performs under his own name inside and outside parliament, said he also took
the prime minister's resignation remark as a joke.
Under increasing pressure, Mr Hosokawa was said to have told companions that
he felt frustrated at not having the freedom to admire the glorious cherry
blossoms blooming across Tokyo.
Mr Shimomura said he knew Mr Hosokawa was really tired when the prime
minister asked if he could finish up the comedian's eels and rice - a dish
said to have restorative qualities.
Their remarks whipped up an instant storm. A startled Mr Hosokawa called the
latest in a series of midnight press conferences which have become a
hallmark of his chaotic government. 'I never said anything about quitting,'
he said.
Mr Hosokawa's slip is the latest blow to his already weakened credibility.
It has aroused suspicions that his patience is indeed being worn down and
that coalition allies will now start to seek a replacement.
It was only a matter of time before Mr Hosokawa does resign, said Mr Yoshiro
Mori, secretary general of the opposition Liberal Democratic party. 'I think
he really did say he wants to quit, because it is about time for him to go,'
Mr Mori said. Mr Hosokawa is already struggling to disprove LDP allegations
of financial irregularities.
He has been forced into embarrassing U-turns over the past two months on
plans for a rise in consumption tax, a cabinet reshuffle and a merger of the
seven parties in his coalition.
This latest misunderstanding drew attacks from Mr Hosokawa's own allies and
the LDP, which is blocking parliamentary debate on the annual budget until
he produces documents or a former aide to testify on an allegedly irregular
loan.
The budget blockage has caused growing alarm among Japanese businesses.
Mr Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Nikkeiren employers' federation,
yesterday called on the government to give the budget bill top priority and
discuss scandal outside the main session.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said the prime minister
'must have made a remark that could be linked to resigning'. The coalition
should now consider LDP demands for Mr Hosokawa to produce full evidence to
disprove the loan allegations, Mr Takemura said.

FT  07 APR 94 / UN forces chief to set up Bosnia peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Sir Michael Rose, the UN military commander in Bosnia, yesterday
agreed to a Bosnian Serb request to arrange talks with their Moslem enemies
on an overall ceasefire.
Gen Rose, speaking after talks with the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan
Karadzic, and military chief, General Ratko Mladic, said he had promised to
help arrange talks on a 'global cessation of hostilities'.
He said the Serbs had pledged to stop shelling the embattled Moslem enclave
of Gorazde, to which he cancelled a planned visit yesterday. At least 64
people have been killed and 300 wounded in a week-long upsurge of fighting
around the enclave, one of three so-called UN safe areas for Moslems in a
largely Serb-controlled region of eastern Bosnia.
The British officer played down the cancellation of his own trip to Gorazde.
'If they (the Serbs) don't want us to go there now, then we have to accept
that,' he said. However, the Serbs did allow a number of UN monitors to
enter the enclave.
Gen Rose appeared to accept the Serb contention that the recent push forward
by their forces around Gorazde was in response to Moslem advances in other
parts of Bosnia. The Serbian request for talks, and the UN's willingness to
treat the request as sincere, boosted hopes that the 'rolling ceasefire'
process in Bosnia could acquire fresh momentum.
However, diplomats said further progress would depend on consistent pressure
from Washington and Moscow, the architects of the Sarajevo ceasefire and the
federation pact between Bosnian Moslems and Croats.
There have been signs of internal disagreement in both capitals. In
Washington, the Pentagon has firmly ruled out air strikes against the Serbs
in the Gorazde area, while the US State Department has been less
categorical. The White House was understood to be working yesterday to
hammer out a common US approach to the peace effort.
In Moscow, the Duma or lower house of parliament has voted to discuss calls
for an end to Russian participation in sanctions against former Yugoslavia.
A vote against sanctions would weaken the authority of President Boris
Yeltsin's administration, although its legal impact would be unclear.
Control of all or part of the Gorazde area would bring the Serbian side
closer to its goal of linking Serbia with Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia.
There is speculation that the Serbs might be prepared to trade territory in
northern Bosnia if they could establish control over Gorazde and the other
Moslem enclaves.

A suicide car bomber blew up a bus in Israel yesterday killing eight people
and wounding at least 45. The extremist Islamic Hamas movement said it
carried out the attack in revenge for the massacre of Palestinians in Hebron
in February.
Witnesses said children fled the explosion 'burning like torches' when the
385lb bomb exploded at midday at a central bus stop in the relatively
peaceful northern town of Afula.
The attack, one of the bloodiest yet seen inside Israel itself, prompted the
government to seal off the occupied territories preventing Palestinian cars
crossing into the Jewish state.
The bomb blast coincided with talks in Cairo between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organisation on implementing their peace deal. However,
Mr Yossi Sarid, environment minister, said the peace talks would continue.
Otherwise 'we are placing ourselves in the hands of these suicide bombers -
and that is their wish'.
The bombing by Hamas, which had vowed to avenge the lives of 29 Palestinians
massacred by a Jewish settler in Hebron, will fuel growing Israeli
right-wing opposition to the peace process.
As promised, Hamas struck 40 days after the February 25 Hebron massacre  -
the mourning period which, in Islam, must be observed before revenge can be
taken. The Islamic movement warned Israel that suicide operations would
increase.
Shlomi Dahn, an 18-year-old schoolboy who ran to the scene after the blast,
said screaming people whose clothes were on fire were trying to escape from
the bus. 'It was like a battlefield,' he said. 'Bodies and parts of bodies
were everywhere and there was blood, noise, smoke - everything like war.'
Mr David Harbi, keeper of a music store who rushed to the scene, had burns
on his hands where he had tried to douse flames on the victims' clothes.
'It was like the worst nightmare of the Jews,' he said - 'the feeling that
if the Arabs have the chance they will drive us into the sea or kill us
all'.
In the aftermath Arabs in the town were randomly beaten. Israeli teenagers
gathered at the charred bus stop to denounce the peace process and the
government of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister. They chanted 'Kill the
Arabs', and sang songs praising Dr Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish settler who
was responsible for the massacre at Hebron.
Mr Harbi said: 'The absurd thing was that in one of the school bags I saw
Arabic language books. The child was trying to learn Arabic to prepare for
the peace. Can you imagine that? If this is the price we have to pay for
peace, we don't want it anymore.'
Mark Nicholson adds from Cairo: Mr Nabil Shaath, who has led the Palestinian
delegation in talks with Israel on self-rule for Gaza-Jericho, said such
incidents were 'one of the reasons we are pushing for the signing of this
agreement - to stop the killing on both sides.'
The attack showed the urgent need to complete as soon as possible the
details of an Israeli withdrawal, he said.

FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Hongs prepare for climate change
 -Groups are searching further afield for fresh gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turning in strong profit growth last year was, for a Hong Kong-based
conglomerate, arguably like stealing candy from a child. The colony's hongs
all hold respectable land banks, at a time when demand is far outstripping
supply, and are tapped into important infrastructure projects at various
stages of development.
However, with a strictly controlled supply of new land - just 50 hotly
fought-after hectares a year - the developers are casting their nets further
afield, buying up plots across the border in China to create commercial and
residential units. The conglomerates are doing likewise and are exploring
new lines of business in fields such as communications, industry and
aviation.
Wharf, which has an asset base of about HKDollars 100.5bn (USDollars 13bn),
is moving into cable TV and telecommunications. Hutchison is increasing its
container terminal interests and preparing for the April launch of its
revamped UK telecoms business. Swire Pacific is investing more in ports and
bottling activities in China.
With the exception of the container terminals, none of these new projects
are expected to make a large impact on the remaining financial statements
this century.
Mr Edmund Brandt, investment analyst with Jardine Fleming, does not see
Wharf's cable TV making a large contribution to profits before 2000.
In 1993, Wharf derived 75 per cent of its HKDollars 2.7bn profits from
property. Over the next three years three new development projects adding 6m
sq ft will come on line. The increased supply, twinned with rising rentals,
will sustain growth over that period.
Earlier this year, Citic Pacific, the Beijing-controlled conglomerate, paid
HKDollars 3.4bn for a 50 per cent share in Discovery Bay, a residential
complex on one of Hong Kong's outlying islands. This will see its property
earnings increase in the current financial year. Last year, the property
portfolio was valued at HKDollars 5bn.
Citic is positioning itself for the changed climate with power station
interests in China (a path followed by Hutchison) and remains on the
acquisition trail for both properties and investment/management stakes.
For Swire Pacific, where overall earnings were eroded by the fall in profits
at Cathay Pacific, the 1993 picture was property driven. About half the
profits came from this source and are expected to rise to about 60 per cent
this year. The group has a HKDollars 56.2bn portfolio of investment
properties and is in one of the strongest positions to carry on milking the
property cow.
Bucking the trend of strong property earnings last year, Jardine Matheson's
Hongkong Land, its 32 per cent owned property investment arm, reported flat
net earnings of USDollars 306.5m, compared with USDollars 305m in 1992,
partially due to losses at Trafalgar House.
Mr Ravi Nahrain, head of research at Peregrine, notes that Swire's
commercial property portfolio eclipses that of Hongkong Land's. Only four
years ago, Hongkong Land's was double the size of Swire's.
'Hongkong Land was the largest commercial property landlord on Hong Kong
island. Now it has quite clearly been replaced by Swire Properties. On a
divisional breakdown, the driving force for Swire's earnings for the past
couple of years and looking forward will certainly be Swire Properties. They
have acquired what is arguably the best property investment portfolio in
Hong Kong, and that will grow by a further 50 per cent - at least - in the
next five years,' Mr Nahrain says.
Swire is addressing the supply constraints on land in a more conservative
manner. There is no flashy bidding at auctions, the preferred route for
many. It is not calling on the Hong Kong and Chinese governments to free up
more land, like Hutchison chairman Mr Li Ka-shing. Unlike Jardine, it is not
selling out in favour of foreign fields.
Swire Properties will add almost HKDollars 4bn to its net asset value by
transforming a bowling alley and cinema, owned by the group, into an office
building, simply for the construction cost. It has teamed up with the likes
of Citic and China Motor Bus to acquire plots at prices deemed to be on the
low side.
The group has a good prospect in its Tai Koo development on Hong Kong
island. Office rentals here are about a third of those in the prime business
district of central, but the area is well served by public transport and is
closer to the airport. An increasing number of companies are relocating
staff there, including some of the colony's biggest employers such as
Jardine Pacific, Hongkong Telecom and Swire
On top of demand, there is room for rentals to move upwards. Mr Nahrain
reckons another 50 per cent is within reach over 18 months, whereas it is
unlikely that prime Exchange Square rentals will rise to the same level of
HKDollars 150 a sq ft.
Aviation, possibly the weak link after the profits fall at Cathay Pacific,
has proved more of a mixed blessing. Dragon Air, the regional airline in
which both Citic and Cathay Pacific have large stakes, is reckoned to have
grown more than 80 per cent last year, according to Peregrine. Earnings at
Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Company rose 15 per cent last year. As Cathay
turns round, so aviation contributions will swell.
The exciting stories in the years ahead will be in the fields of
infrastructure and communications. Container terminals will become more
valuable to those companies which have invested in the ports, and are
expected to become the driving force for Hutchison's earnings.
In communications, Citic will this financial year reap an additional
HKDollars 250m in earnings from its stake in Hongkong Telecom in its first
full-year holding, according to Crosby Securities.
China will continue to play an important role for the hongs, possibly to a
lesser extent at Jardine Matheson. According to Peregrine, the princely hong
that started the Hong Kong ballgame rolling has been a net seller of
HKDollars 7.4bn-worth of Hong Kong and China assets.
It may be churlishness ahead of the de-listing next year but Jardine is
generally deemed to have done the least in terms of a strategic blueprint to
take it up to the turn of the century. Jardine's star turn in 1993 was
Jardine Fleming, the Hong Kong merchant banking joint venture with Robert
Fleming, which saw net profits leap 166 per cent to USDollars 202m.
However, any stock market downturn will hit Jardine Fleming. Analysts also
fear the parent will find it tougher to do business in China following the
de-listing.

FT  07 APR 94 / World Trade News: US-Soviet launch venture - Correction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An article published on March 18 ('US-Russian space venture in key deals')
stated that Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia International (LKEI), a US-Russian
venture to launch satellites using Russian Proton rockets, had secured
contracts to launch up to five satellites for Societe Europeene des
Satellites (SES), the operator of the pan-European Astra satellite system.
Although LKEI has reconfirmed it has an agreement to provide launch services
for SES, a final decision on the launch provider for Astra 1F will,
according to SES, not be made before the end of 1994. The US-Russian venture
has pointed out that final agreements have yet to be reached on specific
launches.
SES said that it has not signed a contract for the launch of five satellites
on board Proton launch vehicles. However, SES is 'considering launching the
Astra 1F satellite on a Proton launch vehicle,' said Mr Yves Feltes, a
spokesman for SES, 'and is proceeding with technical activities necessary to
make such a launch feasible.'
SES was incorrectly identified in our report as the operator of the DirecTV
satellite broadcast system, which is about to be introduced in the US by
Hughes. We regret this error.

FT  06 APR 94 / Pakistan prepares for power crisis: Worst-case scenario
predicts six-hour electricity cuts each day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan is preparing for one of its worst power crises this summer as water
levels at Tarbela and Mangla, two of the world's largest earth dams, and a
large source of power generation for the country, remain critically low
after a long dry spell.
The worst-case scenario predicts at least six hours of power cuts a day,
senior officials say. That forecast has added a sense of urgency to efforts
for attracting new investments in the power sector.
The government estimates the country will be short of almost 7,000MW of
electricity within the next five years, almost 60 per cent of the present
total generation capacity of almost 10,600MW. Efforts to cut waste could
save up to 2,000MW.
'The most critical shortage of all in the economic sector is that of power
which is holding up our production, investment and causing a lot of
inconvenience to people,' says Mr VA Jafarey, adviser to the prime minister
on finance.
A recent report prepared by a government task force on energy forecasts that
investment of up to Rs329bn (Dollars 10.8bn) would be needed to fill the
gap. Only some Rs54bn in new private investments is currently projected, it
notes. For the public sector to plug the gap 'is totally unrealistic' in
view of budgetary constraints, the task force adds.
Among incentives to attract investors, the task force has recommended
increases in tariffs, and cutting down red tape.
Increased domestic use has been partly fuelled by growing imports of
air-conditioners and other electrical appliances. Domestic users account for
40 per cent of total generated power, compared with only 10 per cent in
1970. The proportion is estimated to rise to 52 per cent by the end of the
decade.
'Every dollar you invest in power is now giving you a lesser return,' says
one official, adding: 'This is an unsustainable situation'.
The government is also preparing a bill to be sent to parliament this month
to punish the theft of electricity with up to five years' imprisonment. Up
to 23 per cent of the power generated by the Water and Power Development
Authority (Wapda), the largest power generation and transmission company, is
lost in transmission, breakdowns, leakages and corruption, some officials
estimate.
The government has also committed itself to privatising thermal power
generation units of Wapda, which could together be worth Dollars 4bn-Dollars
5bn.
Mr Shahid Hasan Khan, an economic adviser to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,
chaired the energy task force and supports a wider role for the private
sector. He acknowledges the success of the initiative will depend on the
extent to which foreign private investors can be attracted.
Mr Michael Woodruff, chief executive of the Karachi-based 1,292MW Hub power
project, expected to be fully commissioned by summer 1997, says that 'almost
as important as money is time'.
'If you can put together a project in a shorter time somewhere else offering
a similar rate of return, you'll go to that place.'
The Hub project, biggest of its kind in Pakistan to be backed by the private
sector, took almost six years to move from planning and arrangement of a
financial package to the actual ground-breaking last year.
Project sponsors had to deal with at least seven agencies. Mr Woodruff
commends the government's decision to set up a 'one-window' operation at the
Ministry of Water and Power to deal with all the needs of project sponsors.
'You have to convince those coming from outside, in particular, that the
bureaucracy isn't going to be a problem,' he says.
Other businessmen also want to see if the government is able to resolve
political controversies, the most important being that surrounding the
Kalabagh Dam project in Punjab province.
Objections from Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) that the dam
would cause flooding in a part of its territory have held up the project for
well over five years.
Ms Bhutto's government has recently backed the sacking of the NWFP
government led by Mr Sabir Shah, an opposition leader, after a breakdown in
the provincial administration due to the defection of at least six
provincial MPs.
If a new provincial government can be formed which supports Ms Bhutto's
government, an agreement with Islamabad on the Kalabagh issue may be in
sight.
For a country where the lack of generation capacity may in future threaten
economic growth, any rainfall in coming weeks helping to raise the water
levels in dams would bring only temporary relief.

FT  06 APR 94 / Dutch toy workers protest in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Closing a plant in the Netherlands can be a notoriously complex and
expensive process, but it does not normally involve all employees travelling
abroad to demonstrate.
Yesterday morning all 162 employees of the Hasbro toy factory in Ter Apel in
the Netherlands arrived at the doors of the Hasbro International
headquarters in Stockley Park, near London, to stage an orderly protest.
The world's biggest toy company knew the visit was planned and had earlier
turned down employee requests for a meeting with Mr Norman Walker, president
of Hasbro International.
But when the Hasbro executives saw the Dutch workers - mainly members of the
CNV general union and the FNV print union - shivering outside, their hearts
melted.
'Some of them looked as if they were suffering from hypothermia so we
invited them in for coffee and sandwiches', said Mr Peter Waterman, a
spokesman for the company.
Once inside, they also met Mr Walker who explained that he could not discuss
the proposed closure until the Ter Apel employee works council had produced
its alternative plan, with the help of consultants whom the company has to
pay for.
The Dutch employees of the nearly Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) turnover toy and
games company feel aggrieved that Ter Apel has been selected for closure
despite its being, on Hasbro's own admission, a modern, efficient and
profitable plant. The trouble is, says Hasbro, that worldwide over-capacity
requires the closure of one of its three European plants and the Dutch plant
is smaller than those in Spain and Ireland and it also is not equipped to
produce both games and toys.
'As a publicly quoted company on the New York and London stock exchanges,
the company has an international responsibility to run its business in the
most cost effective and viable way possible,' said a press release from
Hasbro.
If this is the modern face of European industrial relations, it certainly
seems civilised. The Dutchmen and women chartered a Boeing 737-300 to fly
from Eelde to Luton on a public holiday but Mr Waterman said that the
company would have given them a day off to protest anyway.
The protest itself will change nothing but the 162 jobs may nonetheless be
'locked in' by Dutch employment legislation. If no agreement is reached
between the company and its employees on the alternative plan, the issue
will go to a local labour court where a judge may require Hasbro to keep the
plant open.

FT  06 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cellular telephones group Vodafone outpaced the market's other leading
telecoms stocks, delivering one of the best individual performances in the
FT-SE 100 after announcing a record number of new subscribers.
In March 58,500 new subscribers signed up with Vodafone, topping the
previous monthly record achieved in December 1993, and giving Vodafone a
customer base of 1.17m subscribers.
The March sales helped offset the impact of press comment highlighting the
threat to existing cellular companies by the imminent launch of Orange,
Hutchison Telecom's new mobile telephone service.
Vodafone raced up 20 to 536p after good turnover of 4.1m. BT firmed 1/2 to
393p after news that BT's Cellnet attracted 46,900 new customers last month,
taking its subscriber base through the 1m mark.
Cable and Wireless, whose One-2-One system is seen as most vulnerable to
competition from Orange, lost 3 at 452p.
News that Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel had settled its long dispute
with construction consortium TML turned out to be a mixed blessing. Analysts
appreciated the settlement but the stock declined 10 to 505p on fears that
the company might make a bigger than anticipated rights issue. The market
was also surprised to hear that Swiss Bank Corporation has emerged as one of
the lead underwriters of the rights issue.
Market watchers were focusing on reports that Eurotunnel's anticipated
rights issue, originally intended to raise Pounds 500m before the end of
June, may now be in the region of Pounds 750m. The company said it is to
seek shareholder approval for the issue of 150m shares should the need
arise.
A sudden burst of strength in crude oil prices, amid stories that some of
the big international hedge funds have been baling out of stocks and bonds
and shifting cash into crude oil futures, helped oil shares rise.
The biggest impact was on the exploration and production sector, usually
more sensitive than integrated oil stocks to swings in oil prices.
Enterprise Oil rallied 10 to 408p. The company's stake in the Scott Field
has increased from 12.9 per cent to 13.5 per cent.
The appointment of Mr Rudolph Agnew as chairman of Lasmo from May 24 was
given a good reception. Lasmo, which fell to 118p shortly after the market
opened, rallied to end 3 up at 124p.
The financial areas of the market were the first to respond to the early
afternoon strength in UK equities. Hopes, subsequently fulfilled, of a
strong opening on Wall Street, and talk of heavy buying of banks and
insurances by funds operating big personal equity plans, drove both sectors
sharply higher.
The big rise in the dollar boosted stocks with strong links to the Far East,
such as HSBC, which moved up 16 to 755p, and Standard Chartered, 14 ahead at
1055p.
Marketmakers were caught short of stock in Lloyds Bank, which rose 18 to
577p, Barclays, up 9 at 533p, and Abbey National, 7 1/2 firmer at 473p.
Takeover speculation in the wake of last week's news that HSBC had acquired
a 6 per cent stake continued to drive Hogg Group higher. The shares settled
17 up at 182p; turnover was 836,000 shares.
General Accident was the pick of the composite insurances, the shares
surging 24 to 644p after turnover of 1.3m on talk of strong support from
Morgan Stanley, the influential US investment bank.
United Biscuits, Britain's largest biscuits and snacks manufacturer,
performed well on speculation that RJR Nabisco, of the US, is about to sell
its tobacco interests and will then be looking to make food purchases. UB
shares added 13 at 345p. The rumour was prompted by a weekend press article
which said Nabisco was poised to offload its RJ Reynolds tobacco business to
BAT Industries for some Pounds 6.5bn. BAT bounced 14 to 472p.
Tightly held Associated British Foods jumped 18 to 577p on strong
suggestions that the group was poised to sell its retail bakery business to
Greggs. The deal would represent a small disposal for AB Foods but double
Greggs' outlets. Greggs was steady at 743p.
News that Kwik Save, the food discount company, was cutting the price of
many of its top brands in its stores restrained the shares after an early
bounce. The stock rose 10 in a weak morning market and remained unchanged at
618p as rival stocks rebounded.
Engineering and aerospace group Smiths Industries fell 9 to 465 1/2 p, after
it announced a Pounds 21.6m acquisition of a US manufacturer of electrical
heating elements.
The market appreciated an Pounds 18m acquisition by property and transport
group P&amp;O. The shares put on 20 at 713p.

FT  06 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters hit by switching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electronic news and information group Reuters Holdings fell sharply on heavy
turnover in spite of positive news as one investor was said to be shifting
funds into a derivative version of the stock yesterday.
The shares had fallen by some Dollars 2.50 in the US on Monday and were
marked down at the start of trading in London yesterday to bring them back
in line with the American Depositary Receipts. However, as London and New
York prices recovered, Reuters remained in the doldrums and closed 35 off at
1925p.
Marketmakers said there was selling of the ordinary shares to buy Daily Mail
Group bonds. The 10-year bonds issued last summer are convertible into
Reuters shares. Turnover of 4.7m shares - the third highest in more than
three years - did suggest that prices were not being merely marked lower
following jitters in New York. And the weakness came on a day when Reuters
announced that Citicorp, the US bank, was paying Dollars 80m plus redundancy
costs for Reuters to take the ailing Quotron dealing system group off its
hands. The selling also came ahead of a presentation by Mr Peter Job,
Reuters' chief executive, to analysts today and the company's annual meeting
next week.

FT  06 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares close an erratic session
sharply higher - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London market lived up to its recent reputation for volatility
yesterday, moving through a range of nearly 70 Footsie points before closing
sharply higher on the day as Wall Street belied the pundits by opening the
new session with a show of strength.
The FT-SE 100 Index gained a net 29.8 at 3,116.2, led above the 3,100 mark
again by active buying of stock index futures. Equities made the running in
the second half of the session, without waiting for a rally in British
government bonds as US Federal securities also recovered ground. Interest
rate nervousness was also soothed by the announcement that today's money
market repo tender at the Bundesbank would revert to a variable rate,
raising hopes that rates will be trimmed again in Germany this morning.
Although impressed by the turnround in the stock market yesterday,
strategists sounded wary of predicting the near term outlook. Dealers had
marked share prices down sharply at the opening after London analysts
hastened to line themselves up behind predictions that Wall Street's
weakness over Easter spelled danger for European markets. Forecasts of a
Footsie down to 2,800, and a Dow Average at 3,200, originally put forward by
Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research, suddenly became the order of the day
at a number of leading securities houses.
But the sellers of equities failed to oblige and by the second half of the
session marketmakers were paying dearly for leaving their trading books
short of stock over an extended holiday weekend which had left London
exposed to developments in markets in the US and the Far East.
Yesterday was the final trading day of the UK tax year and there were signs
that institutions were buying ahead of expected demand from private client
funds. Once again, the pressure came in derivatives markets, and trading
volume in equities was slow to develop. However, improving sentiment across
the range of equities lifted the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 10.1 to 3,763.
Buyers focused on the manufacturing sectors, leaving many consumer stocks
relatively neglected.
By the close, Seaq volume had risen to 755.1m shares, a good performance for
a session immediately following a bank holiday in the UK. On Thursday, the
previous trading day, Seaq volume of 725.6m shares was worth Pounds 1.36bn
at retail level.
Traders admitted to some bewilderment when share prices began to rise
sharply, although both short sterling and near-dated government bonds
appeared to be signalling doubts over the near term outlook for domestic
interest rates. Some analysts interpreted yesterday's performance by
equities as further evidence that investors are now focusing on the improved
outlook for British companies as the economy recovers.
The past month has seen significant increases in dividend payouts, which has
put some stocks on dividend yields of nearly 5 per cent. These yields will
enable equities to withstand the tightening of interest rates now expected
by many analysts before the end of the year
But against these more optimistic comments, there were still many expressing
bearish views. These pointed out that Wall Street, too, had been oversold
over the Easter break, and that the recovery in the Dow Average would have
to be maintained for several sessions if it were to be convincing.

<TEXT>
The recovery in US markets helped stock index futures reverse earlier falls
to end comfortably above the 3,100 level for the first time in recent
sessions, writes Joel Kibazo.
The Liffe June contract on the FT-SE 100 finished at 3,127, up 60 from its
previous close and 10 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 5
points. Volume was 16,923 lots.
Earlier, June retreated from an opening level of 3,050 as dealers reacted to
Monday's sharp retreat on Wall Street. It fell to a low of 3,035 in late
morning.
Signs of a recovery in New York brought a turnround in the contract in the
early afternoon and the solid performance from that market created a squeeze
in June towards the close of the session.
In the Liffe Mid 250, June closed at 3,760 after light trading. Volume was
25 contracts though the screen showed no volume in the same contract on the
OMLX.
In Liffe traded options, turnover of 37,197 was just shy of Thursday's
closing total. However, volume in the FT-SE 100 option showed a substantial
improvement reaching 19,256 lots against a previous 14,242 lots. Some 7,532
lots were dealt in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. Glaxo was the most active
stock option with a total of 1,063 trades.

FT  06 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Bonds lead Dow into solid
rebound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks surged yesterday when a rally in bonds encouraged investors to
hunt for bargains among depressed blue chip and technology issues, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 82.06 higher at 3,675.41, while
the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 9.37 ahead at 448.29. In
the secondary markets, the American SE composite gained 6.86 at 440.99,
while the Nasdaq composite forged ahead 23.54 to 750.95 for its
second-largest one-day gain ever.
Volume on the New York SE, at 366.9m shares, was heavy. Advances led
declines by 2,152 to 324 in a mirror image of the ratio in Monday's
sell-off.
The US Treasury market, which has led stocks into a steep decline over the
past fortnight, was the catalyst for yesterday's solid rebound. Equity
investors were relieved that bond prices finally appeared to have touched
bottom after a precipitous drop which intensified over the previous two
sessions.
Steady activity overseas, as European investors returned from the Easter
holiday, contributed to a calmer atmosphere. Late in the session, the yield
on the benchmark 30-year government bond had receded nearly 13 basis points
to about 7.27 per cent, easing concern over the upward spiral in long-term
rates.
With buyers again wading into the fixed-income markets, equity investors
were more willing to take a chance, even though there was no fresh economic
news to shape sentiment. The Commerce Department released its February index
of leading indicators. But the data, showing a 0.1 per cent decline, was
close to the consensus forecast of a 0.2 per cent fall.
Still, investors snapped up a wide range of stocks, with automobile issues
showing particular strength. General Motors jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars
57 3/8 after Furman Selz added the stock to its recommended list.
Caterpillar led the way as many of the cyclical stocks, hammered in recent
sessions, staged a comeback. After a delayed opening because of an order
imbalance, the stock ended Dollars 3 up at Dollars 116 1/4 . Deere gained
Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 86 3/8 and United Technologies climbed Dollars 3
3/8 to Dollars 65 5/8 . Cummins Engine jumped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 51
3/4 after announcing that it expected first-quarter earnings to meet or
exceed fourth-quarter results.
On the Nasdaq, technology stocks made a strong recovery after seven straight
losing sessions. Among the biggest gainers, Microsoft was Dollars 3 1/4
ahead at Dollars 87 3/4 .
Canada
Toronto stocks rebounded in relatively light trading after Monday's sharp
decline. The TSE 300 composite index gained 43.2, or 1.02 per cent, at
4,273.3 and rises outpaced falls by 544 to 271. Volume was 62.5m shares
valued at CDollars 896m. Industrial products put on 2.7 per cent and
consumer products 1.8 per cent.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo recovered 5.4 per cent in light trading as bargain
hunting was seen following a fall of some 11 per cent in the Bovespa index
on Monday. The index finished 730 better at 14,280. Brokers noted that most
of the activity came from domestic investors.

stocks rise across the board

<TEXT>
The Nikkei 225 average gained 2.3 per cent, heartened by Monday's intraday
recovery in New York equities, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index ended 440.99 ahead at 19,563.21 after a day's low of 19,184.04,
and high of 19,580.32 just before the close.
Mr Nobuhiro Kaneda, general manager of Daiwa Securities' equity division,
said the Nikkei would move in a range of 19,000 to 20,700 in the near term.
However, he added that the downside risk remained low and expected Japanese
investors to start purchasing stocks in May and June.
But some investors remain cautious due to the political situation and the
expected negative impact of the high yen against the dollar. 'If the budget
isn't approved by mid-May, it could start to have a negative affect on the
economy,' said Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Volume was 220m shares. The Topix index rose 28.45, or 1.8 per cent, to
1,588.83 and the Nikkei 300 advanced 5.87 to 291.08. Gainers overwhelmed
losers by 872 to 172, with 122 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50
index put on 1.73 at 1,302.40.
Shares firmed across the board. High-technology issues were higher in spite
of the yen's rise to the Y102 level against the dollar. Ricoh, the day's
most active issue, gained Y36 at Y855, while NEC moved ahead Y30 to Y1,100.
Arbitrage buying supported banks, with Industrial Bank of Japan rising Y110
to Y3,110 and Fuji Bank Y100 to Y2,200.
Some short term speculative stocks were lower on profit-taking. Yamazaki
Baking, which had risen previously on hopes that the company would benefit
from the current rice shortage, lost Y20 at Y2,080 and Iino Kaiun Y14 at
Y661.
In Osaka, the OSE average strengthened 319.55 to 21,686.43 in volume of 9.4m
shares.
Roundup
Wall Street's overnight performance held the key to trading in many of the
regional markets. Hong Kong, Seoul and Taiwan were shut for national
holidays.
AUSTRALIA was lifted off the session's lows by late bargain hunting and the
All Ordinaries index finished only 3.1 off at 2,050.0, having been down some
2 per cent earlier. Turnover was ADollars 673.6m.
BHP, the most actively traded stock, closed 12 cents down at ADollars 16.36
after some 11m shares changing hands.
News Corp bounced sharply off the day's low of ADollars 8.76 to end 17 cents
higher at ADollars 9.12.
Among gold stocks, interest from overseas investors pushed Newcrest up 16
cents to ADollars 6.34, while Plutonic firmed 7 cents to ADollars 6.77 and
Poseidon Gold 5 cents to ADollars 3.30.
SINGAPORE was slightly firmer but trading was thin and confined to a few
index-linked blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 22.37, or
1.1 per cent, to 2,061.49 in volume of 112.9m shares.
Gains were seen in bank, property and shipyard shares. DBS Foreign advanced
SDollars 1.10 to SDollars 14.50. OCBC Foreign put on 70 cents at SDollars
12.30 and UOB Foreign 40 cents at SDollars 11.50.
KUALA LUMPUR ended a volatile session higher as investors moved in to pick
up bargains after Monday's fall, and the composite index added 10.98 at
939.31.
BANGKOK edged ahead on bargain hunting in the banking sector, after big
fluctuations in morning trade ahead of a public holiday today. The SET index
rose 5.36 to 1,201.95, but turnover was the lowest of the year at Bt2.3bn.
MANILA was lower overall, although oil issues rose. The composite index
declined 20.69 to 2,633.01 as analysts suggested that the market was likely
to fall further to the 2,550 to 2,600 range.
NEW ZEALAND finished at its lowest level for the year as falls in world
markets caught up with the local bourse. The NZSE-40 capital index lost
35.41 at 2,049.17 after a day's low of 2,030.56. Among leaders, only Carter
Holt, up 1 cent at NZDollars 3.45, was unaffected. Telecom was hardest hit,
falling 16 cents to NZDollars 4.96.
KARACHI closed sharply lower in spite of rallying towards the end of the day
on institutional support. The KSE 100-share price index lost 35.72, or 1.5
per cent, at 2,413.11 in an extended session, recovering from a dip of 64.98
an hour before the close.
BOMBAY rose on sustained buying in selected shares by Indian mutual funds.
The BSE 30-share index gained 31.30 at 3,812.15. COLOMBO weakened in light
trading. The all-share index receded 9.64 to 1,187.34 as turnover dipped to
Rp93m.

FT  06 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Resurgent bourses defy the
prophets of doom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mini-crashes in equity markets which were forecast over the Easter
weekend failed to transpire yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
A strategy note from Salomon Brothers had said already that Continental
markets had begun to decouple from those in the US. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs
said that US bond yields should fall, eventually; that European equities are
still undervalued relative to interest rates; and that the earnings growth
'that we expect' should allow equities to outperform bonds.
FRANKFURT's Dax index rose 25.18 to 2,158.29 on the session, and a further
18.80 to 2,177.09 in the post-bourse. This followed a month of
outperformance in German equities, strong on a surge in German exports and
the prospect of accelerated earnings recovery in cyclical stocks.
Turnover rose from DM6.6bn to DM6.7bn. In carmakers, BMW and Volkswagen
continued their battle to lead the share price performance tables, rising
DM11.50 to DM840, and DM8 to DM501.50, with further gains of DM12.50 and DM4
respectively after hours. In chemicals, Bayer climbed DM8.60 to DM381.80 on
the session as traders talked of a big buy order.
Metallgesellschaft, savaged in the first quarter by US oil contract losses,
recovered DM16.80 to DM224.80 on the session, and DM4.70 to DM229.50 in the
post bourse, extending its share price recovery to DM50.50 since the
beginning of last week. Brokers said that a forthcoming rights issue at
DM250 a share was effectively underwritten by the company's creditor banks,
and that this was encouraging speculation in the stock.
PARIS took the initiative from a strong start in the US to break the
downtrend that had gripped equities since two weeks before Easter.
The CAC-40 index moved up 18.31 or 0.8 per cent to 2,100.25, having seen a
low of 2,057 before Wall Street opened.
Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe, writing before yesterday's uptick,
noted that the CAC-40 was 'selling on a little over 20 times 1994 forecast
earnings, if loss making companies are excluded, and is yielding 3.2 per
cent. Following the fall since the start of the year and the break below the
200 day moving average, the market is looking for support at the 2,050
level, but is likely to remain weak on world-wide interest rate fears'.
Eurotunnel, not a CAC-40 constituent, lost FFr1.20 to FFr42.50, on the
announcement that it was planning a rights issue.
MILAN opened sharply lower amid indications of strains within the right wing
alliance, but pared its losses on signs of progress towards a new coalition
government. The Comit index finished 10.58, or 1.4 per cent lower at 724.53,
with much of the day's demand coming from bargain hunting by domestic funds.
Mr David Roche and Mr Richard Davidson at Morgan Stanley who think that
Italian equities could rise by another 15 per cent this year under a
Berlusconi government, raised the Italian weighting in their equity only
European model portfolio from zero to an overweight 6 per cent at the
expense of the UK, France and Switzerland.
Olivetti, L52 lower at L2,652, bucked a mostly firmer trend among blue chip
industrials: Mr Miles Saltiel at Robert Fleming Securities commented that
before the speculative spree which preceded the award of Italy's second
mobile telephone licence, the stock was at 44 per cent of the current price,
which discounts some L1,110, representing Olivetti's share in the Omnitel
franchise. However, Mr Saltiel's analysis suggested that the value of the
franchise for ordinary shareholders was L710, and he has advised investors
to take profits.
AMSTERDAM began the new month with a firm rise, clawing back early losses
when the AEX index fell through the 400 level, seeing a session low of
399.06. The index took its cue from a good opening on Wall Street and
finished the day up 1.55 or 0.4 per cent at 405.40.
KBB, the retail group, went against the trend, losing 70 cents to Fl 113.80
as it announced a rights issue of 1.3m new shares to finance acquisitions.
Aegon, the insurance group, was one of the day's outperformers, finishing up
Fl 2.80 at Fl 97.40, having announced better than expected results before
the Easter break.
ZURICH recouped early losses as Wall Street opened firmer and the SMI index
picked up from a low of 2,769.6 to finish 12.5 higher at 2,807.3.
Chemicals and cyclicals led the market higher: Ciba, the most active stock,
added SFr17 to SFr899.
Comments by Mr Markus Lusser, the Swiss National Bank president, that he
would not be surprised to see inflation below 1 per cent by the summer,
failed to inspire flat to lower financial issues: Zurich Insurance finished
SFr13 down at SFr1,300.
MADRID recovered virtually all of Monday's losses, the general index rising
8.85, or 2.85 per cent to 319.03. US-oriented stocks did well. Telefonica
took back more than it lost, rising Pta110, or 6.8 per cent to Pta1,730 and
Repsol put on Pta180, or 4.5 per cent to Pta4,220.
ISTANBUL surged 7 per cent during an active session in response to the
long-awaited package of austerity measures to cut the budget deficit and
reduce inflation, unveiled by Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister. The
composite index added to Monday's 8.8 per cent advance with a rise of
1,144.97 to 17,500.97.
WARSAW was lower again, the Wig index giving up 749.8, or 5.2 per cent to
13,785.1 in a continuation of the sell-off that has seen the market fall by
a cumulative 33.6 per cent since March 8. Some demand emerged, however, for
selected blue chips at the current prices although brokers doubted that this
indicated the start of a broad recovery.

FT  06 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Japan benefits in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The broader the brush, the better the picture emerges for investors who
followed the advice of global investment strategists at the end of 1993.
They had seen a strong year for equity performance, with the FT-Actuaries
World Index up 17.6 per cent in local currency terms, and an outstanding
final quarter for emerging markets, mainly in south east Asia, as US
investors put their money abroad.
However, most of the top advisers were worried that the outflow of US
investment funds could reverse itself, given the prospect of a tightening of
the US economy.
The main lines of advice were to buy Japan, sell south east Asia and to
tinker with European portfolios. Most of this has paid off.
Three months in Japanese equities this year would have produced a gain of
7.3 per cent in local currency, or 16.6 per cent via the weakening dollar;
this compares with losses either side of 18 per cent in the Pacific Basin,
ex-Japan.
In Europe, matters have been less clear-cut. January went according to plan,
with strength in France and weakness in what was generally accepted to be
the overvalued German equity market; elsewhere on the Continent, there was
the expected outperformance in Italy, up 9.2 per cent, and in Spain, 10.1
per cent ahead. The fact that some Nordic markets had done even better was
seen as a side issue.
Unfortunately, the throttling of liquidity imposed by the US Federal
Reserve's increases in short-term interest rates, in February and March, was
no respecter of opinions. France has fallen, in February and March, faster
than Germany, where indications are that economic recovery will bring more
vigorous expansion than expected; so France ends the quarter with a fall of
6.5 per cent, slightly worse than Germany's 5.9 per cent.
The outstanding European performer has been Italy, up 19.4 per cent after
severe underperformance in the last quarter of 1993. James Capel, in a
strategy note subtitled 'Berlusconi's plastic revolution', retains an
in-line recommendation on Italy within a European portfolio, primarily on
the grounds of an improving macroeconomic position and respectable corporate
earnings growth this year and next. However, it also notes: 'The unstable
composition of the right-wing alliance makes the policy outlook more, rather
than less, confused, introducing a higher level of risk for the equity
market.'

FT  06 APR 94 / Markets Report: Sharp rise for the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday rose sharply in early New York trading on the back of a
strong showing from US bond and equity markets, writes Philip Gawith.
Improved sentiment, helped by follow-through buying after last Friday's
strong set of employment data, helped the US currency recover from recent
lows. It ended in London at DM1.7071 against the D-Mark, from DM1.6788
before the long weekend. By the close of New York trading it stood at
DM1.7144.
Analysts were cautious, however, about signalling a turnround in fortunes
for the dollar, which underperformed expectations during the first quarter.
Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan, commented: 'Price
activity in the last few weeks has been a case of two steps forward, three
steps back.'
Elsewhere, the D-Mark was slightly weaker in Europe, but the pound had a
better day, with the sterling index finishing at 79.3 from 78.9 where it
started trading.
After a quiet start, the dollar rose sharply in the European afternoon when
US equity markets opened. A key factor in the US currency's recent weakness
has been the uncertainty in bond and stock markets since the Federal Reserve
first tightened policy on February 4.
But yesterday's rally in New York served as a reminder to the market that
there remain good fundamental grounds for believing in a stronger dollar.
Principal among these are an interest rate differential moving gradually in
the US's favour, as German rates (and most of Europe with them) fall and US
rates rise; and a growth argument - the fact that the US is enjoying
stronger growth than any of the other leading economies.
On the other hand, investors are only likely to believe that the dollar's
rally is sustainable when it becomes clear that a measure of calm has
returned to US bond and share markets.
There is a further uncertainty. Mr Steve Barrow, economist at Chemical bank,
comments: 'The market is grappling with the idea of whether stronger US data
should be interpreted as good or bad for the dollar.'
Logic suggests that strong growth will be followed by higher rates, which
should be dollar positive. The alternative view is that strong growth will
scare the market into believ-ing that the Fed is playing 'catch-up' in the
battle to curb inflation. This perception would harm the dollar.
The D-Mark ended generally weaker yesterday under pressure from the stronger
dollar. The exception was the French franc, which closed in London at
FFr3.416 per D-Mark, from FFr3.414 last Thursday.
The Italian lira continued to strengthen as post-election optimism about the
prospects for a new government persisted. It finished at L960.8 to the
D-Mark from L963.3.
The focus of attention in Europe, however, was the Bank of Portugal's
defence of the escudo, which fell to a low last week of Es104.60 against the
D-Mark. There were two strands to the bank's actions. First, the regular
intervention rates, normally announced at the start of each 4 to 14-day
accounting period, were suspended. Instead, the bank only offered one-day
funds, giving it a much tighter grip over money market conditions.
Second, the Es344.1bn that the bank put into the system in this way was
offered at interest rates of 13 and 14 per cent, compared to the last
regular intervention rate of 10 per cent set on March 28.
Although analysts said the central bank's efforts appeared overdone, it
succeeded in stabilising the currency, which finished at Es101.8, from
Es102.7 last Thursday.
But Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International, said
sentiment remained negative. Most observers believe the economy (IBJ
estimates that GDP shrank by 1.5 per cent in 1993) needs lower interest
rates, not higher ones. Indeed, Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva
contributed to this perception recently when he said rates could fall by 200
basis points by the end of the year.
Also, the escudo is overvalued against the dollar, D-Mark and in terms of
its own purchasing power parity, said the IBJ analyst.
Conditions remained tight in German money markets, with call money at 5.80/6
per cent, down from 6.75 per cent. Dealers expect the rate to go lower. In
the futures market the June Euromark contract firmed by two basis points to
94.57.
Sterling finished lower against the dollar, at Dollars 1.4638 from
Thursday's Dollars 1.479. But against the D-Mark it rose to DM2.4987 from
DM2.4829. Yesterday evening it was trading at the DM2.51 level.
The pound's better performance on the back of the dollar helped short
sterling futures rally after a very weak start. The June contract closed at
94.47, from 94.53 on Thursday, after touching a low of 94.39 at one stage.
The December future finished at 93.91, compared to a low for the day of
93.78 and Thursday's close of 94.03.
In the discount market the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 250m shortage
with a Pounds 271m round of afternoon assistance.

FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tender trap planned for cattle
ticks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interrupting the sex life of a humble African cattle tick could help save
millions of pounds lost each year through cattle disease and constant
applications of insecticide, according to scientists at Britain's Keele
University.
The brown ear tick, which is about the size of a small grape, attacks cattle
by drinking their blood, damaging their hide and milk output and spreading
deadly East Coast fever.
The fever is prevalent in southern and east Africa, killing about 500,000
cattle each year in the latter region alone. Ticks world-wide are believed
to cause about Dollars 7bn worth of damage annually in animal deaths and
disease, lost production and veterinary costs.
Keele is embarking on a Pounds 60,000 one-year project to find ways of
tricking male brown ear ticks into thinking they have found a mate. Research
on other ticks in the US has already developed decoys - beads that secrete
the female pheromone, the chemical that attracts males.
Dr Gordon Hamilton of Keele says the UK research, funded by the Overseas
Development Administration, will examine the possibility of adding
pheromones to insecticides poured or sprayed onto cattle.
'We hope the pheromones will remain active longer than the pesticide and
disrupt mating,' he explains. 'Their presence on the host animal would make
the male tick feel the whole animal was a female tick.'
The aim is to cut the number of ticks, not to eradicate them, as this would
reduce cattle resistance to the disease.

FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper surrenders gains -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER prices surrendered early gains at the London Metal Exchange yesterday
afternoon to end only just above last Thursday's levels. But other metals
picked themselves off their lows by the close.
'It was a very mixed day - not a great deal of business, and nothing going
in any direction for long,' commented one trader. He suggested there might
have been 'a bit of an Easter hangover'.
Copper prices struggled after an inconclusive break above Dollars 1,910 a
tonne for three months delivery. By the close of the after-hours 'kerb'
session the price was threatening to fall below the Dollars 1,900 level and
test downside targets around Dollars 1,880.
ALUMINIUM prices moved in the other direction, the three months pushing
through a Dollars 1,310 target, although fairly stiff resistance was found
above that level. Late commission house selling trimmed off some of the
market's gains and final business was at Dollars 1,314, up Dollars 5 up from
Thursday.
At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures managed to stage a sharp
recovery in the afternoon after a troubled start. The July position finished
Dollars 22 higher at Dollars 1,385 after begining in the minus column
following the overnight reverse in New York.
'It managed to hold this morning though, and then there was aggressive
buying from one quarter,' one dealer said, adding that that had prompted
investment funds to move in.

FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tobacco growers abandon their
pipe dreams - Caution is the watchword for this year's Zimbabwe auctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zimbabwe's flue-cured tobacco auction auction season open today at a time
when, in the words of one marketing expert: 'There's a lot of pessimism
around'.
Growers and buyers alike predict a cautious, soft start to the sales after
last year's shocks, when growers could hardly believe how little was paid
for good quality tobacco. In the first four weeks of the 1993 sales,
flue-cured tobacco prices averaged 97 US cents a kilogram, little more than
half the 189 cents of a year earlier. Even after the mid-season recovery,
the record 218.5m kg crop averaged only 123 cents a kilogram, 62 per cent
below the record level of 1991 and 25 per cent less than was paid for
low-quality, drought-stressed leaf in 1992.
Last year, growers misread the market badly, having convinced themselves
that the low 1992 price was a reflection on the poor quality of the
offerings rather than growing oversupply in the world market. Accordingly,
many went for volume, only to find their margins cut to the bone as costs
continued to mount while prices tumbled.
They now accept that 1991 was a freak year and that market fundamentals are
now far more negative than three years ago. Accordingly, output has been cut
by more than 20 per cent to about 172m kg.
Quality is harder to assess at this juncture. Although the season started
well, tobacco growing areas received only about 80 per cent of normal
rainfall, while just one region enjoyed above-average moisture. Climatic
conditions were very variable, deteriorating in the last six to eight weeks
of the growing season, when the rains cut off early amid abnormally hot
conditions. This was a godsend for some growers in the north who, up to
then, had had too much rain; but it was a serious setback to the quality of
leaf for many others.
Both growers and buyers are predicting a soft start to the sales.
Manufacturers, who are carrying substantial stocks, will be in no hurry to
secure their supplies, says one leading tobacco merchant, pointing out that
the nature of the Zimbabwe sales has changed with the advent of high
domestic interest rates.
The big players - the five multinationals that dominate the market - borrow
offshore at low, hard-currency interest rates. The local merchants used to
play a speculative role, buying up to a quarter of the crop in the early
part of the season and selling it on to manufacturers at firmer prices later
on in the year. But with high local interest rates - 30 per cent and more -
and little likelihood of further significant depreciation of the Zimbabwe
dollar following the 17 per cent January devaluation, there is little
incentive to speculate, especially at a time when global oversupply is
estimated at around 275m kg.
Today there are two quite distinct markets for flue-cured leaf - a quality
market dominated by the US, Brazil and Zimbabwe - and a much larger market
for fillers and lower quality tobaccos, which is where the main oversupply
has arisen.
Like Zimbabwe, Brazil and the US have cut production, but new factors are
depressing demand, including President Clinton's latest onslaught on the US
industry, the price war in the US cigarette market - forcing manufacturers
to seek low-priced supplies wherever possible - and Washington's new
protectionism. Last year, the US Congress approved legislation limiting
tobacco imports to 25 per cent of total usage by manufacturers, and, because
tobacco is a politically incorrect commodity, this has drawn little
criticism from the fair trade lobby.
The US quota means that new markets will have to be found for most of the
36m kg that Zimbabwe exported to the US last year along with Brazil's 70m
kg. Third world exporters hope, however, that US manufacturers will make
their cigarettes offshore, as in the case of Phillip Morris in Turkey, using
leaf from Brazil, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in preference to higher-priced US
tobacco.
Mr Chris Molam, Chief Executive of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association, which
represents the country's 1,660 commercial growers, says: 'If we can get our
tobacco into these offshore-manufactured blends, then we are on our way'.
There are marketing problems at home too. With one buyer - the US-based
Universal group - building up, partly by taking over smaller operators, a 45
per cent market share at the Harare sales, growers complain that the
auctions have become less competitive than they were.
This year, however, there will be new faces in the buying line with the
admission of the domestically-owned Boka group of companies. Mr Boka, a
black Zimbabwean political heavyweight, with little business muscle, hopes,
with strong government support, to build market share at the auctions, and
'indigenise' what has always been a white-dominated activity.
More competition in the buying line can only be good for the growers, but
there are worries about the quality of that buying and the potential for
price volatility. The consensus view - and last year the consensus was
wildly optimistic - is that the price will harden modestly at the 1994
sales, averaging at least USDollars 1.35 a kilogram (up 10 per cent) and
possibly as much as Dollars 1.45.
As the country's top export, worth an estimated USDollars 325m last year,
tobacco is crucial to the country's export drive under the structural
adjustment programme. Exports have stagnated since independence 14 years
ago, but must now take off if structural reform is to succeed.
In 1991, the World Bank forecast that Zimbabwe's tobacco exports would
double within five years; in fact they have fallen nearly 40 per cent since
then. Leaf exports are likely to slip further this year, but 1994 could well
be the trough of the cycle. 'The market is on the turn,' says one of the
more optimistic merchants.

FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US funds push oil price above
Dollars 14 a barrel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices held on to their sharp Easter Monday gains yesterday as European
markets resumed trading after the holiday.
The benchmark Brent blend May futures contract was at Dollars 14.34 a barrel
in late trading on London's International Petroleum Exchange, 13 cents off
the day's high but a gain of Dollars 1.09 from the pre-Easter close.
Dealers said that the rise appeared to have been triggered by US investment
funds, which had been seeking new opportunities following the recent
weakening of bond and equity prices.
Strong buying in the US markets on Monday left the oil price at its highest
point for two months.
The change in sentiment came despite the recent agreement by Opec to leave
its 24.52m-barrels-a-day production ceiling unchanged for the rest of the
year. The agreement helped drive the Brent price below Dollars 13 a barrel
to a five-year low early last week.
The question now facing dealers is whether the latest gains can be
sustained. The market fundamentals have not altered and oil demand faces its
period of greatest seasonal weakness as the northern hemisphere advances
into summer.

pact talks open

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations between rubber-producing and consuming nations opened here
yesterday with no immediate movement toward a new price stabilisation pact,
trade officials said, reports Reuter from Geneva.
Delegates at the 10-day meeting, held under the auspices of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, are aiming to replace the 1987
International Natural Rubber Agreement, which is due to expire in December
having already been extended for 12 months.
They elected Mr Peter Lai of Malaysia as conference president, but neither
consumers nor producers made official statements at the opening plenary
session. 'No paper was tabled,' one official said.
Rubber growers are expected to press for a buffer stock buying and selling
range at a higher level than in the expiring accord. But consumers are
certain to resist this, as they did repeatedly last year.

FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago futures battered
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rising interest rates and higher oil prices battered most agricultural and
metals markets on Monday, with commodities as diverse as soyabeans, silver,
and lumber coming under pressure as investors liquidated positions.
In New York, silver futures lost more than 19 cents a troy ounce, while in
Chicago, soyabean futures tumbled 30 cents a bushel, the largest decline
allowed at the Board of Trade. Lumber futures also dropped their daily limit
of Dollars 10 a thousand board feet.
In early trading yesterday commodity prices had stabilised, but few markets
were rebounding from Monday's losses, despite a recovery in the US stock
market.
Analysts said falling bond and stock prices forced some large hedge fund
investors to liquidate commodity positions to meet margin calls. Silver and
soyabean futures, popular as hedge fund investments, bore the brunt of the
selling. Lumber prices tumbled because higher mortgage rates were expected
to discourage new home construction.
Soyabeans came under particular pressure in the wake of a government report
that showed US farmers intend to plant 61.1m acres to the crop this spring,
about 3m more than last year. The report was released after Thursday's close
but futures markets were closed on Friday.
With a record soyabean crop being harvested in South America and forecasts
of higher US plantings, Mr Richard Feltes, senior grains analyst with Refco,
the commodities brokerage firm, forecast that stocks would rise to 339m
bushels in the US this year, significantly higher than in the past two
years. He said global production estimates would warrant soyabean futures
prices closer to Dollars 5.50 a bushel, far lower than Monday's close of
Dollars 6.53 1/2 for July delivery.

FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (11): Forming close links -
Education and training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Education in Dorset has a proud new symbol, in one of Britain's newest
universities.
But Bournemouth University, which attained its new status in 1992, has also
demonstrated the problems afflicting the new universities which have been
created throughout the country.
The county's further education system, which last year went through the
spasm of reform known as 'incorporation', when colleges were removed from
county council control, is also expanding rapidly, but not without teething
problems.
However, all of them are exhibiting a new entrepreneurial zeal, and forming
close links with local industry wherever possible.
The university itself says in its mission statement, set in stone in the
entrance hall, that it is a 'vocational university'. It therefore shies away
from more traditional academic courses in favour of subjects more directly
relevant to employers, such as public relations and retail management.
About half its students come from Dorset, while the remainder come from
various locations around the country. Courses reflect the needs of the local
area.
One of its specialist courses, in stonework conservation, was inherited from
Weymouth where the specialism had been developed to serve local Portland
quarries. The department undertakes highly complicated repairs of eroded or
damaged stonework from churches.
Its courses in travel and tourism remain the most popular in the UK, and
cater for a pronounced local need, with most students moving on to work in
the travel industry.
The newly established Dorset Business School aims to serve local business
and operates an executive placement scheme in conjunction with Dorset Tec.
It will place unemployed managers, who have been jobless for at least six
months, with host companies which have potential projects to be developed.
The placements last three months, follow a month-long course at the business
school, and could help ensure the county's resources are used to the full as
it attempts to emerge from recession.
Part-time MBAs are on offer, along with specialised qualifications in export
performance and 'European Enterprise Management' - courses which also
reflect the county's broader economic concerns.
But the university has come a long way since it was founded as the Dorset
Institute of Higher Education, in Weymouth, in 1971. It subsequently became
the Dorset Institute and, in 1990, was converted into the Bournemouth
Polytechnic. Only two years later it was recognised by the government as a
university.
Dr Bernard McManus, who guided the university throughout this hectic
expansion, having taken over as principal in 1983, resigned last month. The
university's governing board differed with him over the need for further
change, and suggested consolidation was in order.
A lecturers' union, Natfhe, had conducted a survey which found that its
members had felt 'under stress, undervalued and under fire', while the
university governors said that the time was right for consolidation rather
than further expansion.
Most of the work has been done, and the university now has a striking wooded
campus on the outskirts of the town, a succession of bars to keep students
entertained, and a ready and willing supply of accommodation from
Bournemouth's hotels and boarding houses.
Bournemouth and Poole College of Further Education is a rather less
glamorous institution, but it is one of the 20 largest in England and Wales,
with more than 20,000 students, and is spread across several sites around
the conurbation. It has more students than all the county's other further
and higher education institutions put together.
It has a Services to Business section which provides consultancy for small
companies, along with short courses mostly aimed at allowing employers to
cope with new regulations or to introduce new technology. For example,
foreign language training is available for telephonists, while one-day
health and safety courses cover all the recent EU directives which could
affect business.
The college retains a strong public service ethic and keeps a large bank of
computers and word-processors open for use by members of the public to try
to improve computer literacy. Much energy goes into improving links with
local businesses via the Tec and the chamber of commerce. The new Dorset
Business Link should make the college more accessible for employers and most
of its specialisms - such as catering, and hairdressing and beauty therapy -
cater for Bournemouth's services-led economy.
The county's third significant supplier of training and education for
employers is Weymouth College, in west Dorset. Occupying buildings vacated
by the Dorset Institute when it decamped to Bournemouth, it offers A-levels
to Weymouth's 16-year-olds, as well as taking a heavy burden of vocational
training.
It offers the Flexible Learning Centre, which has tailored courses for
businesses, often using interactive media and distance learning - useful for
employers in Dorset's rural area where trainees might find it hard to make
daily trips to Weymouth.
The college's Investors In People award, which it won in 1992, is another
powerful signal of its intent to make itself as useful a tool as possible
for local companies.
However, staff acknowledge that they have a hard task. Weymouth's economy is
in poor health, and following the decline of the defence industry, the
college itself is probably now the largest employer. It will measure its
success by how many new employers it can support.

FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (10): Victim of its own beauty
 -Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lulworth Cove symbolises the pressures of tourism on Dorset. The weird
geological formations caused by the sea have made it a magnet for visitors.
In consequence, the tidal erosion is matched by tourist erosion.
Almost all of Dorset's coastline is designated a heritage coast, and 1,300
sq km of the county are areas of outstanding natural beauty.
The seaside resorts, the associations with Thomas Hardy and Lawrence of
Arabia, the historic sites such as Corfe Castle, draw 3.4m visitors a year.
Many enjoy the county so much that they return again and again.
Eighty per cent of visitors to Dorset arrive by car and the dangers are
clear. Improved roads to the east make it possible for Londoners to visit on
a day trip.
Of the estimated 9m day trippers a year, half of them come to the Isle of
Purbeck.
'It is only a matter of time before the Isle of Purbeck becomes the victim
of its own beauty - unless something is done to save it,' according to Mr
Colin Bonsey, chairman of the Purbeck heritage committee which is
co-ordinating projects to manage tourism at, for example, Lulworth Cove.
The county council gave a similar warning in its tourism strategy for
1993-1995: 'Excessive tourist activity or insensitive development will
damage the quality of life for Dorset's residents and will compromise the
very real qualities which attract its many visitors.'
Yet the industry is vital to the county, employing about 24,000 people.
As elsewhere, the recession has had its impact and spending has suffered.
Room occupancy in hotels fell from an average of 51 per cent during 1991 to
49 per cent in 1992, although self-catering flats and cottages saw a rise
from 51 per cent to 55 per cent.
In all, tourism is worth about Pounds 540m a year to the county.
Staying visitors generate a much higher proportion of that income than the
day trippers. While the latter add to congestion on the roads, their average
daily expenditure was only Pounds 11 a head in 1992, compared with Pounds 26
for those who stay for one night or more.
Yet the traditional staying visitor, enjoying a fortnight's summer holiday,
will inevitably become a scarcer breed in the resorts of Bournemouth, Poole,
Weymouth, Swanage and Lyme Regis.
One answer is to have more all-weather attractions to extend the season. An
example is Poole Pottery, with its new factory shop, pottery tour and
restaurant with a harbour view.
Bovington tank museum, which has 300 armoured vehicles, will be one of the
places where there will be a plethora of activities this summer to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of D-day.
Events such as these, and the tall ships race starting from Weymouth this
year, help to stimulate tourism. But it is the higher spenders which Dorset
needs to woo if it is to maintain its income without increasing the
pressures.
A handicap in winning such trade has been that the promotion of Dorset was
fragmented, with councils developing their own policies and the county split
between two separate tourist boards; Southern and West Country. To improve
co-ordination and marketing, the county council set up a Dorset Tourism
unit, and a data project has been collating the information to develop
strategy.
Mr Barry Wilbraham, county tourism officer, believes Dorset needs to
encourage a different type of tourist - one who wants to stay in the county
and look at the heritage (which includes more than 30 hill forts and nearly
2,000 barrows).
He wants more 'green', activity-based, special interest and short-break
tourism inland away from the congested coast. He points out that there are
34 golf courses and planning consents for more. And, he adds, 'What is
coming through loud and clear is that growth in income can come from
overseas markets.'
Dorset, despite its direct ferry links with France and relative closeness to
the international gateway of London, fails to see many foreigners. Of
staying visitors, only 5.8 per cent come from European countries and 2.2 per
cent from countries outside Europe, mainly North America and Australia.
Mr Wilbraham adds: 'I want to be able to offer a truly international
destination where people want to come because of our rich heritage.'
A Destination Dorset committee is targeting more travellers from continental
Europe, and has identified Scandinavia as offering the highest potential.
One imaginative scheme to raise the international profile is a Sea Gardens
project in Bournemouth. This is envisaged as a series of gardens and
pavilions with shops and restaurants, linked by monorail for 2.4km along the
sea front as a permanent world trade exhibition, sponsored by participating
nations.
Cheshire Robbins, the project's design group, says confidently: 'Sea Gardens
will provide one of the largest weather-protected landscaped environments in
the UK.'
An existing asset for encouraging international and business travel is
Bournemouth's conference centre, which has done much to extend the town's
season.
The resort has a quarter of the county's hotels and more than 30,000 beds.
The centre, opened in 1984 and enlarged in 1990, is in direct competition
with Brighton, Blackpool and Harrogate for business. A Pounds 400,000
project this year will result in more meeting rooms.
During the recession, the centre has managed to maintain the number of
events at between 46 and 52 a year - including the Conservative party
conference this autumn - but it has seen fewer delegates.
Mrs Susan Davies, exhibitions manager, says: 'I don't see the trend changing
 -companies want to get value for money. But we have found organisers are
introducing more features to make them interesting - they are investing more
in the conferences to attract decision-makers.'
The centre has acted as a stimulus for other conference and seminar venues -
26 hotels with in-house facilities have set up a group called Conference
Bournemouth. The trade could be encouraged further if Bournemouth airport's
new scheduled services are successful.
Mrs Davies, pointing out that the average delegate spends Pounds 76 a day in
the town, says: 'The effect on the local economy of the conference trade
cannot be overestimated.'

On a greenfield site on the edge of Dorchester, within sight of the hill
fort of Maiden Castle, the first houses are being built in an ambitious
scheme, enthusiastically supported by the Prince of Wales, for the urban
development of Poundbury.
Eventually, over a 25-year period, there could be as many as 3,000 houses on
400 acres of land owned by the Prince's Duchy of Cornwall. This would entail
a surge in the county town's present population of 15,000. The start is much
more modest: 61 homes of which 35 are for the Guinness Trust housing
association to let to local people, and 26 houses to be sold by the builder,
the West Dorset company of C. G. Fry and Son, at prices of up to Pounds
150,000.
So far, the builder has had about 130 inquiries of which half are from local
people.
This first phase will in due course consist of 244 houses and flats, plus
offices, community shops and light industrial workshops. Poundbury, referred
to as an 'urban extension' of Dorchester rather than a village, is intended
to reflect traditional architectural styles. It will have a high density of
houses to foster community spirit, avoid grid layouts and try to reduce
dependence upon cars. In keeping with its back-to-the-future concept, modern
energy-saving techniques will be used in the buildings.
The master plan, by Mr Leon Krier, an architect, is regarded by some as a
dubious exercise in nostalgia, but has attracted international interest. Mr
Andrew Hamilton, Poundbury's development director, says similar schemes are
already being planned.
The Duchy emphasises that it is a landowner, not a speculative developer,
and that West Dorset district council allocated the land in 1988 to help
cope with the county's rising population. But that was before the recession
and slide in house sales.
If the development is to succeed, it has to create work for those who live
there - the aim is to provide jobs within walking distance. Commercial
development will be an important part of the second phase.
The Duchy is in talks with the county and district councils, and other
organisations, to stimulate the business interest which will be needed. 'We
cannot do it on our own, only in partnership,' the Duchy says.

FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (6): County faces a dilemma -
Transport and communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A news story in the Dorset Evening Echo, about plans to solve Weymouth's
'chronic traffic problem' with a Pounds 25m relief road, sums up the dilemma
which faces the county in improving its transport links.
The proposal, the Echo reports, 'is opposed by hundreds of residents and the
environmental group Friends of the Earth, while supporters claim the route
is a solution to congestion and a lifeline for the area's troubled economy.'
Local feelings about road building are especially strong in a rural county -
both for and against. Residents of villages battered by heavy traffic want
bypasses; environmentalists and landowners want to protect the countryside.
There is no doubt the local economy would benefit from an improved road
network. The business community has highlighted this - and the development
of scheduled services at Bournemouth airport - as prime concerns.
The county council, in a report for its structure plan, describes the car as
'the almost universal mode of travel' in Dorset. But in rural areas, it
says, the shortage of financial resources means few bypasses will have been
provided, even by the year 2011.
No motorway passes through the county and only the A31 and A35 are
Department of Transport trunk roads. While the A31 provides a good
connection between Southampton and the M27 to Bournemouth and Poole, the A35
road westwards from Poole is not adequate. A public inquiry into a village
bypass between Bridport and Lyme Regis is scheduled to open on April 11, but
one for Tolpuddle has just been put back on the Department of Transport's
reserve list - a decision which Mr Peter Harvey, chief executive of the
county council, describes as 'appalling.'
The county council will complete improvements this summer to the A37 between
Dorchester and Yeovil. But planned bypasses to improve the north-south A350
from Poole towards Bristol, a twisting road filled with slow-moving trucks,
have yet to materialise.
The port of Poole, despite the A350's inadequacy and the need for a
replacement harbour bridge, has developed rapidly since roll on-roll off
ferry freight services started to Cherbourg, 67 miles away, in 1973. A
self-financing trust port run by harbour commissioners, it reclaimed an
additional 35 acres in the early 1980s and now has three ro-ro berths, plus
berths for conventional cargo and a rail link.
Truckline - bought by Brittany Ferries in 1985 - runs its superferry
Barfleur from Poole to Cherbourg with a capacity of 70 trucks, 270 cars and
1,200 passengers. The company is about to start a new service to St Malo,
with four return sailings a week between mid-May and October. Brittany
Ferries and Mr Hamish Green, chief executive of the commissioners, are
confident in the port's ability to withstand the opening of the Channel
tunnel.
Although it is not a deepwater port, one expanding business is that of
cruise ships and 20 are due to call this year. But in January the port lost
the Jersey and Guernsey services run by British Channel Island Ferries,
whose passenger operations were taken over by Condor, the Guernsey-based
ferry company. Instead, Condor is running hydrofoil services and a
traditional ferry to the Channel Islands from Weymouth.
A mainline electrified rail service runs from London to Bournemouth and then
to Weymouth, from where there is a slow service to Bristol.
In the north, Sherborne and Gillingham are on the London to Exeter line.
For business air travel, the choice has been either Southampton or Heathrow
airports. But scheduled services are due to start from Bournemouth airport
on April 11 which will be operated by a new regional airline, Euro Direct.
Mr Neil Hansford, its chairman, intends to start with flights to Paris,
Amsterdam and Brussels. He says: 'The only limitation to the number of
services we are prepared to offer is the support we receive from the local
community.'
The airport is owned jointly by Bournemouth council and the county council,
with Christchurch council as the planning authority, a combination which has
not stimulated development. Mr Doug Wilson, who took over two years ago as
director, acknowledges that the airport had become 'quiescent.' It has
80,000 movements a year but the vast majority are of light aircraft,
although charter business has grown to about 200,000 passengers annually.
Thomson will be using the airport for the first time this summer.
Planning consent was recently granted to extend the run-off to its main
runway, which will increase the range of aircraft and free up development
land near the secondary runway.
More than 100 companies, mostly aviation-related, are already based at the
airport, employing 2,100 people, and Mr Wilson believes there is the
potential to double that. He says: 'It is quite possible for a centre of
aviation excellence to be built here.'
The cost of the runway development will exceed Pounds 1m and, although part
of that funding is in place, future expansion will require the injection of
private capital.

FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (8): Help for employers -
Business development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 'one-stop shop' has arrived in Dorset.
Local business leaders are delighted that they have succeeded in winning
trade and industry department funds for the initiative, which aims to
streamline all business development services for companies into one
operation. Dorset is the only successful applicant in southern England
outside London.
But the business leaders also accept that the plan must have some success -
and swiftly - because the county's economy is in poor health.
Funded initially by government grants, its aim is to provide all the various
services for businesses which are currently offered by competing bodies -
including the county council, the Training and Enterprise Council (Tec), the
Enterprise Agency and the chamber of commerce - under one roof.
The idea is that employers should quickly find their way to the precise
assistance they need. This, it is hoped, will help Dorset's more troubled
employers, such as the defence sub-contractors. Meanwhile, the Dorset
Business Link will also attempt a sophisticated exercise in 'picking
winners'.
'Growth ready' companies - small companies with good prospects of expansion
 -will be targeted by the Business Link's advisers for 'a high-level process
of diagnosis and support'. Four personal business advisers have been
appointed from backgrounds in the civil service with the Department of
Employment, and in management of small and medium-sized companies.
According to Mr John Morrison, chief executive of Dorset Tec, the service
will ensure 'that firms get the answers they need promptly, as a result of a
single local-rate phone call whether it's a question of marketing, finance,
export services, planning, health and safety, or any one of the numerous
other business issues they need help with'.
The Business Link will also attempt to identify export opportunities in
Europe, following on the work of the old Enterprise Agency, and will also
guide employers to the local training centres - for example, for helping
sales representatives with foreign languages.
Tecs were invited to lead the bid, and Dorset Tec did so,boosted by
government league tables which placed it first out of the 75 Tecs now
established, appearing in the top 25 per cent for six out of seven of the
criteria covered, including cost-effectiveness and quality of provision for
Youth Training and Employment Training, the scheme for unemployed adults.
It was also highly ranked for the number of Dorset companies committed to
Investors in People, a scheme to improve the training of people in work.
Weymouth College was the first college in the country to attain the
distinction, while Frizzells, the biggest employer in Bournemouth and Poole,
was among the first companies to do so.
Despite this strong performance, some local employers still complain about
whether or not the Tec provides genuinely useful services.
Mrs Beryl Kite, chief executive of the Dorset chamber of commerce and
industry, and acting chief executive of the new Business Link, claims that
if the one-stop shop does not work in Dorset, 'it's not going to work
anywhere'.
Dorset's comparative remoteness from other business centres has helped. The
county is more compact than some rural areas, most of its businesses are
pressed into one conurbation, and all the local agencies share the same
boundaries.
This gave Dorset a head-start over metropolitan areas which included
institutional disputes between several Tecs or unitary authorities, or where
more employers' organisations were clamouring for attention, according to
Mrs Kite.
But there is alarm among businesses about the local government
reorganisation. If it goes ahead - and the new structure should be
implemented in 1996 if the government persists with its plans - then
Bournemouth and Poole councillors want to create two separate unitary
authorities for the conurbation.
Ancient rivalries, caused by the fact that Bournemouth was in Hampshire
until the last reorganisation in 1974, lie behind the councillors' position,
which infuriates local businesses. One employer fumed: 'Christchurch,
Bournemouth and Poole look like one conurbation from the air and they feel
like one when you drive through them. From my point of view, services I need
come from those three areas and they need co-ordination. I can't see why we
need more than one council.'
While the entire conurbation is currently served by the county council,
there would be no authority with overall control of planning if the plans
were carried out. If reorganisation goes ahead it looks unlikely to help
developing businesses in the area.
But Mrs Kite remains positive: 'Unless they actually change the county
boundary, we'll still be serving the same area, no matter how they choose to
rename it.'

FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (4): A mainstay of the county
economy - Financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bournemouth and Poole both expanded on the back of the financial services
sector during the 1980s. Employment in the sector nearly doubled.
Consolidation has followed, and further expansion now seems unlikely. Life
insurance, in particular, faces a tough year as the industry attempts to
digest new government regulations covering sales practices which could
reduce sales and increase their costs of compliance.
But there is little danger that the area will lose any business. Mr Allan
Frost, chief executive of Abbey Life, the life insurance group and for many
years the largest employer in the conurbation, makes it clear that the
reasons for relocating still hold good.
'The reason we moved here was that in the mid-1970s if someone walked
through the door in London with an O-Level you would lay out the red carpet.
It made sense to move outside London where there was a willing pool of
labour and where costs were much lower.'
Abbey Life moved to Bournemouth in 1977 and three years ago cemented its
relationship with the town by building a new dazzling white palace for its
headquarters. The exterior has provided a new landmark which dominates the
skyline for anybody arriving in the town by rail, while the interior -
complete with a large atrium - proves to be as well-appointed an office as
any in the City of London. All the company's UK operations, including the
training of sales staff, are based in Bournemouth.
Retention of workers, in a business where employment is notoriously
volatile, has been reasonable with 10 per cent turnover a year since the
move to Dorset. At present, 65 per cent of staff have been with the company
for five years or more, while at Abbey Life Investment Services (ALIS),
which claims to be the biggest asset management operation in southern
England outside London, turnover is only 2 per cent.
Waterloo station is less than two hours away by train and the company's fund
managers, fully equipped with Reuters share-dealing technology, obviously
feel that working outside the City is no disadvantage. ALIS investment
performance has improved slightly in recent years as the company has
attempted to broaden its market to include independent intermediaries,
rather than rely totally on its direct sales force.
Moving out of London has helped retention and the company is also happy with
Bournemouth's education system which includes two grammar schools and a
number of independent schools.
However, Abbey Life has no plans to expand in the near future. It will
concentrate for the next few years on absorbing the insurance industry's
spasm of regulatory change.
Lloyds Bowmaker, the finance house arm of Lloyds Abbey Life which owns Abbey
Life, is also based in Bournemouth.
The conurbation's largest employer is now Frizzell, the insurance broking
and financial services group which employs more than 2,000, while Abbey Life
has only about 1,400 permanent staff in Bournemouth.
Frizzell's offices are crammed into several buildings at County Gate, on
what was the boundary between Hampshire and Dorset until local government
was reorganised in 1974. Attracted initially by a need for skilled labour -
the company tries not to recruit 16-year-old school-leavers - and by
relocation grants then available, Frizzell has now made its 'power-base' in
Dorset for about 20 years, and has no plans to move. Most of the company's
business is done via the telephone and little or nothing is lost by being
based outside London.
Its investment in the area has been heavy, with two floors of one office
block devoted to full-time training. This is aimed, successfully, at
boosting staff retention which is helped by siting the offices in a pleasant
seaside town.
Mr Tony Miller, manager of training, makes clear that the company is happily
settled in the area, but that expansion in employment is now probably at an
end. He said: 'I think we have reached our maximum employment level. I just
don't think that expansion of people is the answer for further growth.'
Other, more recent, arrivals include Chase Manhattan, the US bank, which is
using Bournemouth as the 'admin' centre for its European operation, and
Zurich Municipal, the insurance company, which has moved its brokerage
division to the city, although its UK head office remains in Guildford,
Surrey.
This concentration of financial services in the town helps ensure a large
pool of labour with the relevant skills. But few insurance companies are
left in London, as low central office costs are vital for them in a
competitive market. Dorset is therefore unlikely to attract many more new
businesses from the sector, although the financial services community sector
it already has seems well-established as a mainstay of the county economy.

FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (5): Big range of products -
Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ryvita, crankshafts, intelligent networks, oil, beer, liquid crystals,
opto-electronic systems and pork pies - these are just a small number of the
ever-increasing variety of products produced in Dorset.
'We have faced up to a new type of environment. Specialism is important,'
says Mr Jeremy Pope, managing director of the long-established brewery
company, Eldridge Pope, based in Dorchester.
'Focus is important', agrees Mr Rex Burke, chief executive of Hamworthy
Engineering, one of the county's largest employers.
Both companies have recently undergone a refocusing of activities in order
to capitalise on their strengths. Last year, Eldridge Pope disposed of its
beer wholesaling operation and entered into a trading alliance with
Carlsberg-Tetley. The company now specialises in wine procurement, shipping,
bottling and packaging, export packaging and specialist bottling for a
number of brewers, contract brewering and the production of cask brands and
specialist bottled beers.
Hamworthy Engineering, which began in Poole in 1914 and became part of the
Powell Duffryn Group in 1962, employs 1,200 people. Last year, it sold its
transmissions and hydraulics division to the David Brown Group in order to
focus on its other activities of marine and combustion engineering for which
it has long had a worldwide reputation. For example, Hamworthy's 'Schilling'
rudder is supplied to more than half the Japanese merchant fleet.
The company recently acquired Airoil-Flaregas from Portals and relocated it
from West Drayton to the Poole site. Hamworthy is also expanding its
interests in compressors. By focusing on these activities, Hamworthy has
achieved a turnover of more than Pounds 120m, of which about 60 per cent is
export sales.
Dorset is also home to a number of other thriving engineering companies.
Davy International is a world leader in metals engineering technology with a
turnover of more than Pounds 160m. Five hundred of its worldwide staff of
5,200 are based in Poole.
According to Mr Roy Tazzyman, Davy's chief executive: 'As we have moved to
higher technology we have found it possible to recruit some of the best
research and development engineers, skilled designers and project engineers
partly because Poole is an attractive place.'
When Trafalgar House acquired Davy in 1991 it moved Davy's world head office
from London to Poole - but because this was efficiently run with delegation
to the various companies in the group, the HQ staff comprised only 15
people.
Hunts Engineering, employing 70 people in Poole, began life in 1875
repairing bicycles in Bournemouth. This privately-owned company now
specialises in crankshaft machining. It is in at the birth and death of
various car models when car manufacturers require experimental crankshafts
at the design stage - and it produces crankshafts and spares when mass
production has ceased. Sixty per cent of its production is for export and
the company has a turnover of Pounds 5m.
Meggitt, with its head office in Wimborne, had sales of just Pounds 3.8m in
1983. Since Mr Ken Coates and Mr Nigel McCorkell took over management of the
company in 1984 it has expanded rapidly in aerospace, controls, electronics
and energy-related engineering products so that it now has a turnover of
more than Pounds 360m with operating companies around the world. Its
Dorset-based Wayfarer magnetic card ticketing systems are market leaders in
a number of countries.
Bournemouth International Airport has attracted several big companies with
aviation technology systems and other interests. FR Group, with its
headquarters in Wimborne, has developed rapidly into a world leader in the
provision of special mission flight operations and undertakes significant
aircraft maintenance, overhaul and conversion operations at the airport.
AIM Aviation has its completion centre at the airport where it installs
aircraft interiors and its avionics workshop undertakes system design,
installation and overhaul of communications and navigation equipment as well
as sophisticated in-flight entertainment systems.
Poole Harbour is the largest natural harbour in Europe and a number of
marine-based companies have facilities in the area, including Sunseeker, a
family-owned company founded in 1962 which now has a turnover of more than
Pounds 35m. Its motor yachts have found buyers in many countries.
Another family-owned company with worldwide sales is Daler-Rowney which
employs more than 100 people in three factories in Wareham where artists'
canvasses, art cases and other artists' supplies are produced.
Ryvita, a subsidiary of Associated British Foods, is based in Poole where
its factory produces many millions of packets of the 'best-tasting
crispbread' and has won two Queens Awards for export achievement with about
half its total production exported.
Another well-known food company based in Poole is Millers which was acquired
from Booker in 1991 by the Irish Foods Group, Kerry. Millers employs 400
people in Poole and its pies and other products are consumed throughout
Britain.
Another leading factory, employing 450 people, is Dolphin Packaging, the
public quoted company founded in Poole in 1969 which now has a turnover of
about Pounds 30m from its production of specialist plastic packaging for the
food and medical industries.
Liquid crystals for the electronics industry are created in Poole by Merck,
which has based its UK headquarters in the town and employs 650 people in
the area.
In Weymouth, DEK employs 220 people producing screen printers for the
electronics industry. It also provides key leading edge assembly equipment
with 80 per cent of its production being exported. Tecan produces high
technology parts for the electronics industry by photo-chemical machining
and other processes.
In Poole, Siemens-Plessey Controls employs 1,000 people and creates traffic
control and transportation systems and develops and markets equipment for
the environmental sector.
GPT, jointly owned by GEC and Siemens, employs 500 people in Poole, engaged
in Telecoms systems work, including developing, testing and marketing
intelligent networks where telephone systems are enhanced to provide a whole
range of new services.
Mr Jeffery Wear, engineering liaison manager of GPT in Poole, echoes the
comments of many other managers in Dorset: 'The area is an attractive place
in which to work and live'.
Respecting that is BP, operator of Wytch Farm, the largest on-shore oilfield
in western Europe which employs 300 people and produces about 2.5m gallons
of oil a day. BP's well sites, especially those at Fur zey Island, have been
attractively landscaped and incorporate many trees to screen the facilities
from the public.

No one who drives along the causeway which runs from Weymouth, past the
pebbles of Chesil Beach, to the Isle of Portland can fail to be aware of the
military history.
On the east side is the naval base with its huge harbour, enclosed by
Victorian breakwaters. On the densely-populated limestone lump of an island,
scarred by quarries and with a 16th century castle, is the Defence Research
Agency and the Sea Systems Controllerate.
Nowhere in Dorset is the consequence of the peace dividend more acutely
felt. The naval base will close in 1996 and, next year, the DRA Underwater
Systems division is moving 500 staff to the Atomic Energy Authority
Technology site at Winfrith. There will be redundancies among its support
services at Portland. The SSC is due to relocate much further away to
Bristol.
Nearly half the jobs in the Weymouth and Portland borough are estimated to
be defence-related. They are vulnerable not only to the military
retrenchment but to the cutbacks in the defence budget affecting many local
contractors. In 1984, the travel-to-work area ranked 235th out of 321 in
Britain in terms of unemployment. By mid-1992 it had risen to 132nd. It has
been estimated the imminent Portland closures and relocations could result
in the permanent loss of a further 5,000 jobs.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, gave a stark warning in a report
published in December 1992: 'Unless proactive steps are taken, economic and
employment difficulties in the area are set to become the most intractable
in England in the mid-1990s.'
The report, An Inward Investment Strategy for South Dorset, proposed a South
Dorset Economic Partnership (SDEP) to co-ordinate an economic strategy,
assist 'catalyst' projects and market the area. This partnership is now
established, supported by local authorities, Dorset Training and Enterprise
Council, Rural Development Commission, Dorset Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry
and local companies such as Eldridge Pope, the brewers, and DEK Printing
Machines. Mr Ray Coles, managing director of Ultra Electronics Ocean
Systems, based in Weymouth, is chairman.
An early success for south Dorset has been winning European Konver funding
to assist areas suffering from the defence rundown. A grant of Pounds
366,000 will help with projects such as retraining and business advice
centres. Another recognition of the difficulties is the granting of
intermediate assisted area status. The first new business attracted in
consequence is Edwards Medical, which won a Pounds 25,000 grant to open a
Weymouth factory sterilising and packing medical products.
Dorset, however, failed last December to win European Objective 2 status,
which would have given access to funds to improve the infrastructure. The
county council regards improvements to roads in the Weymouth area as a high
priority, although its plans have met with local opposition.
Better road access was described as vital by Drivers Jonas, the planning
consultancy, in a report published in January on the potential use of
Portland harbour once it is released by the Ministry of Defence. Drivers
Jonas said the new uses should contribute to the maintainance of the
breakwaters, which costs Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000 a year. But the
main limiting factor, it said, was that only 32 acres of land would be
available for development.
One industrial scheme has been proposed by Roil (UK) for a marine waste and
oil recycling project. Interest in the harbour from tourism and leisure
operators, Drivers Jonas reported, had so far been muted.
Leisure and tourism is one sector which holds out the promise of more jobs
in Weymouth - which has a handsome sea front and a charming if undervalued
inner harbour - and a tourism development action programme has been set in
train.
In the present climate for inward investment, attracting new businesses will
not be easy, although New Look, the fashion store chain, has chosen to be
based in Weymouth. Mr Peter Wheelhouse, SDEP's development director, sees
the release of high-quality skills by the defence cutbacks as providing a
pool of quality labour.
Mr Coles emphasises a further asset for inward investors relocating staff:
'We are surrounded by the most fantastic natural and man-made beauty.' His
own company, a management buy-out from Dowty Group specialising in
underwater towed sonars, is an example of how defence-related companies are
diversifying. 'We've had to tighten our belts significantly. We had a Pounds
10m turnover in 1990 but since then a 25 to 30 per cent reduction.
'We embarked on a product strategy - we decided to be pro-active so that,
when the ramping-down in spending started, we had somewhere to go.' Ultra
Electronics has developed the hardware for colour printing identity cards,
and the use of sonars for mapping seabeds for the oil and telecommunications
industries. 'We find that from being in very cold water, our skills are now
much sought after.'
The DRA itself, even before its move to Winfrith, is also diversifying into
civilian markets. Mr David Kimberley, director of Underwater Systems, says
there has been an assumption that all its work is secret. 'But we are very
keen to exploit the skills we have - as a partner or a sub-contractor - for
non-defence activity.'
DRA has the technology and techniques, he says, for a whole range of
industrial underwater activity ranging from remote-controlled vehicles to
image processing. And it does not have to confine itself to the oceans. An
example he gives of the DRA's amphibian approach is to adapt its expertise
in muffling submarines to cutting the noise of wind farm turbines.
On a similarly forward-looking note, Mr Wheelhouse points to the optimistic
aspects of the Coopers &amp; Lybrand report. It concluded that, if the SDEP
could achieve its objectives, 'We believe that south Dorset's prospects for
long-term growth must be seen as good.'

The Prospects have improved - Economic development

'We are feeling a little bit more optimistic about the economy. You hear
better noises from people,' says Mr John Morrison, chief executive of Dorset
Training and Enterprise Council.
While prospects for Dorset's economy have improved compared with the depths
of the recession, the optimism is guarded. Although unemployment in February
at 10.1 per cent was below the peak, it compares with a rate of only 3.2 per
cent in 1990.
From that low base, it accelerated to reach 10.9 per cent in January 1993.
This increase of 241 per cent was easily the highest in south-west England.
An analysis last month of corporate profitability by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the
business information company, ranked Bournemouth as the least profitable
town in Britain. Within the Bournemouth area, nearly 14,000 people were out
of work in December; almost half the county's total unemployed.
Soaring unemployment was the catalyst for the public and private sectors to
set up the Partners for Prosperity forum. Backed by the county council,
Dorset Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry and Training and Enterprise Council,
it intends to lobby for the county, market its opportunities and encourage
initiatives to regenerate the economy.
Mr Tony Ward, chief executive of Partners for Prosperity, says an important
role is information. 'It is vital to know what we have to offer and the
potential. We have to market the Dorset brand - to get it across that Dorset
is a good place to come to bring your company here.'
Within the county, people also have to be persuaded. 'We have to make sure
that people in Dorset think economic development is a good thing. We have to
demonstrate there can be added value to the environment from economic
development, rather than detracting from it.'
The partnership needs, Mr Ward says, to put up 'cogent arguments' in
lobbying the government and European Union for assistance. While the county
failed in December to win European structural funds, the Weymouth and
Portland area, hard hit by the defence run-down, has gained some European
Konver funding and intermediate assisted area status. Part of west Dorset
was designated a rural development area in 1984 and from April 1 much more
of the county is included in an expanded area.
The weakness of the rural economy is shown by a survey in 1991 which found
that Dorset parishes were the worst off in southern England for services.
Half had no permanent shop, post office or pub and nearly three quarters
were without a school. One fifth had no bus service.
Mr Rex Symons, chairman of Dorset Tec, says: 'If we are to preserve the
somewhat unique heritage in the west and north, it has to be a working
community, not a museum. If we could achieve increased rural activity
without destructive development, we would achieve a major breakthrough.'
Gillingham, in the rural north, is one town which has decided, together with
North Dorset district council, that it must attract investment. Land has
been earmarked for development and it believes it offers a good location:
the US company Aldrich Chemicals, which employs 100 people there, is
investing in expansion.
The town council says the decision to develop an industrial and commercial
centre was taken in the knowledge that 'the population are in agreement that
this is the most practical way to secure its future prosperity.'
The economic powerhouse of the region, however, is anchored in the
conurbation around Bournemouth and Poole, where the mainstay industries of
manufacturing, financial services and tourism have suffered in the
recession. But Goadsby &amp; Harding, a leading independent estate agency,
believes this year will see the beginning of speculative office development,
triggered by increasing inquiries and the lack of prime new office property.
It reports 'significant shortages of large, modern specification buildings'
in south-east Dorset.
This indicates the local economy is not all a tale of retrenchment. At
Poole, Surface Electronics, a manufacturer which employs 350 people, moved
to its existing factory in March 1993 but has already outgrown the premises
and wants another unit alongside.
The county council, in drawing up its structure plan, identifies land supply
as an important factor if Dorset is to be a competitive location for inward
investment. But Mr Roger Woolley, business development partner of Lester
Aldridge, a leading regional law firm, considers that while local
authorities are no longer negative about economic development, they still
lack dynamism.
'We don't have a gut feeling there is the political will to make it happen,'
he says. There would need to be only relatively modest growth to see a
shortage of development land.
Dorset has few large development sites. One with the biggest potential is at
Bournemouth airport, and another is Winfrith, where AEA Technology owns no
fewer than 150 buildings. Its commercial reactor shut down in 1990 but there
are still more than 1,000 people employed on decommissioning, research and
consultancy work. It is keen to sell its services for other uses - for
example, in simulations for the oil industry.
Mr David Kirby, head of property for AEA Technology, is seeking to develop
Winfrith as a technology park, attracting like-minded businesses. Last
month, agreement was reached for Defence Research Agency's Underwater
Systems to move from Portland to Winfrith.
In encouraging inward investors, Mr Len Carslake, the county's economic
development officer, describes the 'stability and quality of the workforce'
as one of the great resources of the county. A double-edged factor is that
wage levels in the county are among the lowest in England. While this may
appeal to some companies, it also means that, as the economy improves, it
may be difficult to keep the best staff.
To counter that is the quality of life, which is Dorset's greatest asset. Mr
Woolley says: 'We recruit a lot of lawyers from London. It is very difficult
to get them to come, but once here, they are almost immediately sold on it.'

FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (1): County at a crossroads -
The recession, coinciding with cutbacks in defence spending, caused a shock
to the system in Dorset
</HEADLINE>

The Tolpuddle martyrs, the six farm labourers from the village near
Dorchester who were sentenced in 1834 to seven years' transportation to
Australia for trying to form a union, were fortunate not to have been
accused of vandalism.
A plaque dating from 1828, now in the Dorchester museum, warns that anyone
'wilfully injuring any part of this county bridge' could be whipped and
transported for life.
Dorset still has its landowning legacy but its image of a rural county,
known for Thomas Hardy, Corfe Castle, seaside resorts and sailing in Poole
harbour, is much less than the full picture.
Agriculture and fishing employ only 2 per cent of the workforce. While
tourism and leisure remain leading industries, employment in banking and
insurance in the south-east Dorset conurbation of Bournemouth, Poole and
Christchurch grew by 82 per cent in the 1980s. The diversified manufacturing
base ranges from high-tech defence contractors to builders of luxury motor
yachts and the breweries of Eldridge Pope and Hall &amp; Woodhouse. Onshore oil
is produced at Wytch Farm by British Petroleum.
During the 1980s, overall employment in the county grew by nearly 16 per
cent. The advantages were obvious: Bournemouth is only 100 miles from
London; Poole and Weymouth ports provide access to the European continent;
the workforce is skilled and stable and the countryside fosters a pleasant
way of life.
In 1990, unemployment was only 3.2 per cent and Dorset's population had
become one of the fastest growing in the UK. Whereas in 1981 the population
was just under 600,000, it is now about 670,000 and projected to reach more
than 730,000 by 2001. Most of the increase is due to migration from
south-east England and, although that includes many retired people, the
working-age population grew in the 1980s by 14 per cent, compared with only
4 per cent for England and Wales.
Dorset in that decade gave the impression of being laisser faire - no one
needed to be persuaded to come. The recession, coinciding with cutbacks in
defence spending, caused a shock to the system.
Mr Rex Symons, chairman of Dorset Training and Enterprise Council, says:
'We've seen in the recession something which never happened before in
Dorset. It affected all sectors - tourism, financial services and
manufacturing - and the change in the defence industry has been profound.'
'We were the soft underbelly,' comments Mrs Beryl Kite, chief executive of
Dorset Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry. 'Had we known it, all the components
were against us. It absolutely socked us - we had no experience of this in
Dorset.'
Dorset is now at a crossroads. In one sense, this is almost literal. It has
fast road and rail links towards Southampton and London, but suffers from
poor connections between the coast and north and to the west. Dorchester, in
the west, remains the county town but the economic heart is the south-east
conurbation, which has 410,000 people within its travel-to-work area. The
county tends to split, therefore, between west and east - with the
conurbation looking more towards the central southern region, rather than
south-west England.
The economy, too, is at a crossroads. There is a cognisance of the
implications of high unemployment - 10.1 per cent in February - combined
with a rising population and the certainty of further defence retrenchment.
Describing the state of the local economy, Mr Peter Harvey, chief executive
of the county council, says: 'I don't think desperate is overstating it. We
are caught two ways - there are more jobs to find but fewer opportunities.'
In response, public and private sector initiatives have been launched to
regenerate the economy. 'It is very encouraging to see the sectors working
together rather than going down parallel tracks,' Mr Harvey says. 'Instead
of bickering, we are all facing in the same direction.'
A county-wide forum, Partners for Prosperity, has been established to
develop a strategy, encourage inward investment and press the county's case
with the UK government and in Europe. Mr Tony Ward, its chief executive,
says: 'There was a realisation that being smug about Dorset was no longer
good enough.' Another forum, South Dorset Economic Partnership, has been set
up to counter the problems caused by the defence rundown in Weymouth and
Portland, where the naval base is to close in 1996.
A further grouping, South Coast Metropole, has been formed by the local
authorities of Bournemouth and Poole with Portsmouth and Southampton, which
together call themselves 'the urban focus of the south coast.' Its purpose
is to promote the region's interests within Europe and to form a
'transmanche region' with the similar Normandie Metropole of Le Havre, Rouen
and Caen.
'There is a complete change in attitude to economic development,' says Mrs
Kite. 'The county is still a bit shell-shocked - but we've picked ourselves
up and dusted ourselves down. We hope the worst is over now. We are leaner
and meaner.'
This month, a one-stop Business Link advice service opens to assist
indigenous growth. Small enterprises are the mainstay in Dorset: only a
handful of quoted companies are headquartered there, such as McCarthy &amp;
Stone, the retirement homes builder, and Bridport-Gundry, the netting group.
Mr Harvey says: 'Dorset is not a county where you have major manufacturers -
we need to facilitate the opportunities to enable the small existing
businesses to expand.'
Some official recognition that Dorset faces difficulties has come with the
designation last year of Weymouth and Poole as an intermediate assisted
area, the winning of European Konver funding - intended to aid areas
suffering from the rundown in defence spending - for south Dorset, and an
expansion this month of the rural development area to include much of the
county. But a setback was that Dorset failed last December to win European
Objective 2 status which would have helped fund infrastructure improvements.
Mr Bryan Cassidy, MEP for Dorset East and Hampshire West, stresses that the
county can re-apply. 'It is a commonly held belief,' he says, 'that an area
like Dorset doesn't qualify for any European funding. Substantial European
funding comes in directly and indirectly, but mainly through collaborative
programmes such as at the AEA at Winfrith.'
In political terms, Dorset is also at a crossroads. Last year, the
Conservatives lost control of the county council, with the Liberal Democrats
becoming the largest party, and suffered a by-election defeat at
Christchurch. The county now faces the expense and upheaval of local
government reorganisation with various options being touted and no consensus
among the county and eight district councils. The county backs an option
under which it would survive in large part as a single unitary authority and
Bournemouth and Poole would form two others. Business opinion, as elsewhere
in England, wants new councils to be big enough to address strategic issues.
Such issues, of course, include road building, a highly contentious matter
in Dorset because of the splendour of its countryside, already under
pressure from housing land demand and industries such as gravel extraction.
South West Regional Planning Conference, in strategy advice to the
Department of the Environment, describes an efficient transport system as
crucial to the county, but the aim must be 'to balance a prosperous local
economy with the protection and enhancement of the environment.' For Dorset,
more than ever, that is a difficult balancing act.

FT  06 APR 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally after two heavy selling
sessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury market rallied yesterday as traders took advantage of yields
pushed to attractive levels by two sessions of heavy selling.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 1/4 ahead
at 87 17/32 , with the yield easing by about 13 basis points to 7.278 per
cent. On the short end, the two-year note was  3/16 better at 99 3/8 , to
yield 5.444 per cent.
The firm opening came on the heels of more stable trading conditions
overnight in Asia and Europe. Volatility overseas has contributed to the
recent weakness in US bonds, as traders have been forced to sell their
holdings in the more liquid US Treasury market to cover their losses
elsewhere.
After two days in which the yield on the long bond climbed nearly 20 basis
points and prices dropped by about 4 points, buyers were finally coaxed back
into the market. But traders said the activity was mostly based on technical
factors and stressed that fear of inflation and concern over the direction
of interest rates would limit the extent of any rebound.
The day's economic news - a 0.1 per cent decline in the Commerce
Department's composite index of leading indicators - elicited little
reaction in the market. The February reading, which is designed to predict
future economic activity, compared with a consensus forecast of a 0.2 per
cent drop and a revised 0.4 per cent increase the previous month.
The rally briefly stalled in mid-afternoon after Mr Thomas Hoening,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, suggested that the
economy was on the 'threshold' of higher inflation. But bonds soon regained
their stride and were hovering just below their session highs near the end
of the day.
European government bond prices were marked down by as much as a point
yesterday morning in response to the decline in the US markets over the long
Easter weekend. However, a combination of light buying and signs that Europe
was finally de-coupling from the US fuelled a respectable recovery in the
afternoon.
Traders said that most of the activity was concentrated in the futures
markets but that volume in the cash markets was relatively thin. Some buying
of call options was also reported.
Analysts said that the start of the second quarter might have encouraged a
change of sentiment among investors. 'There appears to be a feeling that
Europe can and will de-couple from the US,' said Mr Julian Callow, European
economist at Kleinwort Benson.
Mr Ifty Islam, fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, said that the
widening of the yield differential between 10-year German government bunds
and US Treasuries provided some evidence that the de-coupling process was
under way.
The semi-annual yield spread between US Treasuries and bunds went as high as
85 basis points yesterday before stabilising around 76 basis points. This
compared with 59 basis points last Thursday and 15 basis points on March 23,
Mr Islam said.
Hopes that the Bundesbank would today announce a further cut in its repo
rate contributed to the rise in bund prices yesterday. The market expects
the central bank to cut up to three basis points off the rate which
currently stands at 5.76 per cent.
Speculation was also growing that the Bundesbank might cut its discount rate
at its next central council meeting on April 14, traders said.
The June contract of the bund future on Liffe recovered from a low of 95.90
to touch the day's best level of 96.95. In the late afternoon the contract
traded at 96.90, up 0.13 point on the day.
UK gilts failed to end the day in positive territory despite the recovery in
the afternoon. The June contract of the long gilt future on Liffe traded at
107 7/8 in the late afternoon, down  5/16 on the day but off the day's low
of 106 9/16 and close to the day's high of 107 15/16.
Mr Islam said the afternoon recovery had prompted some volatility in the
yield differential between gilts and bunds. The spread fluctuated between
120 and 140 basis points on the day.
News in the late afternoon that Mr Silvio Berlusconi had suspended talks
with his Northern League election allies on forming a government sent
Italian government bond futures into a tailspin.
The June contract of the 10-year Italian government bond future on Liffe
dropped by 0.83 point to 112.01 just minutes after the news flashed across
trading screens.
Before the news broke, the contract had stabilised around 112.70, down 0.14
point from Thursday's close, after a day of volatile trading which had seen
a high of 113 and a low of 111.

The Chicago Board of Trade, best known for its US Treasury bond futures and
options contracts, plans to launch futures and options on 10-year Canadian
government bonds on Friday. The contracts will compete directly with
Canadian bond futures traded at the Bourse de Montreal.
The CBoT said the Canadian bond futures could lead to the launch of other
foreign bond contracts. The Chicago exchange is betting that its large
number of financial futures traders will give its Canadian contracts an edge
over the Montreal version. However, it would be unusual for Chicago to be
successful in winning the Canadian business.

FT  06 APR 94 / International Bonds: Lire deals provide focus for investor
interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The high-yielding European currency sectors provided the main talking point
in the international bond market yesterday, sporting a handful of new issues
in Greek drachma and Italian lire.
However, in general, the volatile bond market background continued to deter
many borrowers and investors, and syndicate officials predict that new issue
activity is likely to remain subdued for a while.
Following the outcome of the Italian general election last month, syndicate
officials claim there is 'some retail interest' in the lira sector, although
many of them believe that yesterday's two lira deals were driven mainly by
favourable swap opportunities rather than strong investor demand for
Eurolira paper.
The International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World
Bank, launched a L150bn, 10-year deal with a coupon of 8.625 per cent. BNL,
the lead manager, said investors were attracted by the borrower's triple-A
credit rating and the relatively high coupon, as the yield at net fees was
8.79 per cent.
Syndicate officials said market conditions were tricky yesterday, with many
of the European government bond markets opening lower after the Bank Holiday
weekend in response to the sharp decline in the US. But BNL said it expected
to see further new issues in the Eurolira sector given the favourable
arbitrage opportunities.
GECC reopened its existing five-year Eurolira deal with a 7.375 per cent
coupon, adding a further L100bn to the existing L250bn issue which was
launched at the beginning of January.
The IFC also tapped the Greek drachma sector with the third Eurobond issue
to be denominated in this high-yielding currency. The Dr10bn, five-year bond
issue has a coupon of 15.25 per cent and was aimed primarily at retail
investors who are hungry for high-coupon bonds. The bonds were launched at a
price of 100.875 and traded up to 101.50-102.00 by late afternoon. So far,
the EIB and the World Bank have issued bonds in the Greek currency, and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is rumoured to be
considering tapping this sector.
Tele 2000, a Peruvian cellular telephone and cable TV company, launched the
first Euroconvertible bond for a Peruvian name, with a Dollars 40m,
three-year issue. The bonds will be convertible into ADRs according to
Bankers Trust, the lead manager.

during the first quarter of this year, weighed down by fears of rising
inflation and diminishing prospects for an early cut in base rates.
According to data supplied by J. P. Morgan Securities, UK government bonds
(gilts) showed a negative return of 6.68 per cent in local currency terms
from January to March, far outpacing a loss of 2.74 per cent in the European
index and a loss of 2.86 per cent in the global index.
Last month alone, gilts fell by 3.2 per cent, the second-worst performance
after Canadian government bonds which lost 4.65 per cent. Most government
bond markets fell for the second month in March as a result of the rise in
US interest rates and the liquidation of long positions by highly-leveraged
international investors.
Politics helped to push the Italian government bond market to the top of the
local currency performance tables with a return of 1.52 per cent in March
and a negative return of just 0.12 per cent over the first quarter.
The election victory of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing alliance bolstered
both the lira and the local bond market.

FT  06 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: News Corp softens preference
position
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Pressure from the International Securities Market Association (Isma), the
Eurobond market's trade association, appears to have forced News Corporation
to soften its stance in a complicated dispute with holders of its preference
shares.
Isma said in a statement that 'we understand from Messrs Allen &amp; Overy,
London, that anybody who has suffered loss by reason of the notices inserted
in the financial press in December 1993 relative to the dividend declared by
Pearson of shares in Royal Doulton should write to Allen &amp; Overy, 9
Cheapside, London EC2V 6AD (for the attention of J. Horsfall Turner)
specifying the nature of the loss sustained and the basis of the claim, at
which point it will be possible for News Corporation to consider the claim
in detail'.
The statement added that 'News Corporation . . . takes the matter seriously
and responsibly and that any claims made will be given full consideration by
News Corporation Limited'. News Corp declined to comment.
The notices published by News Corp in December said holders of its
preference shares, exchangeable for shares which News Corp held in Pearson,
would also get Royal Doulton shares when exercising their exchange right.
However, News Corp, the media, film and publishing group, issued another
notice in February which said they were not entitled to around Pounds 15m
(Dollars 21.9m) worth of shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china
manufacturer demerged last year from Pearson. News Corp's about-turn
prompted Isma to state publicly at the end of February that it was
investigating the matter.

share offering

<TEXT>
Thai Telephone and Telecommunication (TT&amp;T), the consortium installing 1m
telephone lines in the provinces of Thailand, this week becomes the latest
Thai telecommunications company to go public with the offer of 10 per cent
of its enlarged share capital to the public.
The offer of 50m shares at Bt145 each should raise Bt7.25bn (Dollars 285m),
and value the company at the equivalent of nearly Dollars 3bn when trading
begins next month. 40 per cent of the new shares has been set aside for
foreign investors and the rest reserved for Thais. Phatra Thanakit is lead
manager for the issue, and a total of 62 finance and securities companies
are listed as underwriters.
Investor interest in the Thai telecommunications sector remains intense as
the private sector rapidly makes up the shortage of lines left in recent
years by the military-controlled duopoly of the Telephone Organisation of
Thailand (Tot) and the Communications Authority of Thailand.
Following the recent listing of several companies, including TelecomAsia,
which has the contract to install 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok, the
communications sector now accounts for 16 per cent of the capitalisation of
the Stock Exchange of Thailand.
TT&amp;T, in which Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and the Thai companies
Loxley and Jasmine International each have a stake of about 20 per cent, won
the provincial telephone concession after a previous Thai government reduced
the number of lines allocated to TelecomAsia and reopened bidding for
provincial lines. Jasmine, which has other communications interests, is
expected to be listed in the next few months.
Under the terms of its contract, TT&amp;T gives 43 per cent of the revenue from
the new lines to the Tot, compared with the 16 per cent handed over by
TelecomAsia, but stockbrokers say provincial lines provide more revenue
because more calls are long distance rather than local.
TT&amp;T forecasts that its net profit will be Bt39m this year, rising to
Bt1.36bn in 1995, Bt2.6bn in 1996 - by which time 760,000 new lines should
have been installed - and Bt5bn in 1998.

FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Foreign companies protest at
Indian plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government is planning to clamp down on foreign companies buying
shares in their stock exchange-listed Indian subsidiaries at a fraction of
market prices.
The proposals have prompted protests from some multinational companies and
foreign-linked chambers of commerce which have accused the government of
acting unfairly and of reversing an important part of its economic reforms.
The foreign companies are lobbying hard to persuade officials to change
their minds before they announce new rules during the next month or so.
The dispute dates back to last year, when, prompted by the government's
liberalisation programme, multinationals started increasing their stakes in
their Indian affiliates. Typically, they increased their holdings from the
pre-reform maximum of 40 per cent to 51 per cent to secure control. Making
use of measures designed to encourage foreign investment, the multinationals
bought the shares at discounts of up to 90 per cent of market prices.
These purchases brought protests from Indian business families which said
foreign companies were taking unfair advantage of liberalisation measures.
Foreign companies were able to do so because rules introduced in 1992
abolished the government's long-standing powers to control stock market
issue prices and opened the door to free market pricing. The measure was a
central element of the dismantling of the 'licence raj', the panoply of
controls in pre-reform India.
Under the new regime, companies were free to allot shares on preferential
terms to any shareholder - as long as they secured approval from at least 75
per cent of shareholders. Shareholders were happy to grant such approvals to
multinationals because they judged a multinational which increased its stake
would also probably bring other changes to the affiliate such as new
managers or new technology - so benefiting all shareholders.
Indian state-owned financial institutions, which hold the bulk of Indian
shares, set rules for minimum pricing, including a minimum price/earnings
ratio of 15. However, because profits in the years 1991 and 1992 were
depressed by recession in Indian industry, the formula allowed companies to
issue shares to their foreign parents very cheaply. Colgate Palmolive, the
US toiletries group, bought stock in its affiliate at a 90 per cent
discount; Burmah, the UK oil group, secured an 89 per cent discount on
shares in Castrol India. Several Indian business families jumped on the
bandwagon - persuading their companies to issue shares to founding families
at cheap prices.
Last December, the institutions set an additional rule, fixing the minimum
price as the average price for the previous six months. Foreign companies
did not like this change - but did not object since the institutions were
exercising their rights as shareholders - as they might in the US or the UK.
However, the institutions' decision did not apply to every listed company
because they do not always have majority shareholdings - some important
foreign-related companies have small institutional holdings and large
numbers of individual shareholders. So officials at the finance ministry
started considering ways of clamping down on all preferential issues.
They have decided on a plan to amend the Companies Act to outlaw
preferential issues to small groups of shareholders, in line with US
regulations. This change would affect Indian and foreign groups, but will
take some time to carry out because it requires amending legislation.
As a stop-gap measure the ministry is considering using foreign exchange
regulations to impose on foreign buyers the same six-month average minimum
price formula adopted by the institutions. The rule would be administered by
the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, which has powers to approve
substantial stock market investments by foreigners. Officials are likely to
decide whether to adopt the stop-gap rule in the next week or so.

bad loans

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese banks unloaded bad loans worth Y2,654bn (Dollars 26bn) to the
Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), the bad loan purchasing
organisation, during the six months to March.
This is 2.2 times more than the previous half-year, reflecting a rush by
banks to remove non-operating loans from their books. As a result, the CCPC
bought non-operating loans with the face value totalling Y4,520bn in the
year to March.
The debt purchasing vehicle is made up of a consortium of banks, and buys
bad loans backed by real estate collateral at a discount. A bank wishing to
sell its loan to the CCPC needs to supply it with a loan to fund the
purchase.
After buying the bad debt, the purchasing company tries to recover the loan
through sales of real estate collateral. However, such efforts have so far
been hampered by the slump in the Japanese property market. Of the loans,
the CCPC has managed to recover only Y30bn.
The purchasing company posted a pre-tax loss of Y11m for its first fiscal
year to last December due to its inability to absorb establishment costs of
more than Y50m. While net operating profits totalled Y44m, net operating
losses were Y13m.

FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Australia Air splutters on the
runway - A look at the international airline's struggle to launch a service
to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will Australia Air International, the fledgling carrier which a year ago won
the rights to fly between Australia and China, ever take to the skies?
As Australia's first - and only - start-up company to be given an entree
into the international aviation market, its progress is being monitored
closely by the business community and politicians alike.
It is now over two years ago since Mr Bob Collins, then federal minister for
transport, heralded a 'new era' in Australian aviation, committing his
country to a competitive, deregulated system on both domestic and
international fronts. The domestic experience was quickly soured by the
failure of Compass, the only entrant to attempt a new nationwide operation.
It went out of business in March 1993, leaving Ansett and Qantas (which
acquired Australian Airlines) with a duopoly.
But now the focus has switched to the international arena. Here, the
liberalised regime envisaged that a newly-formed International Air Services
Commission (IASC) would distribute future international aviation rights
among existing and new operators, effectively ending Qantas' long-standing
monopoly on non-domestic services.
It was as a result of this process that Australia Air, which occupies
offices in a Sydney suburb and is owned by Mr Colin Hendrick, a local
businessman, picked up the China rights in March 1993. Its initial plans
sounded encouraging - a weekly China service, linking Beijing and Sydney, to
begin last autumn. But Australia Air is still spluttering on the runway.
In theory, the China rights are attractive. There is only one carrier, Air
China, which flies directly between the two countries. Yet, according to
Australia Air, some 75,000 Australian tourists visited China last year and
business links between the two countries are expanding rapidly. Direct
flights, rather ones which involve a stopover in Hong Kong, ought to find a
market.
Australia Air claims that the first hiccup came when it discovered that
Qantas was still the 'designated' carrier under the Sino-Australian air
services agreement. The larger airline flew the route in the mid-1980s but
had pulled out of the market in 1987. A spat then developed over how many
designated carriers could exist on the Australia-China route, which was only
sorted out in November. 'Obviously, it took longer than anyone had
anticipated,' admits the IASC.
Hiccup number two was, and to a large extent still is, money. In its initial
application, Australia Air envisaged backing of around ADollars 55m
(USDollars 27m). However, attempts to raise this sum outside Australia - and
to interest US investment banks - have failed. Belatedly, the would-be
carrier has considered the possibility of a stock market flotation, and
called in County NatWest and Turnbull &amp; Partners as advisers.
The viability of this plan has yet to be tested. In recent releases,
Australia Air has given the impression that the float is already
underwritten. However, County says that while there are some conditional
arrangements in place, it would not enter a formal underwriting agreement
until it had a fair idea of the likely sub-underwriting commitments. It is
still testing the waters.
In the meantime, the IASC is demanding to see the colour of Australia Air's
money before it will let the carrier take off. An attempt to persuade the
IASC to allow the airline to start operating on the back of underwriters'
commitments failed. Instead, the IASC stipulated that Australia Air should
have at least ADollars 28.87m in the bank, and the remainder of the ADollars
55m potentially available through calls on partly-paid shares. This has
prompted Australia Air to plead for more time, and the IASC has
provisionally approved a three-month extension, meaning that the float must
be completed by end-June.
In the meantime, the operational side seems to be more straightforward,
although the initial arrangements depend heavily on sub-contractors.
Australia Air says that it would lease a Boeing 747, complete with crew,
from New York-based Tower Air, with Cathay Pacific responsible for catering
and Qantas for ground-handling, aircraft maintainance and staff training.
Many observers think that Qantas is embarrassed by the loss of the rights,
and is scurrying to reclaim some ground through such deals. It opposed the
recent IASC extension, offering to pick up the rights if Australia Air
failed to meet the end-March deadline.
In justification of the IASC's role to date, officials point out that it has
managed to push some significant international rights in Ansett's direction,
especially in the Asian region.
But the domestic duopoly situation seems all too likely to rule in the
international arena as well. And that does not quite equate to the
competitive situation everyone hoped for.

Indonesian cement maker
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa, Indonesia's largest cement producer, and its
subsidiaries reported net income of Rp312.38bn (Dollars 145m) for 1993, 4.6
per cent down on the previous year's Rp327.39bn, writes Our Financial Staff.
Net revenues of Rp2,900bn were 32 per cent higher than the Rp2,200bn a year
earlier.
The net income fell short of several analysts' expectations of about
Rp340bn, in part due to debt repayment.
In 1992 Indocement, which is owned by the Liem Sioe Liong group and the
Indonesian government, acquired noodle maker Indofood, the Bogasari flour
mill, and Wisma Indocement, for a total of about Rp1,700bn rupiah.
That significantly increased the cost of interest charges for Indocement for
the full year 1993, up 45 per cent to Rp274.29bn, from Rp189.51bn the year
earlier.
As Indonesia's largest cement producer, Indocement produces about 9.8m tons
annually and controls about 50 per cent of the domestic cement market.

Cummins, the world's leading manufacturer of diesel engines, yesterday
issued an optimistic assessment of its first-quarter performance. The
announcement helped send its share price sharply higher on Wall Street.
The Indiana-based company said earnings in the three months to the end of
March would 'meet or perhaps exceed' its results in the fourth quarter. On
an operating basis, Cummins generated a profit of Dollars 52.6m, or Dollars
1.42 a share, in the final reporting period of 1993.
The estimate conformed with the forecasts of most analysts. Mr Gary McManus,
who follows the company for Kemper Securities in Chicago, projected
operating earnings of Dollars 1.60 a share, based on sustained demand for
heavy-truck engines and accelerating growth in the mid-range market.
The stock jumped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 51 3/4 in heavy trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. The gain came amid a broad advance by capital-goods
stocks, including Caterpillar, one of Cummins' main rivals.

planned to set up multimedia networks

<TEXT>
Canada's local telephone companies plan to invest CDollars 8bn (USDollars
6bn) over the next decade to equip the national phone network for multimedia
services.
The nine companies yesterday outlined plans to pool their resources through
Stentor, an existing research and marketing consortium.
The centrepiece of the investments will be an upgrade of local telephone
networks to provide broad band capability to between 80 per cent and 90 per
cent of all Canadian businesses and homes within the next 10 years.
The telephone companies are in a race with cable TV operators to establish a
dominant position. Rogers Communications, the biggest cable operator, has
emerged as the phone companies' chief rival. Rogers is broadening its
interests through its takeover of Maclean Hunter, the publishing and cable
TV group. Rogers already has a stake in Unitel, which two years ago set up a
long-distance network in competition with Stentor.
Stentor also announced plans to create a new company to supply multimedia
services and co-ordinate the distribution of multimedia controllers and
software. Outsiders will be invited to invest in this company, presently
named MMI.
The company will attempt to marry access devices, such as personal computers
and TV controllers, with the broad band communications network. Its services
will be distributed through the Stentor phone companies and other
'value-added' resellers.
In addition, a venture capital fund will be set up to help companies develop
multimedia applications and products. The fund is expected to total about
CDollars 50m, with 10 per cent contributed by the phone companies and the
remainder by institutional investors and other outsiders.

At the year end, the Caisse held 48.2 per cent of its assets in bonds and
38.1 per cent in shares, including 26.1 per cent in Canadian stocks. It is
Canada's biggest equity investor.
Caisse holds CDollars 16bn of Quebec's public pension plan assets, CDollars
15.9bn of provincial civil servants' pension assets, and also manages the
portfolios of the Quebec car insurance board, workmen's compensation and
construction industry board. Some of the latter organisations require a

Mr Frank Lorenzo's ATX Corp said it would appeal against a US Transportation
Department decision denying it a certificate of fitness to operate an
airline, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Lorenzo blamed trade union influence for the rejection.
The department, in its rejection of ATX's bid to start up a short-haul,
low-fare East Coast airline, cited Mr Lorenzo's record of safety and
regulatory compliance problems.
His application was fought by airline unions, who charged him with driving
two of his former carriers, Eastern Air Lines and Continental Airlines, into
bankruptcy.
Mr Steve Kolski, ATX president, said that 'the decision to turn down ATX was
made by the department as a political pay-off to organised labour with total
disregard for the law, consumers' interests, or the rights of private
investors to start their own business'.
Mr Randolph Babbitt, Air Line Pilots Association president, said that
'justice has been done, and the public interest has been protected'.

FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Novell appoints Frankenberg as
president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Novell, the leading US computer networking software company, has appointed
Mr Robert Frankenberg, a senior Hewlett-Packard executive, as president and
chief executive to succeed Mr Raymond Noorda, who is retiring.
The appointment puts to rest concerns about management succession at Novell.
Mr Noorda, 69, had said last year that he planned to hand over the reins to
a new chief executive, but seemed in no hurry.
The issue became more pressing last month when Novell announced aggressive
expansion plans with the acquisition of WordPerfect, a leading word
processing software company, and Borland International's spread sheet
product division.
The acquisitions will take Novell into the applications software market and
place it head to head with Microsoft, the world's largest software company.
Mr Frankenberg, 46, who has spent his 25-year career at Hewlett-Packard,
most recently heading the company's personal computer group, is seen as a
solid choice to lead Novell. His broad experience in software, information
systems and personal computing makes him well suited to the task, analysts
said.
'I have worked very closely with Novell over the past four or five years, at
HP,' said Mr Frankenberg. 'I am very excited about the merger with
WordPerfect. It was pivotal in my decision to join Novell, because it gives
us the opportunity to create a new era of network applications and make
those the natural way to use computing.'
Mr Noorda, who has shaped Novell into one of the largest and most
influential companies in the software industry over the past 12 years, said
that he will remain chairman of the company and continue to play an active
role. Mr Noorda said, however, that he has no regrets over handing over
day-to-day management of the company.
With the appointment of Mr Frankenberg, Novell has dissolved its 'office of
the president'. The company's senior executives will now report to the new
chief executive.
Novell's share price rose yesterday, on rumours of Mr Frankenberg's
appointment, to close at Dollars 18 1/2, up from Monday's close of Dollars
16 7/8.

FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Sao Paulo cashes in on
privatisation hopes - Brazil's industrial heart needs to fund an 8% budget
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial powerhouse, is rushing to raise funds on
local and international capital markets. The move has been sparked by the
drying-up of traditional state revenues combined with election-fuelled
spending plans.
Without giving up control of public companies, the state government is
selling equity stakes and cashing in on international interest in sectors
regarded as privatisation candidates, such as electricity and
telecommunications. The money is for current spending and infrastructure
projects.
The projects include roads, an extension of the city's tube line, which is
also receiving World Bank and Interamerican Development Bank money, and
100,000 new homes.
Traditionally, state spending increases in election years and, according to
bankers and analysts, Sao Paulo's money raising is aimed at keeping the
centrist Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) in power at elections in October.
The state government denies this, arguing it is coincidence that most of the
offerings are this year.
Since last November the state, facing a deficit of 8 per cent on its Dollars
18bn budget, has raised Dollars 515m from equity sales, including Dollars
300m from a private placement of non-voting American depositary receipts
(ADRs) in its electricity generator Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo (Cesp)
in February. Locally, sales of equity in Cesp and its distribution
subsidiary have raised Dollars 215m.
The government expects another four debt or equity issues in other companies
to raise about Dollars 700m. These include a planned equity-linked Eurobond
issue offering a stake in Telesp, the state telecom company, similar to that
made in January by the state of Minas Gerais, which offered equity warrants
in its electricity company Cemig. The other issues are of debenture and
shares in the state sanitation company, an initial public offering in its
gas company and debentures in the state bank's leasing firm.
Mr Eduardo Saad, managing director in Sao Paulo of Merrill Lynch and
co-ordinator for the ADR placement, believes more states will attempt
similar operations. However, international issues will be limited because
only a handful of states have large enough companies to interest foreign
investors.
Furthermore, equity-linked bond issues are complex and overseas investors
suspicious about taking on state debt, according to Mr Saad. 'A lot of
states have financial problems with the federal government. They would
probably not pass the test of the bond market,' he says.
The financial problems date from Brazil's economic crisis in the 1980s, when
many states ran up huge debts and used state banks to bail them out. The
crisis has worsened in recent years and last year governors were told they
could no longer borrow from their state banks.
Sao Paulo has also been hit by shrinking sales tax revenues, traditionally
its main revenue source, following a 'tax war' between states to attract
industry. The state's total debt is about Dollars 22bn.
Despite these problems, it remains the industrial heartland of Brazil,
accounting for more than half the country's industrial production and with a
gross domestic product of Dollars 189bn in 1992.
Mr Eduardo Maia, state finance secretary, says the equity offerings are part
of a new philosophy. 'We are preparing the ground for the privatisation of
the electricity industry and other sectors, and for a new, slimmer state
that will target spending on social programmes.'
He believes the proposed Eurobond issue, for Dollars 200m- Dollars 300m,
will succeed because it will be sweetened by options to buy stock in Telesp,
the largest subsidiary of the government- controlled telecommunications
giant Telebras.
However, Mr Alvaro Simoes, a director of Banque Indosuez's Brazilian
operations, which led the Minas Gerais-Cemig issue, believes the Sao
Paulo-Telesp operation will take at least six months to put together.
Although the Minas Gerais issue was regarded as sovereign risk, most foreign
investors were confused about the relationship between the state and the
federal government and concerned about financial health of the state, says
Mr Simoes. He adds that investors were reassured by the competence of state
officials and that the Minas Gerais budget has balanced for the past three
years.
But investor caution and market conditions, along with a recent move by the
central bank to slow down Eurobond issues, may pose difficulties for the Sao
Paulo issue. Some bankers believe Sao Paulo will find it harder to win over
foreign investors due to its financial problems.
A former adviser to the state bank says: 'Although Telesp is an attractive
company, Sao Paulo will probably face more problems than Minas Gerais
because of its financial image.'

IBM is to sell its fledgling investment management business to Fleet
Financial in a deal which could bring the Rhodes Island-based banking group
around Dollars 1bn in assets.
IBM Credit, the computer company's financing arm, began a mutual funds
busi-ness in 1990 and currently manages Dollars 642m held in 68,000
accounts.
It also handles Dollars 349m in 34,000 money market accounts.
The sale, expected to be completed by the end of June, continues the move by
US banks into the retail investment management business. Fleet already
manages some Dollars 4bn in a range of mutual funds.
Fleet will take over the management and admin-istration of the mutual funds,
and will offer money market account holders similar Fleet products.

Quebec's Caisse de Depot, Canada's biggest pension fund with assets of
CDollars 47bn (USDollars 33bn), earned a rate of return of 19.7 per cent in
1993, well up on 1992's 4.5 per cent. The 10-year average return is 11.9 per
cent.
At the year end, the Caisse held 48.2 per cent of its assets in bonds and
38.1 per cent in shares, including 26.1 per cent in Canadian stocks. It is
Canada's biggest equity investor.
Mr Jean-Claude Delorme, president, said the 1993 performance was below
average for North American pension funds, but the Caisse holds a larger
proportion of bonds.
It holds CDollars 16bn of Quebec's public pension plan assets, CDollars
15.9bn of provincial civil servants' pension assets, and also manages the
portfolios of the Quebec car insurance board, workmen's compensation and
construction industry board. Some of the latter organisations require a
large percentage of fixed interest investments.
The Canadian portfolio yielded 26.2 per cent last year, against a gain of
32.6 per cent in the Toronto 300 stock index. The Caisse had large exposure
to Northern Telecom and Laidlaw, two Canadian stocks which fell sharply in
1993. The bond portfolio yielded 18.4 per cent, in line with other pension
funds.
The Caisse says it plans to become more vociferous in the management of the
350 companies in which it holds investments. It is already represented in
the boardrooms of some Quebec companies.
Univa, Canada's second-biggest food distributor in which the Caisse is the
biggest shareholder, lost CDollars 108.2m, or CDollars 1.33 a share, in the
year ended January 31, against profit of CDollars 32.5m, or 30 cents, a year
earlier, on sales of CDollars 6.2bn, against CDollars 6.7bn. The latest
period includes restructuring charges of CDollars 167m.

FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Nippon Life lifts Lehman stake
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nippon Life, the Japanese insurer, is to lift its stake in Lehman Brothers
to 12.2 per cent in a deal which values the US investment bank at Dollars
2.7bn.
News of the extra investment by the insurer came in a registration statement
filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the planned
spin-off of Lehman from its parent, American Express.
Under the plan, announced in January, American Express will inject extra
capital as part of a Dollars 1.25bn recapitalisation of Lehman to strengthen
its balance sheet and distribute shares in the bank to its own shareholders.
Yesterday, it emerged that Nippon has chosen to exercise an option to buy an
additional 3.5m shares in Lehman for Dollars 89.2m, lifting its stake to
12.2 per cent from 9 per cent on a fully diluted basis.
The insurer first bought a 13 per cent stake in Shearson Lehman Hutton,
Lehman Brothers' predecessor, at the height of the 1980s bull market, and
has since had the right to lift its stake back to that level.
The investment will cement Nippon's position as Lehman's biggest
shareholder, with two seats on the company's restructured nine-strong board.
By implication it also puts a value of about Dollars 25.50 on Lehman's
shares and valued the whole company at Dollars 2.7bn, slightly more than
book value.
This is below the Dollars 3.5bn level talked of by American Express
executives at the end of January. However, since then the turmoil in the
financial markets has hit the share prices of other investment banks.
Lehman's profit record has been held back by a higher cost base than its
main US competitors.
The bank has been working to bring its costs into line with rivals, and is
to take a Dollars 30m pre-tax charge against first-quarter earnings to cover
cuts in staffing.

FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: French retailer's profits fall
14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pressures on the French retail sector last year took a toll on
Pinault-Printemps' performance with a 15 per cent reduction in net profits
to FFr511m (Dollars 86.6m) in 1993 from FFr586m in 1992.
However, Pinault-Printemps, which has expanded rapidly by acquisition from a
family-owned timber business into one of France's largest retail groups,
made progress in its debt-reduction programme. The group succeeded by
selling assets - including Prime Equipment, CICA and Discol - to cut its net
debt by more than FFr6bn to FFr12.1bn by the end of the year.
The assets sales triggered a reduction in turnover which fell by 11 per cent
to FFr63.3bn last year from FFr70.2bn in 1992.
Operating profits fell 20 per cent to FFr2.31bn from FFr2.79bn. Continuing
businesses did incur falls in both turnover and operating profits but at a
lower level.
Pinault-Printemps also announced that the board had endorsed its proposal to
take full control of La Redoute, the mail order group. The takeover will be
put to Pinault-Printemps' shareholders next month at an extraordinary
meeting.

FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: IBM to create new role for
mainframe computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines yesterday announced products that it claims
will 'fundamentally change the nature of large-scale computing'. The
announcement came almost 30 years to the day after the group launched its
first mainframe computers.
IBM's sales of its flagship mainframes dropped sharply over the past few
years as many commercial computing tasks switched from centralised
mainframes to distributed networks of lower cost personal computers and
servers.
Aiming to create a new role for mainframe computers in the era of networked
'client-server' computing, IBM announced two new classes of computers, based
on microprocessor technology similar to that used in PCs and workstations.
Faster, smaller and cheaper, the new systems bring the low-cost
semiconductor chips used in PCs and workstations into the mainframe arena.
The products are System/390 parallel servers, based on a new microprocessor
version of IBM's traditional mainframe computer 'engine', and POWERparallel
systems, based on the reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology
that IBM also plans to use in a new generation of PCs.
'These systems deliver what customers tell me they want: lower cost, more
power and protection of their existing trillion dollar investment in
software,' said Mr Nicholas Donofrio, senior vice-president.
The S/390 parallel servers, one designed for transaction processing
applications, such as credit card processing, and the other for database
query applications, such as customer support, will both run on software
written for traditional IBM mainframe computers.
IBM announced a 'coupling facility' that links these 'new world' systems to
'old world' mainframes automatically balancing the computing workload across
all systems.
The new server technology gives IBM 'at least a year's jump on the rest of
the field', said Mr Bob Djurdjevic of Annex Research, an analysis group.

FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais in alliance move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled French bank, hopes to expand its insurance
interests by forging a strategic alliance with Assurances Generales de
France (AGF), the insurance group, according to Mr Jean Peyrelevade, the
bank's chairman.
Mr Peyrelevade, who last autumn was brought into Credit Lyonnais by the
government to rescue the ailing bank, said he had discussed the possibility
of an alliance with Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, AGF chairman.
'It's obvious to me that we need a long-term partner in insurance,' he said.
'The question is whether AGF wants to be that partner. I've had a very
friendly conversation with Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani who asked me,
perfectly reasonably, for time to think it over.'
AGF yesterday confirmed that Mr Jeancourt-Galignani was considering the
feasibility of an alliance with Credit Lyonnais. However, it stressed this
was only one of a number of strategic options under consideration. Societe
Generale, another leading French bank, has indicated interest in forging
closer links with AGF.
The overtures from Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale, both of which have
small cross-shareholdings in AGF, form part of the trend for France's big
banks to reduce their reliance on the intensely competitive banking market
by diversifying into related fields, notably insurance.
Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), another big bank, used its recent
privatisation as an opportunity to clarify its strategic links and
cross-shareholding with Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's
largest insurer which is due to be privatised this spring.
Mr Peyrelevade, who recently sold Credit Lyonnais's 30 per cent holding in
the Union des Assureurs Federales insurance group as part of his FFr35bn
(Dollars 5.9bn) asset sale programme, said he did not envisage an eventual
partnership between Credit Lyonnais and AGF adopting the same structure as
that of BNP and UAP. However he said it would be 'in the same spirit'.

FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Bank takes long march to profit
 -Credit Lyonnais is in a critical condition but Jean Peyrelevade, chairman,
does not seem to be going out of his way to find what he needs most -
friends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man who appears to need all the friends he can get, Mr Jean
Peyrelevade, chairman of Credit Lyonnais, the stricken French bank, does not
seem to be going out of his way to find them.
When his fellow bankers last week complained about the government's decision
to participate in Credit Lyonnais's FFr44.9bn (Dollars 7.6bn) rescue
package, Mr Peyrelevade responded by resigning from the French Banking
Association. 'I didn't think it was very fraternal,' he said. 'I'd expect
people to show some sympathy in a situation like this - and they didn't'
It is typical of Mr Peyrelevade, 54, to have turned his back on the banking
establishment while tackling the biggest challenge of his career. He was a
senior socialist adviser who became one of France's most influential
financiers in the 1980s as chairman of the Suez holding company and then
Union des Assurances de Paris insurance group before being drafted into
Credit Lyonnais last November by the centre-right Balladur government.
Credit Lyonnais is in a critical condition having last month reported a
FFr6.9bn net loss for 1993. The result would have been even worse without
the rescue whereby the government is removing FFr40bn of bad debt from its
balance sheet. Mr Peyrelevade's task is to bring it back into profit against
the backdrop of Swiss and US legal suits over past investments and an
inquiry into the conduct of his predecessor, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer.
'I thought long and hard before taking this job,' he said. 'It's a huge
challenge and that's why I accepted. It's a job that can be done. But there
are some issues outside our control such as the political impact of the
inquiry.'
Yet Mr Peyrelevade is convinced that, in the short term, the rescue should
be sufficient to stabilise Credit Lyonnais. He dismisses the risk of
opposition from the European Commission (which has objected to a similar aid
package for Bull computers) claiming that under French banking law the
government, as majority shareholder, was obliged to rescue Credit Lyonnais.
The government has notified Brussels about the rescue and is awaiting its
response. In the meantime, Mr Peyrelevade must continue with Credit
Lyonnais's restructuring. One priority is to raise capital by selling part
of its FFr55bn portfolio of industrial investments. He plans by the end of
next year to have raised FFr20bn from these disposals and will then continue
with up to FFr15bn of additional sales.
Perhaps the most intersting disposal will be that of MGM, the ailing
Hollywood studio that Credit Lyonnais inherited from an ill-fated 1980s
takeover bid. The bank has since sunk Dollars 2bn into MGM but must, under
US banking regulations, sell it by mid-1997. It is gambling that the
loss-making studio can be turned round in time for the sale. 'Every week
someone offers to buy MGM,' said Mr Peyrelevade. 'I always say no. The new
management team is doing a good job and the offers will still be around in
1997 when, I hope, we'll get a good price.'
One area of Credit Lyonnais that is not for sale is the group of European
retail banks acquired by Mr Haberer in the late 1980s. These banks have
performed fairly well but Credit Lyonnais's management has been too
distracted by its financial problems to fulfil Mr Haberer's ambition of
merging them into the first pan-European retail banking network.
Mr Haberer's critics claimed that the European banking market was too
fragmented to accommodate such a network. Mr Peyrelevade disagrees. He plans
gradually to merge the banks by imposing standard management controls across
all the banks, harmonising their marketing strategies for individual clients
and developing cross-border products for corporate customers.
'It's a gamble,' he said. 'But every day Europe moves closer towards
adopting a common currency. There are more exporters, more importers and
more companies that need an easy way of transferring funds from country to
country. Perhaps I'm wrong, but I think it will work.'
Back in France the imperative is to make Credit Lyonnais's large domestic
network more efficient by cutting costs and improving client service. Mr
Peyrelevade has already announced plans to shed 10 per cent of its
38,449-strong workforce over the next three years as part of an initiative
to reduce the proportion of income absorbed by operating costs (now higher
than its competitors at 75 per cent) by 1 per cent a year.
He hopes to swallow some of the job losses through part-time working and has
diplomatically asked his 20-strong board to accept 10 per cent salary cuts.
But Mr Peyrelevade may face a tough task in selling the rationalisation
package to the unions, which recently went on strike over less radical
cost-cutting proposals.
The rationalisation plan will be critical to his chances of restoring Credit
Lyonnais to profit. The consensus among analysts is that it should be back
in the black in 1995 and can then think about privatisation.
'My sole concern is making Credit Lyonnais profitable,' said Mr Peyrelevade.
'It's only then that we'll be able to think about privatisation. Do I want
to take it into the private sector? Of course. I missed out on it at Suez
(privatised after he left) and now at UAP (scheduled for sale this spring).
I don't want it to happen again.'

<TEXT>
GN Great Nordic, the Danish telecommunications group, increased net profits
last year to DKr148.2bn (Dollars 22.1bn) from DKr31.4m in 1992. Turnover was
ahead to DKr1.62bn from DKr1.33bn and profits before items and tax rose to
DKr161.1m from DKr112.7m.
The group announced a one-for-six share issue and plans to raise about
DKr300m through a convertible bond issue. An unchanged 12 per cent dividend
will be paid.
The improvement in sales and earnings last year was attributed to systems
coming into operation and an improvement in primary operating profits in the
group's manufacturing companies to DKr111m from DKr37m in 1992.
New telecommunications systems include the Copenhagen-St Petersburg optical
fibre cable link, with links to Moscow, which was opened in April last year.
Denmark's second cellular phone system, Sonofon, which competes with Tele
Danmark's Nordic Mobile Phone system, has exceeded expectations and
established a satisfactory level of operations, GN said.
The group expects operating profits in 1994 to remain at the 1993 level,
although profits before financial items will grow. New systems coming into
operation this year include a north-south optical link through Poland and a
system in Lithuania.

<TEXT>
Expanding sales in the Asia Pacific market helped Barco, the Belgian
electronics group, push profits 22.7 per cent higher last year, writes
Gillian Tett in Brussels.
Profits after tax for 1993 were BFr1.1bn (Dollars 30.5m), up from BFr900m
the year before, and BFr600m in 1991. Total turnover rose by 4.1 per cent to
BFr10.5bn, up from BFr10.1bn in 1992.
Turnover in Asia Pacific rose by 21 per cent partly due to a 44 per cent
growth in the sales of data and graphics projectors, which form a core part
of Barco's business.
However, conditions elsewhere had been harder, the group said, with an 11
per cent growth in turnover in the US market and 4 per cent fall in Europe.
Although the climate for investment remained weak in Europe, prospects in
Asia and South and North America were 'exceptionally' encouraging, the
company said. It added that it expected to record a similar level of growth
next year.

growth

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Aegon, the second-largest insurance company in the Netherlands, posted a
10.5 per cent increase in net profit in 1993, and predicted an improvement
in operating profit for 1994, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
Net profit rose to slightly more than Fl 1.0bn (Dollars 526m) from Fl 909.0m
in 1992, on turnover up nearly 45 per cent at Fl 22.1bn.
Operating profit, which does not include realised gains on investments, was
up 10.3 per cent at Fl 865.5m.
The 1993 dividend is to be raised to Fl 4 from Fl 3.75 in 1992.
The sharp increase in turnover was heavily influenced by the acquisition in
February last year of Amex Life's portfolio in the US and its link-up in the
fourth quarter with Scottish Equitable.
Excluding acquisitions, turnover would have risen by 12.5 per cent.
Aegon said the Scottish Equitable acquisition had no effect on 1993 profit
but should make a contribution in 1994. The acquisition trebled European
turnover at Aegon, which generates most of its business in the US and the
Netherlands. The company is active in Spain and Hungary but recently
announced its withdrawal from Belgium.

FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Eager to pluck the tempting cherry - Why
Arthur Andersen wants a merger with BDO Binder Hamlyn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Jim Wadia became managing partner of Arthur Andersen, the UK's
fourth largest accountancy firm, in September last year, he set to work
immediately on his plans for expansion.
Seven months later - and sooner than he might have wished - his target
became publicly known: a proposed merger with BDO Binder Hamlyn, the eighth
largest firm.
The idea, which Binder partners are debating this week, provides some
insights into the structure of the two firms and the state of the UK
accountancy profession overall.
Last summer Andersen released fee income figures of Pounds 388.6m which
helped it to jump up the league table of the largest firms to become fourth
biggest and only Pounds 2m below Ernst &amp; Young, the third in size.
It was also the only firm to report growth among the 'Big Six' - up by 17.4
per cent.
However, Andersen remains frustrated. The UK - as well as Japan and Germany
 -were the three areas where the firm's presence in significant economies
was limited. This reflected a history of later development in these -
sometimes heavily regulated - countries.
Andersen, the only Big Six firm to start in the US rather than the UK, began
operating in the UK only in the 1950s.
It also irritates the firm that rivals often point out that the bulk of
Andersen's UK business derives from its consulting arm rather than from core
audit, tax and accounting work.
In addition, Andersen missed out on much of the fee income garnered by its
rivals for advice on privatisation and other government work during the
1980s.
The reason was its audit of De Lorean, the fraudulent sports car
manufacturer in Northern Ireland, in which the government invested
substantial sums and then sued the auditor in an attempt to gain redress.
Andersen has had no public contracts since then.
Binder, therefore, was a logical target for Mr Wadia. Growth by acquisition
would allow Andersen to expand most quickly. Below the Big Six, the next
largest firm is Grant Thornton, which has a specialist niche concentrating
on owner-managed businesses. After that comes Binder, modelled far more
closely on the Big Six structure.
It is one of the last tempting cherries for the larger firms, which are
increasingly monopolising work for quoted companies of any size. Certainly
Andersen sees its future non-organic growth coming from individual partners
and small practice specialisms from other firms.
Mr Wadia viewed Binder as tempting because it still has a large and loyal
client base with more than 100 quoted companies of note and some highly
regarded professionals and partners. It also has what Andersen does not: a
private client base and significant government work.
Although Binder has periodically been subject to rumours about its financial
strength it is now said to be profitable. It has certainly proved tempting
to other firms, which have periodically held talks for a possible merger.
Mr Wadia wanted to take the initiative. He also reasoned that Binder's
advantages could not last as growing competition between the larger firms
began to erode its client base. Between 1992 and 1993, Binder dropped from
seventh to eighth place by income, with a drop of 5.2 per cent to Pounds
108.5m. It has also failed to diversify as far as other practices, with
audit a high 60.5 per cent of fee income, and relatively underdeveloped
insolvency and consulting arms.
These tentative conclusions formed the basis for a recommendation to the
senior executives of the firm in Europe and the US who gave Mr Wadia
approval to go ahead in February. That led to his discussions with a core
group of Binder partners, and a formal offer last month.
What Mr Wadia had perhaps not fully known was how differently structured
Binder is to Andersen. There are 11 regional partnerships, each jealously
guarding their independence from one another. Press reports of Mr Wadia's
approach before some of these regional managing partners were even aware of
the bid cannot have helped.
In the next few days, each of the regional partnerships will be presented
with a heads of agreement document fleshing out the proposals, and will be
asked to vote for it. There will also be a vote of its 220 national
partners, to determine issues such as who will be able to use the Binder
name. Still under negotiation are topics such as how the costs of potential
future litigation against the firm will be spread, and the terms on which
Binder partners would join Andersen - notably, how many will become full
partners in Andersen's worldwide organisation.
While Binder claims that there will be no significant job losses, some
fall-out is inevitable. Andersen is highly profitable for partners because
its leverage is so high. The professional-to-partner ratio is the highest
among all the UK's accountants at 15. Binder's is one of the lowest, at 7.4.
For Andersen too, the merger will not be easy. It will be faced with
integrating a large firm formed through a series of mergers and with very
different traditions and culture. Most of its own professionals have by
contrast worked all their lives for Andersen. One exception is Mr Wadia
himself, who trained as a barrister before joining the firm as a tax
specialist.
If the merger goes ahead, Andersen will also have to be careful not to
alienate key Binder partners who have close relationships with clients,
which they may take away with them if they leave.
As a result, Andersen has been careful to offer Binder the chance, at least
initially, to retain its name and identity in a merged firm. Binder is
telling its clients that there will be no material changes to staffing,
costs or its approach. Quite how this will work in practice remains to be
seen.
The merger may prove too difficult for some of the smaller firms in the
Binder network who want to maintain their independence.
Nonetheless, Binder's largest and most important regional firms - London and
Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle - have indicated their
enthusiasm, and Andersen will be willing to proceed even if only London and
Leeds wants to go ahead.

FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: British Land completes property transfer
deal with Quantum Realty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Land, the property company, and Quantum UK Realty Fund, which is
managed by Mr George Soros, the financier, have completed the transfer of 17
properties into their jointly-owned British Land Quantum Property Fund.
Taken together with a Pounds 128m acquisition of a portfolio from Royal
Insurance, announced last month, and the purchase of a 29.9 per cent stake
in Stanhope Properties, this brings the total invested in the property fund
to Pounds 400m.
The 17 properties in the portfolio include six office buildings - the
104,000 sq ft Orchard Brae House in Edinburgh, the 19,000 sq ft Weltech
Centre in Welwyn Garden City, the 266,000 sq ft Temple Court in Birmingham,
which is under construction, the 27,000 sq ft Woodlands Court offices in
Burgess Hill, the 230,000 sq ft Legal &amp; General House in Reigate and the
106,000 sq ft York House in London's West End.
The retail component of the portfolio includes the 733,000 sq ft Eastgate
Shopping Centre in Basildon. It also has a retail warehouse in Tunbridge
Wells, three Tesco supermarkets in Bromley-by-Bow, Finchley and Sevenoaks, a
pre-let retail warehouse development in Reading and a Do It All retail
warehouse in Reading.
The portfolio also includes the 122,000 sq ft United Biscuits distribution
centre in Ashby de la Zouch, a 77,000 sq ft industrial warehouse complex in
Middlesex and the Battersea Flour Mill, a 2.2 acre development site.
British Land has also announced that it would satisfy part of its payment to
Royal Insurance by the procurement from the market of 2m British Land shares
at a price of 413p.
Completion of this share purchase is expected to take place on April 25, the
same day as the purchase of the property portfolio.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stylo, which owns the Barratts chain of shoe shops, returned to the black in
the year to January 29, exceeding City expectations with pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2.55m.
This compared with losses of Pounds 746,000 last time, struck after a Pounds
1.33m gain from sales of fixed assets. The latest figure included an
exceptional gain of Pounds 220,000.
Turnover increased to Pounds 116.5m (Pounds 105.5m). Operating profits
doubled to Pounds 6.92m (Pounds 3.47m).
Mr Michael Ziff, managing director, said the group was concentrating on
better products, improved merchandising and tighter control of expenses in
its core areas - Barratts, Instep sportswear outlets, and the golf and
equestrian wholesale business. During the year the group opened 25 new
branches and closed six.
Net borrowings fell by Pounds 4m to Pounds 39.9m, and net interest payable
dipped to Pounds 4.59m (Pounds 5.55m).
Earnings were 12.1p (losses of 4.01p). The single dividend is lifted to 4p
(3p). A 1-for-2 scrip issue is also proposed.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Courtaulds, the chemicals group, is to take a 72.5 per cent stake in the
viscose and acrylic fibres joint venture with Hoechst of Germany, announced
last May.
The final agreement, which had been awaiting approval by the competition
authorities, includes put and call options exercisable after five years on
Hoechst's 27.5 per cent stake. The joint venture becomes operational
immediately.
Courtaulds is contributing 57 per cent of the joint venture's assets of
Pounds 105m and 64 per cent of its annual turnover of Pounds 360m.
The joint venture will be the second largest producer in the European fibre
industry, which has been suffering from overcapacity and Asian imports.
It will have about 30 per cent of the total viscose and 25 per cent of the
total acrylic staple fibre capacity in Europe.
With its Courtelle brand name, Courtaulds is market leader in producer-dyed
acrylic fibre in Europe.
The venture, which has a workforce of 2,450, takes in Courtaulds' viscose
and acrylic fibre operations at Grimsby and Bradford in the UK and acrylic
fibre operations at Barcelona together with Hoechst's viscose and acrylic
fibre operations at Kelheim, Germany.
The joint venture will be headed by Mr Patrick White as chief executive.

FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Buy-out at Excalibur jewellery subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Excalibur Group, the precision engineering and giftware company, has agreed
the sale of Premier Chain, its jewellery chain business, to a management
buy-out.
The price is Pounds 1m, plus the repayment of a 45kg gold bullion loan,
worth Pounds 375,200, and repayment of Pounds 748,000 of inter-company debt.
The deal, which is subject to shareholders' approval at a special meeting on
April 21, follows the strategy Excalibur outlined at the time of its interim
results in January when it said it would focus on its two main businesses
and that jewellery was a non-core activity.
The sale will cut gearing, which stood at over 100 per cent in the last
balance sheet, although net assets will fall slightly, from Pounds 9.6m to
Pounds 9.4m as the business is being sold slightly below asset value of
Pounds 1.23m.
As well as the proceeds of the sale, Excalibur will be relieved of funding
Premier's working capital, which fluctuated sharply because of the
seasonality of the business and moves in the gold price.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Severfield-Reeve, the USM-traded structural steel group, swung from losses
of Pounds 987,000 to profits of Pounds 407,000 pre-tax for 1993.
Turnover of continuing activities improved by 39 per cent to Pounds 21.7m.
Earnings emerged at 2.19p (losses 5.53p) and a final dividend of 0.25p is
proposed for a 0.5p (nil) total.
Margins in the second half were lower as a result of disruption to
production caused by the installation of new equipment. However, the move
enabled the group to raise production capacity by 25 per cent from October
onwards, the 'benefits of which will be seen in 1994 and beyond'.

FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Allied Radio restructure and rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Radio, the lossmaking broadcaster to Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire,
yesterday announced plans to reconstruct its share and loan capital and make
a rights issue.
The shares were suspended at 10 1/2 p. The company said detailed proposals
would be contained in a circular expected to be sent to shareholders in the
next few days, together with the accounts for the year ending September 30.
Last July, when reporting a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.17m on turnover of
Pounds 2.25m, the company said it was considering a reconstruction of the
balance sheet, including the conversion of loan stock and the elimin-ation
of the negative balance on the profit and loss account.
At present the company is capitalised at Pounds 9.6m, including Pounds 4.75m
worth of convertible unsecured loan stock. Interest on the loan stock due at
March 31 will not be paid, but will be taken into account in the
reconstruction.
The company said 'a significant number' of institutional shareholders and
stock holders had indicated support for its proposals.

FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Readicut sells Firth group to Swiss for
Pounds 9.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Readicut International has sold Firth Furnishings, a maker of car carpets,
and its subsidiary, Firth Europe, to Rieter-Scragg, part of Rieter Holding,
a Swiss-based group, for Pounds 9.8m cash.
Total net borrowings of the companies at the end of March were about Pounds
6.5m. The freehold property occupied by Firth and its textile bonding
business have been retained by Readicut, but Firth will continue to use the
property under lease from Readicut.
The sale proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings.

FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Outsiders get foot in Burtons' doors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After more than 90 years in the tailoring business, Burtons is contracting
out its suits departments to an outside company in 350 of its 422 stores.
Burtons, the men's wear chain of Burton Group, is close to agreement with
William Baird, which manufactures suits under the Centaur label, to take
over selling suits in the stores on a concession basis.
While details of the deal are still to be agreed, Baird is expected to
manufacture all the stock and employ all the sales staff, with Burtons
receiving a portion of the takings.
Baird has been operating suits concessions in the group's Debenhams chain
for some years. Burtons says selling suits requires high levels of staff
training and customer service, which concessions are better able to provide.
Concessions also achieve higher sales per square foot, and better profit
margins.
The move reflects a shift to a more casual clothing range in Burtons stores
 -the proportion of its sales accounted for by suits has fallen to about a
third of the level in the early 1980s, and its smaller stores do not have
suits departments.
The suit market has shrunk by about a third in the past two years,
principally because of recession and a shift towards the wearing of casual
clothing, especially at work.

FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Reorganised IBC improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Communications (Holdings), the newsletter publishing,
conference and electronic data services group, reported a solid increase in
underlying operating profits in 1993, while pre-tax profits of Pounds 43.1m
were swollen by a Pounds 38.2m one-off profit on the redemption of senior
loans.
As expected, IBC is returning to the dividend list with a 2p payment. The
shares closed 21p higher at 207p.
The group has undertaken a substantial reorganisation in recent years
including a reconstruction of its balance sheet partly through a Pounds 20m
placing and open offer successfully competed in July last year.
As a result Mr Peter Rigby, chief executive, said that IBC was now 'a normal
company'. He said the reduction in the debt burden, which fell from Pounds
76.4m to Pounds 14.5m at end-December, 'means that a very real obstacle to
the group's future progress and well being has been removed'.
Turnover rose by 9.2 per cent to Pounds 60.5m (Pounds 55.4m) and operating
profits were ahead 23 per cent at Pounds 7.51m, reflecting 'considerable
progress both in overall terms and in operating margins'.
Net continuing interest payments fell to Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 2.54m),
producing profits on ordinary activities of Pounds 6.09m (Pounds 3.58m).
However, there was non-continuing debenture interest of Pounds 1.27m (Pounds
2.83m) and the exceptional Pounds 38.2m profit, resulting in the inflated
full-year pre-tax result against Pounds 752,000 in 1992.
Earnings per share increased to 163p (5.3p). However, Mr Rigby suggested
that the 49 per cent increase in adjusted headline earnings to 13p (8.7p)
represented 'a more relevant performance indicator'.
COMMENT
IBC's underlying performance was somewhat ahead of market expectations and
highlights the group's capacity to generate cash and profits from its two
core businesses. The balance sheet reconstruction has resulted in a level of
debt which the group can well afford to service and long suffering
shareholders have been rewarded with a resumption of dividends. Providing
the upturn in evidence in the final quarter is sustained, pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 7.3m are likely and, with a tax charge which is likely to
remain at about the 18 per cent level, earnings of about 15p per share are
expected. The shares have climbed from a low of 45p a year ago, but could
still go higher.

FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Smiths Industries Dollars 32m US expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smiths Industries yesterday said it was expanding its industrial division
with the Dollars 32m (Pounds 21.6m) cash acquisition of Tutco, the US
heating element manufacturer.
The privately-owned Tennessee-based group is expected to complement the
division's air conditioning and ducting operations.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman, said: 'Recent acquisitions have given our
industrial group a strong focus in the heating and ventilation markets.
Tutco fits in well with these existing busin-esses.'
Those subsidiaries are dominated by Vent-Axia, the fan company acquired for
Pounds 58m in December 1992.
An enlarged industrial division, however, is unlikely to overtake Smiths'
main medical systems and aerospace activities.
In the 12 months to July 31 last year, the division contributed Pounds 21m
to pre-tax profits of Pounds 104.6m and accounted for Pounds 152m of the
Pounds 725.8m turnover.
Smiths predicted Tutco, which employs 360 people and produces more than 5m
heating elements a year, would boost divisional turnover by 14 per cent.

FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant US demand behind Quarto advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyant US demand last year for books and art prints fuelled a 46 per cent
increase in profits at Quarto Group, the publishing and printing services
company.
Reporting a pre-tax outcome of Pounds 5.02m (Pounds 3.42m) for 1993, the
US-registered group hailed signs of economic upturn in its markets -
particularly North America - as the main factor behind the improvement.
Although the 1992 results were restated to reflect Pounds 551,000 of
exceptional charges, underlying profits rose 26 per cent from a restated
Pounds 3.97m.
Turnover also rose 26 per cent as contributions by new subsidiaries helped
lift group sales to Pounds 49.6m (Pounds 39.4m).
Those subsidiaries were dominated by Scafa, the US publisher of fine art
prints, which Quarto acquired last September with an initial Pounds 2.9m
payment.
The acquisition, funded by a Pounds 9.5m rights issue, meant art market
sales now accounted for more than a third of group turnover.
Funds outstanding from the issue were used to reduce net borrowings from
Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 3.4m, and gearing declined from 91 per cent to 27 per
cent.
While welcoming the figures, Mr Laurence Orbach, chairman, said: 'Margins,
both at the gross and pre-tax level, have deteriorated slightly. Pressure on
prices remains intense and we and our suppliers have to adjust to working in
a low inflation and low growth environment'.
He claimed the group's best prospects lay in further expansion in the US,
where it has allocated Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.4m) for acquisitions by Scafa.
'US sales have increased from 42 per cent of turnover to 50 per cent, and we
expect it to stay above that level,' he added.
That growth helped earnings per share rise 20 per cent to 19.7p (16.4p),
while the final dividend is increased to 4p, making a total of 6p (5.37p).
4p (3.76p), making a total for the year of 6p (5.37p).

Frank G Gates, motor dealer, more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds
886,000 to Pounds 2.1m in 1993. Turnover grew 35 per cent to Pounds 76.5m,
mainly due to increased sales of new and used vehicles.
Mr Edward Gates, chairman, said the second half turned out to be similar to
the first six months. Gross profits, however, rose only 15 per cent due to
lower margins on new vehicle sales.
Earnings per share advanced from 3.65p to 6.45p, while the dividend is
stepped up from 2.25p to 2.75p.

Celsis, a biotechnology company floated 10 months ago, said yesterday that
it had 'dismissed' its chief executive Mr Tony Martin on the grounds that he
had been 'ineffectual'.
Mr John Precious, chairman, said that Mr Martin 'has not been able to grow
in the way we needed a chief executive to grow'.
Mr Martin joined the company just over a year ago and saw it through
flotation. He leaves with two years of a three-year Pounds 90,000 contract
still to run and has a 3 per cent stake in the company. Under stock exchange
rules he is not allowed to sell the shares until July 1995. Mr Martin is
consulting his solicitors.
A shortlist of potential candidates for the chief executive post is
understood to have been drawn up and some interviews have already taken
place.
The departure of Mr Martin is a reminder that the risks associated with the
biotechnology industry go beyond the scientific. Few large US biotechnology
companies still have the chief executives that presided over their
flotations.
Celsis executives said that they regarded their ability to dismiss the chief
executive so soon after flotation as 'a virtue'.
The company, which is developing equipment to test for contamination during
the manufacture of food, drinks, cosmetics and drugs, raised Pounds 12.4m in
a flotation that was nearly four times subscribed.
The flotation price was 100p and the shares yesterday fell 4p to 78p.
Celsis concluded a Dollars 700,000 collaborative agreement with Merck, the
biggest US drugs company, in February. But Mr Mark Clement, finance
director, said that Mr Martin had not been involved with that deal.
Mr Chris Evans, the founder of Celsis and the man who recruited Mr Martin,
said that he was appointed 'because of his perceived track record'.
Mr Martin, 40, had been managing director of the diagnostics arm of one of
the UK's biggest biotechnology companies, British Biotechnology.
Before that he had held development and marketing positions with Procter and
Gamble, the US consumer goods manufacturer, and Amersham International, the
radioactive products supplier.

FT  06 APR 94 / Southwestern Bell abandons cable TV link-up with Cox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Southwestern Bell, the US regional telecommunications group, yesterday
announced it was abandoning a plan to form a Dollars 4.9bn cable television
partnership with Cox Enterprises, the privately-owned media group, because
of increasing federal government regulation of the cable industry's
finances.
This is the second large link-up between a US cable company and a local
telephone group to be abandoned this year.
It reinforces the growing belief among analysts that tie-ups between the two
industries are going to proceed much more slowly than envisaged last year
when Bell Atlantic, the Philadelphia-based phone group, and
Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable company, appeared to set a trend
by announcing plans for a Dollars 22bn merger.
That deal was widely hailed as speeding up the availability of multimedia
interactive communications services, but Bell Atlantic and TCI abandoned
their merger plans in February.
Like Southwestern Bell, they blamed the collapse on new rules for the cable
industry announced that month by the Federal Communications Commission, the
government agency which oversees the communications industries. The FCC
demanded that the cable industry cut its prices to consumers by 7 per cent.
Mr Jim Kahan, a senior executive at Southwestern Bell, said yesterday that
the company was convinced that the new regulatory environment, created by
the 1992 Cable Reregulation Act and reflected in the FCC's new rules,
'significantly hinders the ability of the partnership as initially
structured to meet its growth and financial objectives'.
Southwestern Bell provides telecommunications services in Texas and some
neighbouring states. Atlanta-based Cox is a Dollars 2.5bn turnover media
group with interests ranging from newspapers to television broadcasting
stations.
Under the deal they announced last December, Southwestern planned to invest
Dollars 1.6bn to take a 40 per cent stake in a private partnership which
would own 21 of Cox's cable systems, with about 1.6m subscribers in 16
states. Cox and Southwestern were already partners in running cable systems
in Britain and they emphasised yesterday that they would continue to
'aggressively pursue' this venture.

FT  06 APR 94 / Anxious faces in the queue for the market: A look at the
glut of property groups seeking flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER and SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The heavy pounding taken by property shares in recent weeks has sent a
tremor through property companies lining up to join the stock market.
Until recently, 1994 promised to be a record year for property flotations.
Argent Group, which plans a Pounds 150m flotation in May, is the latest of
nearly a dozen companies to announce an intention to join the stock market.
Brokers estimate that a clutch of other flotation candidates could add
several hundred million pounds to the sector's capitalisation.
But enthusiasm for some of these new issues may be muted. The glut of
companies joining the market, together with a fall of just over 16 per cent
in property share values since the start of February, means that a
successful flotation is no longer assured. The recent public offer for
Capital Shopping Centres, which specialises in regional shopping centres,
was only 14.4 per cent subscribed by the public.
The experience of Capital Shopping Centres, which priced its shares at an
ambitious 13 per cent premium to net asset value, is already to prompting
flotation candidates to scale down offer prices. Capital's issue price was
230p, and yesterday the shares closed at 210p - giving it a market value of
Pounds 758m.
Rugby Estates reduced its new share issue by Pounds 5m, and its initial
market capitalisation has fallen by one third to Pounds 20m. As a result,
its biggest shareholder, Hillsdown, has decided not to sell.
But these experiences may not deter the directors of private companies
intent on raising new funds and realising part of their investment. Joining
the stock market offers their companies greater flexibility in fund raising,
enabling them to take advantage of development opportunities. The freedom of
manoeuvre tends to be greater than with bank finance, which is typically
restricted to relatively high quality property.
Moreover, property shares are still highly valued by historic standards.
Although shares are no longer trading at a premium to net asset value, the
current average discount of about 3 per cent may still seem attractive when
compared with the average discount of more than 20 per cent over the past 10
years. 'Property paper is worth more than two years ago. There is a
feel-good factor,' says a director of one company contemplating a float.
But not all those joining the market can expect to be well received. 'When
there is demand for the property sector, anything goes. But there is only a
limited demand for these new issues,' says one analyst.
As investors become jaded by the quantity of paper being released, companies
are increasingly emphasising their distinguishing features.
Several of the newcomers to the market are long-established players. Capital
Shopping Centres has been in existence for 25 years; London City Holdings
has risen from the ashes of Randsworth Trust; Chelsfield, which joined the
market in December, is run by Mr Elliott Bernerd, one of the industry's
best-known figures.
A few of the companies have distinguished themselves by investing heavily
during the downturn: Argent Group built up assets of more than Pounds 200m
during the recession.
Other companies have tried to carve out a marketing niche. LCH has West End
assets, Fiscal Properties has a portfolio let entirely to government tenants
and Rugby Estates a management intensive approach.
But even companies with a coherent strategy or a visible management record
will have to contend with general malaise in the sector. Property shares
have fallen further than the rest of the market, as investors wonder if they
have been over-optimistic about rising property yields.
Uncertainty in the bond market could slow the rise in property values, as
movements in property yields have recently been closely allied to movements
in bond yields. The property market's vulnerability to falls in bond values
will be particularly pronounced if rental growth takes longer than expected
to emerge.
Many other companies will find they have to work hard to persuade investors
of the quality of their management and assets. Kleinwort Benson says a
number of companies likely to seek flotations have been overgeared and need
shareholders' money to solve their cash flow problem. 'Their portfolios will
be historical accidents and not necessarily suited to the 1990s,' it says.
Investors' caution is increased by the lacklustre performance of a number of
existing small quoted companies which have indifferent managements and high
overheads. This poor record calls into question the value of the present
rush of flotations, according to Mr Marc Gilbard of Goldman Sachs. 'The
sector needed to consolidate rather than expand,' he says.

FT  06 APR 94 / Eurotunnel settles TML dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, the company which will operate train services through the
Channel tunnel, has settled a long-running dispute with the construction
consortium, clearing the way for a rights issue of up to Pounds 750m.
Eurotunnel said yesterday that it had agreed to pay an additional Pounds
70m-Pounds 85m to Transmanche Link (TML), the Anglo-French consortium. This
brings the total it has paid TML to Pounds 1.14bn, nearly twice the Pounds
620m original contract price. The amount is, however, considerably less than
the Pounds 1.95bn the contractors had been seeking.
The ensuing Eurotunnel rights issue, planned for mid-May, may raise up to
Pounds 750m, it emerged yesterday. It was originally intended to bring in
Pounds 500m alongside a similar amount of debt.
The agreement, reached on Friday, settles the final claim outstanding
against Eurotunnel, although it still has a Pounds 1bn claim against the
British and French railways. The settlement covers the tunnel's fixed
equipment but not rolling stock deliveries. As part of the deal, TML has
agreed, with the help of Swiss Bank Corporation, to underwrite Pounds 75m of
shares.
The size of the equity issue will depend on the extent of the delay in the
opening of the tunnel; how much the banks will lend; and the exact payment
made to the contractors, which is related to Eurotunnel's share price after
the rights issue.
Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel co-chairman, described the deal as 'quite a
victory' for the company's shareholders. Eurotunnel might have held out for
a lower settlement 'but when you are coming up to a rights issue, a claim is
worth avoiding'.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac and leading UK negotiator on
behalf of TML, said: 'No contractor wants to get paid five years after the
traffic goes down the track. We have found a line down the middle which both
sets of shareholders should be happy with.'
Mr Simms said the impact of the deal on provisions made by the contractors
would take more than a year to come through. No extra provisions would be
needed.
An executive at one of the French consortium members said: 'It had to be a
compromise agreement, but we received most of what we asked for.'
Eurotunnel will seek shareholders' approval to issue a further 150m shares
in each of its French and British companies, in addition to the 192m already
approved for each of them. Shareholders' meetings will be held on May 9 and
17.
Sir Alastair said a full service would operate through the tunnel by
'September/Octoberish'. He estimated the cost of the delays at tens of
millions of pounds a month, but less than the Pounds 50m a month which has
been quoted, for a total over the summer of less than Pounds 100m. He
described this as 'a large but not fundamental loss of revenue'.

FT  06 APR 94 / Suez returns to FFr1.6bn profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Suez, one of France's largest industrial and financial holding companies,
yesterday confirmed that it returned to the black in 1993 with a net profit
of FFr1.57bn (Pounds 184m) against a net loss of FFr1.87bn the previous
year.
The group, which in 1992 fell into the red for the first time in its
135-year history because of the financial pressures on its banking and
property interests, expected to continue its recovery this year. The board
proposed freezing the dividend at FFr8.20 a share for 1993.
However, Suez's rebound concealed a widely varying performance across the
group. Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company, fared
well, as did Indosuez, the group's main investment banking subsidiary, and
Victoire, its insurance business. The strong performance of these
subsidiaries enabled Suez to produce an operating profit of FFr1.61bn in
1993, against an operating loss of FFr610m.
Suez continued to suffer from the weakness of the French property market,
forcing it to make further hefty provisions on the fall in value of its
commercial property interests.
Suez also faced additional problems within its banking businesses. The board
yesterday authorised the recapitalisation of Credisuez, a financial
subsidiary, in a FFr2bn restructuring package. This deal also involved
Compagnie de Suez, another subsidiary, paying FFr1bn to purchase some of
Credisuez's investments.
Suez managed to compensate for the negative impact of its high provisions by
making substantial gains from asset sales. Exceptional profits amounted to
FFr4.35bn, compared with FFr1.64bn. Substantial deals included last autumn's
disposal of Victoire's controlling interest in Colonia, the German insurer,
to Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurer.
Suez, still burdened with heavy debts despite its recent disposals, hopes to
make other asset sales this year.
The group said it did not expect to suffer so badly from the property
crisis. It anticipated further improvement from its banking businesses and
another strong performance from Societe Generale de Belgique.

FT  06 APR 94 / Euphoria and photos as Israeli troops leave Gaza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GAZA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'It is not a lovely thing to do to fight against children with stones. We
are lucky and happy to be getting out,' Major Udi Cohen in the Gaza Strip
said yesterday.
The major spoke as Israel continued packing up military and police bases,
redeploying troops from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho in
preparation for Palestinian self-rule. The arrival of the first independent
Palestinian police force is imminent. The redeployment is Israel's first
withdrawal from occupied Arab lands - captured in the 1967 Six Day War -
since it handed the Sinai back to Egypt in 1982.
All across Gaza yesterday, smiling troops expressed their relief as they
departed. Soldiers photographed each other to commemorate a moment many hope
will be historic and irreversible.
The soldiers will move to a new base in the Gush Katif block of Jewish
settlements in the south of the strip - which will remain after Palestinian
self-rule. 'The new base is more beautiful and you can see the sea,' Lt
Nitzan said. 'We will be surrounded by Jews there.'
Not all soldiers are happy to quit the strip. 'We shouldn't give up our
biblical land and go back to Auschwitz borders,' said one.
But most, especially teenage conscripts, are euphoric to be leaving behind
dangerous patrols, midnight arrests, the constant threat of ambush and
Palestinian demonstrators.
'It's been like hell here,' said one soldier. 'We've been surrounded by
Arabs who hate and fear us. You never knew when you or your friend would
take a bullet. At last it's over.'
Senior officers said yesterday they hope the withdrawal will allow the army
to return to its conventional role of national defence rather than
counter-insurgency and occupation. 'We hope to transfer control to
Palestinians so the army can go back to doing the job of an army and not
that of a military police,' said Col Meir Ben-Yishai, commander of southern
Gaza.
Palestinians watched the withdrawal yesterday with a mixture of impatience
and hostility.
In Jericho, Palestinian schoolchildren tossed stones and bottles at Israeli
policemen trying to finish the evacuation of the police station and paint it
before handing it over.

FT  06 APR 94 / Turkish PM devalues lira as part of austerity package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Ankara Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Turkish government yesterday announced a three-month economic austerity
package and devalued the lira by 28 per cent against the US dollar in an
attempt to relieve the country's economic crisis.
The package follows days of chaos on the financial markets and political
uncertainty after recent electoral gains by an Islamic group, directly
challenging mainstream secular parties.
Outlining the package in a televised address, Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime
minister, warned that Turkey was heading for Latin American-style
hyperinflation unless tough action was taken to reduce a ballooning public
deficit.
The package includes immediate price increases of state controlled
commodities and closures of loss-making state enterprises, which could
provoke a backlash.
The decisions follow two months of currency turbulence, with interbank rates
at one point reaching 1,000 per cent as the central bank attempted to prop
up the lira. The central bank, signalling yesterday it would no longer
intervene to support the lira, announced that today's official fix against
the US dollar would be TL32,050, representing a 28 per cent devaluation
compared with the official Central Bank rate yesterday.
The package comprises structural measures such as faster privatisation,
one-off tax changes and reform of farm support policies to underpin a fiscal
programme to slash the budget deficit in the second quarter from TL47,000bn
to TL9,000bn. The government also announced proposals to reform the central
bank, designed to tighten control over the money supply.
Economists welcomed the reforms, but warned that implementation would be the
test, given potential opposition from Mrs Ciller's coalition partners, the
Social Democratic Populists (SHP). Success will also depend on the
co-operation of the main opposition centre-right Motherland party, Anap.
Yesterday state controlled prices of petrol, tobacco and sugar were raised
by up to 100 per cent. That is certain to fuel short-term inflation, which
last month reached an annual rate of more than 73 per cent.
The Istanbul stock exchange index jumped by 7 per cent yesterday, but
dealers said most of the advance took place before the government announced
the economic package.

FT  06 APR 94 / Dutch toy workers fly in for protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Closing a plant in the Netherlands can be a notoriously complex and
expensive process, but it does not normally involve all employees travelling
abroad to demonstrate.
Yesterday morning all 162 employees of the Hasbro toy factory in Ter Apel in
the Netherlands arrived at the doors of the Hasbro International
headquarters in Stockley Park, near London, to stage an orderly protest.
The world's biggest toy company knew the visit was planned and had earlier
turned down employee requests for a meeting with Mr Norman Walker, president
of Hasbro International.
But when the Hasbro executives saw the Dutch workers - mainly members of the
CNV general union and the FNV print union - shivering outside, they changed
their minds.
Mr Walker told the demonstrators he could not discuss the proposed closure
until the Ter Apel employee works council produced its alternative plan.
The employees of the nearly Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) turnover company feel
aggrieved that Ter Apel has been selected for closure despite its being, on
Hasbro's own admission, a modern, efficient, and profitable plant.
The trouble, says Hasbro, is that worldwide overcapacity requires the
closure of one of its three European plants and the Dutch plant is smaller
than those in Spain and Ireland. Also, it is not equipped to produce games
and toys.
If this is the modern face of European industrial relations, it certainly
seems civilised. The employees chartered a Boeing 737-300 on a public
holiday, but a company spokesman said that Hasbro would have given them a
day off to protest anyway.

FT  06 APR 94 / Power costs anger large users: Electricity prices in
wholesale pool reach near-record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large energy users reacted angrily yesterday as wholesale electricity prices
in England and Wales reached near-record levels.
The price rises contrasted sharply with last month, when they were at their
lowest since privatisation three years ago.
The changes have a direct impact on the more than 1,000 large industrial
companies which buy their power on prices related directly to that of the
pool.
Yesterday's level of 3.4p per kilowatt hour was the third highest daily
average since the electricity pool, the wholesale trading market, was set up
in 1990. Pool prices are determined a day in advance with generating plant
managers saying how much they are seeking to run their stations. Today's
average price is slightly lower at 3.2p than yesterday's, but still more
than twice the average daily price of 1.5p last month. The sharp change
coincided with the end of a financial year in which there was a fierce
battle for market share.
Although the present high levels are unsustainable, following a recent deal
between the industry regulator and National Power and PowerGen, the two
largest generators, they will be cited by large power users who want the
generators' ability to influence prices reduced.
National Power and PowerGen both lost market share in the last financial
year to other producers, including Nuclear Electric. But the level they
charge remains the biggest factor in determining pool prices.
Both companies say that last month's prices are well below what would be
needed to earn an adequate return on their assets or to enable them to build
new power stations.
Mr John Stoney, energy purchasing manager for Imperial Chemical Industries,
said the changes of the last few days meant that 'we have shifted from
competitive prices to manipulated prices once again.
'The levels we had in March are what you would expect to see in a
competitive market where there is overcapacity and high stocks of coal,'
said Mr Stoney. 'The rises show how much power the major generators have
over pool prices.'
The large energy users can comfort themselves with the knowledge that pool
prices will have to drop if the generators are to keep their pledge to Prof
Stephen Littlechild, electricity regulator, that they price their power in
such a way that average annual prices do not exceed 2.4p per kwh.
Mr Peter Rost, chairman of the Major Energy Users' Association, said price
rises this month were very disruptive to his members with pool-related
contracts. They highlighted why Prof Littlechild was justified in limiting
pool prices during the next two years in his deal with the generators.

FT  06 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lasmo is an acquisitive company. It ambitiously acquired Ultramar. Now, in
little more than 12 months, it has acquired a new chief executive, finance
director, and finally yesterday, a new chairman. Such extensive bloodletting
was the price demanded in the wake of the Ultramar deal. Perhaps the
appointment of Mr Rudolf Agnew as chairman also hints that the company needs
an old hand to rebuild goodwill with the institutions. Whether he can warm
relations sufficiently for Lasmo to get a rights issue away is, however, an
open question.
It is also far from clear that fresh equity would help matters much. Further
write-downs of expensively acquired assets will be needed if the crude oil
price remains low. That would certainly tear large holes in an already
moth-eaten balance sheet. But the company's gross cash flows are sufficient
to meet current interest payments. This is hardly the time to spend on
exploration, and Lasmo's record is patchy. Unless banking covenants based on
net assets are likely to be breached there is little incentive to cough up
funds to pay off some banks. Shareholders would simply have more money
staked on a slightly less leveraged oil price bet.
Lasmo's central problem is that it paid for expensive oil reserves and now
the price is on the slide. Many of the corrective measures now being taken
are necessary, but are probably not in themselves sufficient. The oil price
will determine Lasmo's future, and shareholders have plenty invested in that
hope already.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface, it looks as though the great bond market decoupling has
finally started. In late March, 10-year German and US government bonds were
virtually neck-and-neck in yield terms, but German issues escaped the steep
falls suffered by the US market after last week's jobs data. Now they yield
some 80 basis points less than their US equivalents. At the short end of the
curve, decoupling is clearly under way. The Bundesbank has cut its money
market repurchase rate by 24 basis points since the start of March, showing
that German rates can fall while those in the US rise. This is not difficult
when the repurchase rate is still above its US counterpart. How far the
process will flow through into longer maturities is another matter.
For German bunds to trade consistently at a lower yield than US Treasuries
requires an expectation that the D-Mark will strengthen against the dollar.
Despite yesterday's advance, the dollar is still lower than it was when the
Federal Reserve started tightening in February. But the consensus
expectation remains for it to rise, and that is what counts.
Nor are domestic German buyers returning to the bond market in force.
Perhaps they are waiting for further Bundesbank rate cuts, which could also
be hastened by a weaker dollar; perhaps tax worries limit the attractions
even of a 6.3 per cent yield. Whatever the cause, it is hard to believe the
German market is suddenly free of transatlantic influence.

FT  06 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Biotechnology
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tempting to see the abrupt departure of Celsis's chief executive, less
than a year after flotation, as another set-back for the UK's budding
biotechnology sector. The market has already been treated to a profits
warning from Drew Scientific only six months after its debut as a public
company. The unpredictable nature of the business certainly calls for a wide
spread of investments. There is thus a strong logic behind vehicles such as
Rothschild's planned biotechnology investment trust.
Yet seasoned investors will take such nasty surprises in their stride.
Biotechnology companies will increasingly be judged on their ability to
strike deals with larger rivals in marketing or development. Whatever the
details of the Celsis case, that may require a different management cast.
Disappointment on specific products is equally a fact of life in
pharmaceuticals research. The betting is that small biotech companies will,
in aggregate, discover drugs more cheaply and reliably than the giants of
the industry.
With more flotations in the wings thanks to the Stock Exchange's decision to
relax its listing requirements - and a total equity funding requirement of
perhaps Pounds 1bn over the next three years - investors are spoilt for
choice. The US biotechnology sector will need an additional Dollars
15bn-Dollars 20bn funding before the products now under development come to
fruition. That points to fearsome competition for funds. If UK companies are
to capture a slice of the action, they will have to learn to present a very
polished public face.

FT  06 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Clearing the tunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The merchant bankers busy glueing Eurotunnel's rights issue prospectus
together will be mightily relieved at the settlement of the dispute with
Transmanche Link. The outbreak of peace removes the last big obstacle
blocking Eurotunnel's fund-raising. All outstanding legal claims are at
least being made by Eurotunnel rather than being pursued against it, which
will simplify the contingent liabilities clause.
To that extent, it was fair enough for Eurotunnel to claim a victory. The
unanswered question is whether substantially the same deal could have been
struck many months ago. The contractors always appeared ready to settle for
far less than their inflated headline claim. For their part, they must be
delighted they are being paid in hard cash rather than the paper that was
previously mooted. Swiss Bank Corporation will limit their underwriting
exposure. It is a fair bet that many will eventually be able to release some
of their accumulated provisions.
Despite the settlement, Eurotunnel shareholders are fretting about the
slippage in the opening programme and the consequent rise in the funding
requirement. Eurotunnel's units fell 2 per cent in London as it became
apparent that significantly more than the originally-planned Pounds 500m of
new equity will be needed - although the proposed increase in authorised
shares is largely a technicality, which is not as worrying as it might
appear. There seems little doubt that Eurotunnel will eventually make a lot
of money for someone. Shareholders face hefty demands for money first.

FT  06 APR 94 / Leading Article: Touts out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ticket touts, along with gypsies, squatters and new age travellers, rank
high in current Tory demonology. This seems odd, given their obvious social
utility in matching supply and demand in markets which have been distorted
by bureaucratic pricing. Yet touts at Wimbledon or Wembley can suffer a
variety of indignities ranging from prosecution under local authority
by-laws to arrest by the police for obstruction. Now the Department of Trade
and Industry is proposing to introduce regulations under Section 26 of the
Consumer Protection Act 1987 to crack down on ticket agencies selling
tickets for theatre, concerts, sporting and other events.
It is not clear why, in dealing with these areas of the arts and leisure
industries, the principle of caveat emptor should be cast aside in favour of
intervention by the state. At many sporting events touts are simply jobbers
operating in a competitive over-the-counter market. Their existence reflects
the reluctance or inability of the organisers of sporting events to
establish a more formal secondary market to permit the privileged insiders
who initially receive the tickets to pass them on to others at close to
their real economic value. People who are prepared to buy from touts usually
know what risks they run.
In the case of ticket agencies the argument is less clear cut. The agencies
are, in the main, selling tickets for performances - Cats, the Phantom of
the Opera - that are booked out for months ahead. To the extent that foreign
or out-of-town tourists might find it difficult to book so far in advance,
they do provide a service. The snag is that they can be unforthcoming about
the original price of the ticket and other details of what the customer is
receiving for the premium paid. Many theatres remain unconvinced that the
agencies' operations really extend the run of any given performance.
The merit of the DTI's proposals is that they are confined to requirements
for disclosure of the original price and the details of seating, which will
at least make for more transparency. Since the agencies are identifiable
businesses, local authority trading standards departments should be able to
follow up complaints. Yet the people arguably most in need of protection -
foreign tourists - are the ones least likely to complain. It says something
about the priorities of Mr Major's government that it thought this game
worth the candle.

FT  06 APR 94 / Temptations along the eastern aisle: Retailers are
increasing investment in east Asia to take advantage of growing prosperity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From a vast warehouse in a Singapore suburb, Mr John Deuchars, a burly,
chain-smoking Australian, is plotting a small consumer revolution. In a few
months, he aims to propel the country's retail distribution system, largely
unchanged since British colonial days, into the information technology era.
'In terms of choice and display, stores here are as good as any in the
world. But go to the delivery bay, and everything is completely antiquated,'
says Mr Deuchars, local manager of Davids Holdings, an Australian retail
distribution group which recently formed a joint venture with
NTUC/Fairprice, Singapore's biggest supermarket chain.
At present, NTUC/Fairprice's 52 stores are supplied by an irregular army of
small wholesalers, which drop off odd lots of merchandise on average 150
times a day. Once the joint venture gets going, each store's orders will be
placed and invoiced electronically, and delivered on one truck within 24
hours.
As well as reducing traffic congestion and paperwork, the system will enable
NTUC/Fairprice to cut stock levels by 40 per cent, save costs equal to 4
percentage points of its profit margin, and sharpen retail price
competition.
The venture is just one example of a wave of change sweeping through east
Asia, as retailers scramble to meet the increasingly sophisticated demands
of newly prosperous consumers - eager to buy products from deodorants and
frozen food to luxury accessories and designer fashion brands.
This is prompting a stampede across the region by leading retailers from
around the world. They include Mitsukoshi, Takashimaya, Sogo and Yaohan of
Japan, Carrefour of France, Makro of the Netherlands, Marks and Spencer of
the UK, Sweden's Ikea, and Toys R Us of the US.
A possible indication of the growth to come is offered by Hong Kong - now
Asia's richest economy after Japan - where the number of supermarkets has
increased 40 times since 1970. In South Korea, there are 10 times more
stores than in 1980, and retailing employs 28 per cent of the labour force,
more than any other sector.
As economic growth bounds ahead, millions more people every year achieve the
minimum annual income, roughly USDollars 5,000 in most countries, needed to
become active consumers rather than relying on barter. In China, potentially
the biggest market of all, some forecasts suggest their numbers will more
than treble this decade to 200m.
In most of Asia, the ratio of retail space to population is still well below
western levels. However, it is rising rapidly in many cities as store groups
compete to woo customers with ever larger and more luxurious premises. In
Kuala Lumpur, retail space is set to double between 1992 and 1997, and in
Singapore to increase by 40 per cent in the three years to 1996.
Steeply rising land prices are adding impetus. Many local entrepreneurs have
made fortunes by building shopping malls on a speculative basis and selling
them to property or retail companies.
These trends are condemning small shops and street markets to a diminishing
share of business. Nestle, the Swiss food group, says sales to supermarkets
grew from 20 per cent to 40 per cent of its total turnover in Malaysia
during the 1980s.
There are signs, though, that in some cities exuberant expansion of
retailing capacity is outstripping even Asian shoppers' propensity to
consume. In Singapore, only one department store, the old-established
Robinson's, reported a profit in the second half of last year. Many industry
observers think a shake-out is imminent.
But fiercer competition is also encouraging further cross-border expansion
by prompting locally owned chains to look abroad for new business. For
instance, Parkson of Malaysia and CK Tang of Singapore, both department
store chains, have recently moved into China.
Until recently, many Asian countries restricted investments by foreign
retailers. These curbs are being relaxed or, in countries such as Indonesia,
increasingly circumvented by new entrants with the apparent approval of the
authorities. China has recently allowed foreign retailers to set up trial
operations in larger cities.
But not every street in Asia is paved with gold. Mr Chris Nelson, head of
Asian operations at Dairy Farm, the Hong Kong-based retailing group, says
the first rule of success is to target selected population groups, not
entire countries.
At first sight, Indonesia, with income per head of less than Dollars 800 a
year, looks unpromising. Yet in Jakarta, the capital, where most of the
spending power is concentrated, there are more people with a higher standard
of living than in Portugal.
Yaohan, which operates 450 diverse retail outlets in 16 mostly Asian
countries, has achieved Dollars 4bn annual sales partly by focusing heavily
on overseas Chinese customers throughout the region. The company, which
moved its headquarters from Japan to Hong Kong four years ago, aims to open
1,000 stores in China by 2010.
The second rule is to find a reliable local partner. In much of Asia, joint
ventures are a legal requirement. But having an ally able to grease the
wheels - and palms - is also essential to get things done in many countries.
Even then, pitfalls await the unwary newcomer. In most of Asia, distribution
methods are primitive and depend, as in Singapore, on small wholesalers and
middlemen, each of whom expects to take a cut.
Efforts to bypass or modernise the system can stir reprisals, not least from
racketeers who often extort cash from distribution. One foreign retailer
recently discovered this to its cost in Taiwan, where an over-zealous store
manager narrowly survived an attack by axe-wielding gangsters.
In much of China, there are no wholesaling networks at all, and poor roads
and scarce warehouse facilities make transportation a logistical nightmare.
'It will take years for supermarkets to reach the whole country,' says Mr
Nelson of Dairy Farm.
As well as keeping costs high, Asian distribution systems give manufacturers
far greater power over retailers than in most western countries. In
Thailand, some manufacturers refuse to supply supermarkets with their most
popular brands unless they stock poorly selling ones as well.
Another widespread problem is the shortage of skilled labour, particularly
of managers. Before opening a big department store in Singapore last year,
Takashimaya of Japan recruited and trained 400 local sales staff. But as
soon as their training was complete, 100 left for jobs elsewhere.
In addition, retailers must adapt their wares to local tastes and demand.
This can be taxing in a region where market research is often rudimentary.
Some local peculiarities are immediately obvious. In Malaysia, where 60 per
cent of the population is Moslem, supermarkets must invest in special
facilities for treating and storing food in accordance with religious
standards. In northern China, consumers are willing to spend more on smart
clothing than in southern provinces, where good food is the top priority.
Other nuances are more subtle. Polarisation of incomes between a small
minority of rich people and a great mass of poor ones can make it hard for
retailers specialising in catering to the middle market to carve out a
niche.
One such retailer, Marks and Spencer, is still striving after several
attempts to make its formula work in Kuala Lumpur. But it has cracked the
problem in Hong Kong where, it says, its Kowloon store is enjoying good
sales growth and making satisfactory profits selling clothing - 80 per cent
of it made in the UK.
Hong Kong, however, is unusual in having almost no import barriers. In other
countries, heavy duties can destroy the advantage of retailers which depend
heavily on selling imported goods. Such trade protection can also inhibit
the development of discount operations.
Mr Colin Buchanan, Marks and Spencer's director of Far East retailing, warns
that overseas expansion involves 'pain and problems'. However, the potential
rewards are so big that retailers seem certain to continue crowding into the
region. As Mr Nelson of Dairy Farm puts it: 'Where else in the world are so
many new consumers entering the market all the time?'

FT  06 APR 94 / Personal View: Rethink of the regulator's role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatised industries representing some 20 per cent of UK gross domestic
product are now subject to regulatory regimes. It is important that they are
well regulated in the interests of customers and to ensure the long-term
health of the industries themselves.
In deciding how this might best be done, we started in typical British
fashion by defining what we didn't want - the US system.
There, each state has its own multi-member regulatory commission that deals
with several businesses - electricity, gas, water etc - setting prices
according to the required rate of return. The method is legalistic but with
opportunity for public participation. Regulatory decisions are frequently
appealed to the courts. In practice, the US system is burdensome, does
little to encourage efficiency, and tends to promote central planning at the
expense of enterprise.
In contrast, the British regulatory system is meant to be light, muscular
and unbureaucratic. The primary duty of the regulator is to promote
competition. For monopolies, price-capping is preferred to rate-of-return
regulation, with price increases restricted to less than the rate of
inflation (RPI-x).
Each industry is regulated separately. A single regulator replaces the
tribunal in the search for a speedy, unbureaucratic process. There are no
public hearings. The regulators work behind closed doors, they do not have
to justify their decisions, and appeals against them are discouraged. The
industry has to acquiesce or accept a full Monopolies and Mergers
Commissions review.
Were we right to depart from the American way? I believe we were -
particularly in the fundamental emphasis the UK places on putting the
creation of competitive markets ahead of the restraint of monopoly.
The evidence of the privatised electricity industry is compelling in that
the creation of a competitive environment with open access to the market has
been instrumental in shaking up management, slicing out costs, and reducing
prices.
Nevertheless, the British regulatory system could learn something from the
Americans. There are six areas where improvements could be made.
First, we need to define more precisely the role of regulation. The founding
statutes give little guidance as to its objectives. Regulators are
instructed to 'promote competition'. But to what extent? For example, are
the regulators there to create a lot of players with predetermined small
market shares, or alternatively to create the market conditions to allow
competition to flourish?
Second, regulators should publish their 'strategic plan' for regulating the
industries under their jurisdiction. Where management of a regulated
business knows its regulator's objectives in some detail, it can plan
accordingly.
Third, the regulatory process should be more open to scrutiny. Currently, it
is not very clear how or why each regulator views evidence, weighs the
arguments, or comes to decisions. Some public hearings are necessary, and
regulators' work would benefit from public examination. Quick appeals
procedures, such as an ad hoc panel of the MMC, would enable the regulator
and regulated to test each other's arguments.
Fourth, replace the single regulator with a tribunal of three or five
members to remove the 'cult of personality' from the discussions between the
regulator and the regulated.
This would discourage newspapers from adopting a 'league-table' approach to
regulation: who has the most brownie points for being the toughest
regulator. More important, it might make the job more do-able, rather than
leaving a single person to regulate large and complex industries. A small
tribunal could bring diversified experience to bear.
Fifth, bring the various regulators together into a common organisation to
enable the quality of support staff to be raised and to transfer experience
between industries. Common issues, such as the cost of capital or the
treatment of external costs like environmental impacts, could be more
readily addressed.
Sixth, much more work needs to be done on the impact that the regulators are
having on the investment, efficiency, and quality of service of the
industries. Are regulators achieving their goals? Are prices lower,
efficiency higher and customers better off than they might otherwise have
been?
It is time to move away from chatter about the personality of the regulators
to concern about what their objectives really should be and the impact they
are having. Simple faith in such tools as RPI-x is not an adequate
regulatory formula.

With Glenys Kinnock preparing for a famous victory in her rock-solid Labour
Euro constituency, husband Neil waits patiently (if only he could do the
same on motorways) to see if he might join her on the gravy train.
With a Labour replacement for Bruce Millan as a European Commissioner due in
January, a decision on his successor will have to be made soon by John
Major. Kinnock's name went forward for the Pounds 140,000 a year job after
the 1992 general election but Major dropped the idea as quickly as 'back to
basics' when his MPs threatened to explode.
John Smith, however, appears intent upon submitting the former Labour
leader's name yet again, though Major is not bound to accept it. If he does,
the prime minister can count on another row, first for having again changed
his European mind and secondly for taunting his Euro-sceptics with the
appointment of a man whose rabid enthusiasm for the European dream bears all
the hallmarks of a late convert.
At least the Tory Eurofanatics should have little to complain about, other
than their conviction that Kinnock is a Johnny-cum-
lately who would be hell-bent on stirring up trouble for the Tories in
Europe. That, of course, remains the prerogative of the Tory party.

Silvio Santos, who, like his Italian namesake, hopes to realise his
political ambitions. Apart from the lack of a football club, the two are
remarkably alike.
The Brazilian version comes from a poor family and has built up one of the
country's newest and most dynamic TV companies, SBT, now second only to
Brazil's mighty Globo in terms of viewer figures. This success owed a great
deal to sensationalist programming, such as investigations of gory murders
and suicides. But Santos remains a star attraction, hosting a marathon
Sunday night game show in which one of his catch phrases is 'Who wants
money?' as he throws Cr5,000 (Dollars 5) bills into the largely female
audience.
Despite Santos' ambitions, and his likely appeal among the country's many
poor, polls show that he is getting less than 5 per cent of voting
intentions for October's presidential elections. If he cannot persuade more
viewers that he is a serious politician as well as a cash dispenser, he may
just have to lower his ambitions and run for Congress instead.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the dear old Midland Bank goes off the rails again, blame the new owners,
HSBC Holdings. Yesterday Midland Bank's new chairman, HSBC chieftain Sir
Willie Purves, and Midland's new chief executive, HSBC's Keith Whitson,
celebrated their first day in office by removing almost the last traces of
the ancien regime and moving more of their own men into positions of power.
Out goes Chris Wathen, Midland's managing director of branch banking and one
of the great white hopes of previous Midland managements, and in comes a new
deputy chief executive Richard Orgill, who used to run HSBC's Australian
operations. Barry Hine, another HSBC man, takes over as head of human
resources, and Bert McPhee, HSBC's group risk controller, takes charge of
Midland's credit and risk. About the only Midland man to gain from the
reshuffle is Chris Thom, the network support director, upgraded to general
manager retail.
The changes must be particularly galling for Wathen, a career Midland
banker, who played a key role in helping Midland get into bed with HSBC.
They will also put an end to any suggestion that Midland 'merged' with HSBC.
It was taken over by an autocratic outfit which is out to prove that it can
run a UK clearing bank better than anybody else. We shall see.

FT  06 APR 94 / Leading Article: Tough for Turks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Tansu Ciller's appointment as Turkey's prime minister in June 1993
appeared to herald a radical policy shift to correct structural flaws in the
country's inflation-prone economy. In fact, by offering no more than
palliatives during her first six months in office, Mrs Ciller greatly
contributed to the economic crisis that erupted with the 12 per cent
devaluation of the lira in January.
Yesterday, after a two-month lira slide and mounting public sector liquidity
problems, Mrs Ciller finally faced reality with an extensive austerity
package. This programme, including tax increases and closures of loss-making
state enterprises, is tougher than expected. Yet it is the minimum necessary
to subdue overheating and calm anxiety among foreign creditors. Turkey plans
to enter a full-scale customs union with the European Union in 1995. If the
country's generally efficient private sector is to hold its own against
European competition, steps to reduce the rampant cost of the Turkish public
sector are ineluctable.
Partly reflecting Mrs Ciller's refusal to take remedial action earlier, she
is exposed to a difficult combination of circumstances. Her room for
economic policy manoeuvre is constrained by the cost of mounting an
internationally-criticised military clampdown against the Kurds. Pushing
through yesterday's programme will prove politically troublesome. Under
strain as a result of the Islamic-based Refah party's gains in last week's
municipal elections, Mrs Ciller is trying to coax the main opposition party
Anap into an alliance with her governing True Path party to back reform and
safeguard Turkey's future as a secular state. Anap has already warned,
however, of 'serious doubts' about the programme.
Even if the measures are implemented, they may have less effect than the
government has suggested in reducing public sector borrowing, which last
year was 16 per cent of gross domestic product. The official forecast for
privatisation receipts appears excessively optimistic, while planned
lay-offs at loss-making state-owned companies will generate extra social
expenditure. Perhaps the biggest immediate economic problem is that the
fresh lira slump set off by yesterday's abandonment of central bank support
intervention will add to inflationary pressures.
If the Turkish authorities are serious about bringing down the 74 per cent
inflation rate, they may have little choice but to engineer a full-scale
recession. That would have large political and social costs in a country
accustomed to high economic growth. Turkey is, however, fast running out of
alternatives.

FT  06 APR 94 / Leading Article: An agenda for tax reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today marks the start of the new tax year in the UK, with attention focused
on the politics of extending value-added tax to domestic fuel and power. But
the VAT rise is only one of a series of tax changes to raise revenue which
comes into effect this year. Fiscal tinkering is back in vogue - and the tax
system is becoming more complicated and less transparent as a result.
One symptom of this is the proliferation of taxes. In the November budget,
Mr Kenneth Clarke introduced new taxes on insurance premiums and air
travellers. These will eventually raise almost Pounds 1.2bn from activities
previously outside the tax net.
It is all sadly reminiscent of the ingenious wheezes to raise revenue
devised by Mr Harold Lever, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the last
Labour government. These expedients were supposed to have been swept away by
the Conservative tax reforms since 1979. When Lord Lawson was chancellor, he
delighted in abolishing taxes such as the investment income surcharge and
the national insurance surcharge. The creation of new taxes is a regrettable
U-turn against simplification.
So, too, is the addition of extra rates of income tax. Chancellor Lawson's
1988 budget replaced the sliding scale of higher rates with a simple
two-tier structure based on a 25 per cent basic rate and a 40 per cent
higher rate. In 1992, chancellor Lamont introduced a third, lower rate of 20
per cent. This has already complicated tax matters, requiring pensioners and
other low-income savers to reclaim some of the tax deducted from their
investment income at the basic rate. Extra tax staff have been needed at the
Inland Revenue to handle the complications.
Last year, the tax credit that comes with share dividends was reduced from
the basic rate of 25 per cent to the 20 per cent lower rate. This saves the
Treasury Pounds 1bn a year without adding to most people's tax bills. But
higher-rate taxpayers now pay an extra Pounds 200m a year, since the
additional tax collected from them has risen from 15 per cent of the gross
dividend income to 20 per cent. The move is a concealed tax increase.
A further consequence has been to make it harder for basic-rate and
higher-rate taxpayers to work out their liability to capital gains tax.
Depending on the mix of dividends and capital gains, the marginal rate on
gains can be 20 per cent, 25 per cent or 40 per cent. Without the expertise
to calculate it, rational investment decisions cannot be made.
Finally, the start of the new tax year brings the restriction to 20 per cent
of the tax relief available on some allowances. Mortgage interest tax relief
and the married couple's allowance are affected, with the rate due to fall
to 15 per cent next year. The gradual reduction in the rate of relief may be
a prelude to the abolition of these allowances (welcome in the case of
mortgage interest relief). But it requires complicated adjustments to the
codes used by employers to operate pay-as-you-earn.
Increasing complexity and loss of transparency are objectionable enough
after a decade in which the tax system became more open. But they undermine
the government's plans to introduce self-assessment for some 8m taxpayers
from 1996-97. This welcome move will encourage the self-employed and
employees with complex tax affairs to calculate their own tax bills. It
should eventually produce significant savings in Inland Revenue costs. But
it cannot work if haphazard complications arise in the tax system.
There are many advantages in a broad-based and simple tax system. Chancellor
Clarke needs to consider what sort of tax system he wishes to create and
devise a strategy to achieve it. Once he has done this, he must then resist
the temptation to tinker.

FT  06 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Speedy and realistic transport policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SARAH LEES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would agree that Philip Robin's proposal (Letters, March 22) to
reduce top speed on the roads to 50mph would have an immediate impact.
Carrying capacity of Britain's roads would be dramatically reduced and would
seize up on many critical stretches.
May I suggest that the quickest way to promote a realistic transportation
policy would be to put all politicians on public transport for a week,
removing all access to private transport and parking privileges.
One might also look at the logic of granting a lifelong driving licence from
the age of 17 which does not include assessment on a motorway. If drivers
were retested annually, an advanced driving licence for motorways and main
arterial roads were required, and the minimum speed limit on such roads were
raised, it could reduce the number of vehicles and increase the carrying
capacity of our present main networks.
The cost to the individual would be insignificant compared to the current
costs of maintaining and running a car. I have been told that annual
retesting of drivers is political suicide, but some may argue that
politicians are replaceable, whereas our countryside and environment are
not.
The environmental impact of increased fuel consumption at the higher average
speeds would be offset by the reduction in consumption idling in traffic
jams on the same journey.

FT  06 APR 94 / A bitter twist to the bar-room tale: Tony Jackson asks if
inefficient pubs, owned by brewers, are increasing the price of British beer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are the British paying too much for their beer? Given that most of the big
brewers are about to announce lower annual brewing profits for the second or
third year running, the question might seem slightly perverse. But consider
the following facts:
In the past decade, the price of a pint of beer in a pub has risen 29 per
cent before tax, duty and inflation. Consumption has fallen 6 per cent. By
contrast, the average real price of a bottle of wine in the UK has fallen 12
per cent and consumption risen by half.
The standard price of bitter in London is now about Pounds 1.80. In some
pubs, a pint can be bought for 85p or less.
The latest available data suggested that Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, had a
fifth of its worldwide sales in the UK but more than half its profit.
Stella Artois, the Belgian lager, is advertised in the UK as 'reassuringly
expensive'. Last summer, the British supermarket chains Tesco and Sainsbury
started importing Stella from France and sold it 25 per cent cheaper than
the UK-produced version.
Though the brewers would contest some of the details, none would deny they
have a problem. The issue is not one of excess profits. It is not even - as
the brewing lobby would argue - the high level of UK duty on beer. It is
more a question of whether the British system of distributing beer through
pubs ' mostly owned by the brewers ' is proving more expensive than drinkers
will bear: and if so, what the brewers can do about it.
Pubs, certainly, are at the heart of the problem. According to one big
brewery chief, the real price he charges for a barrel of beer from his
breweries has been falling steadily for the past 15 years. Throughout that
time, the real price of a pint in his pubs has been rising. His breweries
have become steadily more efficient: but as an economist might put it, his
productivity in services has failed to keep pace with his productivity in
manufacturing.
But if pubs have failed to modernise, supermarkets are another matter. The
real price of canned and bottled beer sold in supermarkets and off-licences
has been falling for many years and consumption has risen accordingly. As a
result, the share of the beer market sold through the off-licence trade has
risen, while the pubs' share has fallen.
Nevertheless, pubs still account for around 75 per cent of the beer drunk in
the UK. In an international context, this remains a high figure. That fact
undermines another argument currently popular with the brewing lobby: that
the price of a pub pint before duty is lower in the UK than in any other
European Union country except Portugal. That is only partly relevant. A
glass of beer in a French or Italian bar is expensive, but does not
represent the typical price of beer in those countries. Draught beer
accounts for only 16 per cent of consumption in Italy and 24 per cent in
France.
The inefficiency of the pub network as a way of distributing beer does much
to account for the high UK profitability of Carlsberg in the 1980s. Beer
prices in pubs are set by the big integrated operators, such as Bass and
Whitbread, which need to cover the cost of their pubs as well as their
breweries. A pure brewing business such as Carlsberg, which owns no pubs,
can charge the same prices and pocket the difference.
Even in the off-licence trade, the case of Stella Artois suggests UK prices
can be excessively high. The UK brewers insist that net of duty, the price
of off-licence beer is the same around Europe. But a number of continental
lagers, such as Kronenbourg and Grolsch, are dearer in the UK.
This is, of course, before taking account of the abnormally high UK duty on
beer. As brewers point out, the British pint in a pub may be second cheapest
in the EU before duty, but is second dearest after it. The UK consumes 21
per cent of beer in the EU, but pays 55 per cent of the duty levied in the
Union. Hence the hordes of transit vans now criss-crossing the Channel for
cheap French beer, a trade which the brewers put at Pounds 500m a year. In
this respect, brewers are at the mercy of the UK Treasury. But the basic
point remains the same: the price of beer is more of an issue for the
British drinker than it has been for decades - hence the price war which has
broken out among British pubs.
As the industry points out, discounting is not a wholly new phenomenon. One
brewing chief says that, at any time in the past 20 years, he could have
visited any town in England and found a pint of beer at half the price being
charged in another establishment down the road. But, he concedes, there is a
difference. In the old days, the cheap pint would have been in the working
men's club or Conservative Association, both of which would have had
charitable or non-profit-making status. Now it is in a rival pub.
Some reasons for this are technical. Since the government acted in 1989 to
loosen the brewing tie, more pubs are free rather than tied houses, and are
thus in a stronger position to negotiate terms with the brewer. Also, as
another brewing chief remarks, in the old days promotional discounts and
'happy hours' were an invitation to the manager to fiddle the books. Now the
brewery can use electronic point-of-sale equipment to keep an eye on him.
There is a more fundamental reason. As Mr Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's chief
executive, argues, the consumer climate of the 1990s is one in which people
are proud to seek out lower prices. The pubs which offer pints of beer at
85p may sell only a tiny proportion of their beer at that price: but it is a
powerful means of getting people through the door.
A striking instance of this is the small London-based pub group, J D
Wetherspoon. Its pubs currently promise a pint of Guinness or Courage
Director's bitter cheaper than the take-home equivalent from Tesco or
Sainsbury. This ought to be commercial suicide; but since Wetherspoon was
floated on the stock market 18 months ago, its share price has more than
doubled, far outstripping the big brewers, or Tesco and Sainsbury for that
matter.
Given the earlier argument about pubs being the root of high beer prices,
this might seem paradoxical. There are two explanations. First, the decline
in beer consumption has left the brewers with manufacturing overcapacity, so
that they are eager to cut their own throats for extra volume.
Second, most of the brewing industry still operates a type of vertical
integration which in most other industries would seem quaint. Manufacturers
of bread, soap or cigarettes would no longer contemplate owning the shops
which sell their products. The fact that UK brewers still do owes much to
the historic and ossifying effect of the brewing tie. In turn, much of the
instability now afflicting the industry results from the process of sorting
out who shall brew the beer and who shall own the pubs.
In the meantime, the reaction of consumers to the high costs of the
integrated system means that the number of pubs is likely to keep on
shrinking - the industry says by a further 10,000 in the next few years from
a total of about 60,000. Those will mostly be the small, uneconomic pubs
which rely wholly on tied business from the brewery, or old-style boozers
selling little other than drink to a male clientele.
To justify the capital tied up in the remainder, the brewers will have to
work their assets harder. Increasingly, the new-style pubs will base much of
their business on offering an afternoon cup of tea, a playroom for the kids
and better food than the local restaurant. Some of them may cease to be
recognisable as pubs in the process. In the end, that may be the only way
the brewers can justify their prices.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW DYKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Trevor Harvey (Letters, March 30) is right to point out the dangers of
current practice in building society governance. Too many societies have
embarked on policies which do little for their members but much to
demonstrate the incompetence of their management.
Slavish adherence to such already outmoded management fashions as delayering
has resulted not only in the appalling standards of service evident in so
many branches of the larger societies but - worse - in a lack of middle
management capable of reacting on the ground to the opportunities that the
fast-changing housing market will present during 1994. This which will mean
that many societies lose market share as they fail to take advantage of the
improving mortgage market.
All this has come about because societies have pursued the cult of
personality to a point where their charismatic but inept chief executives
are able to force muddle-headed policies through weak boards which are, as
Mr Harvey points out, effectively accountable to no one.
There will be tears in the building society world ere long, and those who
have allowed the societies to become unaccountable will largely be
responsible.

FT  06 APR 94 / Identity to cling on to: In a world of dissolving states,
nations matter more than ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the nation-state obsolete? This seemingly academic question is in fact
highly topical. Many of the arguments for regional integration, in north
America as well as in Europe, start from the observation that economic life
can no longer be organised effectively within the borders of a single state.
If citizens are to have any chance of regulating economic behaviour
successfully, they need transnational rules and supra-national institutions
to do it.
Yet the nation-state remains the only form of political authority that most
people can relate to emotively. In recent years some 20 new nation-states
have emerged, as the former multinational states of Yugoslavia and the
Soviet Union broke up. Obviously the people founding these new states, often
at a terrible price in human suffering, do not believe the model is
obsolete.
I have a theory to explain this paradox: the nation-state does still have a
vital role to play in the world, but no longer the same role that it had in
the past.
For 200 years, from the 18th to the mid-20th century, the nation-state was
an engine of modernisation. Around the time of the French Revolution it
became obvious that states could be more successful and powerful if they
mobilised the energies of their subjects by treating them as citizens.
People began to believe that the state was there to serve them, not the
other way round. The state should be the expression of common interests, and
a common identity, shared by all its inhabitants: together they formed the
nation, to which the state belonged.
Clearly this idea has a lot to do with democracy. It also has a lot to do
with mass education, and with various other phenomena which we associate,
rightly or wrongly, with progress and modernity - notably the formation of
an effective, highly-motivated fighting force. In schools and armies and
other mainly state-run institutions people from different parts of a country
got to know and understand each other, to speak and read a generally
intelligible version of their national language instead of local dialects,
to think of themselves as a nation with common interests to defend.
Political parties, trade unions, lobbies: all developed with the main goal
of steering the nation in one direction or another, through control of or
influence over the state. In response, the state intervened in more areas of
life, acquiring control, even ownership, of larger shares of the nation's
wealth.
People who didn't belong to such a nation, or who felt that they belonged to
a nation that lacked its own state, or to a nation whose state did not
include them, seemed to be missing out on modernity and its benefits. They
were easily persuaded to follow nationalist leaders who offered them
membership of a nation-state as the ticket to participation in the modern
world.
Thus for 200 years or so the nation-state was one of the main agents of
modernisation, and modernisation strengthened the nation-state. But sometime
between 1945 and 1980 the nation-state peaked. Modernity became global.
Today all the processes of modernisation cut across state frontiers, and
tend to erode rather than reinforce the state's grip on the lives of its
citizens:
The instantaneous transmission of images and information around the world
has resulted in capital movements of such speed and volume that the notion
of a national economy has become virtually meaningless.
The information revolution has also created a global mass culture, and has
made political debate harder to contain within state frontiers.
Industrialisation has reached a point where it creates environmental
problems that have equally little respect for frontiers.
In the industrial world the state became overloaded. It is no longer able to
fulfil all the demands its citizens make on it without taxing them more. And
it can no longer guarantee employment to unskilled workers at the wages they
expect, given the growing competition from capital-intensive technology at
home and low-cost labour abroad. It has begun to retreat.
In parts of the ex-colonial world - Africa, especially - and now in much of
the ex-communist world as well, statehood has simply failed to deliver the
goods. First it failed economically, by applying controls which stifled free
enterprise, and now it is failing politically too. Even where states still
physically control their national territory, in the sense of eliminating
armed rebellion, they often cannot provide basic social services, or even
the physical security which is their primary raison d'etre.
The more successful members of the human race can now participate directly
in the global economy and culture, through multinationals and other
non-governmental organisations, without needing a nation-state to represent
them; and the less successful find the states which purport to represent and
defend them are increasingly less able to do so in practice.
Even war, which used to be seen as the quintessential monopoly of the state,
has become both sub-national and supra-national.
In this bewildering new world the nation-state is no longer the engine of
modernisation. Instead it has become the 'Jesus rail' - the handle that a
white-knuckled passenger clings onto shouting 'Jesus', as the car he is
travelling in hurtles round a blind corner. The world is hurtling into the
third millennium at terrifying speed, and we all feel the need for something
familiar to hold on to: a community, a group with which we share language,
culture and collective memory; a nation, in fact.

Sir, Jeffrey Sachs (Personal View, March 31) urges, as some of us have for a
long time, that the G7 should get involved more substantively in Russia's
economic transformation. But his article is marred by the errors of analysis
and judgment that led to his policy failure in Russia.
Wildly improbable demands for aid, matching substantial 'shock-therapy'
targets to slash the Russian budget deficit swiftly and sharply (as
announced and attempted in early 1992), have been the hallmark of Sachs's
failed approach. The assertion that only an immediate and huge commitment of
Dollars 28bn will work in Russia is a reflection of that fallacy. A gradual
but firm attack on budget deficits, matched by smaller external support that
is increased as Russian stabilisation efforts are seen to be credible and
gathering momentum, is surely more realistic. Indeed, the greater cohesion
of the Chernomyrdin administration and the prime minister's recent reformist
decisions make this a credible policy scenario.
Sachs chastises the International Monetary Fund for rejecting his view that
only a fixed exchange rate anchor (supported presumably by a huge aid
commitment) would work in stabilising Russia financially. But he fails to
persuade. Despite his contrary assertion, the evidence on the question is
mixed. The IMF is correct in arguing that domestic financial discipline is
the critical problem: fixed exchange rates will not guarantee it and,
combined with indiscipline, will leave Russia hopelessly indebted as the
larger aid sums are dissipated.
Sachs alienated the Chernomyrdin government by politically siding with the
Gaidar-Fyodorov group and attacking Chernomyrdin in the media in fiercely
undiplomatic ways when it was widely assumed that the former group would win
power in the December elections. He has alienated the IMF, whose policies he
has roundly attacked and whose managing director he has called upon to
resign.
He would now like the G7 to impose his inappropriate agenda on Russia. The
G7 can do no better than to say: no thanks.

FT  06 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mitterrand political review betrays
'intellectual laziness'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr ALISTAIR COLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ian Davidson's review of my book, Francois Mitterrand: a study in
political leadership ('English ennui and French polish', March 17), is
misleading and dishonourable. His tone illustrates mauvaise foi and
intellectual laziness.
He reproaches me for not writing a journalistic political biography. I state
in the preface that this is not the objective of the book, which is
primarily aimed at an academic audience. My book attempts to adopt a
different approach which should be criticised on its own terms, not
dismissed out of hand.
Davidson reveals a shaky grasp of French politics and a simplistic
understanding of the events in question. He contends: 'The simple truth is
that the Socialist party factions, which he (Mitterrand) had originally
created to divide and rule the party, automatically turned into feudal
baronies fighting for the succession, once Mitterrand had been re-elected
and was therefore a lame duck.' This is rubbish. Socialist party factions
existed long before Mitterrand had anything to do with the party. Of course
'feudal baronies' disputed control of the PS once the mitterrandiste
coalition began to disintegrate after Mitterrand's re-election. I make this
point in several places.
A second blatant misrepresentation relates to the economic U-turn of March
1983. The objective reader will search in vain for my apparent explanation
of this event as being primarily the cost of the nationalisation programme.
The deficits engendered by the nationalisation programme were one
contributory factor, nothing more, nothing less.
It is clear from the outset that Davidson has read the book in a cursory and
impatient manner and has made no effort to address its arguments. He falsely
contends that a chronological perspective is absent: that is the function of
the first three chapters.

FT  06 APR 94 / Arts: Never mind the broadcast quality - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of new series arriving on television keeps on increasing as the
number of channels grows and, more important, as series get shorter.
Unfortunately, the amount of talent available remains static.
In Britain, television used to rely on gifted people to come up with good
programme ideas - so talent was crucial. American practice is far more
hard-headed as the networks commission material from programme makers and
impose tight quality control. If you do not get a gag a minute into your
situation comedy, then somebody else will: talent - schmalent] You work to a
formula designed to achieve a given rating and if you fail there are plenty
of wannabes behind you.
Although there is still much talented material on British television, more
and more broadcasters seem to be setting off down the American road. Take
the BBC1 series Do The Right Thing, now screened on Saturday nights. We are
told that it is made under licence from Brazil, where the idea of viewers
phoning in to vote on the moral conundrums in a brief soap drama is a huge
success. Whatever its origins, there is no mistaking that the British
version is in several respects a hybrid.
It is like a cross between Blankety Blank and the Ten Commandments.
Presenter Terry Wogan wanders around, joshing (I think that is the word)
with a panel of minor 'celebrities', just as he did on Blankety Blank. But
this time he is asking ethical questions in the hope of getting a funny
answer. This is more or less ensured because the only resident panellist,
Frank Skinner, is a comedian.
At several stages in the filmed vignette the studio audience is invited to
'vote with your feet', taking 'Yes' seats to the left and 'No' seats to the
right. Should the man have an affair with his stepdaughter? Vote with your
feet (and please mill about in the middle or it looks very unexciting).
At the end of the story viewers are urged to phone in and vote. Thus the
show manages to combine all of television's favourite populist forms: soap
opera, quiz, comedy and chat show, with a phone-in thrown in. It is hard to
imagine anything working more assiduously to a formula. Do The Right Thing
reduces moral problems to the level of mindless gags, and if the BBC really
suggests that this is part of the 'Himalayan option' - the high ground of
broadcasting which they claim to be seeking - then heaven preserve us from
the lowlands.
Of course the prescriptive system can work, if by 'work' you mean achieving
a consistent level of entertainment and a given rating. Many formula-based
American series are impressive, from M*A*S*H* and Cheers to Donahue and
Columbo. Nor is creation to a strict precept a guarantee of poor quality in
British television. BBC1's newish Sunday evening comedy Ain't Misbehavin'
takes Peter Davison, who was so good as one of the adulterers in A Very
Peculiar Practice, Nicola Pagett who was so good as one of the adulterers in
A Bit Of A Do, and teams them up as two sides in an adultery parallelogram.
To be precise adultery has not yet been achieved, but that is what the
series is all about, and since the writer is Roy (Last Of The Summer Wine,
Open All Hours) Clarke, the absence of adultery is funnier than its
presence. It would be no great surprise if the wronged partners became the
first to do the deed.
ITV's newish Thursday comedy, Outside Edge, is even more of a known
quantity, having started life as a stage play and then been adapted as a
television drama. Author Richard Harris is now proving that with a little
stretching and augmentation his material - primarily two couples involved in
a scratch cricket team - can make a highly entertaining series. It lacks the
drive and inventiveness of a Fawlty Towers but the characterisation (the
Dervishes played by Robert Daws and Brenda Blethyn: 'Look, love you Miriam,
fair enough? Okay, fine', and the Costellos played by Josie Lawrence and
Timothy Spall: 'Dontcha just love him? I'm gonna give him a right seein' to
when I get him home') is splendidly enjoyable.
The awful fact is that not only does the formula system often produce
entertaining material, but talent, even in people who do have good ideas,
can often go wrong. The series now running on Friday evenings on BBC2, From
A To B: Tales Of Modern Motoring, is made by Nicholas Barker, following his
weird series about domestic taste, Signs Of The Times. There is a formula of
sorts behind both these series, but it is entirely Mr Barker's.
In the motoring programmes we again have striking photography, interviewees
speaking to camera so fluently that they sound rehearsed, conversations
which are as artificial as dialogue in a play, with participants waiting for
one another to stop before they speak, and technically astounding footage.
Goodness knows where some of the camera mountings have been for the in-car
sequences.
The trouble is that with no reporter or even voice-over we have no way of
knowing whether we should take this seriously or - as I suspect - treat it
largely as a piece of tongue-in-cheek fiction.
The most striking example of the non-American approach in the past week,
however, was Curse Of The Firebeetle in the brief Arena Relics series. Here
was a truly individual vision if ever there was one: an account of a man
trying to carry the giant shield of Atahualpa, the sun god, across a
forbidding landscape to Lima, all shot as a pastiche spaghetti western.
The pastiche was superb, with striking compositions of man, man-made object
and landscape that were often better than the originals by Sergio Leone and
Clint Eastwood. If there is an Oscar for location finding this film should
win it hands down; the Bolivian scenes (standing in for Peru) in mountain
and desert were quite astounding. The trouble was that what little story we
got was thin and unlikely, and writer/director Paul Gruebel Lee clearly had
nothing else to say. He was just knocked out by the mise-en-scene.
Successful non-formula programmes by talented people are few and far between
and, as more television channels demand increasing quantities of 'product',
they will seem even fewer and further between. They will, however, continue
to set the standard by which everything else is judged.

FT  06 APR 94 / Arts: Head-banging with the Cholmondeleys' Metalcholica -
Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SOPHIE CONSTANTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lea Anderson's new show for The Cholmondeleys, Metalcholica, features two
customised motorbikes, seven women clad in skin-tight bikers' gear, and a
rock/thrash guitar score that is effervescent fun for about 20 minutes but
soon lapses into terminal, head-banging monotony.
Anderson's choreography - smothered rather than matched or instigated by
Drostan Madden's music (played live) - is the usual Cholmondeleys-styled
amalgam of lumpish pedestrianism, filigree gesture and occasional bursts of
energy harnessed in neat, rhythmic geometry. And here, as in previous works,
Anderson skilfully teases her vocabulary into phrases and patterns based
upon a chosen theme and its associated images.
Metalcholica is fashioned as a road movie in which each Cholmondeley is a
rebel without much of a cause or course, who manages to turn the desire for
freedom, independence and escape into a full-time, dead-end job. Having
taken to the road - metaphorically at least - the women spend much of their
time gently gyrating under dusky, purple skies, and slumping into each
other's arms after a heard but unseen accident on an imaginary highway.
As one of the two women in possession of a bike, Gaynor Coward discovers
that hers needs fixing. So, after much pedal-pumping, she retires to a
downstage corner to dismantle (and, more impressively, reassemble) the Honda
 -an operation which takes up most of the evening. At intervals, Coward
downs tools and joins her road-mates in bilious pursuit of a fancy free
existence.
Assisted by Anthony Bowne's lighting and Sandy Powell's costumes, Anderson
conjours up scenes of lonely fantasy and misadventure in the barren, open
spaces of the wild west. Mute impersonations of rock stars (generic rather
than particular) offer the cast further opportunities to throw on shades,
peaked caps and the obligatory fringed, studded leather jackets. That
Metalcholica is peppered with fragments of Anderson's earlier creations -
the scuttling figures of Fish Wreck, the crawling insects of Flesh And
Blood, the truncated mapping of faces and bodies in No Joy, and the hints of
alchemy from Precious - comes as no surprise. For the show marks the
Cholmondeleys' 10th anniversary and, as you might expect, Anderson has
chosen to celebrate the decade by encapsulating what she has learnt and
developed.
Ironically, the Cholmondeleys' line-up includes three new recruits -
Ragnhild Olsen, Angelique Wilkie and Michelle Levi - making their debuts in
Metalcholica. Unlike the original members - Anderson, Teresa Barker and
Gaynor Coward - Olsen, Wilkie and Levi have not been part of the
Cholmondeleys' history and have not yet absorbed the quirks of Anderson's
choreography. But the more expansive quality of their movement adds a new
and vital interest to the natural introversion of the Cholmondeleys' style.
Olsen and Levi, tall and long-limbed like Alexandra Reynolds (who joined the
company in 1989), also provide a physical contrast to the three shorter,
more compact women. And although they seem to drag their heels against the
speed of Anderson's more tortuous arrangements, they illustrate the kind of
upper body stretch which, previously, only Teresa Barker could make visible.
As the Cholmondeleys grow older, their need for change and transformation
becomes increasingly urgent; we know who they are and what they do, and it
is all too familiar now. In Metalcholica, Anderson makes sure they die
young, but what good is that if we have not yet seen them live fast?
The Place Theatre until April 9, then touring.

Television's obsession with race continues to grow, and to elbow out other,
arguably more important, matters from the schedules. Timewatch, our only
regular history programme, is devoted entirely to the matter of Britain's
policy on black immigrants in the 1950s. It seems that in 1954 Winston
Churchill said that this was 'the most important question facing the
cabinet' but that he could not get his ministers to take notice. Meaning,
presumably, that they did not share his view (8.10 BBC2).
Dispatches reports from Africa. Guess which country? How did you know?
Because elsewhere in that vast continent it is more difficult to work on the
assumption that brown-against-brown tribal conflict is the fault of whites?
Maybe.
This programme is about the miraculous revival of Winnie Mandela (9.00 C4).
BBC2's Screen Two drama, Dirtysomething (geddit?) is about Dog and Becca,
hippies who meet at the Glastonbury Festival, then settle into a squat and
face the prospect of becoming yuppies . . . well, of losing their New Age
ideals, anyway (9.00 BBC2).

FT  06 APR 94 / Arts: Lazarev's bold strokes - Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Barbican has played host to the BBC Symphony and to Alexander Lazarev,
their 'principal guest conductor' since 1992 (and Bolshoy director since
1987), twice in the last fortnight. Some of us are just now realising what
an excellent choice the BBC has made. The orchestra itself sounds fully
persuaded, for it was on strong, distinguished form for both concerts:
acutely sensitive to Lazarev's overall intentions, grateful to take
expressive advantage of the breathing-space he makes for solo voices.
This second Lazarev concert repeated the format exactly; only the actual
music was different. Instead of a symphony by an obscure Georgian in late
middle-age, he introduced one by an obscure 74-year-old Muscovite; instead
of Shostakovich's precocious First, we had his stark, sombre Sixth; and the
virtuoso concerto this time was Prokofiev's no. 2 for violin. The proud
soloist was Dmitri Sitkovetsky, forceful but perfectly soigne as is his
wont.
The conductor's big test came at last with Shostakovich's fraught Sixth
(1939). But it was scarcely a 'test'. Lazarev established his musical
authority in it at once, so one just sat back to appreciate how he would
develop it. Severely contrapuntal, mostly dark despite some all-out shrieks,
the Sixth is no easy showpiece. Organising its broad paragraphs and the
troubled longer argument that contains them is work for a musician rather
than a showman. Lazarev set about it with urgent, expert sympathy and
unforced purpose, and the result left a deep impression.
In a few places Shostakovich's score rises to desperate screams. Each time,
Lazarev had made us feel the relentless musical pressures that justify them
 -but he rushed nothing, allowing the music to accumulate its own anxious
weight. The BBCSO played superbly, from piccolo (much favoured here) and
first flute down to the impeccably alert timpanist. The ensemble-writing was
as pointed and telling as a good chamber team could boast. Was that due to
extra rehearsal time, or a special Lazarev knack?
As for Nikolay Karetnikov's Symphony no. 4, Lazarev was (shall we say) nice
with it. In 1963 it must have been a brave, defiantly unacceptable Soviet
essay in Schoenbergian writing. Now its expressive convolutions sound honest
and plain, never unmusical, but sedulously beholden to the Viennese master -
too much like an earnest, belated homage to an ideal that had already been
taken much further and more fluently by Western sparks.
Karetnikov is a long-respected composer of Soviet film music (like Sofia
Gubaidulina), with a keen dramatic ear. This performance made me want to
hear more of his earlier 'acceptable' music, and his most recent pieces -
but I suspect that his transitional work should remain decently hidden away,
like anybody else's private crises.

FT  06 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: In pursuit of the
effluent-free mill - Worldwide Waste - A look at the pressures forcing the
Nordic pulp and paper sector to clean up its act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Korsnas pulp mill at Gavle on the Swedish east coast, they boast that
the problem of industrial waste has almost been solved. A dramatic cut in
effluents into the surrounding bay has brought fish back and means the water
is 'virtually unaffected' according to Bengt Nordin, Korsnas'
vice-president. 'We have a good answer to pollution questions; we can
improve a bit but the basic job has been done,' he says.
Across the Gulf of Bothnia, in Finland, the newly-reconstructed Enocell mill
of the Enso-Gutzeit group has cut discharges of chlorinated organic
compounds to just 90 grams per tonne of pulp produced, compared with 1.25kg
in 1990 and a Nordic average of 6kg in 1985.
Successes like these have encouraged executives in the Nordic pulp and paper
sector to suggest that 'the totally effluent-free' mill will soon be a
reality. Such a mill would not only recycle the water it uses, it would also
use much less water than is consumed today.
Waste has been a more contentious issue for Nordic pulp and paper companies
than for other industries in the region because of the sector's huge
consumption of water, the destructive impact of some bleaching processes on
the environment, and the economic importance of forestry to Sweden and
Finland where it is the single biggest net earner of foreign currency.
Worries about disturbing the delicate eco-balance of the Nordic lake systems
and fears of aggravating the problems of the heavily polluted Baltic Sea
have only added to the pressures.
According to Nils Jirvall, director of environmental protection at the
Swedish Pulp and Paper Association, Nordic mills have been driven to clean
up their act by the twin forces of consumer pressure and legislation.
German-speaking areas in Europe have sought tighter environmental standards
in the pulp and paper industry, and driven the trend towards 'totally
chlorine-free' bleaching. Export-dependent Nordic forestry cannot afford to
turn a deaf ear to their calls.
As a result, most Nordic pulp mills not only meet legislative requirements
but exceed them. In Sweden, for example, average emissions of chlorinated
organic compounds are 0.5kg per tonne of pulp produced, compared with the
1.5kg level prescribed by the authorities. Regulation is tough and has been
tightened progressively to take account of technological developments.
In Finland, chlorine consumption has dropped from more than 60kg per tonne
of bleached pulp in 1980 to less than 10kg last year. Over the same period,
sulphur dioxide emissions to the air have fallen from 104,000 tonnes to
14,600 tonnes. 'Average emissions are between 7 and 10 times lower today
than they were in the early 1980s,' says Pertti Laine, director of
industrial and environmental policy at the Finnish Forest Industries
Federation.
The improvements have been achieved despite big increases in total pulp
production. The emphasis has been on changing the internal mill processes,
rather than enhancing the treatment of effluent. One big improvement has
been to extend the pulp cooking stage, so that more of the discolouring
resin, lignine, is removed prior to bleaching. Another has been to use
chlorine dioxide instead of chlorine gas in the bleaching process. Some
mills have even gone a stage further, using hydrogen peroxide, enzymes and
ozone to produce chlorine-free pulp.
The cost has been considerable. The Swedish pulp and paper association
calculates that Swedish forestry groups have spent SKr20bn (Pounds 1.7bn)
since 1971 on environmental protection. In Finland, environment-related
investments are costing forestry groups between FM700m (Pounds 86m) and
FM800m a year. Enso-Gutzeit alone spent FM400m on environmental measures
during the FM2.5bn reconstruction of its Enocell mill.
The danger is that such big outlays will damage Nordic competitiveness
during the current market recession at a time when rival pulp and paper
producers in North America, Brazil and Indonesia are not investing as much
on environmental protection. But, Jirvall says, 'even if they don't have the
legislation in Brazil and Indonesia, they still have to act on the market'.
The success of the Nordic mills in cutting pollution has helped to shift the
environmental debate towards forest management and recycling. But many
executives believe emissions can be cut further. It is no longer a question
of whether the technology is available, but whether mills can afford to
install it.
The key is the removal of chlorine. Once this highly corrosive substance is
eliminated from the bleaching process, it is much easier for mills to
enclose their water systems and discharge no liquid effluent. This 'closed
cycle' concept has been embraced by the designers of a planned FM3bn pulp
mill at Rauma in western Finland whose backers say that when starting from
scratch, the capital and operating costs associated with the latest
technology are no higher than with conventional processes.

FT  06 APR 94 / Management: Policy codifies power for non-executives -
Martin Dickson considers General Motors' new guidelines on the role of its
board of directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been variously hailed as a 'Magna Carta for US directors', a 'very
important corporate governance document', and a 'very commendable example'.
The subject of all this praise is a new, six-page document issued by General
Motors after several months of hard thought and years of bitter experience.
It lays down the company's guidelines on the role and composition of its
board of directors.
The chief message is that power should be vested primarily in the board's
non-executive directors, rather than the group's chief executive.
The guidelines thus institutionalise the dramatic changes at GM in 1992,
when the board's non-executive directors ousted the then chief executive,
Robert Stempel, and replaced him with Jack Smith. Stempel's position as
chairman was filled by John Smale, the non-executive director who had led
this boardroom revolt.
It was a remarkable change for GM. Throughout the 1980s the board had been
dominated by Roger Smith, who combined the roles of chairman and chief
executive. Ross Perot, a one-time board member, likened other members to
'pet rocks' because of what he saw as their passivity.
Many other US companies, prodded by shareholder unrest, have made outside
directors more independent of management, though chief executives still
wield great power in some groups.
The significance of GM's guidelines is that the company is one of the first
US businesses to codify this power shift, with clear policies on the role of
the board.
The document covers 28 issues and on many of them GM follows policies which
institutional shareholder activists lobbying for better corporate governance
regard as good practice.
It says the board should consist of a majority of non-executives - GM's
company by-laws insist on this - and that they should make the decisions on
matters of corporate governance. But one of the main problems which often
face outside directors in challenging chief executives is a lack of
leadership. GM solves this by having the non-executives select a 'lead
director' to chair at least three of the special meetings a year of outside
directors.
When an outside director becomes chairman at GM - as in the case of Smale -
the chairman is the 'lead director'.
However, GM does not have a firm policy on whether the roles of chairman and
chief executive should be split (though many corporate governance activists
insist they should). The board, it says, 'should be free to make this choice
any way that seems best for the company at a given point in time'.
The guidelines also say all directors should have 'complete access' to GM's
management, rather than routing inquiries through the chief executive, and
the board should receive in writing information 'important to its
understanding of the business' in advance of its meetings.
'As a general rule, presentations on specific subjects should be sent to the
board members in advance, so that board meeting times may be conserved and
discussion time focused on questions that the board has about the material.'
The board should be responsible 'in fact as well as procedure', for
selecting its own members (rather than leaving this to a chief executive,
who might fill positions with his friends).
GM has also established a committee of director affairs, which is
responsible for assigning board members to its various other committees
(such as audit, public policy and compensation). It must also report
annually on the board's performance, and review areas of the business where
it could make a better contribution.
Once a year the outside directors must evaluate collectively the performance
of the chief executive, and their opinion will help the board's compensation
committee set pay for the position. The chief executive must report to the
board annually on succession planning and management development.
The guidelines specify no fixed-term limits for being a director - which
some shareholder activists demand - on the grounds that this would reduce
their contributions and their experience in the job which gives them
particular insights into the company. Instead, the committee of director
affairs will review each director's position on the board every five years.
The guidelines also avoid a ruling on whether former chief executives should
be allowed to remain on the board, saying that this is a matter to be
decided in each individual instance.
That may disappoint some shareholder activists, though most will find much
else to cheer about in the GM code.

FT  06 APR 94 / Management: An option on perks - A look at the increasing
popularity of flexible remuneration schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since the 1981 UK Budget introduced the first of a series of
progressively neutralising taxes on fringe benefits, the company 'perk' has
gradually been losing its lustre. Now, however, a new way of dealing with
benefits is charging on to the corporate scene demanding attention from
personnel teams.
It goes by different names in different countries. Americans refer to
flexible benefits, Australians call it packaged compensation and in Britain
it has been described as a cafeteria perk. Whatever the language, it refers
to the optional bits that can be woven around a basic salary.
A report entitled International Flexible Remuneration, published by William
M Mercer Companies, the international firm of actuaries and consultants,
says that employers around the world are waking up to what until recently
has been an exclusively US practice.
Some 60 per cent of US companies have adopted flexible remuneration in one
way or another. Such benefits can be distinguished from what might be
otherwise described as perks by their optional nature. They are substitutes
for pay and therefore must be calculated within an overall compensation
package.
In the US where they have become common, mainly because of tax exemptions,
they would typically comprise various forms of life and accident insurance,
medical and dental care and care for children or elderly parents.
Their attraction is in providing employees with a degree of choice over the
direction of their pay. Even though there are no tax advantages in Britain,
flexible benefits are beginning to attract interest from employers who
believe they may be useful for the recruitment and retention of employees.
Promoters argue that flexible remuneration arrangements are useful for
multinational companies looking for ways to manage expatriate costs. Another
argument is that companies can rid themselves of the perks-driven mentality
of employees who come to expect certain entitlements as a right.
The benefit for employees is that they can concentrate on channeling their
pay into areas which they consider important with the employer providing
some recognition and often administrative help with special needs.
There is also a cost benefit according to Ginny Olds, head of Mercer's
flexible benefits practice in the UK. She said: 'If people simply take a
flat salary they cannot hope to reproduce the same benefits individually
that can be obtained by their organisation which can get a group discount
rate a lot cheaper than the individual could.'
Originally in the US it took soaring health care costs for companies to take
flexible remuneration seriously. Companies gave employees so-called pre-tax
'flex credits' which they could use to pay for health benefits.
One of the first companies in the UK to introduce flexible benefits was the
retailer BHS in 1990 when David Dworkin, the US-schooled department store
specialist, was brought in as chief executive.
Out of his US management baggage he plucked what were at the time
comparatively unfamiliar ideas on flexible remuneration to give his top
management more scope over the composition of their pay and benefits. What
started with a scheme for 50 managers spread in April last year to all 400
managers who have company cars.
An example of how it works at BHS can be seen from the way a typical package
has been arranged for a manager earning Pounds 35,000. The cash value of his
benefits is Pounds 8,115. With this he can choose between one and three
times his salary level in life assurance cover, from four levels of private
medical care and from four levels of annual holiday entitlement between 22
and 30 days. There is also free selection of a company car. In addition,
there is the opportunity to buy long-term disability insurance, an optical
cover plan which subsidises contact lens purchases and eye tests, and a
dental care plan.
Contractually he is entitled to the equivalent of 25 days' holiday, life
assurance worth three times his salary, single cover health care and a
Pounds 300 a month company car. If he wants more than that he can pay extra,
deducted from his salary. If he wants less he can bump up his basic salary
to the equivalent value, less the cost of holiday time. The only benefit the
company insists that managers take is the minimum level of holiday.
Sue Matthews, BHS's human resources manager, said the packages had proved
popular. She said: 'It's a fairly progressive recruitment tool. To be
honest, people love it.'
At Scottish and Newcastle, the brewing company, a scheme was installed 18
months ago and tried initially among 70 or 80 employees with plans to extend
it down through all 2,000 managers who have company cars. The scheme would
allow an executive, earning say Pounds 50,000, to boost his salary to Pounds
60,000 a year by opting out of all benefits or to earn as little as Pounds
37,500 if he were to buy the optimum cover.
The Scottish and Newcastle package covers 10 separate benefits, including
the company product, allowing individuals to take wines and spirits as a
flexible benefit.
Both companies have steered clear of introducing flexible packages
throughout their workforces, mainly because lower down the ladder there are
fewer benefits, such as company cars, to play with.
Mercury Communications, however, proposes to introduce flexible remuneration
for its entire 10,000 UK workforce next January after it is tried on 400
employees starting this month.
'None of what we are doing involves expanding benefits. It is simply giving
people more choice,' said Russ Watling, employee benefits manager.
He said the company had decided that to tailor benefits to individual needs
was the best way of spreading benefit costs. Retaining and recruiting staff
was another positive aspect of the scheme.
Some companies said they had consulted the Inland Revenue about the schemes
but the Revenue itself said such schemes did not require overall approval.
Tax would be paid on benefits in the normal way, it said. The Revenue
appears reasonably ambivalent about the plans at present and has no plans to
tax, say, the savings that can be achieved through a corporate rate as a
benefit in kind.
Matthews cautioned companies about getting too heavily involved in
administration, particularly in the choice of company cars, but said her own
company's scheme was capable of being administered by a single employee.
Its use for negotiating between managements and unions remains largely
unexplored, nor is it clear whether it will be a help or a hinderence to
companies seeking to move towards harmonising pay and conditions among their
workforce. Its popularity in the US, at least, means that the flexible
benefit in remuneration can no longer be ignored.

FT  06 APR 94 / Business and the Environment: Conservation conflict - A look
at the issues behind Richard Leakey's stormy exit from the Kenya Wildlife
Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It takes an unconventional man to rescue a nation's wildlife from the
clutches of ivory poachers, smuggling syndicates and real estate barons. But
last month, Richard Leakey broke with all convention by doing something
unheard of in Africa. He resigned from a government post on a point of
principle, and he did so publicly, challenging the wisdom of new
presidential directives on wildlife management in Kenya.
Leakey's stormy exit from the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) dismayed
conservationists at home and abroad. It has also shaken the Kenyan
establishment, which had been trying to project a cleaner international
image after the corruption scandals of recent years.
To foreign donors, Leakey represented the new face of public service in
Kenya. He was a man who had taken over a corrupt and dispirited government
department in 1989 and transformed it into a dynamic entity, with the
freedom to cut through red tape and resist political interference. Leakey
sacked 1,640 staff, re-introduced a shoot-to-kill policy against game
poachers, and campaigned for an international ban on ivory.
Pictures of President Daniel arap Moi setting fire to pyres of captured
elephant tusks broadcast to the world Kenya's renewed commitment to the
protection of wild animals. Leakey believed Kenya's rich wildlife, which
underpins a tourist industry worth Dollars 450m (Pounds 308m) a year, could
be managed in a profitable and sustainable manner. Donors, including the
World Bank and Britain's Overseas Development Agency, backed his plans by
pledging Dollars 300m for KWS projects over the next 10 years.
Leakey's acrimonious departure has left Moi's government with a public
relations disaster. Noah Katana Ngala, the tourism and wildlife minister,
called Leakey's resignation a 'criminal act by a senior civil servant'.
Donors must unravel a knottier issue: they must decide whether the funds
pledged for conservation are safe from political predators. The omens are
not good. Over the past four years, Leakey says, he withstood the attempts
of 'land-grabbing' politicians to appropriate chunks of Kenya's wildlife
sanctuaries to develop hotels or mining concessions. He believes their
failure led to a smear campaign.
In January, Leakey stood accused of racism, arrogance and corruption, and he
faced a secret government probe into the workings of KWS. He left his post
in January, was recalled by the president in March, and resigned again two
weeks later, saying the government had placed impossible restrictions on the
director's job. He cited only two of the new directives. Armed rangers of
KWS anti-poaching units were to be placed under the authority of the
Commissioner of Police. 'I foresaw problems,' Leakey says. 'If you have two
units carrying arms, patrolling an area the size of Northern Ireland, who is
the boss?'
Leakey also says he was ordered to spend 75 per cent of KWS resources
outside national parks, on the novel reasoning that three-quarters of
Kenya's animals live outside protected areas. 'Our aim was to manage
wildlife in key tourist destinations because tourism is the biggest foreign
exchange earner in Kenya,' he says. Leakey concluded that the KWS dream of a
'self-financing, efficient, and effective, publicly owned, but independent
conservation authority' was not viable under the new directives.
However, Hilary Ng'weno, chairman of the KWS board of trustees, insists
there has been no change in KWS policy. He says the board is discussing the
recommendations of the government's probe committee - more than 100 of them
 -not all of which might prove feasible.
Ng'weno does not appear to lament Leakey's departure. The chairman
conspicuously failed to come to Leakey's defence when he was under attack
for racism and indifference to the needs of communities bordering game
reserves. 'If one man wants to take credit for everything KWS does, he
should be prepared to take the blame for its failures,' Ng'weno says.
The rift between the two men appears to have become deeper after an air
crash in September which cost Leakey both his legs. Ng'weno says the board
played a more active role during Leakey's convalescence abroad. They were
unhappy with the high salaries of certain senior managers, who nevertheless
appeared unable to act without their mentor. 'Leakey's stewardship was
faulty in that it didn't distinguish the captain from the ship,' Ng'weno
says.
Yet this fusion of identity worked to the government's advantage while
Leakey was fund-raising abroad. With Dollars 300m pledged towards
conservation in Kenya, it appears that Leakey had outlived his use. Like
others before him, he was discarded by Moi. The World Bank, which had
earmarked Dollars 60m for wildlife management in Kenya, is concerned about
the upheaval at KWS. 'We felt the projects were progressing well under
Leakey's stewardship,' says Agi Kiss, a World Bank official.
It is, however, difficult for donors to side openly with Leakey, a white
Kenyan with 25 years of public service, without incurring charges of
favouritism or racial bias. Kenyans are sensitive to statements that might
imply that black Africans are more susceptible to corruption or ineptitude
than whites. Leakey's successor, however, is a white Kenyan. David Western
has solid credentials in the field of conservation and is reported to be on
good terms with William ole Ntimama, the minister for local government who
led the attacks against Leakey.
Conservation will be the least of Western's worries at KWS. New policies are
needed to curb the growing conflict between people living and farming near
sanctuary areas and the wildlife - a need Leakey admits he was slow to
address. Local councils, starved of central government funds and short of
patronage, are also eager to wrestle game park revenues from KWS - gate fees
alone earn Dollars 1m a month.
Western, who inherits an army of game wardens, vehicles and surveillance
aircraft, will have to avoid the charges of empire-building that hounded his
predecessor from office. 'Will the new director be able to resist the
political pressures on KWS?' asks Leakey. He wishes him luck.

FT  06 APR 94 / People: David Kendall to chair Meyer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meyer International, the building products group which owns the Jewson chain
of builders' merchants, has filled the vacancy created by Richard Jewson's
decision to step down as chairman at the end of last year.
David Kendall, a former chief executive of BP Oil between 1985 and 1988 and
chairman of Bunzl until September last year, was yesterday named as Meyer's
non-executive chairman.
Kendall, 58, will take up his new post from the start of next month. He
currently holds a number of non-executive directorships, including the
chairmanships of Ruberoid and Whitecroft.
His appointment follows a board decision last year to split the roles of
chairman and chief executive at Meyer, in line with the Cadbury committee
recommendations. That decision led Richard Jewson to announce in September
that he was stepping down as chairman and chief executive from the end of
December.
At the time Jewson, who became chairman in 1991, explained that while he did
not disagree with his board's decision to divide the two roles, he did not
want to become a non-executive chairman, having worked 'hands-on', nor did
he wish to go back to being chief executive, his earlier post.
Jewson was succeeded as chief executive by John Dobby, managing director
since October 1991. Yesterday Dobby said the board, which already includes
three non-executive directors, had been able 'to take its time' to appoint a
new chairman and was 'delighted' to have found David Kendall.
Donald Ford, 63, announced his retirement as a non-executive director
following six years on the Meyer board and will be replaced in due course.

medical equipment manufacturer, as he will reach the company's retirement
age of 65 in June. But he will be staying on as a fairly active chairman,
assisting Peter Chambre, 38, the newly-appointed chief executive.
King says the company looked at a number of candidates to replace him, using
the services of headhunter Norman Broadbent, but that Chambre 'was the
unanimous choice of the board. There comes a time when it's appropriate to
take more of a back seat.
'We have some current problems, particularly in the US, so we needed someone
who will make sure the business is looked after well,' says King. Last
December the company announced first-half profits down by 43 per cent at
Pounds 2.88m, thanks largely to uncertainty in the US healthcare market.
Bespak relies on one US company, US Surgical Corporation, for 23 per cent of
its sales.
Chambre started his career in sales with Cadbury Schweppes, spending two
years there before moving on to a five-year stint in various brand
management roles with Unilever. He worked for Bain &amp; Co for a further five
years, then on to Cope Allman Packaging and, most recently, with Caradon.

FT  06 APR 94 / People: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To Rudolph Agnew falls the job of leading Lasmo back from the wilderness.
The struggling oil company, which recently passed its dividend, yesterday
named Agnew to succeed Lord Rees who steps down as chairman next month.
Agnew is an experienced boardroom hand, of course. As chairman of
Consolidated Gold Fields, he fought off the 1988 takeover bid by Minorco,
only to agree a sale to Hanson, on whose board he subsequently sat. He has
held several other chairmanships including Stena Line and TVS, and is
non-executive director of numerous other companies, among them Newmont
Mining and Standard Chartered.
His mining experience has taught him that 'there's no future in predicting
the commodity price. You've got to get down to being a low-cost producer of
whatever you produce.' As for the oil price, 'you must assume that it's
going to be low,' he said yesterday.

FT  06 APR 94 / Recruitment: HRM: big hat but no cattle?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE FERNIE and DAVID METCALF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Human resource management (HRM) has been the buzz-phrase in personnel in the
past decade. All the management journals are awash with words such as
'commitment', 'employee involvement', 'profit sharing', and 'merit pay'.
Unfortunately, virtually no HRM professionals, and few outsiders, have stood
back and asked what all this activity has achieved. Our research shows that
the description of personnel specialists as having 'big hat, no cattle' -
lots of pretensions but few results - is absolutely right.
Fortunately a survey covering over 2,000 workplaces has recently become
available for analysis. This nationally representative survey - the
Workplace Industrial Relations Survey - contains detailed information on
companies using the new and the old style industrial relations. We have used
the survey to see whether or not HRM practices and new industrial relations
deliver better management-employee relations than their more traditional
counterparts.
Managers responsible for personnel matters were asked to rate
management-employee relations on a seven-point scale, ranging from very good
to very poor. Six different aspects of HRM were analysed - the role of the
personnel manager, industrial relations procedures, payment systems, work
flexibility, employee involvement and the status of the workforce. The
results will be bitterly disappointing to HRM enthusiasts. Almost none of
their techniques appear to improve management-employee relations.
Perhaps the most stunning findings concern the role of the personnel
specialists and directors themselves. One-fifth of workplaces have a
personnel specialist. Those workplaces have much worse relations between
management and labour than those without. One objection to this finding is
that the arrow of causation goes the other way: that workplaces with a poor
climate might need the specialist personnel managers. We investigated this
possible explanation but it was not supported by the evidence.
Systems which link pay to performance of either the individual worker or the
individual company have grown in leaps and bounds in the past few years.
These pay systems are an integral part of HRM - promoting the individual
interest over the collective. Now a quarter of all workplaces have job
evaluation schemes and merit pay. And half have some form of profit sharing
or employee share ownership scheme. Yet not a single one of these systems
appears to improve the climate of employee-management relations.
HRM also emphasises the importance of a multi-skilled, flexible labour
force. Yet where management has attempted to reduce demarcation and promote
new work patterns the climate is worse than where no such attempts were
made. This hardly suggests high quality personnel management.
Employee involvement and commitment are supposed to be improved by providing
workers with a voice. Yet neither the existence of joint consultative
committees nor performance appraisals, which should provide a good feedback
between management and workers, improves the climate.
Climate is improved where work teams meet at least once a month to discuss
their performance in problem-solving groups such as 'quality circles'. By
contrast, mere team briefing meetings or simply cascading information down
the hierarchy results in a worse climate. It is clear that proper
communication has to be a two-way process.
HRM workplaces are more likely to treat their manual and non-manual
employees in a similar fashion - the 'single status' policy. We studied
seven different aspects of such policies covering, for example, pay,
clocking-on, the availability of free or subsidised meals and pensions. On
all but one of these indicators of single status companies which practised
them had a worse climate of industrial relations than those that did not.
We also studied how union strength and structure influences relations
between management and labour. A weak union is the worst of all worlds.
Workplaces with strong unions and those without unions both have better
relations than workplaces where management simply recognises the union for
collective bargaining.
The results of our research suggest that it is time for the HRM
professionals to evaluate what they have achieved. The question needs to be
asked why employee involvement, 'single status' policies, new systems
linking pay to individual performance and - in particular - the
specialisation of the personnel function have failed to deliver better
management-employee relations.

FT  06 APR 94 / Last deep coal pit in S Wales faces axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Miners at Tower colliery, the last British Coal deep mine in south Wales,
expect to be told of the pit's proposed closure today after the corporation
yesterday expressed 'serious concern' about its future.
The corporation also warned industrial employees throughout the country that
existing redundancy terms expire at the end of this month and that new
arrangements are likely to be less generous.
Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal employee relations director, said it would seek
to give a measure of protection against redundancy, but it would have to
assess what is 'sustainable and affordable taking into account the likely
reduced need for redundancy and the government's privatisation plans'.
British Coal's pre-privatisation programme is close to completion. Of the 18
remaining pits, including Asfordby in Leicestershire which is due to open
next year, only two to four are likely to close.
The corporation said at a review meeting yesterday that recent plans for
viable production at Tower, near Aberdare, were high-risk because of poor
geology and falling demand for coal of the pit's quality.
Unsold stocks of coal at the pit have almost doubled in the past year to
more than 400,000 tonnes.
The 200 miners at Tower will learn today whether the corporation wants their
colliery to be among the closures.
Mr Tyrone O'Sullivan, NUM mining union branch secretary, said he expected
the corporation to announce the pit's closure at a meeting with the union
this afternoon.
He expected miners would vote to fight the closure by taking their case for
it remaining open through the industry's review procedure.
Yet miners throughout the country have voted to accept closures in recent
months. The ending of the enhanced redundancy scheme increases the pressure
on Tower's workers to accept closure.
The redundancy terms, which will end on April 30, were introduced in 1990
and have since been extended and improved several times. Miners with a
maximum of 30 years' service have been eligible for payments of up to Pounds
44,000.
These arrangements are funded largely by the government, which has been keen
to minimise criticism resulting from the sharp contraction of the industry.
More than 30 pits have closed in the past 18 months.
South Wales was for much of this century one of the main UK centres for
coalmining. At the end of the 1984-85 miners' strike there were 28
collieries in the region.
Earlier this year the north-east of England, another former heartland of the
industry, also lost its last deep mine when Ellington colliery in
Northumberland closed.

Job vacancies are rising faster than official figures suggest, increasing 27

Personnel Services, the employment agency group.
Reed says vacancies rose 15 per cent in January compared with January last

Demand for office and secretarial staff began to rise earlier than demand
for professional staff such as accountants. But recently demand for
qualified accountants has risen steeply.

More than 12,000 companies were formed in Great Britain in March, the
highest monthly total since 1990. Figures from Jordans, the Bristol-based
information company, show that 12,638 companies were formed last month, a
6.4 per cent increase on March 1993.
March is traditionally a strong month for creation of companies because it
coincides with the end of the tax year. However, Jordans' figures show a
consistent growth trend. Company formations in the six months to March were
59,705 compared with 56,669 in the same period a year earlier, a 5.4 per
cent increase.

The number of business failures has risen for the second month running,
reversing the trend of the past two years, says accountancy firm Touche
Ross.
Mr Ralph Preece, a Touche Ross corporate recovery specialist, said: 'We are
unlikely to see the widely expected fall in receiverships unless there is a
resurgence in economic confidence.'
The analysis of figures from the London and Edinburgh Gazettes shows there
were 262 receivership and administration appointments last month, a 5 per
cent increase on February's 248. The January figure was 163. However, the
year-on-year comparison still showed a fall from the 407 appointments in

FT  06 APR 94 / Lettuce imports threaten growers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Pounds 160m market in glasshouse production of lettuces and
tomatoes is under threat because of the European single market, say growers.
Southern European countries such as Spain have been increasingly turning
their attention to high-priced northern markets, making it difficult for
northern producers reliant on energy-consuming greenhouses to compete.
Spanish shipments of iceberg lettuce to Britain are expected to rise by
10,000 tonnes this year to 79,000 tonnes. This compares with only 1,600
tonnes in 1985.
Wholesale prices have halved during the past month alone, causing severe
financial difficulties for traditional British glasshouse producers.
'We've dumped 20,000 boxes of lettuce at the top of the nursery and just
left them to rot,' said Mr Norman Lee, who runs Southgate Growers at
Chichester, West Sussex.
Mr Lee specialises in supplying during the winter when demand for salads is
low, but prices are usually high. This market is now being filled by a flood
of low-priced imports, and his receipts have dropped by 25 per cent.
Changing tastes have also led consumers to abandon the British round lettuce
in favour of more exotic imports.
Round lettuces have held their market share in previous years because they
have been considerably cheaper than imports, in spite of high energy costs.
As Spanish production has expanded, that price differential has been eroded
during the past year.
Mr Graham Ward, who runs Snaith Salad Growers in Goole, North Humberside,
believes Spanish lettuces are being sold below cost to UK supermarkets. 'The
Spanish prices are totally unrealistic,' he said.
Mr Ward says the break-even price for a box of 12 lettuces, including
transport from Spain to the UK and packing costs, would be about Pounds 2.80
to Pounds 3. But boxes of iceberg are being sold at Pounds 1.50. The drop in
price has slashed his turnover from a typical Pounds 2.5m a month to Pounds
1m in March.
Mr Colin Pickthall, Labour MP for Lancashire West, challenged the government
last week to look into the dumping of Spanish lettuce in the UK market.
Mr Michael Jack, the junior agriculture minister, replied that if growers
could supply evidence of unfair state aid to Spanish producers, he would
investigate.
Growers say it is difficult to find any decisive evidence of subsidy. But
they are infuriated that the vegetable sector should suffer from unalloyed
competition when the rest of European agriculture is supported by the common
agricultural policy.
Mr Derek Crossley, a lettuce grower near Selby, North Yorkshire, says he is
struggling to survive because he can only sell three-quarters of what he
produces.
He said: 'Over the past two years I've invested Pounds 53,000 into the
business which we'd put away to retire on, but now we've run out and I think
I'm going to go under.'

FT  06 APR 94 / Trials of bowel cancer vaccine 'impressive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British scientists have developed an experimental vaccine for bowel cancer,
the second most common cause of cancer deaths in industrialised countries.
It is being tested first as a potential treatment for patients with advanced
cancer but could be used eventually as a preventive vaccine for people known
to be genetically at risk from colo-rectal (bowel) cancer.
The Cancer Research Campaign, which funded the vaccine's development at
Nottingham University, said yesterday: 'The first clinical trials indicate
impressive results in patients.'
ImClone Systems, a New York biotechnology company, has signed an exclusive
worldwide licensing agreement with the CRC for commercial development of
Vaccine 105AD7, as it is known. ImClone is a leader in the fast-growing
research field of cancer vaccines; it is also testing vaccines for lung
cancer and melanoma.
Dr Lindy Durrant and Dr Adrian Robbins, who developed 105AD7 at Nottingham,
said it not only had the potential to prevent bowel cancer or stop the
disease progressing, but also had the advantage of producing no toxic
side-effects - unlike conventional treatments.
The encouraging first results came from tests on a dozen patients with
advanced bowel cancer; they will be published next week. The CRC is now
organising a larger clinical trial, based at Nottingham, with 350 patients,
and ImClone will carry out an extensive trial in the US.
Even if the new vaccine continues to perform well, it is unlikely to be
approved as a commercial treatment of bowel cancer before 1997. Its use in
preventive vaccination might then follow four years later.
There are several ways in which researchers are planning to use vaccines to
prevent cancer. One is the indirect approach - immunising people against
viruses, such as Epstein Barr, which are associated with certain cancers.
The CRC-ImClone approach, on the other hand, is aimed directly at tumour
cells. Vaccine 105AD7 is designed to mimic a particular part of the cell
surface.
This primes the patient's immune system to recognise and attack the cancer
cells themselves.
Every year more than 28,000 people in the UK are diagnosed as having bowel
cancer. Only 9,000 will be alive five years later. In the US, the disease
kills 55,000 people a year.
'Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the west,'
said Prof Gordon McVie, CRC scientific director.

FT  06 APR 94 / Private cash targeted in energy plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government hopes that its subsidy programme for renewable energy will
attract Pounds 3bn of private investment into 'green' power sources by the
end of the decade.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday that subsidies, budgeted at
just under Pounds 20m this year, will be concentrated on key technologies
which are environmentally acceptable and have good prospects of commercial
exploitation. He mentioned solar power, wind power, fuel cells and energy
from coppice (managed woodlands) and waste. But he said that other sources
would cease to be subsidised when current commitments expire because of
their limited commercial potential. These are tidal power, wave power and
geothermal research.
The renewable energy sources must contribute to diverse, secure and
sustainable energy supplies, to reductions in the emission of pollutants and
the encouragement of internationally competitive industries.
Mr Eggar's statement on renewable energy strategy, which reaffirmed the
government's goal of creating 1,500MW of renewable energy capacity by the
year 2000, came in response to the 1992 report of the Renewable Energy
Advisory Group which assessed Britain's capacity to produce electricity from
'green' sources.
Mr Eggar said the main vehicle for promoting renewable energy was the
non-fossil-fuel (NFFO) programme which subsidises electricity companies for
buying electricity generated by fuels other than oil, gas and coal. The
government is considering bids from renewable energy projects for the next
round of NFFO contracts.
Mr Eggar stressed, however, that the purpose of the NFFO was to draw in
private funds, which he expected to total Pounds 3bn by 2000.

Two in five businesses in north-west England are risking receivership by
failing to manage cashflow properly, says the latest quarterly survey by
Latham Crossley &amp; Davis, the Lancashire-based independent accountancy firm.
All but 11 of 110 businesses in the survey sample used sophisticated
computer software for their accounts, but 40 per cent did not use their
computers to plan their cashflow.
The survey showed 77 per cent of companies produce regular management
accounts, 57 per cent produce profit-and-loss statements, 54 per cent
regular balance sheets and 60 per cent cashflow reports.

FT  06 APR 94 / Small tour operators hope for spring break: The industry is
split by an OFT inquiry expected to report soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Crossland, chairman of the Airtours package tour group, tells the
story of how, as a travel agency employee in the 1960s, he won a holiday on
the Costa Brava as a reward for his sales performance.
There is nothing new in tour operators offering travel agency staff
incentives to sell their holidays rather than those of a rival. Independent
travel companies complain, however, that the practice is increasingly used
by large tour groups to deprive smaller operators of business.
Within the next few weeks, the Office of Fair Trading is expected to
announce whether it is to refer the package holiday industry to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The OFT announced in June last year that it was investigating the industry.
It is understood to have completed its investigation and to be preparing to
announce its decision.
The OFT inquiry has divided the holiday industry into two camps. On one side
are Thomson and Airtours, the two largest tour operators, which respectively
own Lunn Poly and Going Places, the two biggest travel agency chains. Both
groups have argued that the travel market is so competitive that it is
ridiculous to talk of customer choice being restricted. Airtours says it
sells only 4 per cent of its holidays through Going Places.
In the other camp are the small travel companies, many represented by the
Association of Independent Tour Operators. Mr Christopher Kirker, the
association's chairman, says: 'We hope the OFT will take the view that the
march of the multiple travel agents in the high street is increasingly
restricting consumer choice.'
Mr Kirker says his members find it difficult to get their brochures
displayed on the racks of the large retail chains. When they do persuade
large chains to sell their holidays, they are asked for increasingly high
commissions, he says.
The small companies have recently won a new ally in the form of Owners
Abroad, the third-biggest tour operator, in which Thomas Cook, the
third-biggest travel agency chain, has a 21 per cent stake.
Mr Francis Baron, Owners Abroad chief executive, says this relationship is
an arm's-length arrangement and does not give his group the sort of
advantages Thomson and Airtours enjoy through outright ownership of travel
agents. He says the practice of giving counter staff cash payments for
selling their parent company's holidays makes it difficult for his group to
compete.
The most detailed allegations have come from Ilkeston Consumer Co-operative
Society, which has nine Midlands travel agents.
The society is taking legal action against Thomson for allegedly restricting
the supply of brochures to its shops. It also alleges Thomson threatened to
deny it access to its computer system unless it promised not to offer bigger
discounts on other operators' holidays than on Thomson's.
The chain said it received a letter from Thomson last December that said:
'We very much hope that during the period from December 27 to February 28
you will not be discriminating against Thomson in your discounting
campaigns.'
The letter added: 'We intend to review our distribution policy in the first
quarter of next year. We will be examining every aspect of our commercial
relationship with retail partners. Those who support us will see benefits;
those who do not support us will lose some of the benefits they currently
enjoy.'
Thomson said it would 'defend the action vigorously'.

FT  06 APR 94 / Total of young dropouts 'heavily underestimated'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far fewer young people than officially realised are in further education,
training or work, says a study from the University of Wales, Cardiff.
It estimates that up to 23 per cent of people aged 16 and 17 who have left
school are outside these categories. The government estimates the figure at
not more than 4.5 per cent of the age group, and the South Glamorgan Careers
Service registers up to 12.5 per cent.
But the study finds that, although the number fluctuates greatly from month
to month, there are many more 'missing' teenagers not registered. The study
is based on South Glamorgan, but Mr Paul Sheldon, chief executive of the
local training and enterprise council, says the results have national
implications.
The Tec commissioned the study because of a lack of information about the
number of young people who, having left school, fail to find a job or a
place on a training programme in spite of the government's youth training
guarantee. The study was compiled by Mr David Istance and Mr Howard
Williamson of the university's School of Social and Administrative Studies.
'The relationship between areas of deprivation, high truancy rates at school
and the ongoing lack of involvement in education, training and employment is
clear,' Mr Sheldon says.
'Without significant change, we will see the growth of a whole new
generation excluded from the jobs market due to a lack of basic core skills,
vocational training and, most importantly, the lack of a work ethic.'
Of the young people interviewed, the report states: 'The majority displayed
a sense of low self-esteem, uncertainty and disorientation about the future
and were, according to them, being thrust from pillar to post with little
sense of having much control over what was happening to them. From the
perspective of these young people, nobody seemed to care.'
Even among those who had no early experience of crime, it says, there was a
growing tendency towards offending behaviour.
The authors share 'serious misgivings' about the withdrawal of income
support to 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds and say many suffer genuine
hardship. The current levels of training allowances are set so low as to be
counter-productive, they say.

FT  06 APR 94 / Beckett blunts Labour attack on tax changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday seized on the increase in employees' National Insurance
contributions and cuts in some income-tax-related allowances to accuse
ministers of raiding wage packets to pay for their mismanagement of the
economy.
But the force of its message was weakened when Mrs Margaret Beckett, the
party's deputy leader, hinted that Labour might shy away from detailed
policy pledges on tax before the next general election.
As the war of words on tax between both parties escalated, Mr Stephen
Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said Labour would lose the
argument.
Asked how many of Labour's tax plans would be spelt out before a general
election, Mrs Beckett said: 'My own counsel would be that we should seek to
set objectives and to say what we will aim towards as the money is there,
rather than to be too detailed.'
Her comments appeared to conflict with a pledge by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow
chancellor, to 'set out the necessary detail nearer the time'. Mr Brown said
millions of voters faced a fall in living standards this year and next.
Taxes were rising because of the costs associated with high unemployment,
economic decline and social deprivation, he added.
Moreover, problems over tax codes had created 'chaos' and had resulted in
more than 5m taxpayers complaining to the Inland Revenue.
Mr Brown suggested that Labour might take a leaf out of the Liberal
Democrats' book by considering in some areas taxation 'hypothecated' or
dedicated to specific types of public spending. 'We will link the taxes
people pay to the benefits they receive,' he said.
Mr Dorrell said Labour would lose the argument on tax because at the heart
of its 'false prospectus' was priority for consumption by the state. This
would pre-empt the fruits of economic growth, push up tax rates, push down
economic growth and ultimately involve real spending cuts.
He said the effect of tax increases introduced as a result of the last two
Budgets would be Pounds 9 a week for a 'typical household'. This compared
with Pounds 5.75 for the average household and Pounds 1 for the 7.5m
pensioner households.
Mr Dorrell refused to accept that adding 1p to National Insurance
contributions was more regressive than a 1p addition to income tax.

FT  06 APR 94 / Exporters upbeat about prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British exporters are more confident about their prospects than at any time
over the past two years, says a DHL Gallup survey. But many are worried that
UK manufacturers are pricing themselves out of world markets.
Almost seven out of 10 manufacturers surveyed have good or excellent
expectations for export orders over the next 12 months and 56 per cent
believe prospects are good for the next three months.
The outlook for British exports has improved since sterling left the
exchange rate mechanism in September 1992. However, 31 per cent of
manufacturers fear that companies are using the pound's competitiveness to
raise prices and, as a consequence, are losing orders. 'We must use our
competitive edge to strive for increased market share,' said Mr Ian
Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export.
Most companies expect an increase in sales in European Union markets. But
the US and Canada are seen as the most promising growth markets. The Pacific
Rim countries are seen as posing the greatest competitive threat.
The survey of 501 manufacturing exporters was conducted between March 10 and
March 17.

FT  06 APR 94 / Lloyd's Names to be excluded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 1,000 Names have been told that they can no longer expect to
participate in one of Lloyd's syndicates, Richard Lapper writes.
Mr Michael Cockell, the manager of syndicate 570, last week wrote to the
agents of Names on syndicate 570 cancelling their participations as from
December 31 this year. In the letter he said he was concerned about changes
'planned by Lloyd's Central (the market's authorities) which, if
implemented, may involve fundamental alterations in the present position of
our Names, members' agents and ourselves as managing agents'.
A group of senior market professionals, known as the value group, is
examining a number of potentially far-reaching reforms affecting Names and
their relationships with agents, including the feasibility of attaching
value to Names' syndicate participations.
The group is expected to report later this month.
Mr Cockell said: 'We are serving the notices so we can arrange a proper and
acceptable relationship for the future.
'I'm running a business. I'm not in the business of not knowing what the new
rules are going to be and want to be free to make a mutually acceptable
relationship around the new rules.'
He said he was also concerned about the impact on Names of the size of
losses for the 1991 year which Lloyd's will report next month.
Syndicate 570 relies exclusively on individual Names and has received no
backing from corporate capital.

FT  06 APR 94 / 'Superbike' designer signs contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The designer of the carbon fibre and titanium 'superbike' on which Briton
Chris Boardman (above) won a pursuit cycling gold medal at the 1992
Barcelona Olympic games has signed a contract to work for Giant, the
Taiwanese cycle producer, John Griffiths writes.
Mr Michael Burrows said he had become disillusioned with British industry
after failing to see his innovative ideas for cycles put into production.
Although the 'superbike' was designed by Mr Burrows, its patents are owned
by Lotus Engineering, which says the launch of a Pounds 3,000 road-going
version of the machine is imminent. Nearly two years have elapsed since
Lotus, sold recently by General Motors to Bugatti, announced it was looking
for a partner to put the cycle into production.
Lotus has designed the roadgoing superbike's components but it is to be
assembled by Casket, the cycles and clothing group which has bought the
LotuSport brand name.
Mr Burrows claims to have made his decision to join Giant only after being
ignored by British cycle makers including Raleigh, the UK's biggest
producer, which makes 600,000 cycles a year. Raleigh has denied receiving
any formal approaches from Mr Burrows.
Giant is one of the world's largest cycle manufacturers, making about 1.6m a
year, almost entirely for export. It is thus one of the UK industry's
fiercest competitors.
After the success of his Olympic design, the self-taught Mr Burrows designed
another cycle, on which Scot Graeme Obree cycled a world record 51.597
kilometres in an hour last July.
'It's sad that it's not an English company,' said Mr Burrows, who will
undertake concept engineering for Giant from his base in Norfolk. 'But their
engineers want to learn and it could be the perfect combination. If I can
give Giant the technological edge there'll be no stopping them.'

FT  06 APR 94 / Employers challenge strike ballots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Communications Union faces legal pressure from the two main
employers of its members - British Telecommunications and the Post Office -
over the conduct of strike ballots.
Post Office engineering staff in London voted last month by a small majority
to take action over the proposed closure of about half the capital's
mechanised letter offices.
The Post Office subsequently questioned whether all the relevant people had
been balloted and said it would seek an injunction to prevent action. It is
going ahead with legal action in spite of assurances from NCU headquarters
that no strike would take place. But recent industrial unrest in the Post
Office among counter and delivery staff still looks set to spread to the
smaller group of engineers.
Post Office engineers voted 799-365 in favour of strike action to win
guarantees that their pay and conditions would not be adversely affected
when they moved from Royal Mail to RoMEC, a new subsidiary company. The Post
Office offered them guarantees, but only for 18 months.
The NCU has recently agreed to re-run a strike ballot of BT engineering
staff in Stafford after BT declared it illegitimate. The result of an NCU
ballot on action in the London area over BT's use of subcontractors is
expected tomorrow.

FT  06 APR 94 / Cash boost aids Tory campaigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD, DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party's finances took a marked turn for the better last
year in a development which may help improve its prospects in the
forthcoming local and European election campaigns.
As Mr John Major was forced on the defensive with further questions over his
leadership during a visit to Essex, it emerged that the party may have
achieved its biggest-ever surplus in the financial year just ended -
breaking a run of four consecutive deficits.
Preliminary figures are believed to show the party had a surplus of about
Pounds 2m last year, on income of Pounds 13m, which helped it to trim its
accumulated deficit from Pounds 19m to Pounds 16.5m.
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, said he believed the party had
'turned the corner' as far as its finances were concerned. This meant 'we
will certainly be able to spend on the election campaigns'. He added that
the party hoped to put on a 'good show' with poster campaigns, particularly
before June's European elections.
A satisfactory performance in these and the local elections which precede
them in May is seen as vital to Mr Major's leadership prospects.
The prime minister yesterday tried to shore up his embattled position by
swapping 'the wild world of Westminster' for the 'real world' of Essex.
As more backbenchers privately predicted that he would be forced to stand
down later this year, Mr Major fiercely denied that he was the cause of
Conservative divisions.
Sir Norman has called for a period of silence from Tory backbench MPs who
have lost confidence in the prime minister. He insisted that Mr Tony Marlow,
Mr John Carlisle and Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, the three MPs who have publicly
called on him to resign, did not represent the view of the Conservative
party in parliament or in the country.
But while few MPs were prepared to publicly call for Mr Major's resignation,
many said a leadership challenge in the autumn was inevitable unless the
party performed unexpectedly well in the European elections.
Sir Norman said that the improved financial circumstances would enable his
policy of diverting resources from the centre to marginal constituencies to
continue. He said the party was aiming to increase the number of agents it
employed from 220 to about 300.
In response to further attacks on Mr Major's leadership Mr Jerry Hayes, Tory
MP for Harlow, warned that the party would do 'appallingly' in the June
European elections if discontented MPs did not 'shut up'.
Mr Major appeared irritated when asked on BBC Radio whether his away-day
visits to Basildon and Harlow were intended to save his job. He replied:
'That has been said for the last two years.
'It is important for a prime minister, any prime minister, to escape from
the wild world of Westminster and come and see what is happening in the real
world of the country.'
Questioned about the disunity within his party, he said: 'All political
parties have their differences on Europe.'

FT  06 APR 94 / Lloyd's losses of Pounds 3bn forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London may report losses for 1991 of more than Pounds 3bn,
Chatset, the company that monitors the insurance market, said yesterday.
This figure would take total losses for the past four years to more than
Pounds 8.5bn.
Lloyd's is due to publish its 1991 results late next month or early in June.
'The indications must be that the overall loss will be around Pounds 3bn,
and it is not inconceivable that this figure will be exceeded,' said Mr
Charles Sturge, co-editor of Chatset.
The company said the losses had been caused mainly by a deterioration of
'open years' such as the underwriting years of 1988, 1989 and 1990 which saw
a series of natural disasters including the Piper Alpha disaster in the
North Sea and serious oil spills elsewhere in the world.
These disasters hit the 'excess of loss' reinsurance spirals, and have led
to a series of legal disputes in which Names, the individuals who back the
market with their wealth, have taken action against market professionals.
Chatset said that results and estimates of insurance syndicates for the 1991
underwriting year had not deteriorated and were still likely to be Pounds
1.2bn or slightly lower. 'However, very serious deterioration has taken
place on the old years,' it said.
It added that a survey of about 30 per cent of syndicates with open years
showed an average deterioration of 28.6 per cent in 1993. If applied to the
other 70 per cent, the overall deterioration for open years to be announced
would be Pounds 2.1bn.
Mr Sturge said: 'The old years are very unstable, and to make an accurate
prediction about the 1991 result is well nigh impossible.'
In February, a ballot among Lloyd's 22,000 Names rejected a Pounds 900m
out-of-court settlement. Lloyd's made the offer to try to head off the wave
of litigation by Names. Errors-and-omissions insurers, which cover agents
against legal awards for negligence, would have provided nearly half the
Pounds 900m.

The Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect private
investors, had by yesterday received just over 2,000 applications from
companies and individuals wanting to be regulated by it, Alison Smith
writes.
When the PIA published its prospectus in February, it estimated there were
about 6,000 potential members who now come under the existing
self-regulating organisations, Lautro and Fimbra. The PIA will open in July
and has warned life companies and independent financial advisers that if
they missed yesterday's deadline it cannot guarantee that applications will
be processed by then.
The decision by Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, to reject the PIA
and be regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board has
intensified caution within the financial services industry over the PIA's
future, leading many potential members to hang back before applying.
Bradford &amp; Bingley, the seventh-largest building society, yesterday
announced it had applied to join the PIA. Mr Geoffrey Lister, its chief
executive, is on the PIA board.

FT  06 APR 94 / Business school urgently seeks head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester Business School has started an urgent search for a new head.
Candidates will have to be ready to start in September and be immediately
available part-time.
The search follows the decision of Professor Tony Cockerell, former deputy
director, to give up the role after July. Mr James Ross, chief executive of
Cable and Wireless and chairman of the school's board, said there was no
time to follow normal recruitment practice as this would take 18 months.
Manchester University is being asked by the board to set up a search
committee for internal candidates, but applicants from other universities or
industry and commerce worldwide will also be considered. The post is seen as
one of the most prestigious of its kind in Europe and the US.
The Manchester school's director, Professor Tom Cannon, left in 1992
following the resignations of an advisory board of private-sector leaders
who opposed plans to pool the university's undergraduate and postgraduate
resources in a new institution, called the Manchester Federal School of
Management.
The federal school started up in January, and from October will offer
flexible courses combining management studies with other subjects.

FT  06 APR 94 / CBI recommends debt ombudsman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called on the government to
tackle the problem of late payment of trade debts, but said legislation for
a statutory right to interest would not work.
The government should instead consider establishing a 'commercial debt
ombudsman' with powers to investigate complaints against the government and
businesses and to publicise its findings.
Government organisations should be required to pay promptly and a system
should be devised to ensure that suppliers to the government pay their own
suppliers promptly.
The CBI made the submissions to the Department of Trade and Industry in
response to a consultative document produced after the last Budget called
for a solution for late payment.
The CBI said quoted companies should be required to specify their payment
policies in annual reports and whether they support the CBI code of practice
on prompt payment. The government should consider a British Standard on
prompt payment.
Mr John Parsons, chairman of the CBI's Smaller Firms Council, said: 'If a
law could be devised to solve the problem of late payment, the CBI would be
the first to support it.
'But our smaller-firm members do not think legislation for a statutory right
to interest would work. Dominant customers who have paid late in the past
will have few qualms about insisting on longer payment terms.'

FT  06 APR 94 / Sinn Fein lobbies as ceasefire begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 72-hour IRA ceasefire came into effect at midnight last night as Sinn Fein
leaders prepared to travel to London to deliver to Mr John Major a letter
calling for a positive response to the republican initiative.
Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein's national chairman, is today expected to use a
London press conference to repeat calls for the British government to open
direct talks with republican leaders aimed at providing 'clarification' of
the Downing Street peace declaration.
But there was still no sign last night that the IRA's gesture had succeeded
in exposing differences between the British and Irish governments.
London and Dublin have consistently criticised the ceasefire as inadequate
and made clear their frustration at the IRA's refusal to declare a permanent
end to violence.
As Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, departed yesterday on
an 11-day visit to North America, Downing Street rebuffed a call from Mr
John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party,
for a representative to be sent to meet republican leaders.
Downing Street rejected Mr Hume's suggestion for a senior Tory backbencher
to be appointed as go-between. It said: 'The situation remains the same. We
are not going to get involved in anything like this.'
The rejection came as Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, sought to
increase pressure on the government by making it clear that Mr Hume's idea
for an intermediary would meet its demand for direct talks.
Sir Patrick said he would use his trip to welcome the strong support shown
for the Downing Street declaration in both Canada and the United States and
to reaffirm the government's determination to eliminate terrorism.

FT  06 APR 94 / Wandsworth plans to bypass boycott of school tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wandsworth, the Conservatives' 'flagship' borough in south London, yesterday
unveiled a plan to carry out national curriculum tests in schools this
summer in spite of the boycott by the largest teachers' union.
Mr Edward Lister, leader of Wandsworth, intends to send supply teachers and
inspectors into the borough's three secondary and 65 primary schools to
carry out the tests.
He said: 'We are determined that the tests will go ahead. We will send in
special teams to make sure that they do.'
Teachers' unions have objected that the tests - compulsory for all children
aged seven and 14 in England and Wales and voluntary for 11-year-olds -
would create an excessive workload. Wandsworth says external markers would
address this issue.
The external markers would be drawn mainly from teachers who have retired,
been made redundant or who have taken a career break.
Delegates at the NUT union's annual conference in Scarborough, North
Yorkshire, reacted angrily to the move, which was thought to pave the way
for a wider government initiative to introduce external marking in England
and Wales.
Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary, described Wandsworth as 'the government's
favourite poodle', and said the action would not deter members.
Wandsworth made a similar offer to its secondary schools last year, but the
head teachers refused to allow extra teachers in their schools. The council
unsuccessfully challenged the teacher boycott in the courts last year, but
seems unlikely to do so this year.
Ms Julia Alterman, a Wandsworth NUT delegate, said the council's money would
be better spent on maintaining teachers for the borough's 'ethnic-minority
children'.
She said: 'It's a very sad state of affairs. It will create more disruption
because we will be asking parents not to send their children to school on
the days of the tests. Of course we would far rather have them in the
school.'
At the conference Mr McAvoy and the moderate wing of the union defeated two
leftwing motions to amend the union's strict rule that a two-thirds majority
of all members is needed for strike action and for a national strike against
job losses.
In his closing address Mr McAvoy said the tests meant the '11-plus exam' and
selective schools would return. Government policy was to 'provide privilege
to the few by denying to the many, by whatever name they use for that
selection'.
Ms Margaret Morrissey, co-ordinator of the National Confederation of
Parent-Teacher Associations, which last year opposed the tests, said school
governors should take ultimate responsibility for deciding whether the tests
went ahead in individual schools.

The agriculture ministry's new central science laboratory in Ryedale, North
Yorkshire, is to be equipped with German rather than British furniture,
which would have produced a Pounds 70,000 saving.
Ministers decided not to award the contract, believed to be worth Pounds 2m,
to Cygnet Laboratory Furniture, a Sycamore Holdings subsidiary. They said
there were doubts about whether the quality of Cygnet's samples could be

FT  06 APR 94 / DTI closes chapter for ticket agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Theatre-goers will have no difficulty getting into the musical Phantom of
the Opera in London's West End this Friday - provided they are prepared to
pay between Pounds 50 and Pounds 85 for a ticket that might have cost Pounds
14 to Pounds 30 at the box office.
The London shops that sell tickets for theatres and sporting events say they
are simply helping to meet excessive demand for the capital's popular events
at free-market prices.
The Department of Trade and Industry disagrees, and yesterday published
draft regulations that will require those ticket resellers to make clear to
buyers not only what the original price was, but also whether they might end
up sitting behind a pillar.
Lord Strathclyde, consumer affairs minister, said: 'People are outraged when
they pay high prices for what they think are good-quality tickets, only to
discover later that their face value is much lower.'
The proposed regulations will require agents to tell buyers all information
printed on the ticket, including details on restricted viewing. When buyers
make their purchases in the shop, agents must give them this information
either in writing or by showing them the ticket.
The department said this must be done 'in a manner which enables the buyer
to read the details clearly; information given orally will have to be given
in a manner that is comprehensible (as well as audible)'.
Yesterday's draft regulations, which will be enforced by trading standards
officers, are the department's second set. The first version was issued last
July. The new draft includes tickets sold as part of travel packages.
Mr Tony Anderson, managing director of All Tickets, a West End agency, said
he was happy with the new regulations. 'No problem at all. We always tell
people where they stand. It's understandable if people don't want to pay
over the odds for a ticket. If people do, the reason they are paying a
premium is the show is sold out. We're ticket brokers. It's a bit like the
stock exchange.'
A later call to All Tickets yielded an offer of a Pounds 50 Phantom ticket
for Friday night. No mention was made of the face value. When this was
requested, a figure of Pounds 14 was cheerfully provided.
Ms Susan Whiddington, development officer of the Society of London Theatre,
said her organisation received four or five complaints a week from
disgruntled purchasers of agency tickets.
Ms Whiddington said: 'We've been lobbying the government for years about the
problems this has created for our industry. This will give us some legal
clout for the first time.'

FT  06 APR 94 / ITN signs video news release deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent Television News has signed an exclusive deal with Medialink, the
world's largest supplier of video news releases, the television equivalent
of press releases which are distributed around the world by satellite.
Medialink will use the camera crews and technical facilities of ITN. The
agreement is with News Services, the facilities arm of ITN, and ITN
journalists will not be involved.
Video news releases for television stations go out virtually daily. Reuters
Television, part of the international news and information group, has
operated such a service for a number of years.
Medialink, which will continue to produce the videos filmed by ITN crews,
has a regular agreement with the Department of Transport to produce video
releases.
Material from the video release of a recent transport safety campaign was
used on the BBC Six O'Clock News and regional ITV stations, thereby reaching
an audience estimated at more than 41m.
Services range from a simple video release through electronic press kits to
'satellite media tours' - interviews with television stations all over the
world - and video conferences.
To produce a video news release and distribute it all over Europe and the US
could cost around Pounds 15,000.

FT  06 APR 94 / US leading indicators dip 0.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A small dip in the US Commerce Department's main economic forecasting index
in February has helped quench fears of overheating in the economy, but
forecasters predict a rebound in March's index as a result of warmer
weather.
The index of leading economic indicators dropped by 0.1 per cent after
rising for six months in a row, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
The largest factors in the index's fall, however, were a shortening of the
average working week and a decrease in building permits. Both elements were
affected by February's severe winter storms, and both rebounded strongly in
March. Higher prices for sensitive materials and lower claims for
unemployment benefits were among the offsetting factors tending to take the
index higher.
Private sector economists had generally expected a small drop in the
February leading index, which is thought to predict the approximate level of
economic activity several months in advance.
The Commerce Department said its index of coincident indicators, which is
intended to move up and down in line with current economic activity, rose by
0.5 per cent after dropping 0.1 per cent in January. The index of lagging
indicators, which provides a trailing signal of economic activity, fell by
0.1 per cent after staying flat in January.

FT  06 APR 94 / Easter double-header for Clinton and Nixon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Clinton met Richard Nixon on Monday night. They were not actually in
the same room, town or state, and therefore did not discuss Russia,
Whitewater, Watergate or any other great matter of the past or present. But,
metaphorically, they were together.
The place was the Coliseum in Charlotte, North Carolina. The current
president was in the stands as his home state university of Arkansas, where
he was a law professor from 1973-76, played Duke, where Mr Nixon got his law
degree in 1937, for the national collegiate basketball championship. It is a
fair bet Mr Nixon was watching the game on television.
For Mr Clinton, it was the perfect end for the sort of Easter Monday that
only presidents get to enjoy. It started on the White House lawns with an
Easter egg hunt for children; it was levitated, via Air Force One, to the
traditional throwing of the first ball at Cleveland's magnificent new
baseball stadium; and it wound up in Charlotte, with his arms round the
black and progressive Arkansas coach.
Mr Nixon, in his time, was the self-appointed nation's 'first fan,' though
he preferred football. He used to volunteer suggestions to the then coach of
the Washington Redskins, the very conservative George Allen, whose son is
now Republican governor of Virginia, having been helped on his way by
fundraisers organised by the 37th president.
But the current comparisons doing the rounds are far more political than
sporting. Whitewater may never equal Watergate either in substance or
climactic end result, but both men have found themselves on similar racks.
The Nixon approach to his crisis was to try to brazen it out, with a White
House praetorian guard under Haldeman and Ehrlichman manning the drawbridge.
The Clinton tactic over the tale of his family's land and financial dealings
in Arkansas years ago was initially to deny almost everything and then to
parcel out information bit by bit. Neither approach worked.
Both came to office burdened with opprobrious nicknames - 'Tricky Dicky' and
'Slick Willy' - which reflected their tendency to moralise and their
quicksilver approaches to politics. Neither was easy to pin down or predict.
Mr Nixon, the presumed foreign policy hardliner, opened the door to
communist China; Mr Clinton's promise 'to end welfare as we know it' would
dismantle a Democratic party monument.
Both were also adept at stealing the political clothes of their opposition,
with Mr Nixon advancing some policies, including wage and price controls,
long favoured by the left and Mr Clinton attacking the budget deficit and
crime almost as if he were a Republican.
The combination of their respective personalities and policies meant that
both inspired something akin to hatred from those who believed they were
morally disqualified for the highest office. For Mr Nixon 20 years ago,
contempt came from liberals; for Mr Clinton today, it is from conservatives.
But many in the middle confessed, then and now, to being made uneasy.
Both faced a hostile media, though comparisons here can only be taken so
far. The Watergate story of 'high crimes and misdemeanours' instigated by
the White House may have been 'broken' by a handful of young reporters but
quickly came to consume the political and legal system and the country at
large.
Whitewater still appears mostly a media-generated affair, with some
assistance from Republican partisans, but underwhelming for the general
public. The quality of much Whitewater reporting pales in comparison with
what Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein achieved over Watergate.
The consolation for Mr Clinton is that Arkansas just beat Duke on Monday
night. The state whose entrails are now under the national microscope can
boast a president and a national champion for the first time. The Cleveland
Indians also won. The only bad Easter omen is that Hillary Clinton threw out
the first ball in Chicago, but the local Cubs promptly lost.

FT  06 APR 94 / Caracas fund to buy poor quality loans from banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Venezuelan government plans a fund to buy poor quality loans from ailing
banks as part its effort to restore the financial sector to health,
according to Mr Enzo del Bufalo, head of the economic planning office
(Cordiplan).
Six private banks are believed to be dependent on government financial
assistance following heavy withdrawals in the wake of the collapse in
January of Banco Latino, the country's second largest bank.
Mr del Bufalo stressed that the proposed fund, apart from helping to
stabilise the banking system, is also expected to play a role in easing
pressure on the country's international monetary reserves and reducing
inflation.
The fund will buy bad loans from selected banks in order to improve their
financial performance. In return, the government will demand they reduce
purchases of US dollars for their own accounts, thus taking pressure off
Venezuela's international reserves.
The country's monetary reserves fell by Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.15bn) during
the first quarter of this year, compared with a decline of Dollars 519m
during all of 1993. However, the pace of reserve loss slowed considerably in
March of this year, and the government still has reserves of around Dollars
10.9bn, equivalent to over a year of imports.
The government also expects borrowers whose bank loans are taken over by the
fund to renegotiate payment terms. In return for more favourable
arrangements, the government will ask beneficiary companies to keep price
rises for their products below a 2.5 per cent monthly target.
Banco Latino, closed since January 13, has been re-capitalised by the
government and re-opened under full government control on Monday. It has
resumed most normal financial activities.
Mr del Bufalo also said the government would urge direct talks between
business owners and employees aimed at replacing the existing system of
worker severance benefits with pension funds.
Under current Venezuelan legislation, employers are required to set aside
one or two months pay for each year of employee service, and to pay market
interest rates on this sum.

FT  06 APR 94 / Plan to 'end welfare as we know it' bears heavy cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton may have to scale back his plan to 'end welfare as we
know it' because of the greater-than-expected cost of overhauling the US
social safety net. The welfare reform plan drafted by a White House task
force could cost as much as Dollars 58bn (Pounds 39.7bn) over 10 years,
according to yesterday's New York Times.
The report, citing a memorandum written by the task force, says a 'Cadillac
version' of welfare reform could cost Dollars 18.4bn during its first five
years, but might cost over Dollars 7bn a year more than the current system
once fully phased in. Officials said the administration was likely to adopt
a more limited version that would still cost Dollars 35bn over 10 years.
The core of the Clinton welfare reform plan - which is designed to fulfil
one of his most popular campaign promises - is a proposal, with which
several states are already experimenting, to require welfare recipients to
work for their benefits after two years.
This is expected to increase the overall cost of welfare substantially,
because of the need to create more training and work programmes, as well as
to provide child care and health cover for participants.
The memorandum showed a 10-year cost of Dollars 12bn for expanded training
programmes, Dollars 14.7bn for new work programmes and Dollars 16.3bn to
provide child care for poor people who work. It also foresees savings of
Dollars 8bn over 10 years from improved enforcement of child support
payments, and of Dollars 2.15bn from allowing states to cap benefits to
those who have more children after they enroll for welfare payments.
Under US budget rules, additional spending will have to be offset either by
other spending cuts or by tax increases.
A rival Republican plan aims to finance itself largely by cutting off
benefits to immigrants - a measure that has also been eyed by many states
seeking to cut their welfare budgets, but which will draw fire from key
Democratic constituencies, including Hispanic members of Congress and church
groups.

FT  06 APR 94 / Military snub for Chilean president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Chilean civil-military relations were thrown into crisis yesterday when the
head of the police force refused to resign over allegations of covering up
the murder of three communist leaders in 1985.
General Rodolfo Stange publicly refused to step down after a long meeting
with President Eduardo Frei, in a move which undermines the president's
authority and highlights the limits of democratic rule, regained in 1990
after 17 years of military dictatorship.
Although under the 1980 constitution, drawn up by the military, the
president cannot dismiss commanders of the armed forces, Mr Frei had made it
clear that Gen Stange's position was no longer tenable.
Mr Milton Juica, a judge who has been investigating the case since 1989,
said that Gen Stange may have 'failed to fulfil his military duties' by
impeding the investigation.
Mr Juica on Thursday sentenced 16 people, 15 of them former carabineros, to
various terms of imprisonment for the murders. Three, including a former
colonel, were given life terms, by far the stiffest sentences delivered in
connection with the human rights abuses committed during the military
regime, most of which remain unpunished.
Mr German Correa, minister of the interior, last week called on Gen Stange
to 'examine his conscience' after the publication of Mr Juica's findings. Mr
Jorge Schaulsohn, president of the chamber of deputies, yesterday said Gen
Stange ought to resign his post 'as a patriotic act'.
Gen Agusto Pinochet, who remains commander in chief until 1997, has strongly
backed Gen Stange, as have top police officials who last week issued a
statement saying: 'The carabineros do not accept nor will accept any
question. . . of placing in doubt the legality, transparency and honesty of
the actions of the force or its commander.'

<TEXT>
World trade growth slowed last year but a hoped-for economic recovery in
western Europe and Japan may offer brighter prospects for 1994, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in a report published today.
The volume of world trade in goods rose by 2.5 per cent in 1993, well below
the 4.5 per cent of 1992 but still ahead of world output growth of just
under 2 per cent. The value of world merchandise trade fell by 2 per cent to
Dollars 3,600bn (Pounds 2,425bn), reflecting the dollar's gain against
European currencies and lower world prices for fuels and other minerals.
Although only limited data are available, Gatt economists estimate that
trade in commercial services may have increased by around 3 per cent last
year, against 12 per cent in 1992, to reach Dollars 1,030bn.
The report blames the 1993 slowdown primarily on recession in western
Europe. Lower trade volumes and exchange rate effects led to a 10 per cent
drop in the value of the region's merchandise trade, unprecedented in the
post-war period.
If trade within western Europe is excluded, the value of world goods trade
rose by almost 2 per cent last year.
The outlook for 1994 remains uncertain. Merchandise trade volumes could
expand by more than 5 per cent if recovery takes hold in western Europe and
Japan by mid-year, Gatt predicts. 'If, instead, delays occur. . . , trade
growth is likely to be closer to last year's 2.5 per cent.'
Trade and output grew fastest in North America, Asia and Latin America in
1993. Exports from Latin America and from six Asian exporters of
manufactures (Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and
Thailand) jumped by 9.5 per cent in volume terms, boosted by rising North
American demand.
This was reflected in changed rankings among the world's leading goods
exporters. The US, Germany and Japan retained their top three places but,
further down the league table, Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico moved up two
spots to 8th, 16th and 17th respectively, while Malaysia jumped three places
to 19th. China, which is pressing to rejoin Gatt this year, ranks 11th.
The rankings for commercial services exports show the US in first place,
followed by France, Italy, Germany, Britain and Japan. Here, too, Asian
exporters are gaining ground. Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan
all feature in the top 20.

European business leaders and Commission officials meet their US
counterparts today in an attempt to relieve tensions over market access and
standardisation in the European and US information technology sectors,
writes Gillian Tett in Brussels.
The meeting, in New York, marks the Commission's first public attempt to
consult US officials about its ambitious plans to develop an information
network infrastructure in Europe, unveiled by Mr Jaques Delors, Commission
president, last year.
A working group of European industrialists, led by Mr Carlo de Benedetti and
Viscount Etienne Davignon, are due to present proposals on financing and
operating these highways to Brussels later this month.
However, Commission officials admit progress is limited in their attempts to
agree the type of common information technology standards necessary to
develop any transatlantic or global information networks.
Coming amid US complaints that European policy on IT telecommunications
patents has been overly restrictive, standardisation is expected to be a key
issue at today's meeting, Commission officials said.

<TEXT>
The French government yesterday struck a conciliatory tone concerning the
incorporation of labour issues into international trading rules, reducing
the prospect of a dispute with developing nations at next week's signing of
the Uruguay Round trade agreements.
Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, said France's aim was to
stimulate a long-term debate on whether labour issues and workers' rights
should form part of free trade agreements. But he said France wanted to
avoid a damaging split between developed and developing economies at next
week's Marrakesh meeting.
Mr Longuet said that France was not seeking to attach new labour standards
to the Gatt treaty and sought to discuss 'very general goals' such as the
banning of child labour and forced labour. He added, however, that it was
important for France and other countries to have the right to discuss issues
of labour and trade as part of the World Trade Organisation, which is due to
succeed the Gatt.
Mr Longuet's comments appeared to increase the chances of a smooth signing
of the Uruguay Round trade agreements. The possibility of incorporating
workers' rights into trade rules, raised by both the US and France, had
brought strong opposition from developing countries, particularly in Asia.
The French government, however, struck a tough note in its position towards
textiles trade. Mr Longuet said Indonesia, India and Pakistan had not made
sufficient progress on liberalising their textiles markets in line with the
new Gatt agreements.

labour-trade link

<TEXT>
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malay-sia's prime minister, has made a strong attack on
moves to link labour standards to trade issues under a new world trading
regime, saying that such action would be disastrous for developing
countries. However, Malaysia's own Trades Union Congress yesterday backed
such a move.
'Our sole advantage is our lower cost of labour. . . there has been talk of
levelling the playing field by removing the labour cost advantage we have,'
said Dr Mahathir. 'But a level playing field is meaningless for midgets
competing against giants.'
More than 120 countries are due to meet in Marrakesh next week to sign the
Uruguay Round trade accords. The US has said it wants a draft ministerial
declaration at the meeting to include references to the relationship between
what it calls 'internationally recognised labour standards' and the world
trading system.
Other developing countries have said labour standards are a matter for
individual governments and should not be linked to trade issues. Last week
Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) countries agreed to act as a
bloc to prevent any 'social clause' being included in future international
trading rules.
The Malaysian Trades Union Congress has backed the call for a social clause
in Gatt as have trade union centres in several other developing countries
including Singapore, Pakistan, Uganda, and Ghana.
'We do not seek a global minimum wage, but what we do need is global
regulation of the right of unions to exist, to organise and to carry out
collective bargaining,' the Malaysian TUC said.

The aim was to raise the efficiency of operations, Mitsubishi said. However,
a minimum level of staffing would be kept in the joint venture, which would
continue to operate for some time. Stuttgart Truck and Bus Sales is 60 per

of 1,000 Mercedes Benz trucks have been sold in Japan.

FT  06 APR 94 / World Trade News: US tries to melt the ice with India -
Minister is in New Delhi to repair chilly relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early in the last century, US trading relations with India amounted to the
transport of ice by clipper ships from Boston to Calcutta. These days the
trade flow is reversed, but the ice remains - in relations between the two
countries.
Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, is in India today to
'underscore the importance we attach to the relationship', according to a
Commerce Department spokesman. But his task will not be easy. With India
identified as a trade and investment target, US officials are scrambling to
counter a series of diplomatic blunders.
The Clinton administration, after 15 months in office, has yet to send a
permanent ambassador to India. Former congressman Steven Solarz was
nominated months ago but never made it through the confirmation process. Mr
Frank Wisner, a top Pentagon official, is in line for the job but has not
been nominated officially.
Meanwhile, Ms Robin Raphel, an assistant secretary of state, who caused an
uproar by referring to Kashmir as a disputed territory, was in New Delhi
last month trying to clear up 'misunderstandings'. The US, she said, had
only one goal in Kashmir: to persuade India and Pakistan to negotiate a
settlement to end fighting that has killed more than 8,500 people in four
years.
Mr Jeffrey Garten, Commerce Department undersecretary for trade,
acknowledges that the US is trailing its competitors in India. Officials
from Britain, Germany, Spain, Singapore, Russia and the Netherlands have
visited New Delhi, often accompanied by large business delegations. But
visits by Mr Garten and his boss, Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary,
remain at the planning stage.
Much is at stake. The US is India's largest export customer, but tariffs
protecting India's domestic market are among the world's highest.
'Bureaucratic delays continue to hinder implementation of many
infrastructure projects and block approval of foreign investment proposals,'
says Mr Garten. Inadequate legal protection of intellectual property and the
weak enforcement of existing laws are also key concerns, he says.
US investment in India was Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 738m) last year, more than
twice the 1992 level. Mr Garten believes US exports to India could rise by
as much as 10 per cent a year, from Dollars 2.8bn last year to Dollars
5bn-Dollars 6bn a year by the end of the century.
US aircraft and air traffic control exports, now running at Dollars
100m-Dollars 200m a year, are likely to expand. US aircraft and engine
manufacturers are bidding in Air India's Dollars 1bn aircraft procurement
programme.
Telecommunications companies are seeking paging and cellular licences and
approval of large investments. Other US companies are bidding for Indian
railways, locomotive and telecom network modernisation contracts.
Other opportunities are seen in the expansion of India's power generation,
at a cost of several billion dollars in the next six years, and petroleum
exploration.
The Commerce Department predicts that three-quarters of the growth in world
trade in the next 20 years will occur in the developing countries, with most
of the expansion in 10 'big emerging markets' of which India is one.
But the potential for US trade with India is being jeopardised by the frosty
diplomatic relations between the two countries. President Bill Clinton's
emphasis on human rights and his criticism of abuses in Kashmir have deeply
offended New Delhi. As with China, he may have to choose between foreign
sales - key to his domestic economic policy - or domestic moralising.

European businesses will be asked at a conference in Copenhagen at the end
of May to present the European Commission with examples of how technical
obstacles to trade continue to prevent the proper functioning of Europe's
internal market.
The conference is being held jointly by the European Commission, Denmark's
industry ministry and the Federation of Danish Industries. The final date of
the conference has yet to be fixed.
The decision to hold the conference follows a report to the Commission in
February by the Federation of Danish Industries, complaining that Brussels
was not doing enough to ensure the functioning of the internal market. It
also documented the continued existence of numerous technical barriers to
the free movement of goods.
'The commissioners are still living with the illusion that the internal
market is functioning satisfactorily, but they won't be able to any longer
once they have attended this conference,' said Mr Soren Krohn, the
Federation of Industries specialist on European policy.

<TEXT>
South Africa's newly declared state of emergency in Natal province failed
its first serious test yesterday when security forces were unable to disarm
thousands of Zulu royalists who marched through a northern town carrying
spears and clubs in defiance of emergency regulations.
Police said it was too dangerous to disarm the marchers, despite the fact
they were acting illegally. 'We could not disarm them without bloodshed,'
Police Major Margaret Kruger said of the march in the coastal town of
Empangeni.
The incident raises questions over whether the state of emergency can reduce
violence in Natal and the KwaZulu black 'homeland' which it includes. Police
said 85 people had died in the five days since the emergency was introduced.
Addressing the march, which ended peacefully, Mr Zenzele Phakathi, an
Inkatha Freedom party official, urged marchers to defy the emergency.
Doubts over the efficacy of the emergency highlight the need for an urgent
political solution in Natal, due to be the subject of a peace summit on
Friday between the country's main political leaders.
Meanwhile, it was announced yesterday that international mediation, aimed at
resolving the country's constitutional dispute, is to be delayed until next
week. The ANC and Inkatha have yet to agree on the terms of mediation,
casting doubt on prospects for rapid progress.
A South African tripartite committee said yesterday that it would be
impossible to hold elections in KwaZulu under the current conditions of
violence and fear, agencies report from Johannesburg. The committee,
consisting of the Independent Electoral Commission and the South African and
KwaZulu governments, said that the police were not 'in a position in the
present political climate to ensure that the elections are free and fair'.

psychological impact, Mr Saleh Afiff, economic co-ordinating minister, was
quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency yesterday. The World
Bank, which has praised Indonesia for sound economic management since the
late 1960s, heads a consultative group of donors which last year pledged
Dollars 5.1bn in fresh development aid.
Indonesia said on Monday it would avoid taking any surprise measures,
including devaluing the rupiah.

Israel yesterday put state-owned Israel Shipyards up for sale by tender,
writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem.
The company, which had annual sales of Dollars 37m (Pounds 25m) in 1992,
builds and repairs ships for civilian and military uses and does repair
works for the US Sixth Fleet.
The sale is part of the Israeli government's privatisation programme for
1994 which aims to raise Dollars 1.5bn and includes selling companies such
as Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, Israel Chemicals and the state airline El Al.
The Finance Ministry said investors interested in Israel Shipyards must
submit bids by May 5 and that the sale would be completed within six months.
According to the tender documents, the buyers are obliged to keep the
concern as a shipping company and maintain existing labour agreements.
To privatise Israel Shipyards, in receivership since 1986, the government
had to forgive Dollars 140m of debt under an arrangement with the company's
creditors.

FT  06 APR 94 / Maghreb nations test EU's united front: No common mechanism
for handling powder-keg to the south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spiral of violence in Algeria is forcing European governments to brace
for the worst.
Last week France said it was closing its schools and cultural centres there,
after advising its 2,000 remaining expatriates to leave if possible. In
Brussels, the European Commission is worried the military government of
President Liamine Zeroual is losing control.
The possibility of a fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front government in
Algeria is no longer excluded, a prospect which could trigger instability
across North Africa, from neighbouring Morocco to Egypt. 'There could be a
domino effect,' said Mr Manuel Marin, senior Spanish commissioner who
controls trade and development policy towards the region. Mr Zeroual warned
the five-nation Arab Maghreb Union at the weekend they were all at threat
from Islamic fundamentalism.
The Algerian crisis provides a natural test for the European Union's
fledgling common foreign and security policy. But member states are still
wrangling over whether it should be funded from national budgets or the EU.
Without agreement, there is no common mechanism or concept for dealing with
the powder-keg to the south, a Brussels official says.
Instead, Algeria looks like turning into a case-study of how the interests
of EU nation states continue to take precedence over a common EU foreign
policy.
Five years ago, hopes were high that the European Commission could encourage
the 12 member states to forge a new common policy toward the Maghreb, which
embraces Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia as well as Libya and Mauritania.
The idea, spurred by an improbable Moroccan application to join the European
Community in 1987, was to 'anchor' the Maghreb to the EC through free trade
and closer political ties. The rough model was the EU's approach to former
communist states of central and eastern Europe, without the promise of
membership.
The new Maghreb policy envisaged a shift from development aid to assisting
small businesses in the hope of strengthening a nascent middle class, new
balance of payments loans to smooth over debt repayments, and a Euro-Maghreb
development bank modelled on the London-based European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. Most striking was its focus on human rights
and the progressive liberalisation of trade.
The momentum behind the so-called EU-Maghreb partnership has since been
lost. Some blame North African stubbornness in trade talks; others say the
collapse of the Algerian economy in the past two years has exposed earlier
hopes of closer relations as inflated. But the Europeans, including Mr
Marin, are also under fire.
North Africans say the EU's emphasis on human rights and democracy is
hypocritical. In January 1992, when the Algerian army suspended a second
round of elections which the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win,
Europe's capitals were virtually silent.
Mr Marin argues it is time to tilt EU foreign policy more toward the
Mediterranean rather than continue with the current preoccupation with
eastern Europe. Member states must look beyond immediate allies and clients
to the common interest. 'Just as the future of the Baltic states cannot be a
matter of interest only to Danes, Germans and British, so the fate of
Algeria and Egypt cannot be of interest only to France, Spain and Italy,' he
says.
Mr Marin's task is made more more difficult because member states usually
pursue short-term advantage, in the absence of firm guidance from the
Commission.
Last year Spain insisted on protecting its Andalusian fishermen before it
would agree to a new fisheries pact with Morocco. Madrid then copied French
strong-arm tactics in the Gatt talks, forcing its EU partners to agree to a
time extension for a minimum entry price for tomatoes, cucumbers and oranges
to the Canary Islands.
The result was a blow to Moroccan exporters, hardly softened by Spain's
claim it had to 'consolidate' the Canary Islands into the EU's Common
Agricultural Policy.
Efforts are now under way to secure compensation for Morocco; but Spain's
arguments in favour of extra EU money to support Morocco's balance of
payments are opposed by budget-conscious Germany and the UK.
Talks with Algeria are similarly vexed. The Commission remains unconvinced
about the regime's reform-mindedness. It is insisting that Algeria sign a
letter of intent with the IMF to allow rescheduling of its Dollars 26bn
(Pounds 17.5bn) external debt and pave the way for much-needed economic
restructuring. It also wants elections within two years.
Behind the scenes, the EU front looks less united. France is pressing its EU
partners to support a balance of payments loan of about Dollars 1bn to
Algeria, to offset lower oil prices. But the UK is sceptical about a shot in
the arm which could delay economic reform.
In fact, the Commission proposed a similar Dollars 800m loan in autumn 1990
to support Mr Mouloud Hamrouche, then the reformist prime minister. But the
French Treasury fought the idea. By the time President Francois Mitterrand
presented his own Dollars 600m loan initiative in July 1991, Mr Hamrouche
had been sacked. A golden opportunity was lost, senior Spanish and Italian
diplomats involved said.
Mr Marin still hopes he can wrap up partnership accords with Morocco and
Tunisia by the end of the year. Algeria could follow at a later date, but
only if the regime takes action to reform its banking sector, open up the
public sector and trim subsidies, he says.
Pressure for an early accord is high on both sides. In 1995 negotiations
begin on the Maghreb's share of the Delors II budget package, one year
before the EU's direct aid runs out.
Assistance could rise well above the present Ecu1.1bn (Pounds 859m)
five-year programme.
Few doubt that the wily Mr Marin will squeeze out more money for his own
budget. But Brussels officials concede the big challenge is to persuade
people in the Maghreb that they share an interest in economic reform, open
trade and closer relations with Europe, rather than Islamic fundamentalism.
'More must be done to stop the first domino falling,' says one Spanish
official.
Without such planning, the EU's dreams of a common foreign and security
policy risk foundering just as they did when the Union was confronted, and
failed to deal, with another crisis, in former Yugoslavia.

FT  06 APR 94 / Japan's current account surplus rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's politically troublesome current account surplus crept up in February
for the third month running, to an unadjusted Dollars 11.94bn (Pounds 8bn).
The increase, 0.1 per cent more than the Dollars 11.93bn recorded in the
same month of last year, was in line with market expectations and reflects
the sharp rise in the yen's value against the dollar in February.
This inflated the dollar value of exports and encouraged a rise in imports.
The February figure marks a slowdown in the rate of increase in the surplus,
from the 30.9 per cent year-on-year rise in January's current account gap.
The trade surplus rose 2.5 per cent over the same period, to Dollars 12.9bn.
That came on a 4.7 per cent increase in exports, to Dollars 28.8bn, and a
slightly stronger 6.5 per cent rise in imports to Japan, to Dollars 15.9bn,
a sign of a tentative pick-up in domestic demand.
In yen terms the surplus shrank 12.1 per cent from February 1993, to
Y1,268bn (Pounds 8.3bn). This decline in the yen value of the surplus will
continue, a Finance Ministry official forecast. Eventually the dollar value
of the surplus is expected to follow suit, as the high dollar price of
Japanese exports starts to erode sales.
Separately, machine tool orders fell 16.7 per cent in the year to Feb-ruary,
according to industry figures, indicating a pause in the slight recovery
shown in the previous month.
Foreign investors continued their buying spree of Japanese shares in
February, setting a new record, the Finance Ministry announced.
They bought a net Dollars 11.3bn of Japanese stocks, beating the previous
record, in January, of Dollars 10.5bn of net purchases. This completes an
eight-month run in which foreign institutions were net buyers, a factor in
the stock market's recent strength.

FT  06 APR 94 / Hosokawa meets his own Whitewater: Tokyo's version is more
than froth whipped up by the press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was wrestling yesterday with his
equivalent of the Whitewater affair which is currently plaguing US President
Bill Clinton.
Yet Tokyo's Whitewater is, unlike the Washington version as it so far
appears, more than mere froth whipped up by the press.
A newly aggressive Liberal Democratic party opposition has seized on
allegations that Mr Hosokawa failed to repay a Y100m (Pounds 657,000) loan
from Sagawa Kyubin, a disgraced parcel delivery company. The affair is more
than a year old, but the LDP has played it up, and unearthed more suspicions
about an allegedly shady share purchase, to test how vulnerable Mr Hosokawa
is. It could, warn coalition officials, precipitate Mr Hosokawa's
resignation or even herald the end of the divided seven-month old
government.
The LDP has not yet risked calling a vote of no confidence, but instead has
blocked, for the past month, Diet (lower house) debate on the annual budget,
until Mr Hosokawa disproves the allegations.
He has signally failed to produce a robust Clinton-type rebuff. Mr Hosokawa
has so far refused LDP demands to ask his former aide, who handled his
financial affairs, to testify in parliament and has been unable to produce
receipts showing he repaid the Y100m. As a result, Mr Hosokawa's denials of
wrongdoing have failed to convince more than four-fifths of the electorate,
according to a recent poll by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial newspaper.
The plot thickened yesterday when an investment consultant claimed he had
received a Y10m 'consulting fee' from the aide to keep quiet about a
purchase of shares on Mr Hosokawa's behalf in the privatised NTT
telecommunications company. Mr Hosokawa said he did not know about this.
Mr Hosokawa's alleged irregularities are venial by the spectacular standards
of previous Japanese political scandals. Yet senior members of the
seven-party coalition have in the past few days aired the prospect of a
cabinet resignation. 'There may be no other choice,' warns a senior member
of the Social Democratic party, the largest and most rebellious coalition
member.
Just how far the LDP wants to go is unclear, but the hunt is said by its own
senior officials to be the one project on which its divided factions agree.
The LDP knows from its own sore experience how effective holding the budget
hostage can be.
Only five years ago, its own then prime minister, Mr Noboru Takeshita, was
obliged to resign after the opposition of the time, led by the SDP, blocked
the 1989-1990 budget to force him to disclose more information about the
Recruit shares-for-favours scandal.
This battle comes at a time when the Japanese leader's popularity is already
waning. Voters' early hopes for a change in style and substance from the
first non-LDP government in nearly 40 years have begun to fade. Mr
Hosokawa's personal credibility has at the same time run into a barrage of
blows, of which Sagawa Kyubin is only the latest.
Since the turn of the year Mr Hosokawa, usually inspired by Mr Ichiro Ozawa,
his backroom strategist, has failed at least three times to impose his will
on the coalition, On each occasion the SDP forced him into a humiliating
U-turn.
This was true of his failed plans for a rise in consumption tax in February,
for a cabinet reshuffle last month and, more recently, for a merger of
coalition members into a single party. One political commentator yesterday
likened Mr Hosokawa to a becalmed warship taking hit after hit, but unable
to turn away from the guns.
This latest hit is especially dangerous because it threatens the prime
minister's main electoral asset; his image as an honest dealer able to break
with the corrupt politics of the LDP era. So it is no surprise that Mr
Hosokawa's popularity has plunged, to 47.6 per cent late last month from a
record high of 70 per cent when he took power last August, according to the
Nihon Keizai Shimbun poll.
Yet Mr Hosokawa's ability to ride through rough patches has surprised even
his own supporters, so he cannot be written off yet.
Even now, he is still far more popular than was Mr Takeshita when he faced a
similar problem at the end of his administration in 1989, or the LDP now.
For the opposition's budget-blocking tactics have aroused enough public
distaste to shave one point from its own popularity rating, down to 27 per
cent at the end of March.
While the LDP is aggressive, it is also painfully aware it is in poor shape
to fight another election. That was driven home last week when it lost a
gubernatorial election in the eastern prefecture of Ishikawa to the first
candidate backed by all coalition parties.
Shocked by this setback, 150 LDP politicians agreed three days later to sink
their traditional factional differences and form a group to 'revitalise' the
party under the leadership of Mr Taro Nakayama, a former foreign minister.
Mr Hosokawa, meanwhile, is said to have sunk into gloom, and begun to spend
an increasing amount of time on his own. It is anybody's guess when his
patience, or that of his supporters, will run out.

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday announced it was investigating its most prominent dissident
for 'new crimes' in a move that risks further inflaming international
criticism of its human rights behaviour.
In a terse announcement, the Beijing Public Security Bureau said Mr Wei
Jingsheng was 'being interrogated' for repeated violations of the law.
The statement, carried by the official Xinhua news agency, said Mr Wei was
'suspected of having committed new crimes when he was deprived of his rights
and on parole'. These serious allegations could lead to a fresh jail term
for the unofficial leader of China's fragmented dissident movement.
Mr Wei, 44, was released on six months' parole last September after serving
over 14 years of a 15-year sentence for allegedly transmitting military
secrets to a foreign reporter and for 'counter-revolutionary activities'.
The possible jailing under new charges of Mr Wei, who first came to
prominence in the pro-democracy agitation of the late 1970s, is certain to
complicate a decision by President Bill Clinton on renewal of China's lower
tariff access to the US market.
Mr Clinton said last year that a further extension of China's Most Favoured
Nation trading status depended on 'overall, significant improvement' in its
human rights behaviour. He is obliged to rule by early June on whether to
renew MFN.

FT  06 APR 94 / US presses for Pakistan nuclear deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, is due today to start a
three-day mission to India and Pakistan aimed mainly at promoting regional
nuclear non-proliferation.
Mr Talbott, the most senior Clinton administration official to visit south
Asia, will be seeking to persuade Pakistan to accept a controversial offer
from Washington of 38 F-16 fighters in return for a 'verifiable cap' on its
nuclear weapons programme.
Mr Talbott will also try to convince Indian officials to drop opposition to
the deal, arguing that the threat to India posed by the new jets would be
more than outweighed by the benefits of a cap on Pakistan's nuclear
programme.
Mr Talbott intends to offer India as yet unspecified incentives to cap its
own nuclear weapons programme. In each case this would involve halting
weapons development and ensuring that work on nuclear power would not
benefit a nuclear arms programme.
Washington's eventual goal is to arrange international nuclear security
talks, possibly including Britain, France, Russia and China, as well as
Pakistan, India and the US.
But deep mutual hostility between India and Pakistan, combined with
suspicion about US motives, could undermine Mr Talbott's prospects. There is
also opposition in the US Congress to tying arms sales to nuclear
non-proliferation.
The administration insists the offer of warplanes in return for a verifiable
cap on Pakistan's nuclear programme is a 'one-off deal', born of Pakistan's
special circumstances and not the forerunner of other 'guns-for-nukes'
transactions.
The 38 F-16s were ordered by Pakistan in the late 1980s and paid for. But
before they could be delivered, Congress in mid-1990 imposed an arms export
ban on Pakistan because of its refusal to abandon its nuclear weapons
programme. Washington had had for some time evidence of Pakistan's nuclear
capacity, but had refrained from taking action because it saw Pakistan as an
ally in the Afghanistan war.
Until earlier this year, Washington insisted Pakistan should not only halt
its nuclear programme but roll it back, meaning it should dismantle existing
bombs. Now the US seems ready to permit Islamabad to keep the bombs it
already has.
But Pakistani officials still have grave doubts, saying Pakistan will not
cap its programme unless India also does and the dispute between the two
countries over the troubled region of Kashmir is settled. Islamabad also
wants delivery of a further 34 F-16s it has ordered though not yet paid for,
plus assurances about future weapons supplies.
Meanwhile, India insists nuclear non-proliferation is a global rather than a
bilateral issue with Pakistan. Officials point out that Washington sold
Pakistan arms in the mid-1980s in return for pledges to refrain from making
nuclear bombs and Pakistan made the bombs anyway. They believe the same
would happen again.
In Washington, Senator Larry Pressler, the main congressional architect of
the arms export ban to nuclear-capable countries, said recently he could not
understand how supplying aircraft capable of delivering bombs to a country
which had nuclear bombs helped slow the arms race.

UN Bosnia commander General Sir Michael Rose is to travel to the UN 'safe
haven' around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia today after rebel Bosnian Serbs
closed in on the Moslem enclave following a week-long assault in which more
than 50 people have died. Gen Rose will be the first high-level western
official to visit the enclave since fighting began two years ago. The UN
will also send additional military observers immediately to the besieged
city and 1,000 Ukrainian peacekeeping troops within the next week or so.
Yesterday however, despite Serb artillery and tank columns advancing 10km
within the enclave, the US refused to sanction use of Nato air power against
the Serbs, at least for the time being. UN special representative Mr Yasushi
Akashi also plans to travel today to Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold, to
emphasise the UN's alarm at recent attacks by Serb forces and its intention
to hold Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, directly responsible.
The French charity Medecins sans Frontieres said Serb forces had broken
through Moslem lines and were 3.5km from the town.

A joint venture between Merck, the US pharmaceuticals company, and

The Commission had originally indicated that the venture, which plans to

breach EU competition rules. But officials said it was exempted because of
its potential public health benefits and because the companies had offered

Russian central bank officials have raided foreign exchange offices to force

criminals,' Mr Melnikov said. The central bank had checked the accounts of
about 900 exchange offices in Moscow opened by 101 commercial banks. Of
these, 165 offices did not correspond to 'civilised standards'.

Russia's Zil car plant, famous for making the black limousines used by the
Kremlin, is laying off more than 60,000 workers for a week because of a
financial crisis. Zil said non-payment by customers had forced the
suspension of the main production line at Zil, which also produces lorries.
Production fell to 100,000 units in 1993, from around 150,000 in 1992, and
the plant was forced to introduce a four-day week in January. Officials said
Zil, which sold part of its shares to the public in May 1993, needed an
immediate cash injection of at least Rbs30bn to stay afloat.

<TEXT>
Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former Russian vice-president and recently
released coup plotter, said yesterday he would fight to remove President
Boris Yeltsin by legal means. His voice joins a growing opposition to Mr
Yeltsin's efforts to achieve consensus. In an interview in the pro-Communist
Pravda, Mr Rutskoi said: 'We must stop playing with consensus or agreements
and get down to work - to change the authorities by legal means.' Mr Rutskoi
is positioning himself to run for president in the next elections.
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Liberal Democrat leader who is also a declared
candidate for the presidency, has said he sees Mr Rutskoi as his greatest
challenge. Mr Yeltsin has been trying to get an agreement with the
parliament on a 'Memorandum on Civil Accord'. But Mr Gennady Zyuganov,
leader of the Communist party, last week dismissed the accord, saying he
could not accept its moratorium on changes to the constitution.

FT  06 APR 94 / Idle model city mourns a very Swedish past: A look at a
miracle cure that was no help at all for Uddevalla's ailing fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few more forlorn sights in Sweden than the waterfront at
Uddevalla, once a thriving shipbuilding city standing at the head of a deep
inlet along the country's rugged west coast.
Wharfside cranes stand idle and rusting, their jibs dipped mournfully
towards the water. The big dry dock lies half-flooded and deserted. Old
brick-built workshops nearby are empty and silent.
It is a scene familiar from other former shipyard towns in northern Europe.
But just across from the dry dock is a sight that makes the plight of
Uddevalla especially poignant. There stands a huge factory built less than
10 years ago by Volvo, the car manufacturer. It was to have revitalised the
city just as the old ship building industry collapsed. But now it, too, is
an empty shell.
Uddevalla, a city of 48,000 people, was supposed to be a shining example of
what became known as the 'Swedish model'. In the 1980s, while the rest of
western Europe began to struggle with high unemployment caused by the
decline of traditional heavy industries, Sweden managed to keep jobless
rates enviably low by a mixture of close co-operation between government,
employers and trade unions and generous retraining schemes.
Faced with the closure of the state-owned shipyard in Uddevalla, the Social
Democratic government used its clout - and some well-aimed incentives - to
nudge Volvo into opening a car plant in the city. Volvo, at the time
extremely profitable and keen to put into practice pioneering car making
techniques which did away with tedious assembly line work, was happy to
oblige.
It seemed like the perfect solution. Unemployment in Uddevalla actually fell
after the shipyard laid off the last of its 4,500 workers in 1986 - to less
than 2 per cent of the local workforce. Hotels sprang up and small companies
moved in, encouraged by the Volvo investment.
But those heady days proved to be a false dawn. Crippled by falling car
sales, Volvo closed its Uddevalla plant last year.
Unemployment in Uddevalla now stands at around 15 per cent - above the
national average. The 'Swedish model' has given way to a painful reality
that is no different from the experience of other recession-struck European
countries.
Officials at the Uddevalla Kommune (city council) admit they feel betrayed -
and abandoned. 'Now the government says the market must decide,' says a
bitter Mr Leif Molander, an elected member of the kommune board. But he and
his colleagues are also realistic. 'It seemed like a good solution at the
time,' shrugs Mr Lars Bjorneld, the planning director. 'The problem was that
Volvo couldn't sell enough cars.'
In retrospect it is clear that the substitution of the Volvo plant for the
shipyard was never as neat a solution as it appeared. Original plans to
include a body and paint factory at the Volvo plant were dropped because of
a row over emissions from the paint shop.
The assembly plant, which employed 930 people at its peak with an annual
output capacity of 40,000 cars, did not start real production until August
1988, two years after the shipyard closed. By then most of the shipyard
workers had found other work, leaving Volvo with a recruitment problem.
'In 1986 we had to say No to a number of very good people from the shipyard
looking for work because we were not ready for them,' says Mr Bengt
Berntsson, a Volvo executive now seeking new tenants for the 100,000 sq
metre factory. 'Later, when we needed them, they weren't there any more.'
This was especially ironic as much of the motivation behind Volvo's decision
to built the Uddevalla plant, with its unique production system of small
teams building whole cars, was to reduce the chronic problems of labour
turnover and absenteeism it was experiencing at its headquarters in
Gothenburg.
A keen debate persists within the motor industry over the viability of the
team-based system. But the harsh reality was that a crash in Volvo sales
left the company with 30 per cent excess capacity and in November 1992 it
decided to close two of its three Swedish assembly plants.
Uddevalla was abruptly exposed to Sweden's recession. Jobs disappeared at an
alarming rate as former stalwarts such as the construction industry slumped.
The government, too, had changed. In place of the interventionist Social
Democrats was a right-centre coalition under Prime Minister Carl Bildt whose
recipe for making Sweden competitive again was a radical dose of market
policies.
After two years of reform and a big currency devaluation, growth is
returning, but domestic investment is lagging and there has been a wave of
overseas investment by Swedish companies. Volvo has production plants in
Belgium and the Netherlands. SKF, the big ball bearing maker which grew up
in Sweden's west, now produces only 10 per cent of its output in Sweden.
The biggest employers in Uddevalla are the kommune itself and the local
health service. 'Our problem is that we need a large industry that can
employ a lot of people as an anchor around which we can build,' says Mr
Molander. Uddevalla is currently working with a private group on the
possibility of re-opening the shipyard.
But it is a project that would require an investment of SKr3bn (Pounds 260m)
and Mr Molander admits it is a long shot.
An example of the way forward for the city seems more likely to be found in
a small corner of the Volvo factory where Mr Bengt Bengtsson and two former
colleagues from Volvo have set up a small components-sorting company
employing 15 people.
'It is not realistic to go back to shipbuilding,' says Mr Bengtsson. He
speaks not just for Uddevalla but for all of Sweden when he says: 'The
mentality has to change. There is no tradition of small industry. We still
have a high cost base in Sweden. But we have good educated people who are
flexible and do not need a lot of management. The future lies in smaller
businesses, not big industries.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial ouput in west Germany grew 1 per cent in February over January,
but year-on-year figures suggested that while exports were up, domestic
demand remained flat. Output in January and February together grew 0.1 per
cent against the same period last year. Production of investment goods and
consumer goods, key indicators of domestic demand, fell 1.1 and 2.9 per cent
respectively. Only raw materials showed significant growth, with output up
4.3 per cent year-on-year, driven by increased export orders. Year-on-year
growth of 3.3 per cent in construction was higher than expected, although
bad weather was blamed for a 7 per cent fall in February over January.
Michael Lindemann, Bonn.
The Association of European Airlines members' worldwide scheduled passenger
traffic was 9.9 per cent higher in February against a year earlier, at
21.4bn passenger kilometres.
The Greek wholesale price index rose by 1.2 per cent in February, taking the
annual rise to 8.8 per cent.
French car registrations were 14.3 per cent higher in March against a year
earlier, at 188,600 units.

French unions threatened to close leading museums in a 24-hour strike

The CFDT trade union said the stoppage could close the Louvre and Orsay

severe disruption at other museums. The four unions involved say the 2,500
museum staff are getting insufficient reward for increasingly complex

FT  06 APR 94 / Russians in oil export revenue trap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia is caught in a vice between falling oil prices and its inability to
raise oil exports to compensate for the loss in revenue, according to its
trade minister.
Exports of raw materials, of which oil is the largest component, now made up
some 80 per cent of all Russian exports, Mr Oleg Davydov said in an
interview to the Nezavisimaya Gazeta yesterday.
It was 'economically senseless' to keep increasing the volume of exports as
prices fell, he said. Prices are currently around Dollars 13-Dollars 14 a
barrel.
Mr Davydov said the rapid fall in industrial production had led to a decline
in other Russian exports, especially in the engineering industry.
'The slow process of restructuring in industry doesn't allow us to to change
the structure of exports: the share of exports taken by engineering and
equipment in 1993 made up only 7 per cent of the total,' he said.
However, a sharp cutback in imports led to a trade surplus last year of
Dollars 16bn - with exports of Dollars 43bn and imports of Dollars 27bn - up
from a Dollars 5bn surplus in 1992.
These surpluses had helped support the rate of the rouble against the dollar
and paid off part of Russian's foreign debt obligations, Mr Davydov said.
But the trade minister quashed hopes by western companies and Russian
importers that the high tariffs announced last month would soon be removed.
President Boris Yeltsin has publicly expressed reservations about the
tariffs and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, last week told Mr
Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, that they would be reviewed. But Mr
Davydov said 'it makes no sense to change the tariffs so quickly', although
he did admit that Russia's application for membership of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would be made more difficult by their
retention.
Russia should anyway continue to press for membership, he said, in view of
the 20 anti-dumping actions now being taken against it. Joining Gatt would
protect Russia from such unilateral actions, he said, since Gatt members
would have to follow a formal procedure before introducing sanctions.
He said that Russia should insist on special terms within Gatt for the
fellow members of the Commonwealth of Independent States - or first form a
customs-free zone with these states and enter Gatt together.
He warned, however, that economic integration with Russia meant 'the loss of
a certain part of sovereignty. It's obvious that the former Soviet states
still have one thing in mind - receiving energy resources from Russia for
the same (subsidised) price as in the Russian internal market'.
Meanwhile, Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the Russian central bank chairman, said
he might lower interest rates later this month. Pointing to a fall in
inflation, he said he hoped to halve interest rates by the end of the year.
Mr Gerashchenko was speaking at lower chamber hearings on the 1994 budget,
on the same day that the upper chamber of parliament was finally cajoled
into approving a temporary second quarter budget pending the approval of the
budget for the entire year.
The present discount rate of 210 per cent could be lowered while still
exceeding the rate of inflation, he said. The discount rate is now about
5-10 percentage points higher than inflation, representing a relatively high
real interest rate. For part of last year the interest rate charged to
commercial banks was negative in real terms as the central bank held off
from passing high interest rates onto ailing enterprises.

FT  06 APR 94 / Airbus insurers await crash inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Aviation Insurance Group, which led the underwriting for the
Russian-leased Airbus which crashed last month, said yesterday it was 'too
early to make a judgement' about reports that the pilot's son was at the
controls before the crash. Mr Graham Lilley, senior underwriter, said they
would wait for the results of the investigation before even considering
whether insurance premiums for Russian International Airlines, the operator,
would go up.
The claim for the hull of the aircraft alone is likely to cost insurers
Dollars 78m (Pounds 53m). There will be an additional but probably smaller
amount for liability insurance, which covers the 75 passengers, and baggage
and freight.
The crashed Airbus was one of five insured last July for around Dollars 400m
for the hulls. The risk was placed by Russian insurance company Lex Garant
through London insurance broker Willis Corroon.
Other US and European aviation specialists shared the risk.

FT  06 APR 94 / German jobs market faces shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ulrich Cartellieri, Deutsche Bank director, last week poked an
uncomfortable finger into the guts of Germany's most testing economic
problem: structural unemployment. The number of jobless in the country would
increase from current record levels by a further 500,000 to 4.5m this year,
he said.
Few believe it will stop there. Even economists who base their forecasts on
comparisons with previous recessions say an end to the cuts is unlikely at
least until mid-1995. But past experience is not a reliable yardstick. The
cyclical nosedive that started in late 1992 exposed chronic structural
deficiencies - most noticeably over-manning and over-payment - which had
made much of west German industry uncompetitive.
The employers' response has generated widespread concern that unemployment
is leading to a structural labour market crisis rather than a temporary,
cyclical hangover. As Mr Cartellieri put it, the dole queues were the
visible reflection of Germany's deficiencies as a place to do business.
By mid-1992, when international competitors had absorbed the worst of
recession and were under way with restructuring, west Germany GmbH was still
hiring and paying extravagant wage awards in response to the short-lived
reunification boom in demand for everything from cars to biscuits. Unit
labour costs rose 16 per cent relative to those in other industrial
countries between 1989 and 1993, and numbers employed increased 1.4m.
The correction, as the unemployment figures and this year's sub-inflation
pay awards show, has been sharp and painful. Available evidence suggests the
pain is far from over. Even assuming one or two more years of pay restraint,
as happened after the recession in the early 1980s, indications from west
German industrial companies suggest none is contemplating hiring in the
foreseeable future. Even though most are forecasting improved earnings, all
are continuing to wield the axe which has already chopped 14 per cent of the
region's manufacturing jobs.
The wholesale transfer of jobs abroad is also gathering pace. Low-tech,
labour-intensive work is being shifted into eastern Europe. Investors,
having decided that proximity to markets is worth more than the vaunted
'Made in Germany' label, are building plants abroad for everything from
chemicals to BMW cars.
Mr Cartellieri's finger pointed to two areas where there is real room for
job creation: the under-developed service sector and part-time work. In
passing, it delivered a sharp prod to the country's legislators whose rule
books, he said, 'hamper the establishment of the simplest entrepreneurial
initiative'.
As he indicated, antiquated restrictions on shopping hours made little sense
in a country where 300,000 unemployed women were looking for part-time work.
The greatest and most fruitful prospects appear to lie in services. Official
figures show between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of west Germans still earn
their keep in industry, compared with around 30 per cent elsewhere in the
European Union. Unofficial figures from the Institut der Deutschen
Wirtschaft (IWD) in Cologne give the lie to a persistent German belief that
anything which is not screwed together or has no wheels is of inferior
value. It estimates that employees in all service industries, except
retailing, now generate more added-value per head than manufacturing's
overall DM90,000 (Pounds 35,000) a year. Banking and insurance workers top
the rankings with DM160,000. More encouragingly, it discovered that
two-thirds of all the new jobs created in the 1980s boom emerged in the
official catch-all category of 'other services', ranging from healthcare to
film developing.
On the same theme, the Basle-based Prognos forecasting institute said the
next 15 years could see the creation of some 2.5m new service jobs. That
might eventually cover the losses mounting up as traditional industries
restructure. If government responds to the proddings for deregulation from
Mr Cartellieri and others, Germany GmbH might even come out of the crisis
with its enviable post-war employment record intact.

FT  06 APR 94 / Embargo strangles Macedonia: Kerin Hope reports from
Bogdanci on the damaging effects of the Greek blockade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Costs have soared for producers of spring cucumbers and tomatoes in
Bogdanci, a village in southern Macedonia just across the border from
Greece, since the Greek government imposed a trade embargo on the former
Yugoslav republic two months ago.
Mr Gjorgi Icev, financial director of Izvorski, the region's biggest
exporter with 24 hectares of greenhouses, says: 'Fuel for greenhouse heating
and all our pesticides were delivered from Greece. Now everything has to
make a detour through Bulgaria. It's a ludicrous situation.'
The embargo was intended to force Macedonia into making concessions in the
dispute with Greece over its flag and constitution, both seen in Athens as
signalling expansionist designs on the northern Greek province of Macedonia.
It is having a disastrous effect on the Macedonian economy, already
struggling as a result of UN sanctions against Serbia, formerly its main
trading partner, and the demands of a stabilisation programme backed by the
International Monetary Fund.
However, separate mediation efforts by the United States and the European
Commission, aimed at restarting bilateral talks under UN auspices, have
failed to persuade either Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minster, or
Mr Kiro Gligorov, the Macedonian president, to shift their positions.
Greece, already accused by several EU partners of trying to destabilise
Macedonia through the blockade, is now threatened with a European Court
action on grounds of violating the Rome and Maastricht treaty requirements
on the free movement of goods.
Macedonia estimates the embargo is costing about Dollars 80m (Pounds 54.7m)
monthly in lost exports and higher transport charges for shipping goods
through the Black Sea port of Burgas in Bulgaria and Durres in Albania, a
figure equivalent to about 85 per cent of average monthly export earnings.
Few exporters were as prescient as Izvorski, which abandoned plans to truck
this season's early vegetables through Greece in favour of setting up a
joint venture with a Vienna-based trading company to air freight about DM10m
(Pounds 3.8m) of produce to markets in central and eastern Europe.
Macedonia's heavy industry, already in steep decline after losing markets in
the rest of the former Yugoslavia, is grinding to a halt. The
state-controlled steelworks in Skopje, the country's largest employer, shut
down last month with the loss of around 8,000 jobs. Other large state
enterprises which relied on a rail link with the northern Greek port of
Thessaloniki appear close to collapse.
After shrinking by 15 per cent in 1993, Macedonia's gross domestic product
was projected to decline by another 8 per cent this year. Per capita income
dropped to around Dollars 700 last year, while the yearly inflation rate is
around 70 per cent.
Yet despite the economic cost, the Skopje government is set for a prolonged
stand-off rather than give in to Greece's demands that Macedonia change the
symbol on its flag, associated with the ancient Greek kings of Macedonia, or
amend the constitution to suit Greek sensitivities.
'Even if the Greeks lifted the embargo tomorrow, how do we know they won't
impose it again? We have to reduce our dependence on Thessaloniki,' says Mr
Hari Kostov, deputy finance minister.
The government says there is enough oil stockpiled to meet requirements for
another two months, long enough to set up a fleet of tanker trucks to import
petroleum products from Bulgarian refineries.
Meanwhile, a search is on for bridge funding to build a 65km rail link with
Bulgaria, to carry crude oil for the Skopje refinery and raw materials. The
Dollars 120m project could be completed in nine months, as Macedonia's
state-controlled construction and engineering companies have few contracts
at present.
After repaying its share of the former Yugoslavia's debt to the World Bank,
amounting to Dollars 106m, Macedonia is eligible for Dollars 80m in fresh
loans, but is unlikely to start drawing down funds until next year.

FT  06 APR 94 / Bristol &amp; West head was paid almost Pounds 1/2 m to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH

<TEXT>
Bristol &amp; West, the UK's tenth largest building society, has paid out almost
Pounds 500,000 in compensation for loss of office to its former chief
executive, a near-record payment for a building society.
Mr Tony FitzSimons, who left abruptly last September, received Pounds
415,000 in compensation for loss of salary, and a further Pounds 69,000 in
enhanced pension contributions.
The society's annual report and accounts also reveal that Bristol &amp; West has
a three-year contract with a company run by Mr FitzSimons for consultancy
services at a rate of Pounds 50,000 a year.
The society's 1992 results saw a drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 39.1m
from Pounds 67.4m, as it had to triple provisions for possible bad debts on
mortgage lending to Pounds 74.1m, having been badly hit by the fall in house
prices in the south of England.
Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at stockbroker UBS, said that
Bristol &amp; West had been 'dogged by over-expansionist lending in the heady
days of 1989 and 1990, and over-zealous spending both on acquisitions -
notably Hamptons, the estate agency - and on technology in the branch
network'.
This had resulted, he said, in a loss of confidence in a traditionally
strong society, although under Mr John Burke, formerly deputy chief
executive who succeeded Mr FitzSimons, the society's performance was already
improving.
From his appointment as chief executive in spring 1989 to his resignation
last autumn, Mr FitzSimons was a controversial figure. In December 1992, for
example, he said that Bristol &amp; West would become the first society to price
new mortgages according to the borrower's age and family status.
The payments to Mr FitzSimons - who served less than five years - are
rivalled only by the Pounds 641,000 paid to Mr Scott Durward, who resigned
from Alliance &amp; Leicester, the UK's fourth largest society, in 1991 after
ten years as chief executive.
A more typical payment to an executive director leaving a large society
would be about Pounds 250,000.
Bristol &amp; West said yesterday that the board thought it was 'in the
society's interest' to make it possible for Mr FitzSimons to depart without
being required to serve out his two-year notice period, and the compensation
payments reflected this.
Bristol &amp; West said there had been other occasions, though not at chief
executive level, when a senior executive who had left the society had
undertaken consultancy work because of specialised knowledge and experience.
Going through a tendering process before awarding a contract to Mr
FitzSimons' company 'would not have been relevant', it said.
The society's 1993 results, announced last month, showed both the scale of
its poor results and the beginnings of recovery. Its pre-tax profits rose to
Pounds 41.3m, helped by a fall in bad debt provisions to Pounds 63.3m, while
its 1992 results were restated - in the light of new accounting standards -
as just Pounds 14m.

FT  06 APR 94 / Berlusconi suspends talks on forming a government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, yesterday suspended talks
on the formation of a new government after failing to convince the members
of his rightwing political alliance to join him in a coalition.
The suspension brings to an end only the first phase of manoeuvring among
the three parties which won the most seats in last week's general election,
but the announcement sent Italian government bond futures into a tailspin in
late trading on Liffe, London's futures exchange.
Changing his negotiating tack, Mr Berlusconi, who heads the rightwing
Freedom Alliance, said talks would resume once Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the
Italian president, had chosen a new prime minister. He cannot do that until
after parliament reconvenes on April 15.
Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the populist Northern League and the
neo-fascist National Alliance will have a majority in the lower chamber of
Italy's parliament when the new deputies take their seats, and a
near-majority in the upper house.
But the electoral pact between the three parties has been threatened since
the election by internal tension, heightened by the repeated acid comments
of Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader. He criticised Mr Berlusconi's
suspension of the talks, suggesting that the media magnate had 'lost his
nerve'.
Mr Berlusconi yesterday called off a meeting between senior League and Forza
Italia officials, due to take place today. 'We're not going to go to the
League, nor anywhere else,' he said. 'We're not betraying them, we're
waiting for the president to give his opinion.'
Earlier Mr Bossi accused the leader of Forza Italia, who also controls a
clutch of television stations, of manipulating public opinion.
He also criticised Mr Berlusconi for bringing a non-politician - Mr Gianni
Letta, a senior executive of Fininvest, his media and publishing group - to
a meeting last week between the League and Forza Italia. Mr Bossi had
snubbed Mr Berlusconi by not attending that meeting.
Talks among the parties do not have to begin until Mr Scalfaro has chosen
someone to form a government. Mr Berlusconi's new tactic could calm the
situation, but it could put pressure on Mr Bossi to apologise for his
attacks.

FT  06 APR 94 / US stocks and bonds rise sharply: First significant advance
in trading since Federal Reserve's move on interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US stocks and bonds rose sharply yesterday helped by stronger European
markets, confounding some commentators' predictions of a widespread sell-off
following Wall Street's steep fall on Monday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 82.06 points higher at 3,675.41,
while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 9.36 to 448.28.
The price of the benchmark 30- year US government long bond was also sharply
higher late in the session, sending the yield down by nearly 17 basis points
to 7.238 per cent, as buyers were coaxed back into the market.
It was the first big advance by US stocks since before the Federal Reserve
lifted short-term interest rates by a quarter point to 3.5 per cent on March
22.
Analysts said the New York market was ripe for a rebound after losing about
276 points in the last seven sessions. The Dow lost more than 42 points on
Monday in reaction to news of a sharp rise in the March employment figures,
announced on Friday, fuelling worries that the Fed might raise rates again
in a bid to prevent the economy from overheating.
A small dip in February in the US Commerce Department's main economic
forecasting index helped ease these fears yesterday, although forecasters
predict a rebound in March's index as a result of warmer weather. The index
of leading economic indicators dropped by 0.1 per cent after rising for six
months in a row, the Commerce Department said.
However, yesterday's Wall Street rally was driven mostly by bargain hunting,
rather than any change in the fundamental economic outlook. 'It's a rally in
a bear market,' said Mr Michael Metz of Oppenheimer &amp; Co in New York.
'With the markets getting hammered nearly every day, they needed to take a
rest yesterday,' said Mr Chris Moore, senior bond market analyst at
Technical Data in Boston. He predicted the yield on the long bond, after
briefly hovering at current levels, would soon begin rising again.
The London market lived up to its recent reputation for volatility, with the
FT-SE 100 index moving through a range of nearly 70 points before closing up
29.8 at 3,116.2. UK gilts finished lower on the day despite the recovery in
the afternoon. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX index closed up 25.18 at
2,158.29.
In Tokyo, stocks earlier ended a quiet session just off the day's high. The
Nikkei average closed up 440.99 points or 2.31 per cent at 19,563.21 points.
In early trading today it had added about 275 points.
The improved tone in the bond and equity markets spilled over into a firmer
dollar. The US currency was trading at DM1.71445 in late activity in New
York, up from an early low of DM1.6910 in London, and nearly 3 pfennigs up
from DM1.6788 before the long weekend.
Some of the strength reflected follow-on buying from Friday when European
markets were closed and unable to respond to the strong employment figures.
Analysts were cautious, however, to herald a turnround in the dollar's
fortunes. 'Price activity in the last few weeks has been a case of two steps
forward, three steps back,' said Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at
Chase Manhattan.

FT  06 APR 94 / Power chief calls for review of regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radical changes in the way Britain's utility industries are regulated are
called for today by the chief executive of National Power, the UK's biggest
electricity generator.
Mr John Baker wants tribunals of three to five members to replace single
regulators. Writing in today's Financial Times, Mr Baker also suggests that
the regulators should be brought together in a common organisation with
colleagues from other industries and that their deliberations should be more
open.
Mr Baker's article fuels a growing debate about utility regulation.
Controversy will intensify this year and next as the number of industries
affected by regulation grows through privatisation of the coal and rail
sectors.
Regulators will also reach conclusions this summer on their reviews of water
and electricity distribution industries. The results will be compared with a
recent review of rates of return in the gas industry. The water review is
causing acute concern among fund managers, two of who are urging water
companies to appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission rather than
accept severe price limits.
Mr Baker compares the UK regulatory regime with that in the US and, while
criticising the US system as 'burdensome' and for promoting central
planning, says Britain could 'learn something from the Americans'.
Drawing on US practice of regulatory commissions with three to five members,
Mr Baker suggests tribunals, rather than single regulators, would remove the
'cult of the personality'.
A common organisation for the various regulators would 'enable the quality
of support staff to be raised and to transfer experience between
industries'.
Mr Baker calls for: a precise definition of the role of regulation;
publication by regulators of 'strategic plans' of their objections; greater
use of public hearings; and quick appeals procedures.

FT  05 APR 94 / Northrop wins battle for Grumman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Northrop yesterday emerged the victor in the battle for control of US
defence company Grumman, after rival bidder Martin Marietta declined to
raise its own bid for the company.
Northrop increased its offer for the company to Dollars 62 a share, even
though, at Dollars 60 a share, it had already made the higher bid ahead of a
Friday afternoon deadline for offers set by the Grumman board.
Martin Marietta, which a month ago sparked the battle by announcing an
agreed Dollars 55 takeover of Grumman, said it was not in its shareholders'
interests to increase its own offer.
The Northrop bid, which values Grumman at nearly Dollars 2.2bn, marks one of
the largest acquisitions yet in the US defence sector, where mergers are
being driven by falling defence spending.
Analysts said that they expected other takeovers to follow, with the most
likely acquisition candidates being defence divisions of larger corporations
looking to leave the business.
Northrops' share price dropped more than 5 per cent yesterday morning on
news of its increased offer, against a background of a weak stock market.
By lunchtime in New York, Northrop shares had fallen Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 37 3/4 .
Mr Kent Kresa, the chairman of Northrop, insisted that his company was
paying 'a fair price for Grumman, one that will enable us to enhance
profitability in the long term, beginning next year'.
The deal would not affect Northrop's earnings this year, and would begin to
increase its earnings per share in 1995, he said.
On completion of the tender offer, which has been extended to April 15, the
company will be renamed Northrop Grumman.
Martin Marietta said it had received a Dollars 50m termination fee from
Grumman, which had been agreed at the time of their original merger accord,
and that is was also seeking Dollars 8.8m to cover its costs in the bid
battle.
Yesterday, Martin Marietta reiterated its intention to make acquisitions
when opportunities arose.
Mr Norman Augustine, the company's chairman, has been one of the most
vociferous advocates of mergers in the defence sector, and has already
engineered the takeovers of the aerospace division of General Electric and
the space division of General Dynamics in recent months.
Northrop said in a statement that it and Grumman would have had combined
1993 sales of more than Dollars 8bn, more than 40,000 employees and a
business backlog in excess of Dollars 13bn.
Mr Kent Kresa, Northrop chairman, said: 'This merger will enable Northrop to
pursue its primary business objectives of being a key member of the nation's
defence industrial team well into the 21st century.'

FT  05 APR 94 / Nurturing a landless nation: Judy Dempsey visits the
displaced Sorb people of Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The children hardly said a word. Frowning with concentration, they dipped
their goose-feather quills into a warm jar of honey-comb wax to mark areas
of natural colour on egg shells. Then they started drawing elaborate designs
on the shells with dyes, before covering them with grease to make them
shiny.
Like their parents, the children were dressed in the traditional bright
clothes of the Sorbs, as they prepared for Easter Sunday in the German
hamlet of Neuwiese in Saxony.
'When you paint three crosses on the egg, it's a sign that you want to keep
the evil spirits away,' said Mrs Slyvia Panoscha. 'When you paint a star
with six corners, it is to thank the bees for the honey and wax.
'When you paint a star on top of the egg, it symbolises life. We are brought
up knowing these things. I hope the traditions will live on with these
children here.'
The Sorbs are descendents of the west Slavs who migrated from the Carpathian
mountains in northern Romania and made their way northwards to the river
Elbe. They now live in Upper and Lower Lusatia, straddling the states of
Brandenburg and Saxony.
They number fewer than 60,000 but senior members of the Sorb community
believe they are witnessing something of a revival since German unification.
Few, however, have any illusions about the difficulties in protecting a
community which has undergone natural, and forced, assimilation.
'As an ethnic group, we were always under pressure,' said Johann Kaspar, a
62-year-old Sorb who speaks a Slav language closer to Czech than to Polish.
'Thousands emigrated for economic reasons in the 19th century,' said Mr
Bernhard Ziesch, a senior member of the Domowina, or Association for Sorbs
based in Bautzen.
Many settled in Texas in the US, or in Australia - 'but we still kept out
culture alive through music, dance, song and customs. It was hard. Those who
remained had to find work in the brown-coal mines and move to the cities.
They soon became completely Germanised. They intermarried. They lost their
identity as Sorbs.'
He and Mr Kaspar believe, however, the Sorbs suffered most under the Nazis.
'I was just a boy at the time,' said Mr Kaspar, 'and I remember that the
Sorb schools were closed. We were forbidden to speak the language in public.
But my parents kept speaking Sorb at home and so did I'
When the East German communist party was established in 1949, the Sorb
language and culture were allowed again, schools were re-opened, public
signs were bi-lingual. But the Sorbs were not allowed any links with the
diaspora.
According to Mr Ziesch, there are about 125,000 Sorbs world-wide. 'It is
only since the Wende, or change, in 1989, that we can set up cultural links
with our fellow Sorbs throughout the world,' he says.
Unification also led to the states of Brandenburg and Saxony ensuring that
Sorbs could attend schools in their own language. There are now seven
primary schools and six secondary schools for the Sorbs, and about 50 mixed
German and Sorb schools.
But the assimilation has not been halted. 'With German unification, the
children now want to watch video games and all that sort of thing,' said
65-year-old Mrs Magdelene Balting, whose son Lotar, 45 and unemployed,
cannot speak Sorb.
'I was posted in the army, and was later a policeman, so I just spoke
German,' he says.
Even the fervent Mr Kaspar, who speaks German with a thick Slav accent, said
it was a struggle trying to get his own children to speak Sorb. 'I married,
but she is a German, not a Sorb. . . The German language won the day]'
Yet as the children painted the egg shells throughout the afternoon, many of
their parents said they were confident they would learn Sorb. Ms Barbara
Krahal, a shop assistant, and Ms Kirstin Bohm, an architect, feel they are
Sorbs. 'Our citizenship is German, but our nationality is Sorb, and I hope
our children will feel themselves to be Sorb.'
'It is up to us, as parents, to keep the culture alive,' said Ms Bohm. 'Now
that we have all the freedom to do so, it might be harder, but the signs are
that the children do want to learn about our past and traditions, as they
are doing today in this hall.'
Little Horst was not so sure. He spoke a few words of Sorb, telling me he
had only one hour left to finish painting the Easter eggs, so he had to keep
quiet and concentrate. Before he broke off, however, he said that, if I
wanted to buy any of the eggs, they would cost DM1 (60 US cents) each. This
he said in German.

The contest between Crimea and the Ukrainian government over who rules the

Kiev. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, annulled a March 15
decree by the Crimean President Yuri Meshkov, which stated that Crimean

dispatched by the Ukrainian command.
Meanwhile, Crimea contested the legitimacy of Mr Kravchuk's March 31

FT  05 APR 94 / Israel steps up troop withdrawals: Move out of occupied
territories boosts peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Middle East peace efforts gained urgency yesterday as Israel stepped up
withdrawing and redeploying troops and equipment in the occupied territories
in preparation for Palestinian self-rule and the arrival of the first
contingent of Palestinian policemen.
The move will add momentum to regional peace talks after months of delay and
bitter wrangling and marks Israel's first concrete steps towards winding
down more than a quarter century of occupation of the territories, where
1.9m Palestinians live.
Israel's actions bolstered the confidence of Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine
Liberation Organisation leader, who said he was making plans to return to
the territories next month and be based in Jericho.
The rapidly unfolding Israeli withdrawal also caused Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, concerned that Israeli-Palestinian progress would leave
Syrian-Israeli talks in a backwater, to fly to Cairo for talks with Egyptian
president Hosni Mubarak.
In both the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, soldiers yesterday
loaded up equipment and furniture on to trucks and evacuated prisons, police
and military facilities to prepare for up to 500 Palestinian policemen
expected to arrive this week. Palestinians also said the Israeli army was
close to completing the evacuation of 600 prisoners from the Ansar II prison
camp in Gaza city to a detention facility in Israel's Negev desert. The
Ansar camp is to be used by Palestinian policemen as a training and command
centre.
Some Palestinian youths stoned soldiers packing up equipment, but at other
places crowds of teenagers gathered round the departing Israeli troops
clapping and chanting Palestinian nationalist slogans. PLO leaders welcomed
the long-awaited change on the ground. 'It can be seen that the Israel army
is evacuating a lot of areas, thinning out many forces,' Mr Soufian Abu
Zayda, a PLO official in Gaza, told Israel radio. 'That says the agreement
is beginning to be implemented in the field. That is what is important.'
Israeli military officials said the government had instructed them to be
prepared to complete evacuation of the Gaza-Jericho area by April 14  - the
date originally agreed in the peace accord signed last September. The army
said it had been told the final evacuation moves should be finished five
days after Israel and the PLO conclude negotiations under way in Cairo on a
self-rule agreement for Gaza-Jericho.
Mr Nabil Shaath, chief PLO negotiator in Cairo, said he foresaw smooth
progress and expected agreement within two weeks. However Mr Yossi Sarid,
Israeli minister of the environment, said he expected the Cairo talks would
only be finalised by the end of April allowing for a Israeli military
withdrawal to be completed two or three days later.
Talks on the deployment of the first contingent of Palestinian police
continued into the night in Cairo, with the PLO drafting into the
negotiations two of its most senior military officers, Major-Generals Nasr
Youssef and Abderazzak al-Yahya. PLO officials have said they expect a force
of more than 400 men to arrive in Gaza and Jericho 'within a week' with an
advance party of officers due in earlier.
Officials from Norway, Denmark and Italy, which are to supply the 160
international observers for Hebron, also met yesterday in the Egyptian
capital, but gave no indication when the first of their officers would
arrive in the West Bank town. Israel also said it would allow 46 Palestinian
activists deported from the territories for political activity to return to
their homes today. The deportees are expected to cross from Jordan into the
West Bank and from Egypt into Gaza.
Reflecting the stepped-up pace of negotiations in recent days, Mr Arafat
told Palestinian students yesterday of his plan to return to his Palestinian
homeland next month, saying he would be based in Jericho. For Israel, Mr
Sarid confirmed that Mr Arafat might be able to return in May once the Cairo
negotiations and the Israeli withdrawal were completed.
Violence flared again in Hebron, site of February's massacre of 29
Palestinians by a fanatical Jewish settler, as Israeli soldiers shot and
wounded 18 Palestinian demonstrators.
Israel has agreed with the PLO to allow 160 armed observers from Norway,
Denmark and Italy into the town, the flash-point of Arab-Israeli violence.
However the cabinet yesterday decided against discussing the possible
removal of 415 extremist Jewish settlers living in Hebron and surrounded by
110,000 Arabs.

Keating visits Indochina
Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, begins an eight-day visit to
Indochina, incorporating stops in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. It will be
the first time an Australian prime minister has visited post-war Vietnam.
Mr Keating's visit follows strenuous efforts to shore up Australia's
position in Vietnam, now that the US trade embargo against the country has
been lifted. Australia currently ranks fifth among countries awarded
investment licences in Vietnam, but is expected to face formidable
competition for contracts in infrastructure and telecommunications from US
corporations.
Nato general in Romania
General George Joulwan, Nato Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, begins a
two-day visit to Romania where he will meet President Ion Iliescu and other
senior officials. General Joulwan will discuss ways of improving military
co-operation between Romania and Nato within the framework of the
Partnership for Peace, which Romania signed in January. Last month President
Bill Clinton lifted the US embargo on high technology arms sales to Romania.
Talbott begins trip
Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state, begins a nine-day trip to
India, Pakistan, Poland, Slovakia, and Nato in Brussels.
Greece tackles tax evaders
Greece's socialist government will consider a tax bill, aimed at cracking
down on Greece's legion of tax evaders, at a special cabinet meeting. The
bill will try to redress the injustice of easily taxed wage earners paying
the largest share of Greece's tax burden.
Premium Bond millionaire
Ernie, the National Savings computer, picks the first Pounds 1m monthly
Premium Bond jackpot prize. The UK's Premium Bonds, which have no capital
growth but offer holders the chance of winning cash, used to have a Pounds
250,000 jackpot.
Japanese trade surplus
The Japanese current account surplus in February is expected to widen to
Dollars 12.2bn, from Dollars 6.8bn in January. The strong yen is still
boosting the dollar value of Japanese exports, and keeping the surplus high.
However, this short-term effect may be followed by a downturn in exports and
a reduced surplus as the yen makes Japanese goods uncompetitive.
Budget tax rises bite
The start of the new UK tax year means that Britons finally face many of the
additional charges imposed in the two 1993 Budgets. A 1 percentage point
rise in employees' National Insurance payments and the reduction in relief
on the married couple's tax allowance will have the biggest effect on pay
packets.
The imposition of value added tax on fuel and the reduction in mortgage
interest tax relief have already begun to take effect.
Banesto deadline
This is the last day for banks to register as potential buyers of Banesto,
the troubled Spanish bank which is due to be auctioned. Sealed bids will
have to be submitted by April 25. The front runners in the auction -
Argentaria, Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya - have already
registered.  .TX- Danish bond issue  .TX- Denmark will become the latest
European sovereign borrower to lengthen the maturity of its bonds from 10
years, by introducing a 30-year government bond with a 6 per cent coupon.
Since the bonds will be sold on a 'tap' basis it is not clear how much the
Danish government intends to raise through this offering. Traders say the
bonds will not remain liquid for long if the government issues less than
DKr12bn-DKr15bn worth.
The market is also unsure about the proposed pricing of the bonds. Traders
are basing their forecasts on the yield differentials between 10-year and
30-year government bonds in France, the Netherlands and Germany where the
spreads range from 50 basis points to nearly 70 basis points. Some traders
expect Denmark's 30-year bond to yield just over 60 basis points over the 8
per cent bonds due 2003 which were yielding around 6.90 per cent late last
week.
Nazarbayev in Japan
Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has attracted western
investment to help develop his country's rich oil and gas reserves, goes to
Japan for a four-day tour.
Nazarbayev, whose globe-trotting has enhanced his reputation as the leader
of one of the more stable regimes in the region, recently called for the
former Soviet Union's transformation into a Euro-Asian union.

Hurd arrives in Brasilia
British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd comes to Brasilia for talks after
arriving in Brazil on Tuesday. He is due to stay until Friday, when he will
fly on to the Falkland Islands.
As well as cementing growing economic ties, Hurd may sign an extradition
treaty. This is, however, unlikely to lead to the extradition of Ronnie
Biggs, the escaped train robber, who lives in Rio de Janeiro.
Balladur in Beijing
Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, will travel to Beijing for a
four-day visit aimed at setting the seal on improved relations between
France and China. The visit follows France's announcement in January that it
would no longer sell arms to Taiwan, a long-standing source of friction.
UK economic figures
UK manufacturing output and industrial production figures for February are
unlikely to be as strong as they were in January, which saw month-on-month
rises of 1.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively. The figures are very
volatile and some analysts are accordingly expecting manufacturing output to
have fallen in February.
However, recent Confederation of British Industry surveys have been positive
and the average forecast is for manufacturing output to have risen 0.4 per
cent and industrial production 0.5 per cent, indicating a continuing UK
recovery.
German jobless statistics
In the middle of this week Germany releases March's unemployment figures.
Observers are expecting the jobless numbers to rise further towards the 4.5m
figure which Ulrich Castellieri, a Deutsche Bank board member, forecast for
the end of this year.
Although seasonal factors might affect the short-term outlook, the
consistent upward trend can be counted on, if only because most of German
industry - including the banks - are still in the middle of their
rationalisation programmes.

The Australian golfer Greg Norman should be the favourite to win this

South African summit
ANC leader Nelson Mandela, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu
Inkatha party, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and South African President FW
de Klerk will meet to try to resolve the impasse over Zulu participation in
the April 26-28 election.
The Zulu leaders demand guarantees on the king's status after the elections.
Mandela and de Klerk seek Inkatha's agreement not to impede voting in Natal,
which includes the Zulu homeland, KwaZulu, run by Inkatha.
A state of emergency was declared in Natal last Thursday to try to control
the escalating violence between ANC and Inkatha supporters.
EU finance meeting
European Union finance ministers meet in Athens for two days of informal
talks. The main items on the agenda will be the operation of the European
Monetary System and the prospects, if any, for a return to the old narrow
fluctuation bands for member currencies; the financing of the trans-European
networks in road, rail, telecommunications and energy; and the prospects for
further cuts in European interest rates to lift the continental economy out
of recession.
Friendship Bridge opens
The first bridge across the lower Mekong river will be officially opened by
Australian prime minister Paul Keating, marking another step in the economic
development of south-east Asia. The 'Friendship Bridge' linking Vientiane,
the capital of landlocked Laos, with the northern Thai town of Nong Khai,
was built with Australian aid at a cost of about USDollars 30m.
Thailand and Laos expect the bridge to ease the increasing flow of tourists
and trade between the two countries, although some Lao officials are worried
that their once isolated country will become a truck stop between southern
China and the maritime states of the region.
Fourth Test match begins

Argentina goes to the polls
Voters in Argentina go to the polls on Sunday to choose a constituent
assembly that will rewrite the country's 1853 constitution. Lifting the
constitution's ban on consecutive presidential terms will allow President
Carlos Menem to run for a second term in 1995. The polls forecast an easy
victory for Menem's Peronist party.
Ukrainian election run-off
Ukraine faces a complete gas cut-off on Sunday as its citizens return to the
polls for run-off elections for the nation's first post-Soviet parliament.
Russia's Gazprom is demanding that Ukraine pay its near Dollars 1bn gas debt
by Sunday. Ukraine is scrambling to put together a barter package of cars,
food and machinery for Russian oil and gas. There is also a proposal to
clear Ukraine's debt by giving Russia a stake in its gas industry.
The Grand National
Britain's most famous steeplechase takes place at Aintree, near Liverpool,
on Saturday. Last year's race ended in chaos after a false start when
several jockeys completed the course ignorant of attempts by officials to
stop them.
Gatt pact to be signed
The long-delayed final act of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
Uruguay Round trade agreement is due to be signed on Tuesday, 12 April, in
Marrakesh, Morocco. Trade ministers will be meeting from Monday to Friday
and the US wants discussion to focus on the link between workers' rights and
the world trading system.
The signing will come a few days before the expiry of the 'fast-track'
negotiating authority extended by Congress to President Clinton in April
1993. Under this procedure Congress must accept or reject a proposed trade
agreement, and may not substantially amend it.
Israeli pull-out deadline
April 14 is the deadline for Israel to pull its forces out of the Gaza Strip
and Jericho in the occupied territories. Recent progress in the talks
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation has meant this date
may be met, though there is still disagreement over the size of the
Palestinian police force.

FT  05 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow suffers sharp loss in
heavy trade

Wall Street
US stocks fell sharply as investors scurried to square their positions after
a Good Friday sell-off in bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 42.61 off at 3,593.35, but well above
the session's low. The fresh decline, as investors returned from a three-day
Easter break, extended the downturn in the bellwether index to 385 points,
or 9.6 per cent, since its closing record peak of 3,978 on January 31. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 weakened 6.84 to 438.92 and declines swamped rises by
2,108 to 371 in heavy trading of 344.4m shares. The American SE composite
was 8.98, or 2 per cent, lower at 434.13, and the Nasdaq composite down
16.05, or 2.2 per cent, at 727.41.
The tumultuous opening was no surprise. It was widely expected since Friday,
when the Labor Department released March employment data showing the biggest
monthly gain in non-farm payrolls since October 1987. Bond prices plunged
and yields surged as a result.
With the stock markets closed in observance of Good Friday, equity investors
had the weekend to mull over the implications of the data for the financial
markets, which were already unsettled by the threat of higher interest
rates.
Their conclusion brought a wave of selling at the opening, pushing the Dow
industrials down by as much as 84 points. But prices managed to crawl off
the session's lows when the morning failed to bring another sharp setback in
bonds. The Dow swung back and forth again during the afternoon amid several
waves of program trading and a deep plunge in bond prices just before
trading ended.
Grumman was marked down Dollars 3 to Dollars 61 5/8 after its board accepted
a Dollars 62-a-share tender offer from Northrop, which dropped Dollars 2 1/4
to Dollars 37 5/8 . Martin Marietta, which had offered Dollars 55 a share,
slipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 42 5/8 .
Woolworth shed Dollars 2 1/4 to yet another 52-week low at Dollars 12 7/8 on
news that senior executives had stepped down temporarily amid an internal
investigation of accounting irregularities.
Canada
Toronto shares plummeted in light trade as a worsening currency crisis
gripped all Canada's financial markets.
The TSE 300 composite index dropped 99.5, or 2.3 per cent, to 4,230.1 and
falls led rises by 713 to 138. With many investors still on holiday, volume
was a paltry 42.1m shares.
South African markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.

FT  05 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Italians, cyclicals, consumer stocks
lead Europe - The first quarter of 1994 was no time to be a French company,
or financial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian stocks rocketed in the first quarter of 1994, their French
counterparts fell, and the oft-mooted switch between financials and cyclical
shares was on in a big way.
Italy, a below average performer in October and November last year, kicked
strongly in December, built on its enthusiasm, and came up with three of the
four top performers in the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index for the first three
months of this year.
A wave of political optimism, privatisation hopes and a continued upswing in
cyclicals lifted the telecoms duo, Sip and Stet, and the carmaker Fiat to an
average gain of 39 per cent in local currency terms, compared with a fall of
6 per cent in October/December 1993.
Nordic-domiciled stocks are also heavily weighted in the top 10, taking
first place and four in all. Once again, this reflects the strength of their
domestic equity markets during the quarter; and, taking in Nokia, Electrolux
and Volvo, it emphasises the consumer goods orientation which is allied to
the current swing to cyclicals.
At the bottom end of the table, the 'dogs' are mainly French, financials or
both. The French insurers UAP and Axa were very nearly joined by ING, of the
Netherlands, and the massive Allianz, of Germany. They are in company with
five banking groups: French, Swiss and Irish.
Mr Sasha Serafimovski, a vice-president at Merrill Lynch in London, said in
mid-March that the group believed economic growth was likely to surprise on
the upside in 1995 and stocks geared to demand will prove the best
performers. 'The theme of falling interest rates aiding bank stock
outperformance,' he wrote, 'is now a dead duck in Europe.'
Mr Graham Warren, an insurance analyst at Goldman Sachs, says the insurance
companies at the bottom end of the performance table have exaggerated a
general trend. 'European equities have fallen by around 5 per cent this
year,' he says, 'insurers have underperformed by 5 to 10 per cent and, when
funds are looking to sell, they are likely to move first on big, liquid
stocks like Allianz and Axa.'
Higher interest rates have meant lower bond markets. 'Insurers are nowhere
near as interest rate sensitive as is generally assumed,' maintains Mr
Warren, 'with their bond holdings matched by liabilities on the other side
of the bal-ance sheet; however, investors are not prepared to take the
counter-view until there is some stability in the investment market.'
Mr Nick Stevenson, European equity strategist at SG Warburg Securities, says
first quarter Euro-performance has brought together a collection of
investment themes.
Alcatel, the second worst performer, is French but cyclical. Its story,
however, says Mr Stevenson, has a pan European flavour; the company, and
both Siemens and Ericcson to lesser degrees, have suffered from the slowing
of the gravy train in big public telecommunications switching equipment,
with the trend to digital extension almost having run its course.
Alcatel, too, has been the biggest stock in EAFA (European, Australian and
Far East) investment fund portfolios and has been overowned.
Similarly, Astra's position in the bottom 10, says Mr Stevenson, also has a
thematic quality about it which is linked to Alcatel's recent unpopularity.
It is a Swedish stock, traded heavily on international markets; 'very
international, very American influenced'.
Astra produced outstanding results at the end of February, says Mr David
Longmuir, a Nordic specialist at James Capel. But worries mounted about
pharmaceuticals in general, and about Astra's ulcer drug, Losec, which saw a
German threat to its intravenous application at the beginning of March, as
well as more general worries about competitive and cheaper ulcer products.
Nokia, the best performing Nordic stock, had a very grim 1992 but came back
extremely strongly in 1993 with a gain of 209 per cent before topping the
charts this year so far. It is one of Europe's biggest television set
makers; this may not be wildly exciting, but it ties in with the theory that
cyclical and consumer stocks should be this year's performance issues.
Nokia is also big in mobile phones, much bigger, says Mr Longmuir, than
anyone anticipated, and investors have been having a serious affair with the
mobile phone market.
Also in Finland, Outokompu, the metals company, has risen on Finland's
outstanding stock market performance last year, this year's follow-through
and a desperate search for new stories among the country specialists.
Outokompu is very big in copper, also in nickel and zinc, and this year's
strategic pref-erence for commodity-based issues has given it wings.
Electrolux is one of Europe's largest white goods manufacturers, and there
have been some optimistic stories around. However, the company, effectively,
is going to take over AEG's household appliances operations and may need to
issue equity to fund it; the Stockholm market is edgy about rights issues
this year.
Among the carmakers, probably the most exciting story has been the rise and
rise of Fiat, a serious laggard in 1992, an outperformer in 1993 and the
best performing car assembler of 1994 so far. Meanwhile, BMW, with its
acquisition of the UK's Rover car company, has grabbed the attention of
investors looking for the big story, especially with the news - right at the
end of the quarter - that BMW was finding its acquisition 'even more
interesting' than when it bid for it.

FT  05 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Madrid at low for 1994
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Most of Europe's bourses remained shut yesterday for the Easter holiday.
MADRID showed the effect of volatility in the US, with the general index
falling nearly 3 per cent to a new low for the year. The index shed 9.3 to
310.18. Turnover was thin at Pta17.2bn.
Telefonica, the day's most active issue, dropped Pta45 to Pta1,620 in volume
of some 1.8m shares.
Repsol suffered the most, losing Pta225, or 5.3 per cent, at Pta4,040, while
Endesa weakened 3.8 per cent to Pta6,840. Sevillana fell nearly 5 per cent
on volume of 260,000 shares.
ISTANBUL jumped almost 9 per cent in expectation that the government would
announce an economic stabilisation package today. The composite index put on
1,328.72 at 16,356.48. The equity market was unmoved by a 12 per cent fall
in the value of the Turkish lira against the dollar.

FT  05 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei and region fall
in fear of Wall Street decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that Wall Street may suffer further falls discouraged investors, and
equities lost ground again, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 154.94, or 0.8 per cent, off at 19,122.22. The
index opened at the day's high of 19,232,85 and fell as low as 18,896.48
during the morning session.
Investors were worried that the New York stock market would continue to lose
ground this week following last week's rise in US long-term interest rates,
triggered by firm US labour data.
However, market participants were reluctant to sell below the Nikkei 19,000
level due to concern that institutions will come in to support the index.
Institutional investors, expected to buy stocks following the turn of the
new business year, were absent. Volume stayed flat, at 230m shares, and
trading was dom-inated by arbitrage-linked activity.
The Topix index of all first section stocks finished 10.80 down at 1,560.38
and the Nikkei 300 declined 1.90 to 285.21. Falls outscored rises by 754 to
254, with 163 issues unchanged.
In spite of the rise in the dollar against the yen, high-technology issues
were depressed. Matsushita Electric Industrial slipped Y10 to Y1,700 and
Sony receded Y40 to Y5,890. Auto makers were also lower, with Nissan Motor
losing Y15 at Y814.
Arbitrage selling hit banks, Industrial Bank of Japan declining Y10 to
Y3,000 and Fuji Bank Y60 to Y2,100. Brokers were lower, Nomura Securities
dipping Y30 to Y2,200.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone retreated Y2,000 to Y903,000. Reports that
the company may be forced to postpone its increase in city rates, due to the
cabinet's concern over the rise in a number of public fees on the economy,
prompted selling by some investors.
Housing shares were higher on hopes of rising demand. Misawa Homes firmed
Y10 to Y1,040 and Daiwa House Industry Y20 to Y1,550.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 189.27 to 21,366.88 in volume of 7.1m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, lost Y100 at Y6,630 on profit-taking.
Roundup
Wall Street worries gave most of the region a bad day. Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Australia and New Zealand were closed for holidays.
KUALA LUMPUR blamed Wall Street, rather than the central bank's currency
losses, as investors liquidated their holdings. The KLSE composite index
ended 31.61, or 3.3 per cent, lower at 928.33.
Dealers said the market was jittery about the effect of the sharp fall in US
bond prices last week on the Dow Industrial average. The day's losers
included Genting, Telekoms and Maybank, in thin volumes. Some 114.8m shares
worth MDollars 503m were traded.
BANGKOK added some domestic political uncertainty, and the SET index closed
35.94, or 2.9 per cent, down at 1,196.59 in wafer thin turnover of Bt2.8bn,
against Friday's Bt2.7bn, the lowest of the year.
KARACHI noted that foreign funds and local institutions kept to the
sidelines as the KSE 100 index fell 62.43, or 2.5 per cent, to 2,448.71 on
profit-taking by jobbers. Volume was low, and the jobber selling was
described as speculative.
MANILA was led down by the big blue chips, Manila Electric and Philippine
Long Distance Telephone. Meralco 'B' and PLDT each dipped by about 2 per
cent, to 462.50 pesos and 1,700 pesos respectively, as the composite index
declined 57.80, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,653.70.
SINGAPORE fell in sympathy with the weak US bond market and in the absence
of Hong Kong-based fund buying. The Straits Times Industrial index ended
41.78, or 2 per cent, off at 2,039.12.
SEOUL staged a technical rebound centred on blue chips, asset play counters
and low price/earnings ratio issues, which left the composite index 5.10 up
at 860.47. There were rumours that the government may be considering
measures to attract foreign investors, but the Finance Ministry denied these
and brokers did not foresee an upward trend.

FT  05 APR 94 / Emerging Markets: Renewed focus on US monetary policy -
Currency markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When foreign exchanges reopen for business today, the key issue will be how
to interpret Friday's US jobs data, showing the fastest rise in job creation
since October 1987.
With confirmation that the robust US economic recovery continues unhindered,
some analysts believe the Federal Reserve may be tempted to decisively
tighten monetary policy, possibly ahead of the next meeting of the
policy-making Federal Open Market Committee on May 17.
Certainly this was the prevailing interpretation on Wall St yesterday with
equities getting off to a very shaky start on fears of higher rates.
Not all observers, however, believe that the argument for a
policy-tightening is cut and dried. Mr Lacy Hunt, chief US economist at
Midland Global Markets in New York, argues that the labour market is not
nearly as strong as Friday's headline number would suggest. Most jobs being
generated are in low-pay service sectors and this, if anything, has a
restraining effect on inflation. Mr Hunt comments: 'Growth with decelerating
inflation should not be a concern of monetary policy.'
What all of this means for the dollar will become clearer today when
European markets reopen. Although the US currency rallied on Friday, it has
still significantly underperformed investor expectations. Dollar bulls will
take succour from the latest data, but if dollar weakness persists, this
could well prompt a sell-off of the US currency.
The other focus for dollar watchers will be today's publication of Japanese
trade data for March and current account data for February. Last week saw
the dollar sink below Y103 after the US administration dismissed as
inadequate market-opening measures proposed by the Japanese government.
Many analysts believe the market will test the record low of Y101.3 to the
dollar and may well fall below Y100.
In Europe, attention will remain with Italy. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, leader of
the Freedom Alliance which triumphed in last week's elections, appears to be
making good progress in uniting his fractious allies. This helped the lira
rise to L959.75 per D-Mark last Friday. The market wants to believe the good
news, but will watch closely for signs of political division. It will also
expect details of a credible deficit reduction policy if it is to believe in
lower interest rates.
In the UK, meanwhile, sterling's fortunes are likely to be closely tied to
the fortunes of prime minister Mr John Major. A further weakening in his
position could further undermine the UK currency.

FT  05 APR 94 / Emerging Markets: Brazil's turbulence set to continue - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited sealing of Brazil's Brady plan debt restructuring this
month might have been a shot in the arm for the country's capital markets.
Previous deals by countries such as Argentina led to huge inflows of foreign
investment. But Brazil has been affected by the recent turbulence in
emerging markets linked to US interest rate rises and also faces domestic
uncertainties including general elections at the end of this year and a
government anti-inflation plan.
This means that although the Brady deal is expected to reduce the country
risk for Brazilian securities, a sea change in the attitude of international
investors is unlikely in the short term.
For the stock market, the announcement of the deal, which restructures
Brazil's Dollars 52bn debt to foreign banks and is due to be signed on April
15, was welcomed. But there was disappointment that the IMF was not
sufficiently convinced by the government's anti-inflation plan to provide a
stand-by loan in support of the Brady deal.
Nevertheless, for Mr Alfredo Viegas, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in New
York, the potential for Brazil's equity market is staggering. He predicts
that Sao Paulo's stock exchange index will repeat 1993's performance and
double in value again this year.
'After the Mexican elections there will be a huge inflow and that will spill
over into Brazil,' he says, noting that foreign investment on the Sao Paulo
exchange, Brazil's largest, is still relatively small, averaging only 15 per
cent of daily trading compared with 60 per cent in Mexico.
The Sao Paulo index has climbed by about 40 per cent this year, although
most of that appreciation was in January following a large inflow of foreign
investment and hopes for the anti-inflation plan.
Mr Viegas says his bullish scenario depends partly on expectations that a
candidate from the centre, such as former finance minister Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, will be elected president. The success of the
anti-inflation plan is also a key factor, he says. This involves balancing
the federal budget and proposes the introduction of a currency linked to
Brazil's foreign reserves to tame inflation, running at about 40 per cent a
month.
The doubts surrounding Brazil's economic and political development lead to
difficulties in valuing the stock market. In spite of last year's doubling
of the main index, blue chips like Telebras, the government-controlled
telecom company, are still quoted at near or below book value. Another
indication of the market's potential is that at the end of last year the
market capitalisation of Brazilian stocks was 23 per cent of gross domestic
product compared with 56 per cent for Mexico, according to investment bank
CS First Boston.
Less optimistic analysts argue the opposite. Ms Cristina Vervloet, a
director at brokers Socimer do Brasil, is pessimistic about prospects for
the market this year. She highlights recent political impasses, including a
congressional review of the constitution, which has made little progress.
The review could open up government monopolies in the telecommunications and
oil sectors as well as reform the tax and welfare systems and enable the
government to have more control over spending. It is regarded as essential
if the inflation rate is to be kept down. 'Despite the Brady deal, the
economy remains unstable and there is a lot of uncertainty,' says Ms
Vervloet. She agrees that the market will be bullish if Mr Cardoso looks
likely to become president and win the congressional support needed to push
through structural reforms and consolidate the plan.
Ms Vervloet is also worried that the new currency will be introduced by the
government too early and therefore jeopardise the plan's prospects.
Even with inflation of about 2,500 per cent last year, the capital markets
boomed. This was caused by increased foreign investment, optimism at the
appointment of Mr Cardoso as finance minister and recovery from the
political turbulence caused by the resignation of former president Fernando
Collor in 1992. Net foreign inflow was Dollars 5.5bn, four times more than
in 1992, while Eurobond issues totalled Dollars 7.6bn compared with Dollars
4.8bn in 1992.
Bankers do not expect a higher volume of Eurobond issues this year because
of the market situation combined with local volatility in the run-up to
elections. There is uncertainty about when, and by how much, the interest
rate spreads paid by Brazilian issuers will fall. Currently, Brazilian
companies pay on average about 400 basis points above the relevant US
Treasury security, compared with about 300 points for Argentine issuers and
200 for Mexican companies, according to Mr Jose Eduardo Martins, a director
at investment bank Patrimonio . .
However, Telebras is planning an ambitious eight-year bond issue at an
interest rate spread of below 300 basis points in response to the Brady
deal. The success of the issue, which still has to be officially approved by
the Treasury, will indicate whether Brazilian bond spreads are set to fall
significantly this year.
Mr Jose Luiz Lima, head of sales and distribution at Dutch-owned ING Bank's
Brazilian subsidiary, believes Telebras is over-optimistic in proposing such
a low interest rate spread under current market conditions.
In spite of the problems that have hit emerging markets recently, there has
been a growing international acceptance of Brazilian securities that is
allowing an increasing number of companies to consider launches of American
depositary receipts. Mr Martins says that extremely high local interest
rates and the comparatively expensive cost of Eurobond issues has prompted
companies to consider inter-national equity offerings.

FT  05 APR 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY
Equities in Istanbul gained nearly 9 per cent yesterday on expectations that
the government will today unveil a package of measures to tackle inflation
and reduce the budget deficit.
The equity market has seen volatile trading in recent sessions, rising 11
per cent last week, but falling 9 per cent the week before. The composite
index remains some 21 per cent down on the year to date.
Recent activity has been driven mainly by domestic investors, as foreign
institutions wait for the situation to clarify. Many investors were taking
advantage yesterday of cheap prices to buy.
The government's measures are expected to include job cuts and privatisation
of many state companies.
BEIJING
China has launched an Dollars 11.5bn domestic bond issue - its biggest ever
 -to help cover the budget deficit and the increasing debt-service
obligations of its vast infrastructure programme.
Western bankers and economists say that plans to issue some Yn100bn (Dollars
11.5bn) in two and three-year bonds are highly ambitious, and will severely
test the Chinese debt markets.
The three-year bonds will carry an interest rate of 13.96 per cent. This
compares with increases in the cost of living running at more than 20 per
cent in the larger cities.
Huaneng International Power Development, a unit of state energy group
Huaneng, has said that it has obtained approval for a global share issue and
primary listing on the NYSE this year.
BUCHAREST
Bankcoop, a Romanian private bank, is to launch a share issue to raise its
capital to around 12bn lei (Dollars 7.2m), a bank official has said.
Bankcoop will sell its shares to Romanian and foreign companies and
individuals. Last year the bank had a pre-tax profit of 14bn lei, up from a
post-tax profit of 3.1bn lei in 1992.
MEXICO
Foreign investment in Mexico totalled Dollars 4.09bn in the first two months
of 1994, an increase of 143.4 per cent over the same period a year ago, the
trade ministry has said.
The ministry said foreign investment now totals Dollars 45.8bn during the
administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office in
December 1988.
The ministry said Dollars 3.17bn, or 77.6 per cent, of foreign investment in
January and February was channelled through Mexico's stock market, and the
remaining Dollars 916m was in direct investment.
Some 70.5 per cent of the new investment came from the US, with Spain
accounting for 6.5 per cent, Germany for 1.2 per cent and Canada for 0.7 per
cent.
OMAN
Oman is to sell shares in more government-held companies in 1994 and link
its stock market with Bahrain as part of the process of opening its economy
to private and foreign investment.
A stock exchange official said that Oman and Bahrain were to link their
stock markets by listing public joint-stock companies in each market by the
end of the year.
A Bahrain official has said that Oman will set up two international funds
for Japanese and UK groups to invest. Oman's stock market lists 93 companies
capitalised at Dollars 1.6bn. Annual turnover is about Dollars 60m.

FT  05 APR 94 / Equity Markets (This Week): Clouds of uncertainty linger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After the hammering endured by stocks over the past fortnight, the reasons
to be pessimistic about further declines this week are painfully evident.
Most importantly, the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the financial
markets - the root cause of the current malaise - has shown no signs of
dissipating. Rather, it appears to have thickened with each downward lurch
of the Dow. Yesterday's tumultuous session was an omen of more of the same.
By Monday's close, the Dow industrial average had lost 9.6 per cent of value
since the Federal Reserve's first tightening of monetary policy on February
4. Such a decline was still in line with expectations immediately after the
Fed's move.
With each passing day, however, the initial forecasts seem to have been
overly optimistic. Since March 22, the day before the Fed lifted short-term
rates for a second time, the Dow's fall has accelerated, with the average
dropping in seven out of nine sessions. Yesterday, the blue-chip index was
off 42 points after climbing back from a 80-point deficit in mid-morning.
The deepening of the downturn has rattled even the most bullish of Wall
Street's seers. Ms Elaine Garzarelli, the influential Lehman Brothers
analyst, hedged her bets last week by saying there was a 50-50 chance of a
10 per cent to 15 per cent correction before stocks settled down.
There was a fleeting break in the gloom late last week. In Thursday's highly
volatile session, the market fell by about 70 points before midday, only to
fight its way back to a nine-point gain by the close. Some analysts
interpreted the sudden swing in share prices as a sign that market had
bottomed out.
Those hopes were dashed by Good Friday's news showing the biggest monthly
jump in non-farm payrolls since October 1987. The figure suggested the
economy had grown by more than 3 per cent in the first quarter, as most
economists forecast. It also suggested higher inflation, the bane of bonds,
and a subsequent sell-off by equity investors.
Although most bond trading firms were closed in observance of Good Friday, a
few decided to remain open in anticipation of the important jobs report. As
a result, prices plunged and yields surged in light activity which ended at
midday. Yesterday, it was the stock market's turn to catch up with the news.
Cash flows into mutual funds - one of the driving forces of the three-year
bull market - slowed considerably last month. Anticipation of a big jump in
mutual fund redemptions, as the wariness of individual investors
intensifies, may push share prices even lower as the week progresses.
The bond market will continue to fall under the close scrutiny of equity
investors. Signs of stability in Treasury prices could trigger some
bargain-hunting and a modest comeback by stocks. But late in yesterday's
session, bonds were experiencing a fresh round of heavy selling even though
there was no obvious news to depress sentiment further.

FRANKFURT
The German bank reporting season continues with figures due on Friday from
Dresdner Bank, the country's second largest bank after Deutsche. The
consensus is for a rise in net profits of about 30 per cent. At the 10-month
stage, the bank unveiled operating profits up by 16.2 per cent. The
supervisory board of Daimler-Benz meets on Thursday to decide the dividend
on 1993's results.
PARIS
Suez, the financial and industrial holding company, is due to report this
week. Mr Gerard Worms, the chairman, has confirmed that the group returned
to 'modest' profit last year after making its first loss in 1992 due to the
recession and its heavy debts. Alcatel Alsthom is also expected to announce
1993 figures during the week. Mr Pierre Suard, the telecommunications
group's chairman, has already said that overall sales fell by 3.4 per cent
in 1993 when he forecast static profits of around FFr7bn.
AMSTERDAM
The reporting season is drawing to a close although figures are expected
today from KBB, the department store group. UBS forecasts a 20 per cent rise
in 1993 net profits, on a sales increase of 2 per cent. The bank says that
KBB has had a good year with the Hema chain benefiting from a more focused
product range, M&amp;S Mode still expanding by some 10 per cent a year and FAO
Schwarz having discovered a more successful, larger format which is enabling
it to improve results.
MADRID
Wednesday is the final day for the banks BBV, Argentaria, Santander and
Popular to register their intentions to bid for Banesto, whose auction is
scheduled to be completed by May 10.
TOKYO
Although the start of the new business year signals an end to the corporate
profit-taking that depressed prices in recent weeks, the market is likely to
remain volatile on the uncertain outlook for the currency and the domestic
political situation. Speculation that the US will keep up pressure on trade
has triggered heavy buying of the yen. As a result, equity investors are
likely to hold back from buying because the strength of the yen could delay
the recovery of the economy later this year.

When is a new derivative product genuinely ground breaking? The launch last
week by Societe Generale of Boosts, heralded as a new derivative instrument,
was greeted with some scepticism by some of the French bank's competitors.
'At this stage in the derivative market's development, I don't think there
are any genuinely new instruments, just variations on a theme,' said the
head of options at one bank. But according to SocGen, Boosts - an acronym
for Banking On Overall Stability - are fundamentally different.
The concept is based on a stability band for an underlying asset, within
which the investor expects the asset to remain for a set period of time.
Every day that the underlying instrument remains in the band, the investor
earns one currency unit.
Thus if a one-year Boost remains within the set range throughout its life,
the investor earns Dollars 365 (less the upfront cost of the product). If
the asset falls outside of the range after 100 days, the investor earns
Dollars 100 (again less the upfront cost, which means that he may or may not
have broken even).
The age of the Boost - the number of days spent within the band - and the
life expectancy are the main components in pricing. Some derivative
specialists argue the technology is the same as for a spate of Eurobond
deals earlier this year known as range floating-rate notes.
These floating rate note issues are structured so that interest only accrues
on days when the three-month London interbank offered rate (Libor) falls
within a specified range. In return, the investor gets a high margin over
Libor.
'There has been a whole variety of instruments for buying or selling
volatility,' argues one derivative specialist. There have been successful
examples of embedding derivatives strategies in a security. For example,
Swiss Bank Corporation marketed a series of securities known as GROIs (an
acronym for Guaranteed Return on Investment). An investor could chose
between having, say, a guaranteed 7 per cent return, in which case the
maximum bonus - if the SMI index of leading shares on the Swiss stock market
over the one-year term performed well - would be only 2.03 per cent. If he
chose a 0 per cent guaranteed return, the investor could make as much as
24.72 per cent if the SMI did well.
Indeed, several derivative specialists said that such trades have been done
in the over-the-counter market, where they are sometimes known as
time-trades.
However, there are undoubtedly some novel aspects to SocGen's Boosts.
Firstly, even if the concept existed, it was not available in the form of a
tradeable security. SocGen plans to list its Boosts on European stock
exchanges, and to make an active secondary market in the instruments, which
may appeal to institutional investors who would not want to buy OTC
instruments.
'No single security has previously been able to derive profit from a stable
underlying (asset) during a given period,' said SocGen. A similar strategy
can be constructed by using options to create 'straddles', 'strangles' and
'butterflies'.
So far, Soc Gen has launched six different series of Boosts over one and two
years on the D-Mark/French franc and dollar/D-Mark exchange rates and on
10-year OATs (French government bonds) and nine-year bunds (German
government bonds). However, the structure can be applied to commodities,
equities, indices and short-term interest rates.
The remaining question is whether investors will want to buy instruments
based on a stable outlook, at a time when markets are extremely volatile.

It might be a good idea to stand well clear of the trading screens this
morning. Europe went home for the Easter holidays in a highly nervous
condition and developments on Wall Street and Asia Pacific since last
Thursday evening have done little to help. Talk of '1987 re-visited' from Mr
Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research set the mood for a gloomy weekend which
has brought sharp falls in US Federal bonds, shivers in some Asian markets,
a plunge in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures and a general fear that Wall
Street could face trouble today.
Setting aside the ugly lines on Mr Knight's charts, the markets will focus
on the sharp rise in US employment levels in March, announced after European
markets had closed for the Easter weekend. The reaction from US bonds made
it clear that fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten credit policy
sooner and more fiercely than anticipated have returned in force; and will
it be the discount rate this time?
Some decoupling of gilts from US Federal securities has been seen but UK
bonds are still highly volatile and capable of throwing UK equities into a
spin. The stock market seems unlikely to escape unscathed if gilts come
under pressure again. And tremors in sterling have provided another
challenge to those still convinced that base rates will be cut soon by a UK
government facing a sea of political troubles as higher tax rates are phased
in.
These arguments may not be entirely new, but their sting has been drawn for
the past month by technical factors which are now changing. Fund managers
have been very unwilling to sell stock ahead of the closing of investment
books on the first quarter of the year, which coincides with the end of the
UK tax year and the financial year-end for many companies and financial
institutions. Those inhibitions, including the fiscal year-end in Japan,
will disappear this week. Fund managers can be expected to make longer-term
investment decisions and that could be painful in a stock market which has
shown that it can move 50 points on the Footsie scale in the blink of an
eye.
No sector has paid more dearly for the stock market's repeated attempts to
show faith in the recovery of the UK economy than the retail stocks.
Consumers have stubbornly refused to lead the way out of recession and even
the most efficient store groups have had to fight hard to hold profit
margins.
Now, 'mistakes do not go unpunished,' and, to succeed, a retailer must have
a strong brand franchise and the ability to refine costs so that low gross
margins do not become lower operating margins.
Marks and Spencer remains at the top of BZW's recommendations, with its
capacity for high dividend growth and a relatively low p/e. Argos is
regarded as having the same strength in its own highly competitive sector;
Argos has only 2.53 per cent of its sector while Marks has nearly 29 per
cent, with GUS its nearest rival with 15 per cent of their area.

German 10-year bond yields ended last week unchanged on the previous week at
6.30 per cent, but the market has yet to take account of the latest economic
news from the US, which has lifted chances of a further US interest rate
rise this week.
Against this background, an expected cut of 3-5 basis points in the
Bundesbank's repo rate is likely to have little impact. The Bundesbank repo
results are due on Wednesday, when DM82.1bn of repos expire.
Instead, any attention not trained on the US market is likely to be focused
on German economic data.
The market reopens today, after the long Easter weekend, to a slew of
economic data this week, which includes manufacturing orders, output and
unemployment.
According to market surveys by IDEA, the market is expecting unemployment in
March to show a rise of 10,000 to 35,000. The ranges for industrial and
manufacturing production in February, month-on-month, are down 0.6 per cent
to up 0.3 per cent and down 0.3 per cent to up 0.7 per cent respectively,
according to IDEA.
The range for manufacturing orders in February is down 0.5 per cent to up
0.5 per cent.
Traders will be on the look-out for signs of economic recovery, which could
reduce the likelihood of further rate cuts by the Bundesbank.

FT  05 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Activity switches to floating rate notes
 -International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'First there was the orgy, then came the uncertainty, and then the real
horror sunk in.' That is how one syndicate manager describes the first three
months of this year in the international bond market - and it is a view
probably shared by many syndicate officials as they wonder just how to match
last year's record figures.
The Bacchanalian start to 1994 certainly came as a surprise, since usually
the period after Christmas and New Year is fairly quiet in terms of new
issuance. Yet day after day, new deals flooded into the market as borrowers
rushed to get a head start with their annual borrowing plans.
Then the US Federal Reserve threw a spanner in the works with a quarter
point rise in interest rates on February 4, and for weeks the world's
financial markets remained jittery and distinctly nervous about the future
direction of US interest rates. The Fed's decision to hike up rates by a
further 25 basis points on March 22 confirmed market fears that one rate
rise would not be enough to nip inflationary pressures in the bud.
The response among borrowers and lead managers to the rising interest rate
scenario has been either to postpone their new issues until conditions
improve or to tap the floating rate note sector instead.
In fact, taking the strong start to the year and the pronounced switch into
floating rate notes together, the total volume of new issues in the first
quarter is not dramatically lower than in 1993. Total new issues amounted to
Dollars 110bn in the first quarter this year, down 7 per cent on the
comparable quarter in 1993.
But the interesting point is that floating rate notes make up a much higher
proportion of the total new issuance this year: borrowers launched the
equivalent of Dollars 34.1bn in FRNs, corresponding to 31 per cent of total
new issues (and mainly denominated in US dollars), compared with a total of
Dollars 17.1bn in the first quarter of 1993 (or 14 per cent of total new
issues), according to figures compiled by Euromoney.
'For borrowers, floating rate notes are more cost-effective than fixed rate
bonds at the moment,' points out one FRN specialist at a US house. The
attraction of FRNs for investors is that the coupon is reset - usually every
three or six months - in line with money market rates. 'Floaters are
supposed to provide investors with capital protection, trading at around par
(100),' says Mr Charlie Berman, syndicate manager at Salomon Brothers. There
is some scope for capital gain if the credit rating of the borrower
undergoes an improvement or is seen as a likely upgrade candidate.
Central banks and money funds are the traditional buyers of sovereign
floaters with sub-Libor coupons, although recently this type of paper has
been seen as a safe temporary parking place for money by a wider range of
fund managers.
The problem is that the market has probably seen too much new FRN paper
launched in the last couple of months: some of the recent deals are still
partly unplaced, and several have shown a disappointing price performance
while yields have widened.
'The FRN sector should have been a stellar performer,' says Mr Tim Skeet,
senior vice-president of Kidder Peabody syndicate desk in London, 'but
there's been so much supply that, at a time when you would expect the market
to be strong, the price performance of some of these issues has been
disappointing. There are still opportunities for borrowers but it's a case
of getting the pricing and timing right'.
The glut of new - and often aggressively-priced - FRN supply has led to
accusations that the lead managers are simply buying market share. 'If you
are a big Eurobond house and you need to do something in these market
conditions, what do you do? Floaters are just about the only thing you can
do, and you have seen houses which a year ago did no FRN business suddenly
bringing badly priced deals,' says one syndicate official.
After the bumper profits and mega-bonuses of 1993, the shift in sentiment
does not augur well for the bond houses. 'I'd be willing to bet there's a
correlation between position in the league table and the amount of red ink
in the profit and loss account for the first quarter,' said one official.
For the lower fees brought in by floating rate paper (compared with fixed
rate bonds) and the fact that syndicates are sitting on a lot of unsold
paper which has fallen in price and widened in spread suggests that
profitability - at least in the first quarter - will be less than a year
ago.

The renewed rise in the yen against the dollar triggered by US-Japan
tensions over trade is expected to provide support for the government bond
market this week.
Bond traders expect the yen's appreciation to depress corporate earnings,
and hence delay recovery in the economy. A possible barometer of investor
confidence will be the auction for April government bond issues scheduled
for this week.
Although the ministry of finance may be forced to postpone the auction due
to the parliamentary wrangling over the budget talks, analysts expect
institutional investors' appetite for long-term bonds, to have improved
considerably due to the turn of the new business year.
Volatility in the stock markets due to increased political turmoil has
decreased alternative investments. However, the key for movements of the No
157 10-year benchmark will continue to be price movements in the US Treasury
market.
Investors are focusing on the Bank of Japan's branch managers' meeting held
for the three days to Wednesday. In spite of some bright economic
indicators, especially in the consumption area, government officials and
central bankers remain cautious about the economy and towards pointing to
the end of the recession.

FT  05 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Investors show doubt over Berlusconi -
Capital and Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi may have wowed the Italian public with his slick
election campaign but he will have to come up with something more
substantial to win over the investors on whom Italy relies to bankroll its
budget deficit.
'Is he the right person to lead Italy out of its current crisis?' asks Mr
Darren Williams, European economist at Merrill Lynch in London. 'To my mind,
Fininvest, his high-growth, highly-indebted company, is a microcosm of Italy
and where it has gone wrong over the last 20 years.'
The volatile performance of the Italian government bond market last week
suggests that investors harbour similar doubts about the media magnate who
is poised to take over as Italy's prime minister.
On Monday, before the election results were published, the market rallied by
nearly three points on rumours that Mr Berlusconi's right-wing alliance
would win an absolute majority in the lower house.
The market then fell back on fears that he would have difficulty in forming
a strong government because of the policy differences between his two
coalition partners, the Northern League and the MSI/National Alliance. Bond
prices also eased on worries that the new government would sacrifice fiscal
restraint for economic growth. Then on Thursday, the market jumped by more
than 1 1/2 points on signs of progress in forming a government.
Analysts believe Mr Berlusconi will succeed in bringing his partners
together but that this achievement will not be enough to protect the market
against further volatility.
Mr Jose Luis Alzola, southern European economist at Salomon Brothers, says
that the risks of investing in Italian bonds are still substantial and will
only be reduced if the new government takes tough measures.
The most pressing task will be to redress the slippage in Italy's budget
deficit which has already overshot its 1994 target of L145,000bn (Dollars
88.71bn) by L15,000bn. 'Part of the shortfall will have to be addressed
through a mini-budget . . . the new government will have to reassure
financial markets that it will not let the deficit grow again,' says Mr
Alzola.
Measures to reduce the deficit, either by raising indirect taxes or cutting
expenditure, would appear to contradict Mr Berlusconi's electoral promises
to cut taxes. 'The market will have to take the tax-cutting talk with a
pinch of salt, just as the UK should have done when the Conservatives said
they wouldn't raise taxes,' says Mr Williams.
Analysts say that if investors are prepared to put up with the volatility
which goes hand-in-hand with political uncertainty, Italy's improving
economic fundamentals should enable them to make significant gains in
Italian government bonds this year.
A widespread view that the lira will strengthen against the D-Mark should
attract foreign investors in particular. Mr Alzola estimates the lira's
purchasing power parity against the D-Mark to be around L875 to the D-Mark,
though he believes that the lira will stabilise around L925, up from a
current level of L965. 'If the currency approaches L900 to the D-Mark the
Bank of Italy will accelerate the pace of its rate cuts to revive domestic
demand,' says Mr Alzola.
Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, says
that the downward trend in Italian inflation will enable the Bank of Italy
to match the pace of easing by the Bundesbank. He forecasts a fall in the
Italian discount rate from 7.5 per cent to 6 per cent by the turn of the
year.
Mr Williams says that lower interest rates should help Italy to reduce its
budget deficit to around 7 per cent of its gross domestic product next year
from around 9 1/2 per cent this year. 'That will mean that Italy will come
close to the European average of 5 1/2 per cent of GDP for the first time in
years,' he says.
This is all good news for Italian government bond yields, which Mr Williams
expects to fall to 7 1/2 per cent gross by the end of the year from 9 1/4
per cent currently.
Mr Alzola forecasts that the yield differential between Italian and German
government bonds will narrow to 250 basis points from a current 276 basis
points. However, he points out that the risks associated with investing in
Italy will prevent the differential from going as low as inflation
differentials would suggest.

Whatever minor distractions the Treasury bond market may have in the coming
days, there are only two questions hanging over it: when will the Federal
Reserve next raise rates, and by how much?
Any lingering doubts that another rate hike is on the cards seemed to be
dispelled by Friday's figures showing a 456,000 seasonally-adjusted rise in
non-farm payrolls in March.
This was nearly double the consensus estimate on Wall Street and appeared to
confirm that economic growth in the first quarter, though dented by bad
weather, had not slowed by as much as had been expected from the buoyant
fourth quarter of last year.
Officially, the markets were closed for the Good Friday holiday, but there
were enough traders on hand to mark prices down by around a point and a
half.
That judgment was confirmed when the market got back to work in earnest
yesterday morning, with the yield on the benchmark long bond hovering around
7.25 per cent.
The Federal Open Markets Committee, which determines interest rate policy,
is not due to meet again until May 17.
In a market that is scared of its own shadow, though, last Friday's news
raised fresh fears that it will act sooner.

Gilts will start the week in an uneasy mood as bond markets around the world
react to the strong US employment figures announced on Friday.
For a while last week it seemed the gilts market might have turned a corner,
given the success of the floating rate auction last Wednesday and a rally in
the long gilt future.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Greenwell Montagu, thinks the worst of
the bear market may be over, as institutional demand for gilts seems to be
aroused when yields reach 8 per cent.
Nevertheless, the weakness of the US bond market and UK political worries
may prevent a sharp rally in the near term, he believes. Hopes of a rate cut
seem to have diminished, thanks to sterling's weakness.
Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International
(Europe) says that Wednesday's M0 data, the narrowest measure of the money
supply, is likely to show a rise in the annual rate to 5.7 per cent, from
5.5 per cent in February. Notes and coins figures will be particularly
strong, possibly because of the Easter holidays.
However, the market may not pay much attention to M0 which the authorities
seem to have downgraded as an inflationary indicator. In last week's
Treasury monetary report, M0's refusal to fall within its 0-4 per cent
target range was not mentioned.

FT  05 APR 94 / The Markets: Predicting inflation trends - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a number of years policymakers have recognised that commodity prices may
play a potentially useful role in predicting inflation trends. There was
even a period in the late 1980s when the seven major industrialised
countries formally adopted a commodity price basket to help guide monetary
policy.
Recent remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that gold prices are
a valuable indicator of inflationary expectations suggest that, at least in
the US, commodity prices may once again be influencing monetary policy
decisions.
The idea that commodity prices may play a causal role in the inflation
process is not new. Many economists have emphasised the role of commodity
prices, especially oil prices, in the inflationary booms of 1973-75 and
1979-81 and the subsequent disinflation of the 1980s.
At the moment, global financial markets have a heightened sensitivity to
inflation. Any pick-up in commodity prices could easily spark fears of
tightening in monetary policy by the Fed and limit the scope for easing in
other countries.
The financial markets' nervousness in part reflects the rise in a range of
commodity price indicators over the past year. Yet the links between
commodity prices and inflation are complex, and the inflationary
implications of the recent increases is far from clear.
A commodity price indicator is intuitively attractive for a number of
reasons. First, generalised rises in commodity prices can represent early
signs of inflationary pressure.
Most obviously, a rise in food and oil prices will have an immediate impact
on consumer prices. More generally, increases in the price of raw materials
will raise industrial production costs, which may then be passed on to the
consumer in the form of higher finished goods prices.
Second, commodity prices are sensitive to monetary policy changes. A
relaxation of monetary policy may lead ultimately to higher inflation as the
additional demand generated in the economy boosts the prices of commodities
and manufactured goods. But because commodities tend to be traded in highly
competitive markets, their prices generally adjust more rapidly than either
wages or the prices of finished goods. Commodity prices may therefore serve
as an early lead indicator of future movements in consumer price inflation.
Third, commodity prices may act as a catalyst to the inflation process.
Jumps in commodity prices are generally temporary, and often reverse
themselves within two or three years. Yet shocks to consumer price inflation
often show a high degree of persistence.
To sustain the inflation process, other forces within the economy must
therefore act to reinforce a commodity price shock. For instance, a rise in
consumer price inflation resulting from a commodity price shock may create
upward pressure on wages as workers seek to maintain their real standard of
living. This then feeds back into domestic prices, which creates the
potential for yet another upward move in wages and so on. Thus an initial
shock from commodity prices could have a lasting effect on inflation.
The extent to which commodity prices show up in consumer price inflation
depends on the source of the shock to the economic system and the policy
stance of central banks.
If an increase in commodity price inflation is met with tighter monetary
policy, this would have the effect of slowing the rate of increase of other
prices in the economy. This would alter the relative price between
commodities and other goods while leaving the overall rate of inflation
unchanged. A commodity price shock should only prove inflationary if it is
accommodated by central banks.
Clearly the link between commodity prices and inflation is far from
automatic. For one thing commodity prices are very much more volatile than
consumer prices. This alone calls into question their reliability as
inflation indicators.
Nevertheless, there is a similarity betweens cycles in commodity price
inflation and consumer price inflation in the main industrialised countries
as the graph shows. There is also a tendency for peaks and troughs in
commodity price inflation to precede those in consumer price inflation.
Yet while the linkages between commodity prices and consumer prices are
important, they do not seem stable enough to be able to draw strong
conclusions about the extent to which consumer prices will respond to any
change in commodity prices.
Often large commodity price increases can occur because of temporary supply
disruptions. Yet in most cases these would be unlikely to have general
inflationary implications.
For this reason it is better to look at the behaviour of baskets of
commodities rather than to concentrate on individual price movements. If the
price of several commodities are rising strongly, this is more likely to be
in response to global demand conditions than to unusual supply conditions in
any individual market.
Even so, the signals from different commodity price indices can be quite
different depending on the commodities included and the weights attached to
each one.
The Economist index, for example, shows that commodity prices are up by 12
per cent in dollar terms over the past year. Yet this index excludes oil
prices, which are down by 30 per cent over the same period. The CRB index,
which includes crude oil but with the same weight as orange juice and the
other 19 components, is up by 9 per cent.
By contrast, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, which includes 19
commodities that are assigned weights reflecting their importance in world
production and consumption, shows a rise of 3 per cent since the beginning
of 1994, although this still leaves the level of commodity prices 8 per cent
lower than a year ago.
So should financial markets be worried about the recent upturn in commodity
prices? Almost certainly not. Although the US and UK economies appear to be
growing strongly, the same cannot be said for Japan and the rest of Europe.
The amount of slack in the world economy is still large, as shown by high
levels of unemployment. In this environment it is hard to see how a rise in
commodity prices could act as a catalyst for a sustained rise in consumer
price inflation. For this to occur labour markets will need to tighten
considerably first. Commodity prices may have turned, but this carries few
worries for inflation at the current time.
David Walton is senior international economist at Goldman Sachs.

FT  05 APR 94 / The Markets: Beware of Italian brio - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some things - although not many - are clearer about the Italian markets. The
'meltdown' scenario which investors feared if the election winner looked
unable to form a government now looks remote, although this week may see
some post-election consolidation.
Even for those who have scarcely dabbled with Italian assets, the markets'
behaviour now deserves scrutiny. Italy offers a case study on dealing with
political uncertainty at a turning point in the economic cycle when
corporate prospects are particularly hard to judge.
European investors are hardly strangers to political uncertainty. After the
jitters in sterling markets in the last two weeks, because of worries about
divisions within the Conservative party over European voting procedures,
they may feel they have had their share.
However, now that the marathon of German elections, which will last until
the general election in October, has kicked off with the Lower Saxony
parliament elections last month, they can hardly avoid it. Investors' skills
at reading the financial implications of political turmoil will be at a
premium.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi's victory, which was welcomed by all the Italian
markets, has made some of the investment parameters clearer.
On the currency front, investors now have more confidence in saying that the
exchange rate of L1000 to the D-Mark seen before the election is likely to
be the limit of weakness. Last week saw the lira strengthen to L963 to the
D-Mark. The spread between Italian and German bond yields is also narrowing,
heading towards 250 basis points, from 300.
Against that background, some of the leading Italian stocks continue to look
excellent value fundamentally compared with their European counterparts. For
instance, SIP, the domestic telephone network operator, is now valued at 3.1
times estimates of 1994 cashflow, a discount of between 30 per cent and 100
per cent to companies such as Spain's Telefonica or the UK's British
Telecom. Its capital expenditure peaked in 1991, and last year it turned the
corner from consuming cash to generating it.
Nonetheless, although the best stocks still warrant investment, the markets'
present strength offers a chance to reduce holdings across the board.
Investors should seriously consider taking that chance, given the
uncertainty that remains.
Investors say that the former communist party of the Democratic Left (PDS)
went to some lengths to win their confidence, but that Mr Berlusconi has
made less attempt to cultivate the markets, and that the investment
implications of his victory are unknown.
While investors feel confident that the privatisation programme will
continue and may even speed up, the impact of mooted tax cuts on Italy's
ability to finance its debt is high among their concerns. The form of the
indirect tax rises which are intended to compensate for the tax cuts also
remains unclear.
Before Mr Berlusconi assembles a coalition, little can be judged of the new
government's plans for cutting government spending or whether these hopes
are achievable. Until the answers become clearer, investors may well put
caution first and take profits.
Time for bonds
Traders in the City are braced this morning for bond and equity markets to
fall following the sharp drop in US markets yesterday.
US employment figures, which showed that the American economy is forging
ahead, reawakened fears of a further rise in interest rates, possibly as
soon as this week.
That is exactly the threat which had deterred investors from re-entering the
bond markets in the two months since the Federal Reserve's last rate rise.
However, the markets' immediate jitters aside, investors may well find this
latest alarm marks a good point to consider buying bonds again.
Fears of a sustained rise in US inflation may be premature. Commodity prices
have flattened out while Friday's figures suggested that wage inflation has
stayed low. Nor did Friday indicate that manufacturing industry would
provide a spur to inflation; growth in employment came in the retailing,
entertainment and business services sectors.
Moreover, bond analysts were saying last week that the long queue of forced
sellers which has kept the market down may be ending.
The main wave of selling by the large American hedge funds may now have
passed, as may the unloading of stock by the proprietary trading desks of
banks which report quarterly and wanted to cut positions by the end of
March.
Gilts selling in particular now looks overdone. While the markets remain
nervous of any inflationary indications, the inflation rate in the next 10
years, implied by the yields on 10-year index-linked stock, is 4.4 per cent,
more pessimistic than the same houses' economists are forecasting.
The UK also looks unjustifiably cheap compared with benchmark German bonds.
In late January the yield on 10-year gilts was 50 basis points above
comparable stocks on the Bund. The gap has now more than trebled, and much
of that opened before the market's unease about Conservative party turmoil.
That is not to say that German bonds are now overvalued. The wage
settlements by the public sector unions and by IG Metall, the engineering
union, last month have gone some way to calming fears about German
inflation.
Investors' worries about UK inflation picking up again, which may restrain
the degree of exposure they want, are understandable. However, the
discrepancy between German bonds and gilts may reassure them that most
worries are reflected in the price, and that the risks of re-entering the
market are lower than for some time.
For some of the same reasons, high yielding UK equities also offer new
attractions. They have fallen back with the rest of the equity market in the
correction which has accompanied the bond market selling.
While many investors have been picking over the results reporting season
with an eye to high earnings growth, they may still find appeal in the high
yields now available. The financial sector and utilities have been
particularly hit in the setback. 'Heaven's the wrong word, but it is a great
opportunity', says Mr Hilton Seely, head of the high-yield desk at Kleinwort
Benson Securities in London.
Those who take a more cautious view of the inflation outlook can take
advantage of anomalies which have opened up during the recent gyrations.
Food retailing and manufacturing stocks such as Argyll, Tesco, Unilever and
Hillsdown are good examples. The UK market has broadly treated the
industries as if they fare well in inflationary times. That assumes that
they can edge up their prices even if economic conditions deteriorate, an
assumption partly undermined by the current restructuring in the food
retailing sec-tor.
However, demand for food is generally insensitive to price, while many
agricultural products are supplied under the European Common Agricultural
Policy and prices have been flat or declining. As these raw materials can
make up more than half of operating costs for domestic food manufacturers,
companies are partly shielded from inflationary pressures, allowing them to
raise margins.
Nevertheless, food stocks have suffered during the market's recent weakness,
even though that has been partly because of the same inflationary fears
which have troubled bond markets.
As the stocks provide something of a hedge against inflation, investors who
are nervous about the economic outlook may find them attractive.
Chocaholic investor
Replete with chocolate after the Easter break, investors might turn their
thoughts to cocoa futures. Worldwide demand for cocoa - most of which is
used for making chocolate - has been rising at about 3.5 per cent a year for
some time, both because of world population growth and because some people
are eating more chocolate.
The past year was the third in a row in which demand exceeded supply and
world stocks shrank. That helped send the price from Pounds 663 per tonne
last summer to more than Pounds 1,000 per tonne at the start of this year.
It is unclear how much weight can be put on the five-year producers pact
agreed in February. But if it has any effect, it will be to strengthen the
price. Recent profit-taking has pulled the price back to Pounds 900 per
tonne but that is likely to be quickly regained on any news of crop setbacks
or unexpectedly high consumption levels. The present prices offer investors
a chance to back the world's sweet tooth.

step down

<TEXT>
Shares in Woolworth, the US retailer, tumbled by more than 5 per cent
yesterday in New York following an announcement at the weekend that the
company's chairman and chief financial officer had stepped aside pending an
investigation of accounting irregularities.
Mr William Lavin, chairman and chief executive, and Charles Young, chief
financial officer, have denied wrongdoing. According to Woolworth they have
told the company they have relinquished their positions temporarily so that
the company's business will not be disrupted during the investigation.
The confidence of suppliers was shaken last week as the company announced it
was looking into allegations surrounding its reported gross margins. The
news threatened to disrupt the company's normal trading as suppliers
reassessed their relationships with the retailer.
The shares closed down Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 12 7/8 in New York
yesterday.

FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: General Mills steps up price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Mills, the US foods group, said yesterday it was slashing the price
of its cereals, signalling an escalation of the price war with its main
rival, Kellogg.
The company, which claims a 29 per cent share of the Dollars 8.7bn a year
cereal market, said it would cut the price of its largest cereal brands by
an average 11 per cent, with effect from May 2.
The move, which the company said will reduce its earnings by between five
and 10 cents a share in the current quarter, signals the company's intention
of reversing a 5 per cent slide in cereal sales in its second quarter.
At the same time, the company said it was reducing its use of coupons and
other promotional discounts, leading to estimated savings of Dollars 175m a
year.
The move reflects a trend among US consumer product companies to establish
lower prices for their products and at the same time abolish the generous
discounts used to attract buyers.
Mr Steve Sanger, president of General Mills, said the practice had become
'more and more inefficient for manufacturers and retailers, and burdensome
for consumers'.
The company said that it did not expect the moves to have any impact on its
market share, and that they would have 'a positive profit impact' in the
fiscal year beginning in June.'

FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Four Seasons to be sold as Sharp
loosens control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Four Seasons Hotels has put itself up for sale in a two-stage process that
would allow Mr Isadore Sharp, the luxury hotel chain's founder and
controlling shareholder, to loosen his ties gradually over the next
three-five years.
Mr Sharp, aged 62, linked the move to plans for his own retirement. 'Every
good leader should know when to step down and how to ensure the continuing
good health of his company,' he said.
Four Seasons, which is listed on the Toronto stock exchange, has a market
value of CDollars 294m (USDollars 223m). It owns or manages 44 hotels in 19
countries, including The Pierre in New York and The Four Seasons, in London.
Mr Sharp is keen to maintain Four Seasons' product and management style for
the forseeable future. An outside investor with a strong interest in the
travel business is likely to get a more favourable hearing than a rival
hotel chain. Mr Sharp and his family own 18 per cent of Four Seasons'
shares, but control 70 per cent of the votes. He pledged that the principal
condition of any deal would be identical terms for all shareholders. Mr
Sharp has retained Goldman Sachs to seek a buyer for all Four Seasons'
shares.
Initially, an offer would be made to outside shareholders, followed later by
the purchase of the controlling block. Like other luxury hotel operators,
Four Seasons has been buffeted by the recession. But the company said
yesterday that 1993 earnings, to be published in mid-April, would show very
strong operating numbers'. Nine-month earnings were CDollars 5.2m, on
revenues of CDollars 950m.

FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Snecma loss widens to FFr804m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Snecma, the French state-owned aero-engine manufacturer, suffered increased
net losses of FFr804m (Dollars 136m) last year, compared with a deficit of
FFr794m in 1992. It resulted from declining sales and the costs of
restructuring measures. The company warned of continuing difficulties.
According to the group, which manufactures engines for military and civil
aircraft, the losses were largely due to exceptional charges related to the
sharp fall in turnover to FFr19.57bn last year from FFr22.84bn in 1992.
Exceptional charges in 1993 rose to FFr995m in 1993 from FFr570m the
previous year. Snecma said cost-cutting and restructuring would be 'followed
and amplified in 1994'.
Snecma said there were some reasons for encouragement. Net debts were
reduced to FFr1.12bn at the end of last year from FFr2.56bn at the end of
1992.
Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group which was privatised
last year, is set to take control of Co-operation Pharmaceutique Francaise
(Cooper) following the decision by one of Cooper's largest shareholders to
back its FFr3bn bid.
Sabeton, which holds 21 per cent of Cooper, had previously declined to
support the offer. Rhone-Poulenc had set a target of winning 67 per cent of
Cooper's shares to proceed with the bid.

FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa likely to break even
this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa, the German flag carrier which launched a large restructuring
programme two years ago, is heading for break-even this year after making a
pre-tax loss of DM50m (Dollars 29.4m) last year, Mr Jurgen Weber, the
airline's chairman, said during a visit in London.
'We have had to carry through some painful measures to restore our
competitiveness. However, promising results are now beginning to show,' he
added.
The DM50m pre-tax loss last year follows a much heavier pre-tax deficit of
DM297m in 1992. Lufthansa's after-tax losses are expected to decline to
about DM110m last year from DM373m in 1992.
Mr Weber indicated that Lufthansa would consider in the longer term
investing in an equity stake in United Airlines, one of the biggest US
carriers which has forged a strategic commercial alliance with the German
carrier. 'We feel we must first start in strategic alliances with marketing
agreements to save costs.'
He emphasised that any cross equity deal with United would come much later
and would depend on the results of the ticket code-sharing agreement
recently finalised between the two airlines.
Mr Weber confirmed that Lufthansa, in which the German government holds a
majority 51 per cent stake, was keen to be fully privatised.
However, the airline's privatisation hinged on negotiations between
Lufthansa and the government over the future of the government pension
scheme for the airline's staff, Mr Weber stressed.
The pension scheme 'still blocks the road to our full privatisation', he
said. 'The German government has it very high on its agenda, and Lufthansa
management is strongly in favour of privatisation.'
If privatised under the current pension law, all Lufthansa pensioners and
staff would lose their complete pension benefits. 'The social implications
would be unacceptable,' Mr Weber said.
'Since its establishment as a company Lufthansa and its employees were
legally bound to pay into the government pension scheme which is not funded.
The scheme becomes automatically invalid if public ownership drops below the
magic line of 50 per cent,' he explained. 'That needs to be changed urgently
and we hope our government will find appropriate solutions soon.'
Mr Weber attacked state subsidies for European national carriers during an
address to the Aviation Club of Great Britain. 'We'll have to make hell in
Brussels,' he said, if approval was granted to Air France for a FFr20bn
(Dollars 3.4bn) injection of funds without strict conditions.

FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Revco pays Dollars 600m to
acquire rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Revco, one of the US's biggest drug store chains, said it was acquiring
rival chain Hook-SupeRx for Dollars 600m in a deal which signals a further
consolidation in the drug distribution business in the US.
Both groups are based in Ohio and each has about 1,200 stores, making them
together one of the largest retail drug chains alongside Rite-Aid and
Walgreen.
Revco said it had reached agreement to buy Hook for Dollars 13.75 a share, a
50 per cent premium over the Dollars 9.125 at which the company's shares
closed at last Thursday. Hook's shares jumped to Dollars 12.625 yesterday,
reflecting lingering doubts that Revco would not be able to complete the
acquisition.
Revco, which emerged from bankruptcy in 1992, said it was still assessing
the financing for the deal, and that the transaction was dependent on its
ability to raise up to Dollars 175m through a debenture issue. It said it
had received commitments for bank debt to back the deal, and a standby
purchase agreement from its largest shareholder to back an equity issue.
The uncertainties surrounding healthcare reform in the US and the pressure
on profit margins of both producers and distributors has begun to force
consolidation in the drug industry's various distribution channels. In the
biggest transaction to date, Merck, the country's biggest manufacturer,
acquired telephone distribution company Medco for Dollars 6bn.
Hook had sales of Dollars 2.3bn last year, almost identical to Revco. Mr
Dwayne Hoven, president and chief executive of Revco, said the takeover was
intended principally to strengthen the company's position in Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, as well as
giving it a position in a range of other states where it does not operate.

FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Kodak launches unit for
electronic imaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Fisher, who took over last December as chairman of Eastman Kodak,
the photographic products company, has taken one of his first significant
moves to shake up the business - the formation of a new unit to spearhead
its involvement in the emerging market for electronic imaging.
Mr Fisher, former chief executive of electronics group Motorola, took over
at Kodak when shareholder unrest over the company's lacklustre earnings led
to the resignation of the chairman, Mr Kaye Whitmore.
Kodak said it was forming a separate worldwide unit for digital and applied
imaging and was looking outside the company for someone to head the
operation.
The unit will initially comprise several Kodak businesses - applied imaging,
CD imaging, printer products and the company's equipment and software
platform centre.
Most of Kodak's photographic earnings come from traditional film, which uses
a chemical process, the sensitivity to light from silver halide salts.
However, Kodak has long feared this business could ultimately be superseded
by the rapidly growing market for digital, electronic imaging.
The company is a significant force in electronic imaging - for example in
its invention with Philips of the Netherlands) of the photo CD system. But
critics said that under the previous management they were uncertain how much
clout the electronic side carried within the group.
Mr Jack Thomas, president of Kodak's imaging group, said 'our traditional
businesses will continue to furnish the majority of our earnings for a long
time. However, fuelled by digital technology, digital imaging is growing
faster than conventional photography'.

improvement

<TEXT>
Hermes International, the French leather goods group, last year bucked the
downturn in the global luxury goods market with a 19 per cent increase in
net profits to FFr210m (Dollars 35.6m) from FFr176m in 1992.
The group, which ended its long tradition of independence last June by going
public on the Paris secondary market, said that it expected to achieve yet
another increase in profits for 1994 after a 'strong performance' in the
opening months of the year.
Hermes' strategy of concentrating on the top of the luxury market helped it
to achieve a sales increase of 16 per cent to FFr2.85bn in 1993 from
FFr2.46bn in 1992.
Operating profits rose by 19 per cent to FFr406m from FFr341m over the same
period.
The board proposed raising the net dividend to FFr4.10 a share against the
payment of FFr3.70 in the previous year.

FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: Battle for Corange takes further
twist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for control of Corange, the Bermuda based pharmaceutical group,
took a new twist yesterday when its biggest single shareholder threatened to
sell his stake.
In advance of tomorrow's special general meeting of Corange, which is the
parent company of Boehringer Mannheim, one of Germany's largest healthcare
companies, Mr Curt Engelhorn, said he was not prepared to hold shares in a
company in which he had no say.
The board is attempting to eject Mr Engelhorn, the 67-year-old German who
speaks for 42 per cent of the family-owned Corange's shares through three
different trusts, as chairman of the supervisory board of Boehringer
Mannheim, a company founded 125 years ago.
He has also been replaced as chairman of Corange, on a temporary basis, by
Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of the Bundesbank.
Mr Engelhorn, who was chief executive for 30 years until 1990 when he moved
up to the supervisory board, has retaliated by sending a letter to members
of the Engelhorn family demanding the resignation of Mr Max Link, Corange's
chief executive.
'Mr Link has behaved in a rough, tough, rude manner. He has alienated the
workforce,' said Mr Engelhorn, who is being advised by Goldman Sachs
International, the investment bank.
In his letter to shareholders Mr Engelhorn says: 'Certain members of the
senior management may have a private agenda which is not necessarily
consistent with the interests of the family and shareholders'. He criticises
Corange 2000, the company's financial strategy, which he says is excessively
optimistic.
Mr Engelhorn warns that planned investments cannot be met through cashflow
nor by additional debt. 'Thus the only alternative would be to go public'.
Mr Pohl, along with four other independent directors, have threatened to
resign if they lose tomorrow's vote.
Mr Peter Warburton, international counsel to Corange, which had worldwide
sales last year of Dollars 3.2bn, said Mr Engelhorn had been displaced as
chairman because of a breakdown in confidence between the board and Mr
Engelhorn.
Mr Engelhorn is unlikely to sell his shares until after the annual meeting
in May.

FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: Accountants seek merger agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Partners of BDO Binder Hamlyn met yesterday in a bid to reach consensus over
a proposal to merge the eighth biggest UK accountancy firm with its larger
rival, Arthur Andersen.
It was expected that senior partners supporting the deal would try to
persuade five regional offices opposing the merger to change their minds.
Last week Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and the partnership covering
London and Leeds all expressed support for the idea of a merger, proposed by
Andersen last month.
These four represent more than two-thirds of Binder's total partners and
more than 70 per cent of its staff and fee income. The partnerships opposed
to the deal are Scotland, East Anglia, Northern Ireland, Bristol, Poole,
Nottingham and Wolverhampton.

FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: Amey takes stock market road - Ex-Hanson
construction group plans listing with Pounds 50m price tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amey Holdings, one of the UK's largest private construction companies and
the country's sixth biggest road builder, is expected today to announce
plans for a stock market listing together with a placing to finance
expansion.
The exact amount to be raised has still to be decided, but the issue is
expected to value the company at a minimum of Pounds 50m.
Amey directors, who currently own 62 per cent of the company, may also sell
some of their shares. Close Brothers holds a further 25 per cent of the
shares on behalf of about 30 investment institutions.
It will be the second former Hanson company to come to the market this year.
Beazer, Britain's fourth largest housebuilder, was floated last month by the
UK/US conglomerate raising Pounds 463.4m, of which Pounds 50m of new money
went to Beazer and the remainder to Hanson.
Amey, previously part of the ARC building materials and construction group,
was briefly a Hanson subsidiary when ARC was acquired from Consolidated
Goldfields by Hanson in August 1989.
Amey, the construction arm of ARC, was acquired in November the same year
for Pounds 6.5m by the company's four main directors - Mr Neil Ashley,
executive chairman, Mr Eddie King, managing director, Mr David Cawthorne,
finance director, and Mr Richard Douglas, managing director of Amey
Building.
After stagnating in the 1980s, Amey has trebled its turnover since the
management buy-out. It has regained its position as a large UK road builder
as well as carving out new markets in construction for water companies,
housebuilding and developing a network of regional building companies by
acquiring contracts and businesses from receivers.
These purchases, in most cases, have been self financing leaving the group
with net cash of Pounds 8.7m at the end of December. It also took over the
staff of the former heavy electrical business of JM Jones which was
lossmaking and was closed by Amey last year.
The continuing businesses, however, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m last
year on group sales of Pounds 210m. That compared with profits of just
Pounds 300,000 on sales of Pounds 70m before the buy-out in 1989. Pre-tax
profits including the discontinued business would have been Pounds 2.2m last
year.
The cash is needed to expand the capital base, with shareholders funds
currently about Pounds 7m, to enable the group to expand its housebuilding
operations from 40 homes a year up to 200 to 300 by the late 1990s and to
make other strategic investments.
A larger capital base will give potential customers greater confidence and
enable the company to bid for a bigger range of construction contracts,
including involvement in privately financed infrastructure schemes.

FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels faces delisting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Resort Hotels is set to be delisted following its failure to put forward
restructuring proposals before a March 31 deadline set by the Stock
Exchange.
Resort's shares were suspended on July 16 after it had exceeded its banking
facilities, and imposed significant management changes.
The group has since revealed pre-tax losses of Pounds 71m for the year to
April 1993, a net negative valuation, and a Serious Fraud Office
investigation into the activities of its previous management.
The Stock Exchange said it was left with no choice in delisting the company,
if Resort did not put forward 'something that looks feasible within a
realistic time frame', before midnight last Thursday.
Mr Roland Lewis, managing director, said Resort was keen to maintain a
listing in the longer term, but it was not yet in a position to submit
detailed proposals.
He said the financial implications of delisting were limited, since the
level of documentation required to gain Stock Exchange approval for
restructuring, would be similar to those for a new listing.
Resort's future remains in the hands of its bankers, primarily National
Westminster Bank and Midland Bank, since the group has net debt of Pounds
53m.
It is examining a number of potential solutions, and it is understood that
one option is the sale of the company to private hotel group Jarvis Hotels.
Meanwhile, Resort has withdrawn from the management of 14 hotels which will
therefore 'no longer require any financial support from Resort.'
As part of a rationalisation it is attempting to cease unprofitable
management deals, and develop a hotel marketing role.
Its banks have indicated continued support, and the management remains
confident it has a long-term future.

FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: GRT sets out for London with a Pounds 40m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRT, a bus and coach operator, will come to the market later this month
through a placing which is expected to value the Aberdeen-based group at
about Pounds 40m.
It will be the third bus group to have come to the market within the past
year. Stagecoach, based in Perth, was floated last April, and Badgerline,
the Avon-based operator, came to the market in November.
The Go-Ahead Group, of Gateshead, will be floated by the summer with a
market capitalisation of more than Pounds 40m.
GRT operates in the north-east and central belt of Scotland, as well as
Leicester and Northampton.
The company was formed in 1989 to effect a management-led employee buy-out
of Grampian Regional Transport, the first Scottish local authority bus
company to be privatised.
Midland Bluebird, which operates in the central belt of Scotland, was bought
in 1990. The Leicester CityBus and Northampton Transport operations were
bought late last year.
The flotation, through a placing arranged by James Capel, will raise between
Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m of new money, enabling debt of Pounds 10m to be
paid off leaving cash for acquisitions and organic growth.
Post-flotation, about 30 per cent of GRT's shares will be held by employees,
with a further 25 per cent owned by senior management. Some bus drivers and
cleaners in Aberdeen will have stakes worth between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds
20,000.
Mr Moir Lockhead, chairman, said a key element in the success of the group
had been the high degree of employee commitment achieved through
participation in the buy-out and the operation of an employee share
ownership plan.
To encourage participation in the flotation, employees will be able to buy
one share and receive one free. They will also be offered interest-free
loans of up to Pounds 500. Following the flotation, 5 per cent of the
group's profits before interest and tax will be allocated to fund the
employee scheme.
The group currently employs 1,850 people and has a fleet of 725 vehicles.
Mr Lockhead said: 'The group has expanded well since the buy-out. In order
to continue our development we believe that flotation is the next natural
step and will enable GRT to continue to take advantage of opportunities for
expansion when they arise.'
GRT's turnover has risen from Pounds 11.8m in the year to March 31 1989, to
Pounds 32m in the year end-March 1993, with operating profits increasing
from Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 3.6m. This excludes the Leicester and
Northampton operations.

FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: Saatchi men to keep their jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising group which has seen open
hostilities between its chairman and chief executive in recent weeks, has
said that both men are to stay in their jobs.
In a statement last week the directors said that, following consultation
with share-holders, clients and employ-ees, it had been agreed that the
interests of the company were best served by the con-tinuation of Mr Maurice
Saatchi and Mr Charles Scott in their present roles, as chairman and chief
executive respectively.
The relationship between Mr Saatchi and Mr Scott appeared to deteriorate
towards the end of last year and it had been looking increasingly likely in
recent weeks that one of them would have to leave.
Mr Saatchi is said to be unhappy about Mr Scott's handling of the group's
financial performance; Mr Scott refuses to be drawn on the conflict, but his
supporters say that Mr Saatchi has not been bringing in the new business the
group so badly needs.

FT  05 APR 94 / UK Company News: Heron completes sale of motor
distributorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heron International, the property and trading group run by Mr Gerald Ronson,
will today complete the sale of the Heron Suzuki motor distributor to Suzuki
Motor Corporation.
However, the sale of Heron Suzuki - which was agreed last month - will do
little to reassure Heron's creditors who were left in confusion last week
after meetings of senior and junior bondholders were adjourned when they
failed to reach a quorum.
The bondholders' meetings had been called to consider Heron's request for a
deferral of interest payments due on Thursday until the end of June.
Because the interest has been left unpaid, the bonds are technically in
default - though as yet no creditor has moved against the company.
Heron, which completed a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing six months ago, had warned
that without the interest deferral, and the postponement of other payments
due, the property and trading group might be unable to continue trading.
In the wake of the bondholders' meetings there has been some speculation
that Heron might ask UBS, its financial adviser, to formulate proposals for
the sale of the whole group.
Yesterday, however, Heron said it had 'nothing to add' to its statements of
last week.
Heron expects to receive Pounds 75m from disposals by the end of June -
Pounds 31m from the sale of Heron Homes and Pounds 44m from the sale of
Heron Suzuki.

Power Grid and its estimated value is about Pounds 50m.
The National Grid is not revealing how big its shareholding will be but it
estimates that it expects to invest about Pounds 25m.
The link will provide surplus off peak energy from the eastern region to the
north.
National Grid and Power Grid already have a co-operation agreement to

FT  05 APR 94 / Northrop bid wins control of Grumman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Northrop yesterday emerged the victor in the battle for control of US
defence company Grumman, after rival bidder Martin Marietta declined to
raise its bid for the company.
Northrop increased its offer for the company to Dollars 62 (Pounds 42.40) a
share, even though, at Dollars 60 a share, it had already made the higher
bid ahead of a Friday afternoon deadline for offers set by the Grumman
board.
Martin Marietta, which a month ago sparked the battle by announcing an
agreed Dollars 55 takeover of Grumman, said it was not in its shareholders'
interests to increase its own offer.
The Northrop bid, which values Grumman at nearly Dollars 2.2bn, marks one of
the largest acquisitions yet in the US defence sector, where mergers are
being driven by falling defence spending. Analysts said that they expected
other takeovers to follow, with the most likely acquisition candidates being
defence divisions of larger corporations looking to leave the business.
Northrop's share price dropped more than 5 per cent yesterday morning on
news of its increased offer, against a background of a weak stock market. By
the close in New York, Northrop shares had fallen Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars
37 5/8 .
Mr Kent Kresa, Northrop's chairman, insisted that his company was paying 'a
fair price for Grumman, one that will enable us to enhance profitability in
the long term, beginning next year'.
The deal would not affect Northrop's earnings this year, and would begin to
increase its earnings per share in 1995, he said. On completion of the
tender offer, which has been extended to April 15, the company will be
renamed Northrop Grumman.
Martin Marietta said it had received a Dollars 50m termination fee from
Grumman, which had been agreed at the time of their original merger accord,
and that is was also seeking Dollars 8.8m to cover its costs in the bid
battle.
Yesterday, Martin Marietta reiterated its intention to make acquisitions
when opportunities arose.

FT  05 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Strength in US should cover UK
blushes - Invesco MIM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost every mention of Invesco MIM's name in the UK last year was
accompanied by references to two things: a record Pounds 750,000 fine from
regulator Imro, and the saga of its involvement in the Mirror Group pension
scheme - denuded by the late Robert Maxwell.
The Imro fine has been digested, and in an out-of-court settlement earlier
this year, Invesco paid the trustees of the Mirror Group scheme Pounds 11m,
without admitting liability. Analysts say the group has now cleaned itself
up - but results for last year, due on Thursday, are expected to reflect a
struggle to retain institutional clients and to attract new business in the
UK. At the interim stage, the European division (including the UK) had just
moved back into profit.
Luckily for Invesco, however, there is little awareness of or concern over
these affairs in the US, the source of an overwhelming proportion of the
group's funds under management. US mutual funds put on spectacular growth
during 1993, and Invesco's strength in the US should mean that profits from
the US division more than outweigh any weakness in the UK.
Most analysts' forecasts for last year's pre-tax profits are in the Pounds
30m-Pounds 40m range, after the exceptional charge of Pounds 11m for the
pay-out to the Mirror pensioners. Bolder forecasts go to Pounds 50m or more,
compared with Pounds 12.6m after exceptionals in 1992.
The total dividend is expected to stay at last year's reduced level of 3p,
or possibly increased by 1p. But the company is thought to be too concerned
with rebuilding its balance sheet to bring the dividend back to its 1991
level of 6p.
Even if the results are considerably better than forecast, analysts say the
share price may not be much affected because of the market downturn and
fears that the boom in US mutual funds is over.

FT  05 APR 94 / Steinhardt makes first move in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steinhardt Partners, one of the world's top three hedge fund managers, has
launched its first raid on a quoted UK company, as a first step towards
making a series of substantial investments in debt-stricken European
businesses.
Over the past two months, Steinhardt, which has equity under management of
around Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn) but borrows many billions more for
investment, has quietly acquired a 30 per cent stake in the convertible
preference shares of Ransomes, the lossmaking manufacturer of grass cutting
equipment.
Even though this gives Steinhardt a fully diluted stake of just under 15 per
cent in the company - well above the 3 per cent level that normally obliges
public disclosure of a holding - the shares are currently non-voting, so
there has probably not been a legal obligation to disclose.
However, the convertible preference shares become voting instruments when
dividends are six months in arrears.
Ransomes made pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.9m in 1993 and it postponed the
payment of the preference dividend due last October 31. As a result, holders
of the preference shares should receive votes at the end of the month,
giving Steinhardt a potentially influential stake in the company.
A financier with a close knowledge of Steinhardt's European plans said that
although a full bid for Ransomes could not be ruled out, the fund's normal
preference was to take a strategic holding and then persuade a company to
adopt a reorganisation plan.
Steinhardt, which paid around Pounds 10m for the Ransomes stake, is
understood to believe the company has a solid operating business but will be
unable to thrive until the burden of paying interest on Pounds 75m of bank
debt and dividends on Pounds 56.6m of convertible preference shares is
reduced by a significant injection of equity.
The financier said that Steinhardt was also examining a series of other
investments in over-borrowed European companies.
Like Soros Fund Management and Tiger, its two main hedge fund rivals,
Steinhardt typically invests in very liquid instruments - particularly
currency and interest rate derivatives - with the aim of making enormous
profits from movements in foreign exchange or bond markets.
However, like Soros, it also takes substantial stakes in companies. In the
US, it has invested hundreds of million dollars in businesses with excessive
debts in order to facilitate financial reconstructions. For example,
Steinhardt has been battling with a consortium linked to Continental
Airlines over proposals to recapitalise America West Airlines, the US
carrier in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Mr Michael Steinhardt, founder of the fund, is consistently ranked as one of
Wall Street's biggest earners, alongside Mr George Soros, earning hundreds
of million dollar a year.

FT  05 APR 94 / Picking up the pieces of an emerging market: The secondary
market for the debt of less developed countries was profitable and popular.
But just as it was on the verge of joining the mainstream, it collapsed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contrast between last year's bull run in the financial markets and this
year's bearish conditions is nowhere more striking than in the secondary
market for emerging country debt.
The market consists of the restructured and impaired loans made by banks to
countries in Latin America, Africa, the former Soviet bloc and Asia, many of
which ran into problems in the 1980s. Since then, the value of these loans
in the secondary market has staged a strong recovery, as the
creditworthiness of their emerging economies has improved.
So far this year, Salomon Brothers' Brady bond index, which tracks the
restructured commercial bank debt of countries such as Argentina, Mexico and
the Philippines, has declined by about 20 per cent, after last year's
impressive return of 43.87 per cent.
The commercial loans of countries that have yet to restructure their debt
have fared even worse. Poland's debt has dropped from 52 cents on the dollar
in early January to 31 cents, while Sudan's debt is trading at 6 cents on
the dollar, down from 11 cents.
Few traders had doubted that the market was heading for a correction, but
the scale of the collapse has shocked many participants. Many were convinced
the market was in the process of entering the mainstream.
Trading volume last year trebled to an estimated Dollars 1,000bn-Dollars
1,500bn (Pounds 685bn-Pounds 1,027bn), according to a recent market survey
by Risk magazine. That compares with estimated market turnover of around
Dollars 200bn for 1991, and reflects the broadening of interest in the
market.
The market's roots go back to the early 1980s. When Latin American countries
began to default on their commercial bank debt, some banks started to sell
off some of the impaired debt. Gradually they set up small teams to adjust
their own books, and a secondary market in what was then known as LDC (less
developed country) debt developed.
Later, seeing the profits to be made from the LDC debt market, investment
banks began to set up trading teams. But they were stillproprietary traders
who were charged with making money by using the banks' own capital to take
positions, rather than dealing on behalf of clients.
The market slowly started to be viewed as a genuine investment medium, often
for so-called 'flight capital' - money held offshore by wealthy Latin
American nationals - and then by specialist country funds. In recent years,
large returns attracted mainstream institutional investors as bond markets
rallied and the credit ratings of Latin American countries improved. Last
year, there was a wave of money from hedge funds (highly leveraged, mainly
offshore funds).
'Unfortunately, about half-way through the process (of
institutionalisation), the market has gone into decline,' said one
investment banker.
One reason for the severity of the decline may be the nature of trading:
many participants are themselves still natural holders of the debt.
'Our market is different from the gilts or US Treasury market,' said Mr Paul
Luke, head of emerging market debt research at Morgan Grenfell.
'In those markets, the path of interest rates is an issue over which
honourable men can differ. In our market you don't get anyone who says it's
overvalued.'
The sharp decline has come just as participants are pouring fresh resources
into the market. Not only have new entrants recently set up teams - in some
cases poached from other houses for hefty packages - but the advent of the
institutional investor has increased the demands on both investment and
commercial banks. Already, most of the top 10 houses have between 15 and 25
traders. Salomon Brothers estimates that the number of trading and sales
professionals involved in the market worldwide has grown from 750 in 1991-92
to between 1,000 and 1,500.
In addition, institutional investors also want expensive research facilities
at their disposal. 'It's very costly to run a full sales, trading and
research operation, but that's what the major institutions demand,' said one
emerging market debt trader. As a result, the return on capital for this
business is set to decline, albeit from levels as high as 40 per cent,
according to some traders.
In spite of its problems - heavy losses, long positions, no sign of
investors returning - the outlook for the market is not as bleak as it may
seem.
'Obviously it's not a pleasant thing to go through, but it's not entirely
unhealthy. Towards the end of last year there was a lot of froth in the
market,' said Ms Alex McLeod, managing director, secondary asset trading at
Continental Bank.
After a spate of bad news - including the collapse of Banco Latino,
Venezuela's second-largest bank, the rebel uprising in Mexico, and the
assassination of the country's leading presidential candidate - there is
some good news on the horizon. Brazil, Poland and Bulgaria are all close to
finalising Brady deals.
For all but the most recent entrants to the market, the hefty profits of the
past few years have provided a cushion that will enable them to wait for the
market's fortunes to pick up again.

FT  05 APR 94 / NUT conference paves way for strike action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Union of Teachers, the UK's largest teachers' union, yesterday
opened the way for strikes against a string of government education
policies.
Mr Doug McAvoy, the NUT's general secretary, attempted to play down
prospects of the votes at the union's annual conference leading to
widespread classroom disruption. He was responding to strong criticism of
the conference decisions from ministers and rival trade unions.
The NUT on Sunday isolated itself from the other unions by pressing ahead
with plans for an indefinite boycott of the government's national curriculum
tests.
During the conference, which started in Scarborough on Saturday and ends
today, leftwing delegates committed the union to strike plans over rising
class sizes, cuts in grants to schools with a high number of ethnic minority
children and new contracts for teachers in sixth-form colleges. The NUT
conference is traditionally militant, but this year's decisions mark a
significant shift in power towards the left.
Members have also reserved the right to strike over pupil tests, which will
be boycotted indefinitely, and to refuse to co-operate with 'anti-trade
union legislation'.
However, a motion calling for strike plans in support of a flat-rate Pounds
3,000 pay increase was defeated in a rare success for the moderate
executive.
The leaders of the rival teachers' unions have distanced themselves from the
NUT. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general-secretary of the National Association of
Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said: 'What's going on at the NUT
conference doesn't represent the majority view of the profession.'
Mr McAvoy claimed there would be no widespread disruption. Any school
wishing to take industrial action would need to obtain a two-thirds majority
of its members in a ballot and then seek approval, both from the union's
local division and the action committee of the national executive which is
dominated by moderates. Many delegates had voted in line with factions at
the conference, but he predicted they would not persuade teachers to take
prolonged strike action, which would be needed to force concessions from the
government.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, said he was 'really very saddened'.
'I think parents will be frankly bewildered that just when standards are
beginning to improve in this country we suddenly seem to be back in the
1960s, with threats of one-day strikes right in the middle of the A-level
period,' he added.
Mr Tony Lloyd, shadow education minister, said Mr Patten should resolve the
crisis by calling in all the teachers' unions to hammer things out.
'These tests still have very little value for the pupils involved. They are
all about saving John Patten's face,' Mr Lloyd told BBC Radio 4's The World
at One.
Mr Don Foster, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: 'It would have
been very much more sensible for the NUT to co-operate with the five other
teacher unions.'

FT  05 APR 94 / Russian investment surge boosts industrial shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A surge of domestic and foreign investment in Russia is boosting the shares
of privatised companies and giving much-needed momentum to the process of
industrial restructuring, according to financiers.
The flow of foreign funds into the country reached Dollars 400m (Pounds
273m) in the first quarter this year, raising hopes of a long-awaited
breakthrough in investor interest in Russia, although some experts are less
optimistic. Foreign investment totalled Dollars 2.9bn last year.
The prices of vouchers which Russians use to buy shares in privatised
companies have been rising steadily and trading in some of the 'plum'
enterprises has been frenetic, say financiers.
The two-year privatisation programme, due to end in June, is now releasing
shares of companies in the utility, communication and energy sectors, at
knock-down prices.
They include the Unified Energy System, the world's largest integrated power
generation company; the Lukoil holding company, Russia's largest oil
producer and refiner; the Rostelkom telephone corporation; and the Primorsk
and Novorossisk Shipping companies, which dominate the Russian Far East and
Black Sea maritime routes.
Shares in Unified Energy System have risen from an original nominal price of
Rbs1,000 (70 US cents) when they were sold to workers to Dollars 2.30 when
workers sold their shares in over-the-counter trading and to about Dollars 8
in the national voucher auction, when members of the public bid their
vouchers for a 13 per cent stake in the company.
Even so, the valuation of the company was extremely low by international
standards, according to Mr Boris Jordan, head of the Credit Suisse First
Boston branch in Moscow - the largest foreign bank engaged in trading shares
in Russia and the only one with a broker's licence from the Ministry of
Finance.
'A similar company, producing that number of kilowatts, would be worth about
Dollars 49bn in the US (and) over Dollars 30bn in Europe. Here it was worth
Dollars 200m. The world has not yet woken up to the fact that Russian assets
are so extremely cheap,' said Mr Jordan.
In this climate, Russian investment funds, many of them cash-rich from
arbitrage activities, are buying enough shares in some companies to control
the management board. These funds, say CSFB executives, are now
sophisticated, knowledgeable and eager to restructure the companies under
their control.
Mr Stephen Jennings, CSFB's investment banking director, believes the next
three to five years will see widespread change in Russia's industrial
sector.
Set against the new-found enthusiasm of Russian and foreign investors for
privatised companies are the growing number of complaints from foreign
business people that rapidly changing laws and tax regimes make large deals
unattractive, that organised crime is penetrating business practices, and
that the country remains politically and macro-economically unstable.

FT  05 APR 94 / Buyers surface for sale of tunnelling machines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Want to buy 200km of second-hand steel pipe or 110km of copper earthing
cable? Maybe you are in the market for a fleet of used excavators or a
crawler-crane capable of lifting 200 tonnes? One careful owner, and it must
all go.
Vast amounts of civil engineering machinery and surplus materials left over
from building the Channel tunnel, which opens officially on May 6, are
attracting possible buyers from Malaysia, Denmark, Abu Dhabi and the US.
Some 85 per cent of the project's second-hand equipment has already been
sold, raising more than Pounds 30m for Eurotunnel, the operator, and
Transmanche, the consortium of five British and five French contractors
which designed and built the tunnel.
Still for sale is one of the 8.72-metre diameter tunnel-boring machines, the
biggest of some eight machines used to cut the 50km-tunnel linking Britain
and France.
The machine, built in Glasgow by Howden Group, cost Pounds 7.5m and could
fetch up to Pounds 2.5m on the second-hand market, according to agents Henry
Butcher, who are handling the British end of the sale.
Possible purchasers include builders of the proposed Channel tunnel rail
link between London and the Kent coast. Other equipment may be bought by
construction companies building London Underground's Jubilee Line extension.
The agents have already sold a smaller tunnelling machine to build a
stormwater drainage system at Brighton.
Other tunnel-boring machines, which met mid-Channel, will remain entombed
under the seabed. It would cost too much to dismantle and remove them. One
of the French machines used to bore a section of tunnel from the French
landward side is to be exhibited at the Eurotunnel terminal near Calais.
Another may be shipped to Britain to be exhibited.
Mr Peter Harriman, a Henry Butcher partner, says the agents have raised more
than Pounds 16m from British sales. Purchasers have included tunnellers
building the Boston metro in the US and the 18-km Storebaelt link in Denmark
who have bought locomotives and muck wagons.
A Hong Kong developer building hospitals in Malaysia paid Pounds 500,000 for
desalination plants previously used in the cooling system during
construction of the Channel tunnel. A 200-tonne crawler-crane was sold to
Abu Dhabi. Others were sold to the US, Singapore and Portugal, raising
Pounds 2.5m, said Mr Harriman.
Mr Philippe Laboise, cost control and administration manager for the French
works, says French sales have recovered about 12 per cent of the value.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
April will be Orange. The quirkily-named mobile phone service from Hutchison
Telecom will be launched this month, and it poses a strong competitive
threat to Mercury's One-2-One network. The latter has set itself up as a
cheap mass market phone in the south-east, but Orange may be similarly
priced and offer much wider coverage. A national system would also challenge
the more expensive mobile operators Cellnet and Vodafone.
Much depends on Orange being able to deliver on its claims of wide coverage,
high quality and enough capacity on the system to meet demands. Assuming
that it can, however, the existing three networks will have to respond.
Mercury has a strong brand name, but limiting its initial investment to
London now looks too timid. Even though One-2-One is not now constrained on
capital expenditure, it will not reach Orange's opening coverage for at
least 18 months. If the two services are similar in other respects, Mercury
will be at a significant disadvantage in attracting consumers.
Vodafone and Cellnet will also have difficulty defending their current
prices on the basis of national coverage. The slimming of mobile's fat
margins will accelerate. But the established operators want to make hay
while the sun shines, so tariff cuts will be as slow as possible. The rise
in connections may also help. Vodafone and Cellnet's cheap handsets and
One-2-One's cheap calls have increased the market substantially in recent
months. Another competitor may well do the same. Mercury, however, must
hurry if it does not want to be last.

It has become fashionable to knock sterling. Since its peak of DM2.62 in
mid-January, it has fallen 5 per cent against the D-mark. Mr John Major's
position has become more precarious, creating uncertainty about policy. The
current account deficit is growing, while this month's tax increases may
slow the recovery, adding to pressure for an interest rate cut. On that
basis, there is no particular reason why sterling's fall should stop here.
Look at its relationship with the dollar, though, and the picture appears
different.
Sterling is still well inside the range of Dollars 1.46 to Dollars 1.51 in
which it has traded since last October. Moreover, it has fallen only 3 per
cent on a trade-weighted basis since the start of the year, although its
decline did accelerate over the past week. While some of the fall against
the D-mark is clearly due to Britain's eye-catching political troubles, some
has other causes. As so often in the past, sterling has been caught up in
tension surrounding the dollar, which has weakened partly in the wake of
US-Japanese trade tensions and partly out of disappointment with the slow
pace of German interest rate cuts.
With next month's local and European elections looming, sterling will remain
vulnerable. If the economy continues to recover despite the tax increases,
though, there is a chance that, having moved down with the dollar, it might
share in any recovery of the US currency. Gilts would then look doubly
attractive at a yield premium of over 130 basis points to German bunds.

The French government's privatisation programme must be beginning to cause a
few concerns. The 8 per cent fall in the CAC-40 this year is unnerving and
some recent privatisation issues, such as Elf Aquitaine, are trading below
their offer price. Friday's postponement of the sale of the
recession-damaged Banque Hervet will hardly have helped sentiment either.
The government's immediate worry must be whether to press ahead with the
sale of more shares in the insurance group, UAP. Financial stocks have been
out of favour across Europe this year. UAP has fallen 21 per cent.
But the French government can ill-afford to cancel the UAP issue, given the
need to recycle the proceeds into recapitalising the corporate wounded, such
as Credit Lyonnais and Air France. Besides, the government will be desperate
to avoid any further blows to its credibility by reversing its privatisation
policy. That suggests the state will sell its holding this summer, but at a
less ambitious price than might once have been anticipated.
The government's discomfiture may prove the investor's opportunity. Like
most other stock markets, the Paris bourse has lost ground as the US Fed has
started making cash look attractive again. The liquidity tide which
sustained French shares last year has now lost its force. There is bound to
be a hiatus as the market waits for the corporate earnings momentum to take
up the slack. But the prospects for corporate earnings look good as the
economy recovers. The French penchant for provisioning in recession should
also give that upturn added edge.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Signs of unease among City institutions must increase the chances that at
least one of the UK water companies will appeal to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission this summer. The regulator will not want to provoke a
wholesale revolt. But Ofwat might reason that an appeal or two might be an
acceptable price to pay for keeping water bills as low as possible. Since
both the Prudential and BZW Investment Management have questioned Ofwat's
methodology, the companies must also take encouragement that the regulator's
intellectual case is far from watertight.
Yet deciding under what circumstances a company should appeal is far from
easy. A price limit which looked likely to drive interest cover down close
to two times would certainly qualify, on the grounds that the company would
be unable to borrow enough to finance capital investment. But the pain
threshold for equity investors would be reached some way above. If the banks
were uncertain about interest cover, there would be little left over for
dividend growth.
The issue turns on what level of dividend growth is acceptable. On Ofwat's
view that water is a relatively low-risk business, dividend growth below the
market average would be acceptable. Yet that view is difficult to square
with the regulatory uncertainties and risks inherent in such large capital
spending programmes. On that basis, real dividend growth of 3 or 4 per cent
 -around the long-term equity market average - might be the minimum that
companies and their shareholders will be inclined to accept.

FT  05 APR 94 / Knocked about but unbowed: Israel's economy is healthy - yet
growth depends on the peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peace-making in the Middle East was always going to be a stop-go affair. So
it is not surprising Israel's economy is being knocked about in its wake.
At the start of this year, economic liberalisation, a flood of well-educated
immigrants from the former Soviet Union and rising hopes of peace were
leading to fast economic growth, rapid technological advance, surging
exports and an investment boom that saw the value of securities quoted on
the Tel Aviv stock exchange rise from about Dollars 8bn to Dollars 50bn
between 1989 and 1993.
A very different, and grimly familiar, picture of Israel has dominated the
world's headlines since the end of February, when Mr Baruch Goldstein, a
fanatical Jewish settler, massacred 29 Palestinians worshipping in a Hebron
mosque.
The Hebron killings and the authorities' heavy-handed treatment of the
occupied territories jeopardised the peace process and did nothing for
Israel's image abroad. At the same time, the investigation of alleged
insider dealing and share price manipulation on the Tel Aviv stock exchange
alarmed domestic investors and helped push the index of 100 leading shares
down by nearly a quarter from its mid-January peak of 259.
In the space of three months, the mood swung from viewing Israel as possibly
the world's next hot growth prospect to just another emerging market economy
where the speculative bubble had burst. But though there are still many
risks - not the least, the threat of extremists on either side again
knocking the peace process off course - the Israeli economy has underlying
strengths. Those could become more apparent if efforts towards an overall
Middle East settlement, involving Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, as well as the
Palestinians, are maintained.
Israel at the weekend began to withdraw and redeploy troops in the occupied
territories in preparation for Palestinian self-rule and the arrival of the
first contingent of Palestinian policeman; it follows last week's agreement
between the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organisation for
international observers to be deployed in Hebron, allowing negotiations on
Palestinian self-government in Jericho and Gaza to resume. Both sides appear
anxious to make up for lost time.
The Israeli government is keen that progress on Palestinian self-rule should
be followed by economic co-operation. The government's hope is that peace
will enable Israel to use its rich human capital and scientific and
financial expertise to play a bigger role in a world economy where growth is
increasingly knowledge-based. The stock exchange has reacted positively to
recent events, with the 100 share index closing yesterday at 210.2, nearly 6
per cent above last month's lows.
Confidence among businessmen and government officials is high that growth
this year will rise to between 5 and 6 per cent, exceeding last year's 3.6
per cent. And unemployment is expected to decline further after an
unexpected fall to 9 per cent in the final quarter of last year from 11.2
per cent in 1992.
There appears to be no let-up in the influx of foreign delegations and study
missions to examine business opportunities. Even after the Hebron killings,
long-term investment funds continued to flow into Israel. The Claridge
investment group, in which the Canadian Bronfman family has a big stake,
began putting together a Dollars 150m fund for wealthy international
investors to put money into Israel shortly before the massacre. According to
Mr Jonathan Kolber, Claridge president, the fund was oversubscribed last
month.
The limited economic fall-out from the Hebron killings indicates investors'
earlier enthusiasm for Israel has deeper roots than last year's handshake on
the White House lawn between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister,
and Mr Yasser Arafat, the PLO leader. It testifies to an improvement in the
economic fortunes of a country that, in the mid-1980s, was on the brink of
hyper-inflation and notorious for over-regulation and socialist policies.
A rigorous stabilisation programme brought Israel's annual inflation rate
down from 445 per cent in 1984 to less than 20 per cent two years later,
preparing the ground for growth. Today Israel, with only 5.4m people, has a
gross domestic product of Dollars 65.5bn, dwarfing its neighbours. At about
Dollars 12,500, GDP per head is far above the Dollars 1,000 per capita GDP
in the occupied territories or Egypt's Dollars 600.
To be sure, inflation, at 11.2 per cent last year, was high by western
standards. But the Bank of Israel appears on course to hit the government's
8 per cent target this year.
The government is cutting taxes for businesses and individuals. It is
committed to a programme of privatisation, due to raise about Dollars 1.5bn
this year on top of Dollars 1.3bn in 1993. Spending priorities have been
shifted to encourage growth: the 1994 budget envisages a 15 per cent
expansion in infrastructure spending and a 30 per cent rise in funding for
education over 1 1/2 years. Trade unions have lost a lot of power, although
this year has seen a damaging strike at Bezeq, the national
telecommunications company. Only 30 per cent of annual wage changes are now
reached through collective bargaining, against 90 per cent 10 years ago.
Building on existing free trade agreements with the US and Europe, Israel is
progressively exposing its domestic economy to competition from abroad.
At the same time, the state has developed a range of policies to promote
research and development that have helped Israel's spending on R&amp;D reach 3
per cent of GDP - more than the US, Japan and other leading industrial
countries.
Israel tops the world league table for published research in the natural
sciences and engineering, with more than 60 papers per 10,000 members of the
labour force, against 30 in the US. According to The Lancet, the UK medical
journal, Israel produces proportionately more medical research publications
than the US or UK. Immigration from Russia, which has boosted the population
by 550,000 since 1989, has greatly strengthened Israel's pool of scientists
and engineers.
That and Israel's heavy investment in education recently prompted Union Bank
of Switzerland to predict Israel could become the third most competitive
country in the world in the years ahead, after South Korea and China, and
ahead of Japan. The combined effect of government policies, immigration and,
now, hopes of peace has been an upsurge in entrepreneurship and the
mobilisation of capital to finance new businesses.
This business renaissance partly explains why industrial exports rose by 18
per cent last year, in spite of recession elsewhere. The other central
factor was the improved international climate engendered by the peace
process: this helped Israel penetrate new markets in south-east Asia, China
and former communist countries.
But Israel still has some way to go before it can rank among the world's
blue-chip economies.
The stock market scandals have reinforced concerns among some foreign
investors about a lack of transparency. Mr Alistair Stewart, general manager
for Europe, the Middle East and Africa of General Electric, the US
industrial giant, warns that Israel will have to improve its business
integrity if it is to be a 'hub' economy for the Middle East. Others say it
still has the hallmarks of a 'bubble economy' where company and stock market
values are too high.
Many foreign investors, and some Israeli businessmen, say the government has
been too slow to cut taxes and privatise. Others complain that Israel's
currency, the shekel, is still not fully convertible.
None of these problems is life threatening. Indeed, in the days after
Hebron, many Israeli businessmen argued their country could prosper even if
the peace process ground to a halt. But there is recognition domestically
that Israel will find it impossible to play a full role in the regional and
world economies so long as there is no settlement with the Palestinians, or
peace with Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. 'We fought five times. The Arabs
didn't win the wars. We didn't win the peace,' says Mr Shimon Peres, the
foreign minister.
In the drive for peace, economic and security factors are inextricably
combined. Many Israelis hope that peace will offer a chance of drawing the
fangs of Islamic fundamentalism through trade and investment, and by
eventually closing the gap between Israel's prosperity and the low GDP per
head of neighbouring Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Israel, Mr Peres argues,
cannot stay prosperous in a sea of poverty - 'otherwise waves of bitterness
will lap over our small island'.
It is a view shared by business leaders, who say they are ready to make
sacrifices in the form of trade concessions to former enemies to achieve
this goal.
'We want satisfied, well-fed neighbours with higher living standards and
less violence,' says Mr Dan Gillerman, chairman of the Federation of Israeli
chambers of commerce. Mr Dan Propper, head of the Israeli manufacturers
association, puts it more bluntly: 'No one wants a new Iran next to us.'

A tired commercial traveller fed up with driving across the North Yorkshire
moors spots a sign outside a lonely pub advertising 'a pie, a pint, and a
friendly word for Pounds 1.80'.
Not knowing when he is next going to get a meal, the traveller decides to
rest a while and orders the special. The barman pulls a pint, hands over the
pie and then goes straight back to doing his crossword. The traveller is a
bit miffed at the lack of welcome and after several minutes' silence asks
what happened to the promised friendly word.
'Don't eat the pie,' mutters the barman.

Farce, rather than tragedy, from distant Athens. Ursula Barrow, Belize's
High Commissioner in London, was supposed to be there last week as an
observer to the 'San Jose ministerial', an annual binge where ministers from
the European Union and Central America talk about peace and stability.
Her presence less than delighted Guatemala's foreign minister, Gladys Ruiz
de Vielman. Guatemala still nurtures yearnings for Belizean territory;
Belize's privileged access to the EU banana market doesn't help much,
either.
Greek European Affairs minister Theodoros Pangalos, their host, first denied
he had invited Belize. Then he claimed the invitation had been withdrawn.
The Greek diplomat then tried to push her out of the group photograph and
hustle her out the meeting, while Britain's foreign office minister, David
Heathcoat-Amory, tried to stop him.
Yet again Greek diplomacy triumphed and Barrow left. In another age, such an
insult might have merited the dispatch of one of Her Majesty's gun boats.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By contrast, the fevered speculation about John Major's future has not
discouraged the equally hefty book at Westminster on who will get what in
the summer cabinet reshuffle. The presumption is that Major will have one
more stab at stamping his authority on the government before bowing to his
critics.
John Patten, 48, the ill-fated education secretary, is odds-on favourite
along with attorney-general Nicholas Lyell, 55, to be given the opportunity
to spend more time with his family. They might well be joined - voluntarily
 -by John MacGregor, 57, and Peter Brooke, 60. Douglas Hurd, 64, has decided
not to desert the sinking ship. Despite the ambitions of Virginia Bottomley,
46, David Hunt, 51, remains favourite for the party chairmanship.
But for those seeking an interesting long-shot, Observer hears that Major
may seek to coax Peter (now Lord) Walker, 62, back into the political fray.
Friends of Major say Walker's formidable political talents would make him an
ideal chairman.
Of course the Tory right would be infuriated but Major has lost them anyway.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Meanwhile, the race is on, but no bets are being placed, for the replacement
of another independent-minded Irishman, Maurice Doyle, who steps down as the
governor of Ireland's central bank at the end of this month.
Traditionally, the job tends to go to a senior civil servant from the
Department of Finance. The obvious choice would be Sean Cromien, the first
secretary, but he turns 65 this year and the word is that he wishes to
dedicate his coming years to writing and wildlife pursuits. So the running
looks like being taken up by the three second secretaries: namely Maurice
O'Connell, 57, who heads the finance division; Paddy Mullarkey, 54, who
heads the budget and economic division; and Bob Curran who runs the public
expenditure division and is also in his 50s.
Outsiders include Kieran Kennedy, the director of Dublin's Economic and
Social Research Institute, Michael Somers of the National Treasury
Management Agency, and Gerry Scanlan, the recently retired chief executive
of Allied Irish Banks. The smart money is on O'Connell but Paddy Power's -
Ireland's largest bookmakers - is not taking bets. 'We think the decision
has already been made and insiders could catch us out', say the bookies.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Padraig Flynn is the craftiest European Commissioner of them all. At least
that is what some are saying in Brussels after his unexpected move to
support Sir Leon's Brittan's campaign to become the next president of the
European Commission.
Flynn has apparently calculated that it is a no-lose strategy to back Sir
Leon's unlikely bid to succeed Jacques Delors. Success would mean a plum job
in the new commission and failure might still lead to a good turn from Sir
Leon.
A third option looks even better. Flynn shares Sir Leon's view that victory
depends on halting the bandwagon behind Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime
minister who remains the race favourite. But a stalemate would not
necessarily tip the scales towards Sir Leon, whose chief weakness is his
passport; more likely, EU heads of government would still be looking for a
Lubbers-like conservative, if possible from a small state. And who better
than. . . Padraig Flynn?

FT  05 APR 94 / Leading Article: The dollar dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gyrations of the dollar since the news of strong American jobs data on
Friday still leaves the US currency well below the levels predicted by
mainstream forecasters at the start of the year. What is the explanation for
the dollar's continuing weakness against the D-Mark and the yen in the
aftermath of successive increases in the US federal funds rate?
With the Fed tightening policy, it was widely assumed that the dollar could
only rise, with short-term rates still falling in Europe and possibly also
in Japan. Instead, the dollar has weakened, and often on the basis of
perverse arguments. The yen, to take the obvious case, has risen against the
dollar on trade war rhetoric. Yet a trade war should have precisely the
opposite effect: protectionism in the US would lead to the sale of fewer
dollars because of an enforced fall in Japanese exports.
Short-term technical factors no doubt provide part of the explanation for
the US currency's weakness. Many hedge fund operators had been overweight in
dollars before the Fed's first rate increase on February 4, so there was
bound to be a backwash as leveraged speculative positions were unwound. Yet
there are also important fundamental factors at work. The more interesting
of them relate to the pattern of long-term portfolio flows.
A notable change over the past 18 months has been the recognition by US
pension funds of the portfolio theorists' case for international
diversification. From holding less than 5 per cent of their assets overseas
they have increased their average holdings to about 8 per cent and will
probably reach double figures by the end of 1994. Mutual funds, which have
seen huge inflows of money as depositors have deserted the banking system
for higher returns in the capital markets, have been diversifying in similar
fashion.
Portfolio exodus
While hedge funds have been responsible for significant capital outflows,
these two conventional groups of investors have been the more significant
impetus behind last year's portfolio exodus from the US of more than Dollars
120bn. When that long-term capital outflow of Dollars 120bn is added to the
current account deficit of Dollars 120bn to produce a figure that used to be
known as the basic balance, there are potentially stressful implications for
global markets.
The Japanese current account - and thus the Japanese supply of savings to
world markets - is no longer rising. Within the capital account of the
Japanese balance of payments the long-term outflow is modest by the
standards of the 1980s. European countries are not, in aggregate,
diversifying on anything resembling the scale of the US. So the US is going
through a huge one-off portfolio adjustment at a time when there is no
comparable balancing flow of stable long-term funds back into the US. It
follows that the financing of the US balance of payments is unduly dependent
on short-term inflows and foreign central bank purchases of dollars.
Overvalued yen
Since the Japanese authorities are anxious to prevent an overvalued yen
throttling their exporters, they are no doubt happy to oblige for the
moment. But for all other holders of dollars the extent of the long-term
outflow means that an increased risk premium is probably required to
compensate for an excessive portfolio weighting towards the dollar. In
Europe this point is reinforced by the growing evidence of economic
recovery. An upturn in Germany would imply that the Bundesbank's scope for
interest rate cuts may be less than earlier assumed.
Taken together with political worries arising from the Whitewater affair and
concern over changes in the composition of the board of the US Federal
Reserve, this could well imply continuing short-term vulnerability for the
dollar. But before too long the portfolio pressures may ease. The markets
have been pricing three-month money in 12 months time at about 5 1/2 per
cent, substantially above today's level. That, taken against the background
of weak bond and equity markets, would imply a considerable incentive for
investors to retreat from mutual funds back into the banks.
A flow of unhedged mutual fund capital would then be repatriated, creating
upward pressure on the dollar. If at that point the US is still expanding
more strongly than Europe and Japan, the dollar bulls may have their day.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Migdal Ha'Emek, just off the main road from Nazareth to Haifa in northern
Israel, is typical of many towns that have grown up over the past 25 years:
a spider's web of unmemorable housing sandwiched between two industrial
parks.
Dull though it seems, Migdal Ha'Emek turns out to be a hotbed of
technological innovation and entrepreneurship. Encouraged by government
incentives in what is a development zone, a clutch of small, fast-growing
companies is developing new products in a bewildering array of technologies.
Some, such as RSL Electronics and CI Systems, started as suppliers to the
Israeli military sector, while Optomic, another local company, was formed in
the mid-1980s by ex-military officers and defence industry executives, who
felt that the defence boom was ending. Their new products typically draw on
know-how gained in defence contracting but, according to Mr Oched Amichai,
Optomic's chief executive, they are developed in response to market needs.
Hence Optomic is completing development of an industrial laser which, it
claims, is a quarter the size of competitive products. CI Systems has
developed a spectral imaging device for remote sensing, which it says will
harness space technology for use in cell biology, medicine and pollution
monitoring. RSL, whose staple business is still defence and includes night
vision systems for the Israeli Defence Forces and an advanced brake control
system for F16 combat aircraft, is developing an electronic diamond colour
grading instrument and a semen quality analyser.
Other companies, notably LanOptics in Migdal Ha'Emek and Gambit Computer
Communications in nearby Yokneam, are seeking to exploit niche markets in
computer communications. Both supply corporate networking equipment enabling
computers in large organisations to communicate with each other.
The Migdal Ha'Emek high-tech companies are typical of many up and down
Israel. They were founded, or started to develop rapidly, in the mid to late
1980s, have annual sales of Dollars 10m to Dollars 14m, employ about 85
people, spend up to 25 per cent of revenues on R&amp;D and cultivate close ties
with the scientific and technical academic communities in the US and Israel.
All the companies are putting more effort into marketing (traditionally a
weak spot in Israel's corporate culture) and exporting: for instance,
Gambit's marketing director, Mr Dave Green, spent 145 days outside Israel
last year.
Until recently, the companies had little difficulty raising capital through
private placements, venture capital funds, or via the Tel Aviv stock
exchange or the Nasdaq over-the-counter market in New York. But some
analysts wonder whether the future will be so golden. Some high-tech
high-flyers - such as LanOptics and Yokneam-based Intelligent Information
Systems, another data communications and network equipment company - have
seen their share prices plummet recently after they disappointed investors'
expectations.
But such doubts are not articulated in Migdal Ha'Emek, where the town's
entrepreneurs, such as Mr Bob Buckwald, the president of CI Systems, aim
high. His company has annual sales of just Dollars 9m, but he forecasts a
Dollars 400m market for its spectroscopic diagnostic equipment.

FT  05 APR 94 / Leading Article: Not much of a ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The three-day ceasefire announced by the Irish Republican Army and due to
start today is not a breakthrough for peace. The British prime minister was
right to call it cynical. His Irish counterpart was correct to express
dismay at the failure of the terrorists to lay down their arms once and for
all.
Both Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds have signed a document intimating
that all is possible after a genuine declaration of a permanent ceasefire,
and nothing before it. This should be definitive. It would be a mistake to
heed the siren voice of Mr Gerry Adams, the principal apologist for the IRA,
who promises, in a thousand different ways, that if only the British and
Irish prime ministers would stand on their heads, a more prolonged cessation
of violence might follow.
Just meet the IRA, or Sinn Fein, its political wing, says Mr Adams. Such
contacts have taken place before, and they can begin again. If, absent a
permanent ceasefire, negotiations are ruled out, then let the parties
discuss clarification of the Downing Street declaration. If clarification is
rejected as a euphemism for negotiation, let there be less well-defined
conversations, perhaps between a representative of the British government
and one from IRA/Sinn Fein, perhaps for an hour. If not an hour, perhaps for
a shorter period.
It is easy to see what Sinn Fein is trying to do. The two governments must
be shown to have succumbed to the arguments of the terrorist. They must
blink first. The proposition that violence pays must lie on the negotiating
table, to be used again if the negotiations are not going Sinn Fein's way.
The republican case can thus be pressed to its unswerving conclusion, namely
the unification of Ireland, with or without the consent of the electorate of
its northern province, this being the very point on which no British
government can or should budge.
Saving face
There is another view. It assumes or at least hopes that the IRA is
genuinely anxious to make peace and that it requires a meeting to save face.
If so, there might be a case for considering Mr Adams' offers. Some
respectable participants in Irish affairs argue thus. The 72-hour
post-Easter peace represents an ideal opportunity to test Sinn Fein's
intentions, proclaims Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labour party. Mr Hume is widely respected for his earnest efforts to bring
the IRA and Sinn Fein into negotiations. Call the Adams bluff, he argues
persuasively. If a lasting cessation of violence is not thus achieved, then
he will ensure Sinn Fein's isolation from democratic politics. Cardinal
Cahal Daly, the Catholic primate of all Ireland is another who believes that
some within Sinn Fein genuinely desire to end the violence.
Derisory offer
This argument, sadly, is not supported by the facts. As an earnest of
peaceful intent, a three-day break from what its adherents call the armed
struggle is, after 25 years of bloodshed, derisory. Had the IRA called a
six-month truce, it would be more difficult to dismiss the case for starting
low-level official talks on the modalities of negotiating a permanent peace.
Mr Hume's pleas are sounding more desperate. Cardinal Daly acknowledged in
his Easter message that most people are deeply disappointed that the
ceasefire will last for such a short time. 'The credibility of the Sinn Fein
commitment to peace is steadily ebbing away,' he said. The Irish government
appears to concur.
The British government is in a more awkward position. The prime minister is
under challenge within his own party. If he stands by the joint declaration
and dismisses the arguments for talks with Sinn Fein he will be accused of
trying to show his strength of purpose over Ulster this week, having failed
to do so over the European community last week. This is a burden Mr Major
must bear. He knows it would be wrong to succumb to Mr Adams' temptations.
He must also be aware that to do so would be taken by his party as
overwhelming evidence of weakness under pressure.
Meanwhile, if Mr Adams genuinely wants something significant to emerge from
72 murder-free hours, he should use the time to publish a clear statement of
what his organisation means when it demands clarification of the Anglo-Irish
declaration.

FT  05 APR 94 / A bid to push the world to rights: The campaign to include
worker protection in international trade pacts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last May 209 workers, mainly young women, were killed in a Bangkok toy
factory fire. The casualties would have been far fewer if all but one of the
exits had not been locked, and if the roof of the building had not collapsed
a few minutes after the fire started.
The Thailand tragedy, the world's worst factory fire, became a cause celebre
for the small but effective lobby campaigning to make acceptance of basic
civil and worker rights a condition of Gatt membership.
The idea of linking trade agreements with workers' rights - and so
preventing developing countries in particular from winning an unfair trading
advantage - is not new. Keynes made similar suggestions in the 1930s.
But the confluence of growing economic interdependence through trade,
persistently high unemployment in the developed world, and the end of the
Cold War (the communists did not like worker rights) has given the campaign
new impetus.
The lobbying threatens to take some of the fizz out of celebrations at
Marrakesh next week when ministers from 120 countries gather to sign the
Gatt Uruguay Round agreements. Both the US and France say that without some
commitment at Marrakesh to discuss workers' rights they will block the
setting up of a committee to manage the transition next year from the Gatt
to its successor body the World Trade Organisation (WTO). They have support
from elsewhere in the European Union, from Canada and from Australia.
Such threats are unlikely to undermine the new world trade order in
themselves; but according to some supporters of workers' rights such as the
AFL-CIO, which represents US trade unions, no move at all on the issue could
stir up the US Congress into refusing to ratify the Gatt deal.
The US, even under Republican administrations, has long felt aggrieved about
what it sees as unfair competition based on a disregard for human rights.
Under the present Democrat administration there is a particular interest: Mr
Mickey Kantor, trade secretary, previously worked as a union lawyer for
Californian farm-workers; President Clinton is a long-standing advocate of
the worker-trade link.
But the governments of many developing countries are adamant that such a
link is at best misguided and at worst 'rust-belt' protectionism, seeking to
maintain the living standards of developed country workers. France is
regarded as very keen to protect its workers from competition.
Opponents argue that a worker-trade link would make it harder for poorer
countries to exploit their main comparative advantage - cheap labour - and
set back economic development. Mr BK Zutshi, India's Gatt ambassador, says
the issue had 'the destructive potential for undoing what we have built so
assiduously in these seven years'.
The arguments on both sides touch on sensitive issues, such as the invasion
of national sovereignty and the causes of human suffering. They also lend
themselves to misleading caricature: some supporters of workers' rights
imply that their opponents would have resisted the abolition of slavery in
the 19th century - a step which required protesters to interfere with the
rights of nation states.
The issue has also created an unusual alliance between western free
marketeers and third world governments who do not normally see eye to eye on
development issues. But, on the opposing side, many western trade unionists
question whether authoritarian governments in the developing world represent
their populations.
On one level, the arguments seem to have got out of hand. The US government
and the international trade union bodies say they only want to talk about
the issue at this stage. Mr Mark Anderson, of the AFL-CIO, says: 'I think
people in the US will have difficulty understanding why there is so much
resistance to just talking about the issue.'
Mr Stephen Pursey of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions
(ICFTU), adds: 'There is a lot of mud-slinging. A lot of people call us
protectionist. Let's talk and see if we can find safeguards which are not
protectionist.'
But opponents have a case for fearing that once the talking begins, action
will not be far behind. The ICFTU and similar bodies already have blueprints
for the sorts of mechanisms they would like imposed. They want a two-level
approach: an outright ban on extreme abuses, such as slave labour, and a
framework which allows workers to organise themselves on issues such as pay
bargaining and basic health and safety.
'We don't want a minimum wage or anything like that, we just want to ensure
some basic civil rights at work, and we want measures which are affordable
by poor countries,' says Mr Pursey. He accepts, for instance, that
flexibility is required on child labour in countries which depend heavily on
young workers, such as India and Brazil.
The mechanism he proposes is to make membership of the WTO dependent on
ratifying seven conventions drawn up by the International Labour
Organisation, the United Nations' body which tries to enforce minimum labour
standards - two on forced labour, two on freedom of association, two on
discrimination and one on child labour.
Sanctions should be imposed only rarely, says Mr Pursey. But unlike the ILO,
which has no sanctions available to it, there would at least be the ultimate
threat of action against offenders. Countries not properly implementing the
conventions might be given two or three years to mend their ways by the WTO
before penal tariffs were imposed on the relevant category of exports.
Critics believe such a system would have no legitimacy and argue that the
'take off' stage of any country's industrialisation is unavoidably tough.
But the ICFTU replies that the 'trickle-down' theory of trade policy - the
idea that social conditions improve as trade expands - does not always work.
It believes its proposals would help prevent a vicious circle of greater
world competitiveness leading to more pressure to cut labour costs. It cites
the example of Thailand which has health, safety and building legislation
but does not always enforce the protection offered. If it had been policed
in the case of the Bangkok toy factory, its owner Kader Industries, under
pressure from western retailers to cut prices, may have moved to another
country. Only international rules would prevent such a downward spiral of
competition, says Mr Pursey.
Trying to broker a solution that might satisfy both sides is Sir Leon
Brittan, the EU trade commissioner. He believes there is no reason in
principle why trade should not be linked to other economic or social
objectives, pointing out that trade agreements are already used to protect
endangered species, to reduce the use of CFCs and to control trade in
hazardous waste.
But to give the Gatt or its successor such a role in the case of workers'
rights would be entering unfamiliar territory - its purpose since its
formation has been to tear down barriers not erect them. Mr Peter
Sutherland, Gatt's director general, says that introducing the workers'
rights-trade link into the WTO framework, which is meant to be based on
consensus, 'would place the system at immediate risk of collapse'.
But the world trade order is moving into a new phase with the formation of
the more political WTO. Already agreement has been reached on setting up a
working party to debate how environmental protection measures could be
included in future trade pacts.
That working party was set up because there was a consensus in favour.
Supporters of workers' rights want a similar working party, but are a long
way off from winning such support. Suspicions will continue to linger in the
developing world that there is more self-interest than idealism behind the
link being made between trade and workers' rights, especially in the US and
France. Nonetheless, the issue will not easily be set aside.

FT  05 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ventures put Tecs to the test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN COWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lisa Wood's article, 'Jobless with special needs 'face funding-cut
threat'' (March 31), regarding training for those with special needs, misses
a crucial point which is invariably ignored in discussion concerning the
financing of Training and Enterprise Councils and the surpluses that Tecs
make.
The essential point is that Tecs are private companies and have substantial
business interests outside of their contracts with government. It is likely
that Northumberland Tec will, next year, generate a turnover of more than
Pounds 3m from contracts and business ventures which are outside of the
government Tec contract. These ventures bring jobs and investments to the
county. It is simply naive to criticise Tecs for maintaining staffing levels
while payments to providers are cut, if those staff are actually engaged in
activities quite separate from their contractual obligations to government.
The true test of whether Tecs are providing services which are of value is
when they have customers who are willing to pay for those services. Only
when Tecs have a significant proportion of their total income coming from
outside of the government contract will they have the independence to engage
in long-term planning and to deal with their fundamental remit - to promote
the regeneration of their local economies.

FT  05 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Kazakhstan - no shortage of
refineries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RALPH H PICKERING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Chrystia Freeland's interview with President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan
gave an interesting and generally enlightening overview of that country's
present situation (FT Interview: 'Prospects in the pipeline', March 25).
However, it did contain a serious error when it stated that Kazakhstan has
no oil refineries. Kazakhstan has in fact three refineries in operation at
Chimkent, Aktyrau (formerly Guryev) and Pavlodar, with a total crude
capacity of 21m tons a year. This capacity compares favourably with
Kazakhstan's current domestic crude production of about 27m tons a year.
Kazakhstan's problems with refined product supplies lie not so much with a
lack of refining capacity but, first, with the location of its refineries
with respect both to crude sources and to the internal market and, second,
with the reduction of pipeline deliveries of crude from Russian fields in
western Siberia to the two largest Kazakh refineries. Curtailment of Russian
crude supplies is due to payment problems and the overall drop in west
Siberian crude production.

changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERIC CHALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The successful efforts to prevent damaging rule changes at the
Conservative central council meeting in Plymouth were led not by the Charter
Movement, as you reported ('Charter Movement defeats three voting motions',
March 26), but by the Party Reform Steering Committee. This committee
represents nearly 60 constituency associations, whose interests were
directly threatened by the two rules which failed to receive sufficient
support.
The requisition of a special central council meeting in 1992, to which the
article also referred, was made by 50 of those associations and co-ordinated
by this committee, not by the Charter Movement as you stated.
It is not, and never has been, our aim to give anyone a 'bloody nose'. We
merely seek to institute democratic accountability for the running of
Conservative Central Office, a reform from which the whole party will
benefit.

FT  05 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: US seeks a balance with proposed
export licensing legislation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARTHA C HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your February 24 article, 'Radical reform of US export licensing
proposed', discusses the US administration's proposal for a new Export
Administration Act. For the first time in more than a decade, the executive
branch has put forward draft legislation that balances national security,
foreign policy and economic concerns.
Regarding several points the article raises, Cocom will not 'be replaced by
the expansion of multilateral groups'. Our goal to expand membership of
existing multilateral non-proliferation regimes is different from what we
seek in discussions with Cocom partners to establish a new arrangement to
control sensitive dual-use items and conventional weapons to regions and
countries of concern.
Rather than a 'shift' decisively in favour of business we believe our bill
strikes an appropriate balance between national security and economic
competitiveness. Economic impact on US companies, while considered in our
proposed control review process, does not mandate any automatic de-control.
We are committed to using unilateral controls only when absolutely
necessary.
Our proposed revised dispute resolution system maintains the roles of the
national security agencies in licensing reviews, while continuing the
commerce department chairmanship. Several new features, including strict
time-lines, improve the process and the accountability of all involved.
Your article also states that 'the number of products for which licenses are
needed will be vastly reduced and the licensing process will be simplified'.
Our bill would simplify the process, but it would not automatically
de-control any exports. The number of products (notably computers and
telecommunications) for which licenses are required has been reduced in
recent months by separate action.
Finally, Iran and Iraq will not 'be allowed to buy more sophisticated
digital computers'. These countries will remain under broad trade
restrictions because of their unacceptable policies.

FT  05 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Buthelezi and the playing of an
ethnic card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your March 30 editorial, 'The Zulu factor', correctly states: 'Chief
Buthelezi has decided to play the ethnic card, and it is a dangerous one.'
But did he decide, or was the decision made for him?
For decades Buthelezi has consistently supported non-racial democracy,
although his political beginnings, like those of Nelson Mandela, were in
pan-Africanism. He entered negotiations advocating non-racial federalism.
The Freedom Alliance, when it emerged, was a pioneering attempt at
multi-racialism of the right.
Surely the most chilling moment in negotiations came when the ANC,
determined to break the Freedom Alliance, began to hint at an Afrikaaner
homeland or special status for the Zulu king. The ANC, for short-term
political gain, began to use the very weapon of ethnic divide-and-rule it
has fought against for 80 years.

FT  05 APR 94 / What was right with the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the ironies of contemporary politics is that British Conservatives
are almost as eager to denigrate the 1980s as US Democrats. According to
revisionists, Lady Thatcher's principal mistake was to promote an 'obsessive
individualism' that owed more to the modern American libertarian tradition
than to conventional Tory values.
In his pamphlet Right Ahead, Mr David Hunt, the UK employment secretary,
worries that young people are becoming 'atomised' - anti-social and isolated
from society. He reminds us that Tories have traditionally regarded human
beings as social beings: 'ours is a communitarian philosophy'. Wrinkling his
nose at such dated concepts as the 'laisser faire economy', he urges a
return to - wait for it - 'One Nation Toryism'.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, is equally
futuristic. In his recent speech 'What is a Conservative?' he argues that
the touchstone of Toryism is 'respect for inherited institutions and
traditions' and quotes approvingly from Edmund Burke's tirade against
'solitary, unconnected, individual, selfish Liberty'. Far from seeking an
atomised, 'minimalist state', he believes Tories should be proclaiming their
faith in government action.
The political pressure for more 'caring' policies is considerable.
Archbishop George Carey's protest about widening social divisions in his
Easter message was typical of countless onslaughts from opposition leaders
and other opinion formers. By elevating commercial profit to God-like status
and by destroying the morale of groups such as teachers, the argument runs,
Thatcherism undermined civic and moral values. From these poisonous seeds a
bitter harvest of crime, cynicism and inequality is now being reaped.
The populist power of such arguments is undeniable. Yet from a US
perspective the Thatcher government did little that was either radical or
liable to undermine moral or civic values. There was, for example, nothing
immoral in reducing top tax rates from a ridiculous 98 per cent to a
still-high 40 per cent. Leftwingers who inveigh against these tax cuts are
at liberty to give 98 per cent of their incomes to charity. Those who
decline to give voluntarily do not become moral paragons by demanding higher
rates of compulsory taxation - usually on others.
The heinous 'cuts' in public expenditure are an equally blind alley because
spending never was cut in real terms. Even as a share of gross domestic
product, public spending only fell slightly - from 40.9 per cent in 1979 to
37.6 per cent in 1989, and that mainly reflected soaring economic growth in
the late 1980s. The public sector's share of GDP has since risen by about
five percentage points. But suppose public spending really had been cut? Why
should a shift of resources into the private and voluntary sectors be
regarded as unethical?
The rest of the agenda is as easily defended. It was not sinful to remove
from trade unions legal privileges that no other groups have ever possessed.
It was not wrong to privatise businesses, most of which should never have
been in the public sector. It was not immoral to liberalise prices, wages,
dividends and exchange rates - this was simple economic common sense. Nor
was it unethical to introduce a hint of competition in the delivery (but not
financing) of public services such as education and healthcare.
Looking back, Thatcherism was no more than a mild - and beneficial -
reaction to what had become an excessively powerful and intrusive state. The
shift towards greater personal choice and responsibility ought to have won
praise from clergy and other arbiters of the nation's morals, even if it did
result in slightly greater inequality. So why are 'moderate' Tories now so
anxious to rethink Conservative doctrines? Why are the policies of the 1980s
so often regarded as uncaring or extreme?
I think the answer lies partly in continuing ignorance of the philosophy -
classical liberalism - that underlay the positive aspects of Thatcherism.
Messrs Hunt and Dorrell worry about the 'atomisation' of society. Well, the
fact is we are atomised. Evolution might have created a vast jelly-like
creature with numerous centres of consciousness. But it did not: we have
separate minds and bodies. If somebody clobbers Mr Hunt, I feel no pain. If
Mr Dorrell loses money on the stock exchange, my bank balance does not
suffer. The public policy shifts of the 1980s were merely a recognition of
our status as distinct individuals with varying abilities, experiences and
desires.
Classical liberalism's guiding principle is that individuals know best what
is in their own interest. It thus advocates freedom in all spheres of life.
What critics construe as crass commercialism is simply a demand that people
enjoy economic freedoms comparable with the political and personal freedoms
so vigorously championed by leftwingers. Classical liberals regard private
enterprise as generally superior to the public sector because the pattern of
activity is determined by voluntary exchanges between individuals. Public
services are allocated by bureaucrats and made possible only by coercion -
the forcible extraction of taxes.
Yet to favour free exchange is not to put any special value on profits: a
society of classical liberals could well opt to work only a few hours a day,
devoting the rest of its time to meditation and gardening.
The Tory critics of market liberalism have nothing to put in its place.
Fearful of change, they want to freeze social and economic development. Yet
had Thatcherism never existed, they would now be defending a far more
collectivist status quo. With such passive thinking in the ascendancy,
nobody should be surprised by the Major government's lack of momentum.

<TEXT>
When it first appeared at The Bush last summer, Jonathan Harvey's Beautiful
Thing had reviews ranging from the mildly appreciative to the strongly
enthusiastic. It has arrived with a different cast at the Donmar Warehouse
but it may have been better in the more intimate, run-down environs of The
Bush.
The setting is a block of apartments in Thamesmead, South East London, 1993.
Admittedly there is a heat wave, so much of the action takes place outside
on what is remarkably like a sunroof. It might be bleaker if it were
raining, but on this showing - for all the references to paper walls - life
in South East London seems okay. This is not a play about poverty or
deprivation; broken families perhaps, but still economically above water.
Central to the piece is the love affair between two male adolescents. It is
delicately done: first sharing a bed head to foot, then touching each other.
They end dancing smoochily in the presence of one of the boys' mothers.
Just a couple of points. Beautiful Thing is extraordinarily sentimental. I
wonder if there would be any interest in it if the affair were not
homosexual: the dialogue is pretty trite. And despite a lot of audience
laughter, at least on the first night, I didn't find the piece funny. The
semi-educated characters who spend their lives watching and quoting
television seem to me rather sad. If it were not for the artificial ending
of the mother accepting the love affair, Beautiful Thing would be a harsh
not a sentimental play. It is not at all clear what Harvey is saying.
The two boys are excellently played by Mark Letheren and Shaun Dingwall. The
implausible mother is Amelda Brown. She looks good, acts well, and it is not
her fault that the part fails to make sense. The director is Hettie
Macdonald, as at The Bush, so presumably she is satisfied with the move to
smarter surroundings. Possibly Harvey deserves something rougher for a bit
longer.

FT  05 APR 94 / Arts: Judgment day for the restorers - A 'new' Michelangelo
is unveiled this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since its completion during the papacy of Paul III in 1541,
Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment' fresco in the Sistine Chapel has been the
subject of criticism. The Pope's Master of Ceremonies, incensed by his cameo
role as Minos at the Mouth of Hell, begged the pontiff to destroy it;
unseemly baggy shorts were added to tone down the prevailing nudity while El
Greco modestly volunteered to paint something better in its stead. Even
among Michelangelo's supporters, the fresco, on the altar wall, has not
enjoyed the celebrity of Adam, on the Sistine ceiling, or Moses on the Tomb
of Julius II.
Now, however, as the Pope prepares to celebrate mass on Friday to mark the
unveiling of the newly restored 'Last Judgment', the attacks will be
directed at a different target. The work of art itself will barely get a
look in as every detail of the restoration will be pored over. Voices will
be raised in protest against the destruction of a great masterpiece, echoing
the clamour that surrounded the unveiling of the ceiling frescos four years
ago after a decade of restoration work.
Then, the prime objection centred on the claim that Michelangelo had
combined true fresco, which is painted on to wet plaster and forms a
chemical bond with it, and secco, which is painted after the plaster has
dried. Critics argued that the Vatican restoration team had cleaned off the
secco and that subtle layers of pigment had been eradicated. For the
critics, Friday's unveiling is the last chance for a high-profile lament on
the whole issue of restoration.
The Sistine Chapel, and above all the ceiling, is so familiar that people
commonly feel they have always known what it looked like. It is an old
friend. This is particularly true of art historians, many of whom had
recorded their descriptions of the frescos as sombre and sooty. Michelangelo
had always been presented as no colourist, as a sculptor press-ganged into
painting who preferred to work in monochrome. The Ancestors of Christ,
depicted in lunette frescos, had been plunged into darkness, it was argued,
because they lived before the light of revelation. Suddenly the restoration
revealed them bathed in light and dressed in startling acid colours.
The new Michelangelo was revealed to be far less the isolated genius than a
recognisable child of his time - the pupil of Domenico Ghirlandaio and the
inspiration of Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino, the next generation of
Florentine painters. These colours were not unfamiliar: they were all around
Michelangelo, but for some reason he was not thought to have used them.
Maybe geniuses are not meant to conform to any norms of their age.
The truth so conveniently ignored by the non-interventionists is that almost
no painting or fresco has escaped tampering in the past. A vote for the
status quo is rarely going to preserve the unadulterated patina of
centuries. Rather it is often a preference for the unscientific messing
about of the past as opposed to the marginally more informed approach of the
late 20th century. Today's restorers not only tend to give a truer picture
of the original but also frequently wipe away the misdemeanours of their
predecessors, who were not above petty censorship or the concealment of
signatures.
Even the sternest purists have had to accept the necessity of conservation
as opposed to restoration: works of art frequently require life-saving
operations when they do not need facelifts. In the case of the Sistine
Chapel, something had to be done. The glues and resins, used by restorers
since the late 16th century to revitalise Michelangelo's ever darkening
colours, were deteriorating and in the process detaching colour from the
plaster. If nothing had been done, the master's work would simply have
crumbled away. The 1980s restoration cleared the frescos of centuries of
dust and smoke - from candles, oil lamps and the braziers formerly used for
heating - as well as earlier restorers' glues and the blackish overpaintings
added in desperate bids to accentuate lighter passages. The difference
before and after was astounding. It is hardly surprising that cleaning
should have divided opinion so radically.
The idea that the work of art one grew up with and learned to love was not
all that it seemed is invariably painful. But there is a real possibility
that the transformation wrought by restoration can be for the best. In other
media similar battles are all but won. The experience of a 'Messiah' played
on original instruments and performed on the scale which Handel intended
might be enough to set the old Huddersfield Choral Society turning in its
grave, but few now would deem it an arid exercise in musical archaeology.
The new 'Last Judgment' is bound to spring plenty of surprises, not least
Michelangelo's more painterly technique and use of almost Venetian rich
colour, but only the most deluded of observers can really believe that there
was no room for improvement in its previous appearance. The Vatican team has
proceeded with admirable caution, taking - at 14 years - four years longer
over the restoration of the frescos than the the master took to paint them.

FT  05 APR 94 / Arts: Johnny on a Spot - London Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why has the National Theatre revived Charles McArthur's forgotten 1942
political farce Johnny on a Spot? As one of those who watched most of the
first night po-faced, I am curious.
Partly, I guess, the National reckons that we could do with a comedy about
political corruption these days. Others may say that we are now too familiar
with such matters to find them funny, but that is nonsense. We need to laugh
at them more than ever. And, on the crookedness of politicians, McArthur was
remarkably prescient. Following his plot today, we are reminded of other
statesmen who have praised family values while adulterising in private, of
other rigged elections, of other mismanagements of hospital finances, of
other politicians whose corpses have been found in their mistresses' homes.
Yet if you revive an American play from 1942, you do so, surely, because you
think you can breathe new life into it. In Richard Eyre's staging, Johnny on
a Spot bursts into brilliantly funny life for about five minutes, while
James Grout, as Judge Webster, tries to improvise a speech on live radio. He
keeps forgetting that he's on the air, he has no notion what specific points
he's supposed to be making, and he keeps misunderstanding the mime signals
with which his colleagues try to feed him hints. Grout's lurching eyebrows,
gaping mouth, bulging figure and booming voice all afford perfect hilarity
here; and elsewhere in the play he is always a model of enchanting detail.
This, however, is not enough. Most of the acting is what I want to call
competent, except it is not quite competent enough to animate this farce. As
Nicky Allen, Upjohn's campaign manager and the plot's central manipulator,
Mark Strong has looks and energy - but not the leading-man charm and
openness of spirit that this latterday Harlequin-Figaro type requires. As
his gal, Julie the secretary, Janie Dee does have bright-eyed charm, but
(the lines tell you) the role calls for more force of character. Amid the
cast in general, even from the excellent Michael Bryant, there are too many
unAmerican vowels and too much placing of the voice at back of the head, a
l'anglaise.
So, without quite enough style and character to animate it, the play creaks.
Its various crises feel as if they are being switched on and off for
dramatic convenience. Jokes crop up and fall like lead. Two of the main
female characters (Pearl the madame and Barbara the Judge's niece) are
caricatures of sexiness, and played so broadly by Diane Langton and
Geraldine Fitzgerald that they keep verging on the grotesque. Poor Bryant
struggles to make an impression more forceful than the live parrot that
squawks on his wrist.
Then there is the question of why Eyre &amp; co. decided on the Olivier. There
are several times when different conversations or speeches overlap - a comic
device that collapses when projected into the great fan shape of this
auditorium. William Dudley has designed a huge glamorous hall of an office.
Too huge for comic comfort; not huge enough for the stage; and the glamour
is distracting.

FT  05 APR 94 / Arts: Onegin on a shoestring - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The day of the disposable opera production is drawing nigh. The problem with
encouraging audiences to expect a risk-taking production with novel ideas
when they go to the opera is that the novelty soon wears off and then they
do not want to see it again. The risk is financial as much as artistic,
since any revivals are likely to lose money.
The Arts Council put its finger on this dilemma when it warned English
National Opera that the company had an insufficient stock of revivable
productions. The new management has taken that to heart, scheduling no less
than eight new productions for next season. More immediately, there is the
question of what to do about revivals already planned of first-time
failures.
The 1989 Eugene Onegin was one of those - not an outrageous disaster, but
uninspiring (the worst kind at the box-office). At first a straight revival
was announced, then a 're-staging', and finally a new production, though
heaven knows how little money was available for Julia Hollander.
Her designers (Fotini Dimou the sets and Tahra Kharibian the costumes) have
at least managed to make a twopenny budget look as though it stretched to
threepence-ha'penny. By the middle of the opera one gets used to the
back-to-basics settings. Madame Larina's party is a crowded affair, where
dancing couples bump into each other, nicely capturing the parochial
atmosphere. Lensky and Onegin's duel is held on a lonely, frosty
landing-stage.
On balance, this is an improvement on before, as is Hollander's production.
After the previous experiment had failed, there must have been pressure to
deliver a conventional show. This is by and large what she has done,
dressing the opera fairly sensitively in the period and social milieu for
which it was intended. There is little novelty this time round, but much
that is straightforward and true, especially in the treatment of the main
characters.
Cathryn Pope looks by far the youngest Tatyana I have seen. A mere
adolescent, she is shy and uncertain of herself, a bundle of unformed
impulses, blown this way and that by the conflicting emotions of the Letter
Scene. One's sympathy goes out to her, just as Tchaikovsky intended.
Inevitably the older Princess Gremin suits her less well (the top of the
voice is unpleasantly strained) but, in her, the opera has found its heart.
The Onegin and Lensky are well differentiated physically: Peter
Coleman-Wright's Onegin is tall and handsome, an outwardly assertive man
with firm and decisive singing to match; Bonaventura Bottone's Lensky is
short and plump, dressed in slightly shabby poet's clothes, his bright tenor
encompassing the music with accomplishment, but not much romance. Neither
stimulates the emotions, as Pope's Tatyana does.
The focus remains firmly on the central trio, though Ethna Robinson has the
cheerful bounce for Olga and Richard Van Allan gets dignity to do duty for
strong top notes as Prince Gremin. There is no need to look at the programme
to tell that a Russian conductor is in the pit. Alexander Polianichko hails
from the Bolshoy and gives us Tchaikovsky school of Svetlanov, vibrant,
passionate, the volume turned up to maximum for the Polonaise.
He has no doubts where the opera is heading and it is his brazen
decisiveness which keeps the momentum going in an evening which might have
faltered under another conductor. Presumably this budget production is only
intended as a stop-gap. What will ENO do for Eugene Onegin next time?
In repertory until 4 May

FT  05 APR 94 / Arts: Goode plays Beethoven - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest instalment of Alfred Brendel's Beethoven cycle is just a week
away. Meanwhile, however, there is Richard Goode's, which began on Thursday
at the Queen Elizabeth Hall with four early sonatas and the late, dappled
one in A, op. 101. (Second concert tomorrow, a third next Tuesday; then 10
more sonatas in November, and a final series later in the season.)
On the strength of this first programme, Goode is plainly just as rewarding
a Beethoven pianist as American reports have proclaimed him.
There is none of the hierophantic 'I am ushering you into the presence of a
Great Work' manner. Goode just plays, with evident delight and a buoyant
imagination which belies his sure command of Beethoven's structures. Also he
croons and hums along, like his teacher Rudolf Serkin and like Glenn Gould.
Certainly the vocal obbligato is redundant, for he makes the piano sing with
appealing directness - rare among self-conscious moderns in this repertoire,
especially since the death of Serkin.
A favoured way of playing Beethoven is to build up edifices of distinct,
sculpted blocks. Instead, Goode treated all the music as running lyrical
discourse, shaded with such easy subtlety that every phrase bore its own
speaking sense in the argument. Only in retrospect did we realise how firmly
the larger forms had been tamped into place.
He opened the cycle conventionally with the first sonata, op. 2 no. 1 in F
minor. By way of revealing the young Turk at once, pianists often make it an
exercise in junior thunderbolts; with Goode it was lighter and wittier than
that, without sacrificing its air of a challenging debut.
There and in op. 14 no. 1 and op. 22, he mostly played 'brilliant' arpeggios
and scales as light decorations, almost throwaway effects, not aggressively
motorised note-by-note and therefore not inflated.
With the Sonate Pathetique he broadened his scale dramatically, without
hardening. It must need a rare purity of heart to shape the familiar Adagio
so sweetly and uncomplicatedly. As for op. 101, it stretched out great
branches, richly and effortlessly and marvellously coloured on a towering
scale that remained human. It felt like a rare temperamental attunement
between master-pianist and masterpiece.

A promising, and packed, evening. In the Young Musician Of The Year, the
string players compete for a place in the concerto final (7.40 BBC2).
Channel 4's series The Brief is becoming compulsory viewing: last week's
programme about the Serious Fraud Office was eye-opening (8.30). That is
followed by an 85-minute interview with Dennis Potter in Without Walls. In
30 years Potter has created a uniquely impressive body of work including
'The Singing Detective' (9.00).
In the first of three programmes Network First tells how the US slowly came
to terms with 'the enemy within', the Mafia. The series focuses on the
Gambino family, said to be the richest of New York's crime families, headed
by Carlo, model for 'The Godfather' (10.40 ITV). Omnibus looks at the work
of American choreographer Bill T. Jones whose 'Last Supper At Uncle Tom's
Cabin' was concerned with racism, sexism, religion and Aids. Roger Vadim's
1956 film And God Created Woman, in which he introduced Brigitte Bardot to
the world, is now more significant as a social document than as a movie
(midnight BBC2).

FT  05 APR 94 / The Monday Interview: Making the medium the message -
Vladimir Gussinsky tells Leyla Boulton how he hopes to help Russian society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first and only Russian to build a private media empire, Vladimir
Gussinsky rejects suggestions that he is Russia's answer to Rupert Murdoch.
His press secretary says the parallel does not fit because Gussinsky does
not seek to control what his media says. The explanation from Gussinsky
himself is that of a businessman. 'In the west, the media means revenues. In
Russia, it means expenditure,' says this 41-year-old banking, real estate,
and now media, magnate.
Gussinsky declines to say exactly how much money his Most (Bridge) banking
and construction group has put into building one of the nation's most
popular television networks, and one of its most respected liberal
newspapers. He says simply that helping NTV, his Independent Television
Company, and Sevodnya (Today) newspaper - both of which recently celebrated
their first anniversary - will cost him and his bank partners 'dozens of
millions of dollars'. Two Russian banks, Stolichny and National Credit,
share with Gussinsky a majority stake in and the extension of cheap loans to
NTV and Sevodnya.
Like Murdoch, Gussinsky's investment in the media, which he believes will
ultimately pay back financially, is also about power - albeit in a
specifically Russian context. His explanation is simple: 'We must try to
influence the political and social situation in the country so that our
investments are secure and a market and society develop in the most legal
way possible'.
His focus is on upmarket journalism. The quality and independence of NTV's
news programmes have been a big factor in the company's rapid transformation
into a direct threat to Russia's ailing state-owned Ostankino and Russian
Television networks. NTV's weekly Itogi (Conclusions) programme is the
closest thing Russia has to a serious western-style analytical news
programme, while its daily mixture of news and feature films has managed to
attract 40m viewers in just one year.
Sevodnya newspaper, which took over many of the best journalists from the
rival Nezavisimaya (Independent) newspaper, manages a print run of 100,000
in a nation of 150m at a time of falling demand for newspapers.
Gussinsky's approach stands out in a country where much of the media's
dependence on meagre state subsidies means they are open to political
influence and corruption.
Some critics would argue that he is simply ambitious and rich enough to
afford the sort of media whose quality can only enhance his own prestige and
respectability. Others point out that private media ownership introduces to
Russia new constraints of a different kind: the media's inability to
criticise its private owners or clash directly with their interests.
Although Itogi has presented both sides of the argument over foreign banks
coming to Russia, Sevodnya, for instance, has consistently backed Russian
banks' demands for protection against western banks, a view which coincides
with Gussinsky's.
Both his media have also stayed away from corruption allegations made
against the Moscow city authorities, with whom Most has close business
relations. Despite some fears of what use Gussinsky might make of his power
further down the line, for the moment, however, the benefits of media
patronage outweigh any disadvantages of what he describes as enlightened
self-interest.
'As soon as the freedom of the journalists stops, I think (private) banks
will stop existing,' Gussinsky says. 'It is a symptom and a test. The first
thing the Bolsheviks did was to limit the freedom of speech.'
NTV's superior performance has also demonstrated just how much the
state-dominated media has suffered from a lack of competition to date.
Resistance to new, competitive, private media has come not only from Russian
conservatives, but from officials within a Kremlin establishment used to
treating the media as its private property. Gussinsky only won the right to
lease Russia's state-owned fourth channel every day from 6 pm to 1 am for
NTV - a rare concession to private television - after a decree signed by the
president was pushed through.
His appetite for 'creating the preconditions in which the media can
flourish' also reveals the instincts of a man who loves to influence events
from behind the scenes. He says that NTV is to spend some Dollars 30m
acquiring rights to what he describes as some of the best films from the US,
England, Italy, and France. He wants to build NTV, which leases state-owned
premises, a studio and technical centre of its own, as well as to buy into a
professional advertising agency.
While planning to expand its network of foreign correspondents, NTV has
negotiated news-sharing agreements with both Reuters and CNN. Gussinsky is
now examining the possibility of acquiring a few radio stations, including
Ekho Moskvy, whose independent coverage played a role in defeating the
August 1991 coup but now says it will die without financial support. He is
also discussing with Time a project to launch the US news magazine in
Russian.
He says he has no ambitions to expand internationally. And, although he has
a home in London, he has no intention of joining the exodus of rich Russians
who have made a pile of money and left Russia for good.
As Russia displays a more assertive foreign policy, Gussinsky says that what
it needs from the west, more than any financial aid, is understanding and
treatment as an equal partner.
'What is wrong with letting BP refine oil in Russia? In a society like ours,
industry cannot simply disappear. Patriots who ask why we should drink
foreign vodka could well create a fascist state. If that happens, we will be
the first victims, and (the west) the next.'

FT  05 APR 94 / People: Bowlin moves up at a bad time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is this the time to take over the running of an oil company, asks Richard
Waters.
Mike Bowlin, who becomes chief executive of Atlantic Richfield on July 1,
could hardly have picked a worse moment. Oil prices, which slumped late last
year, slumped again last week. 'It was not what we expected,' Bowlin says
ruefully. Like others, Arco had predicted that oil prices - now around
Dollars 14 a barrel - would rise to Dollars 20 a barrel this year, and stay
there for some time to come.
'Episodes like the one we have just gone through make us stop and wonder,'
he says.
If that wasn't bad enough, Arco has just poured hundreds of millions of
dollars into trying to build its reserves in Alaska (the location of most of
its current reserves) with little success.
Under Bowlin, Arco is set to direct more of its efforts overseas. The
company has already scaled back its Dollars 1.9bn development budget for
this year, he says, with the US taking the brunt of the cuts. 'We have not
cut back in the international arena.'
Bowlin, 51, was behind Arco's first push overseas, in the late 1980s, and is
set to continue the drive. As head of international acquisitions, he was
behind the takeover of Tricentrol in the UK in 1988 and the development of
gas projects in Indonesia and China. The aim is to push overseas upstream
activities up to the level of those in the US, he says.
There is at least one silver lining to the current slump, says Bowlin.
Foreign governments will be forced to change the terms of their contracts
with international oil groups to encourage them to continue exploration.
And the oil price? 'There is one thing I'm certain of: it will still go up
and down.'

FT  05 APR 94 / People: Gaviria courts OAS scepticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is usual in Washington to scoff at the Organisation of American States,
the western hemisphere's private and generally ineffectual United Nations,
writes George Graham.
It is also, however, polite to greet new arrivals with enthusiasm, so Cesar
Gaviria, who will take over as OAS secretary general when he steps down as
president of Colombia in August, can expect messages of support.
US politicians have tended to treat the OAS with the same kind of scepticism
they shower on the UN. 'The Organisation of American States is a kind of
mini-United Nations where we can be voted down in only three languages,
thereby saving translators' fees,' says Irving Kristol, the conservative
commentator.
Latin American members, on the other hand, have seen the OAS as rarely able
to extricate itself from the dilemma that if it acts the way the US wants,
it is accused of kowtowing, while if it doesn't, it is simply ignored. They
have increasingly taken their problems directly to the UN in New York.
Gaviria should get a warm welcome from President Clinton, who has shown his
interest in Latin America by calling a summit meeting of the region's heads
of state - even if his choice of Miami for the gathering is not universally
acclaimed.
Now 47 - the same age as Clinton - Gaviria was elected to parliament at the
age of 27 and became finance minister before he turned 40.
His presidency has been an uphill struggle, but despite widespread drug
violence, Gaviria has made headway in opening up the Colombian economy
through free trade and privatisation. Free trade will also be his priority
at OAS, he says, with an ambitious goal of linking the hemisphere's trading
blocs into a single free trade zone.

FT  05 APR 94 / Business Travel: Inspiration rises from the rubble -
Although much of east Berlin looks like a building site, visitors to the
city should choose to stay there
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone doing business in the German capital should insist on staying in east
Berlin.
Certainly, the east is a vast building site, where the bright lights of the
tall cranes seem like high street lights for the Mitte, the heart of the
city before it was divided in 1961. But at least the change seems positive,
unlike in the western part of the city, where the inhabitants complain that
unification has raised taxes and increased traffic, and has upset the
privileged status they had before the wall came down on the night of
November 8, 1989.
Don't be put off by such complaints, or by the dust, noise, rubble and
unprepossessing housing in the east. After all, most first-time business
visitors to Berlin hope to take advantage of the opportunities for
construction and services created by unification.
When you land at Tegel, the main airport north-west of the city, or the
small, rather quaint Templehof, a former military airport near the centre,
the benefits of unification may not be immediately apparent. Taxi drivers,
who charge about DM30 (Pounds 11.60) for the journey from Tegel to the
centre, will mutter that they cannot find the exact location of the street
if your hotel is in the east. They admit that they are still not used to
driving in that part of the city - four years after unification.
Most good hotels in east Berlin are in the Mitte. Say 'Mitte' clearly to
your taxi driver, and try to avoid being dropped off at the corner of
Checkpoint Charlie, the main crossing between west and east. A helpful taxi
driver deserves a tip of about 10 per cent. You should receive a receipt as
a matter of course. If not, just say: 'Quittung. Bitte.'
If you want a change from taxis, have little luggage and are not in a rush,
you can buy a weekly (DM33) or 24-hour (DM13) travel card for the city's
excellent public transport network. The cards, available from machines at
the airport bus terminal and at all underground stations, give unlimited
travel on the underground, S-bahn - or city trains - trams and buses.
You can also use them on the airport bus, which stops at
Karl-Schumacher-Platz, near Tegel. From there, you can take the fast,
efficient underground to Franzosische Strasse or Stadtmitte, which are near
the Maritim Grand and Hilton hotels, respectively. These hotels are a short
walk from the Treuhand privatisation agency on Leipziger Strasse - it is not
worth going by car to the agency, because traffic congestion around this
part of the Mitte is acute, especially around 8am, midday and 5.30pm.
Another advantage of using the U-bahn - or underground - is that this avoids
the Umleitungen, or diversions, on the roads, which are steadily growing in
number and can delay the taxis. As most of the city's bankers, engineers,
lawyers and Treuhand officials always seem pressed for time, it is polite to
arrive with a few minutes in hand.
Berlin is a deceptively big city, and its streets are very long. If you
don't want to be late, ask which end of the street the office you are
visiting is located.
Doing deals
Before appointments, find out whether an interpreter is needed, or whether
one will be provided. Most of the west Berlin business community - but not,
as a rule, most officials from the senate or government - speak English.
Many, however, prefer to speak German. And if you meet with local managers
in the eastern part of the city, they are more likely to speak Russian than
English. Another point to remember: always shake hands when meeting and
leaving.
If your contacts need extra copies of architectural or construction plans
that are too big for the hotel to cope with, there are outlets called
Copyhaus. One is in Georgenstrasse 3, close to the wonderful Pergamon
Museum, and is open from 9am to midnight on Monday to Friday, and from 10am
to 18.30 on Saturday. Another is in Grunewaldstrasse 18, south of the city,
which is open until midnight on Saturday.
Most visitors to Berlin end up doing some walking. This exercise is welcome
in a city where the inhabitants, particularly the middle to older
generation, are fond of large, heavy meals, three times a day.
Where to eat
Pace yourself. If you are meeting clients over breakfast, most hotels will
provide the full buffet, from fresh yoghurt, salami, fish and a selection of
meats, to a variety of excellent rolls, fruit and cereals. If you prefer to
eat breakfast outside the hotel, try Cafe Berio in Nollendorf-platz, or any
of the cafes in Savigny-platz, both in the west. Savigny-platz has better
surroundings, is very trendy and is a short walk from Ku'damm, or
Kurfursten-damm, the main shopping area of west Berlin.
The east is not particularly good for eating out, although it is slowly
improving. For lunch, you can wander up to Oranienberger Strasse and try
Cafe Oren, or Cafe Silberstein, or dine under the arches at Zum Nolle at
Friedrichstrasse railway station.
For dinner, go west, where there is an ever increasing number of good
restaurants, including Cafe Einstein, a grand old Berlin coffee house which
refuses to indulge in heavy German food, except for the Schnitzel. If the
weather is fine, ask for a table in the wonderful garden. Otherwise try Il
Calici, just off Adenauerplatz, and Paris-Moskau, behind the Reichstag, the
future seat of government. Increasingly, restaurants and shops take credit
cards, but this is still a cash-oriented society.
Leisure time
If, after all of your appointments and meals, you have time to spare, your
decision to stay in the east will be vindicated. The hotels are a stone's
throw from the Staatoper on Under den Linden, the Schauspielhaus, home of
Berlin's symphony orchestra, and a short walk from the Berlin Philharmonic.
There is also a good English-language bookshop on Mauerstrasse, which stocks
daily newspapers - east Berlin has been slow to set up kiosks selling
non-German papers. The few that do stock them sell out quickly. Otherwise,
the hotel should oblige.
In the centre, the shops close at about 6pm, except on Thursdays when they
stay open until 8pm. They remain open until 4pm, other than on the first
Saturday of each month. Banks generally open at 8.30am and close at 2pm,
except for Tuesdays and Thursdays when they stay open until 6pm, but it
depends on their location.
As for the overpriced duty free goods at the airports, forget them. It would
be better to buy a fine art history of Berlin or Potsdam at the bookstores
and ponder whether this strange, unhappy, united city will ever recapture
its former glory and confidence.

FT  05 APR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Arab dispute
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gulf Air president Salim bin Ali Assiyabi on Monday criticised Arab
carriers, including newly-born airlines in the region, for competing in a
limited market by offering lower prices.
Mr Assiyabi, whose airline has faced increasing competition in the Gulf,
contrasted the 'appropriate' European framework for regulating the air
transport industry with the lack of a proper regulatory framework in the
Arab world.
He did not give names but both Qatar and Oman, which together with Bahrain
and Abu Dhabi own Gulf Air, recently set up separate airlines that compete
with Gulf Air on some of its routes. Dubai, also in the UAE, has in addition
set up the thriving Emirates airline.

A fire at the Forte Grand hotel in Amman yesterday morning killed one person
and injured 12 others, writes Michael Skapinker. Forte said yesterday that
the fire had started at 5.30am local time in a lounge on the first floor.
The UK company said staff had extinguished the blaze by the time the fire
brigade arrived.
All 430 guests were evacuated. An Italian guest died of a heart attack. Nine
other guests were taken to hospital suffering from the effects of smoke
inhalation. A British hotel employee, his wife and child were also injured.
The company said it would not know the cause of the fire until investigators
had completed their work. Any guests with reservations at the hotel for this
week should contact their travel agents.

FT  05 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): An angel at your
boardroom table - Richard Gourlay starts a series on business angels with a
profile of Sir Peter Thompson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man who says he has spent most of his life as 'a boring big-company
man', Sir Peter Thompson's first investments in small private businesses
have been remarkable. So successful has the former chairman of National
Freight Corporation been that the most reticent of investors might be
tempted to follow him into a second career as a business angel.
This is exactly what he would like to see. Sir Peter's great passion is NFC
and the concept of employee capitalism that made many of the former
nationalised industry's workforce rich individuals when the company floated
in 1989.
But his latest crusade is to try to encourage people like himself 'fortunate
enough' to have amassed wealth to recycle some of it into investments in
private companies at early stages of development: 'Many people have followed
the MBO route that NFC pioneered and it is really they who should be
prepared to take the risk and invest in a second layer of wealth creation.'
He is not setting a bad example. Early in March, Mercury Communications paid
Pounds 3.8m for a 37 per cent stake in M33, a company which owns Andromeda
Interactive, publisher of CD-Roms and reference books. Three years ago Sir
Peter invested Pounds 100,000 and became non-executive chairman.
He became involved in one of his earliest investments, a company building
private hospitals, while in the middle of persuading the government to let
him lead the MBO at NFC. The company, now called Community Hospitals,
floated in 1989 and is valued at Pounds 90m. 'It was my first insight,' says
Sir Peter, who became non-executive chairman. 'Entrepreneurial groups don't
just need money, they need managing as well.'
Possibly his most successful investment has been in FI Group, which makes
and services software through a network made up mainly of women working
part-time from home. 'Steve Shirley (the founder) said 'I want the employees
to buy some of my shares', and off we went down the route of an
employee-owned company,' Sir Peter says. 'The company has just taken off.'
A modest man, he insists his record of private investing is not unusual. 'I
am no better than my peers but I have invested in six companies and none
have failed. My perception of the return is that it is very good - much
better than putting it into BTR,' he says.
He is critical of venture capital companies that no longer take real risks.
'The reason people have moved out of true venture capital is the massive
failure rate,' he says. 'I think they (early stage companies) fail because
they are never given enough support - not in the financial sense but all the
other support they need.'
Sir Peter says the lessons angels have picked up in their own varied careers
are as useful as the money they bring to young companies.
In his own career Sir Peter has taken his share of knocks. When he arrived
at NFC the company had made a Pounds 35m loss and was working with a
government controlling every penny. 'Managing your way out of that kind of
desperate situation was a very interesting experience for me and I am sure
it actually began to mould the basic philosophies I began to develop,' Sir
Peter says.
Again in 1989, joining John Gunn's British &amp; Commonwealth after its
disastrous acquisition of Atlantic Computers, he fought and lost the battle
to persuade banks to back his rescue plan. 'I think the lesson that came out
of B&amp;C was the importance of cash and the importance of having a banking
arrangement which was empathetic to what you were trying to do.'
He finds the advice he gives the management of the companies in which he
invests is very similar. One lesson he preaches 'almost obsessively' is how
managers need to find quality income streams or ways of securing the cash
flow from a large slice of the business.
And he repeats relentlessly the 'universal truth that you can only run out
of cash once'. Take his investment in M33 where Mercury Communications has
just taken a stake. 'Most of that (success) is due to the flair and
entrepreneurship of the two guys who set it up,' Sir Peter says. 'But I
constantly pressed on them that I have known companies go bust in the full
flush of expansion because they run out of cash.'
At M33 he will now be advising how it should provide information to and deal
with a large corporation now that Mercury has taken a significant minority
stake.
On a smaller scale, he suggested that the entrepreneur whose executive
recruiting agency he backed should base himself in an office next to his own
in Newport Pagnell. This gave the entrepreneur in the early days the chance
to 'have beer and sandwiches at lunchtime ' and talk over problems. Sir
Peter says he has also helped school this entrepreneur in the disciplines of
presenting cash flows, budgets and strategies to board meetings.
He says the angel can also help on simple things like how to deal with the
bank manager: 'Give the bank more information than they could conceivably
want, particularly if things are going badly.'
Sir Peter's investment record has been so short of disasters that it is
tempting to suspect he has access to a special supply of deals. But he says
he came across most of the investments by chance.
For that first investment in Community Hospitals, Sir Peter was approached
by Robin Hodgson, chief executive of Granville, then an issuing house and a
small venture capital supplier.
The meeting with M33 was more haphazard. In 1990 he answered an
advertisement in the Financial Times for a correspondence course on how to
make money out of the reverse yield curve on gilts. 'I realised I had been
creating wealth and managing it and in the process some had stuck to my
fingers but I had never given any time to personal finance planning.'
After seven lessons, the managing director of the company supplying the
course asked whether his illustrious student would endorse the product. Sir
Peter said he could be of greater help contributing management ideas and
became non-executive chairman.
Shirley found Sir Peter after reading his book Sharing the Success about
employee share ownership and NFC. She wanted advice on how to implement her
plans to allow the workforce to take stakes in the company.
Despite relying on chance to find his investments, Sir Peter hopes there
might one day be a comprehensive forum to bring angels together with
prospective businesses. And he holds high hopes for the new Enterprise
Investment Scheme, which replaced the Business Expansion Scheme at the end
of last year, as long as sponsors do not find ways to hijack it with
risk-free investments.
His greatest contribution towards creating a more vibrant angel environment
may be as a role model and as a gentle goad to other successful business
people. 'I would not bet the farm on this,' he says. 'But I see too many of
my old colleagues saying 'Let's give our money to an institution to manage'
and who are not really creating a second layer of wealth.'

FT  05 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Venture capitalists wary
of burns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention venture capitalists to entrepreneurs who are trying to raise
start-up or early stage development funds and the hostility is often
palpable. Their assessment that venture capital companies have 'stopped
backing ventures or taking risks' is broadly correct.
There are some notable exceptions, such as 3i and some houses that
specialise in high-tech investment. But most venture capital companies have
chosen not to back early stage companies since they were badly burned by
high failure rates in the 1980s.
With banks also increasingly reluctant to provide equity, there is little
option for many entrepreneurs in the UK but to turn to business angels, the
businessmen and women who bestow money and wisdom on companies in their
early stages of development.
This week we launch an occasional series on angels, the businesses they back
and the marriage brokers that bring them together. Today we profile Sir
Peter Thompson, former chairman of the National Freight Corporation, one of
the most successful management and employee-backed buy-outs, and an active
investor in private companies.

FT  05 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Representative selection
 -Exporting / Rules for UK companies choosing agents in overseas markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the new European Union law on agencies came into effectlate last year,
UK companies wanting to export must take far greater care in choosing who
will represent them abroad. While most European companies will notice no
difference as they have had well-defined contracts with agents for many
years, the changes have come as a shock to their more cavalier British
counterparts.
No longer will UK exporters be able to engage and then drop Continental
agents, safe in the knowledge that most will not challenge them in a British
court and under common law. Since January 1, UK exporters have become
subject to European law which implements a 1986 directive that clearly
defines the framework of agency agreements and gives agents well-prescribed
rights.
Mike Thornton, partner in Laytons, the Manchester solicitors, says that some
UK exporters were so
concerned about the changes that many agency agreements were torn up before
the deadline, with exporters either turning to distribution agreements or
bringing their representatives in house as full-time employees. 'I keep
impressing on people to spend a few shillings in the beginning drawing up an
agreement and save a fortune in court costs later,' says Thornton.
'Historically, British companies have written their agency agreements on the
back of a fag packet.'
As with all decisions about starting to export, the choice of whether to go
with an agent, a distributor, a joint venture or to set up a local office
requires careful planning. The last two options suggest the exporter has a
high degree of confidence in the product and deep pockets to support the
decision.
But choosing between the agency or distribution route depends largely on the
product, the type of market and local custom. The technical difference
between a distributor and an agent is that the former buys the goods from
the supplier, holds the goods on account and makes its profits by marking up
the price. An agent, on the other hand, generally works with his principal's
price list and does not take title to goods.
Under the new EU agency law, an agent has the right to inspect such extracts
of the principal's books as are necessary to check commission levels. The
agent also has a right to compensation if there is early termination of an
agreement. 'You can end agency agreements,' says Thornton, 'but you are no
longer able to have an agreement so much in favour of the principal.'
In most European countries, the exporter of expensive items will require an
agent - few distributors will be prepared to fund stocks of big ticket
items. For faster moving items, the distributor route is more suitable
through most of Europe - although in Italy agency networks and the idea of
the middle man are well established.
A distributor is also more appropriate for companies supplying machinery
needing maintenance and service support.
David Hammond, managing director of Hertfordhire-based consultancy Aimm,
says agencies are a good route for businesses that want to dip their toe in
an export market. A distributor, on the other hand, gives a supplier a far
more dedicated service in return for which the supplier will have to commit
to a level of financial support and agreed production levels.
For many first-time exporters the first port of call should be the country
desk of the Department of Trade and Industry, which will put the business in
touch with relevant commercial consulates.

FT  05 APR 94 / London council in corruption probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Police are investigating allegations of corruption at Brent Council in
north-west London.
Three men were arrested in connection with the sale of former Brent Council
properties on March 17 by the public-sector corruption unit of the
Metropolitan Fraud Squad. The men were not charged but bailed to return in
three months.
Police would not name them but a spokesman for Brent's Labour group said
that they included Mr Ahmad Shahzad, a Labour councillor.
One of the main properties involved is Anson Hall in Willesden, Brent, which
is now owned by the Dar Al-Islam Foundation. This property was sold by the
council in early 1992 to Merpark, a company registered in the Isle of Man.
In September 1992 Merpark sold it to the Dar Al-Islam Foundation for Pounds
375,000.
Merpark began as a Manx shelf company in 1990 and was not activated until
sold to its present owners in 1991. Its shares are in the form of bearer
warrants. The company is owned by whoever holds the bearer warrant - a
system that provides anonymity.
Although the deeds of sale to the Dar Al-Islam Foundation were correctly
signed by one of Merpark's two Manx directors, the deeds of purchase by
Merpark from the council apparently were not. The only people authorised to
sign the deeds were any two of the company's two directors and the company
secretary at the time. Neither director saw or signed the purchase deeds.

FT  05 APR 94 / Savings at BBC likely to more than double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC is expected to achieve more than double its planned savings of
Pounds 50m this year, and the money will go mainly towards new programmes
and services.
Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, said last September that the corporation
would save Pounds 100m in the 1993-94 financial year, Pounds 50m in the
current year and Pounds 25m in 1995-96. In the current year the BBC expects
to achieve a gross Pounds 125m instead of Pounds 50m.
The savings come from sources ranging from continuing cuts in the size of
the central bureaucracy to Producer Choice, the controversial system which
makes programme producers responsible for their budgets and gives them the
right to buy services outside the BBC.
The corporation has also been helped by a campaign against licence-fee
evasion, growth in the number of households and indexation of the licence
fee to inflation.
After funding more than Pounds 30m needed to launch and run Radio Five Live,
the news and sports network, and after removing a deficit of Pounds 18m
planned for the resources department, the BBC will have an extra Pounds 80m
available.
The scale of the savings coming through, which will be seen as a vindication
of the cost-cutting policies of Mr Birt, last month enabled Mr Alan Yentob,
the BBC 1 controller, to expand his programme plans.
Mr Yentob announced that there would be an extra 110 hours of new programmes
between June and August this year to counter complaints about the high
proportion of repeats shown last summer.
EastEnders will move to three nights a week in line with its main ITV rival,
Coronation Street.
The news that savings will be greater than expected comes as the government
completes its white paper on the future of the corporation. The white paper
will preserve the existing structure of the BBC and the licence-fee system
that funds it.

FT  05 APR 94 / Patten sees chance to teach union a lesson: John Authers
weighs the odds in the battle over school tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, has at last succeeded in dividing
the teachers' unions over national curriculum tests for children aged seven
and 14.
Last year the unions united against them and the tests became a humiliation
for the government.
It also seems unlikely that this year's tests will produce meaningful
results. The NUT, which concludes its conference in Scarborough, North
Yorkshire, today, is totally opposed to the tests, and has enough members to
ensure that they will not take place in thousands of schools.
This is bad news for the government because testing is integral to the
national curriculum which was introduced by the Education Reform Act of
1988. They are meant to diagnose children's difficulties and to enforce
accountability of schools to parents.
The NUT has also committed itself to an indefinite boycott of all national
curriculum tests, which delegates described as a 'government imposition'.
Not only will tests for those aged seven and 14, which the government
attempted to introduce last year, be barred, but also tests for pupils aged
11, due to start next year. No reforms of the tests will be enough to gain
NUT support.
NUT conference delegates are more leftwing than the union's general
membership, and defeated the moderate executive nine times during the first
three days of the conference. But the unanimous support it gave to extending
its action suggests that it can deliver a further firm boycott.
Yet this does not necessarily signal the end for Mr Patten's tests.
Teachers' unions are deeply split, and the NUT may have overplayed its hand.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT union, is bitterly
opposed to the NUT stance, which he describes as 'going from farce to
fiasco'.
The NASUWT has instructed its members to administer the tests this year and
they are likely to do so. It is satisfied that Sir Ron Dearing, the
government's chief adviser on the curriculum, has delivered sufficient cuts
in the workload caused by the tests.
A third union, the ATL, which is traditionally moderate and is not
affiliated to the Trades Union Congress, has also advised members to abandon
the boycott.
Baroness Blatch, the education minister, will address both the NASUWT and
ATL this week, and is expected to offer to have all tests marked externally.
Mr de Gruchy would favour such a move because it would reduce workloads.
Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, dismisses this as 'snuggling up' to
ministers while Ms Marion Darke, a former NUT president, said the move would
reduce teachers to 'technician' status.
Legal objections could also thwart the NUT. The NASUWT was challenged in
court over the boycott last year but was successful because the dispute was
'solely or mainly' concerned with workload.
The NUT has always made clear that it objects to the tests on educational
grounds, which are not legal grounds for an industrial dispute. It might
lose a court case if it persisted when other unions had announced that the
workload issue was settled.
Ministers might also change the law to make the NUT action illegal. Primary
legislation might not be necessary because some union members believe they
could be legally forced to carry out the tests by changes to the small print
of the annual schoolteachers' pay and conditions review.
Mr Patten will find this much easier to achieve if he has public opinion on
his side. He failed disastrously in this last year, on one occasion branding
a parents' organisation 'neanderthal'.
But this year the NUT must oppose the emollient and widely respected Sir Ron
as well as Mr Patten. The union appears to be isolated and Mr Patten has a
chance to inflict an embarrassing defeat.

FT  05 APR 94 / NUT will fight rises in class sizes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Delegates yesterday committed the NUT teachers' union to a campaign against
rising class sizes, including a policy of refusing to cover for other
teachers.
The union's annual conference at Scarborough, North Yorkshire, decided this
would apply in education authorities that did not allow primary school
teachers to spend at least 20 per cent of each week in 'non-contact' time -
time not spent in front of pupils.
The union's moderate executive opposed the motion which was only narrowly
successful, being passed by 86,314 votes to 85,326. The NUT must now
campaign for a statutory maximum class size of fewer than 30 pupils.
Delegates unanimously passed a motion attacking the reduction in government
grants for areas with high numbers of children from ethnic minorities. It
authorised strike action for areas where teachers thought the cuts would
lead to job losses.
One delegate said the shift in funding would cost 8,000 jobs, while another
accused the government of a 'racist attack' against children.
A motion opposed by the executive calling for a flat-rate pay increase of at
least Pounds 3,000 for all teachers was narrowly defeated.

FT  05 APR 94 / Recovery 'still buoyant': Managers report a record increase
in manufacturing activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery is still buoyant, say two reports published yesterday - the day
before the full impact of the government's tax rises starts to hit
consumers.
There was a record increase in manufacturing activity last month, the
purchasing managers' index found, while a survey of investment intentions
indicates that almost two out of three UK companies intend to buy a
substantial asset over the next three months.
The two reports will sustain hopes that the corporate sector can maintain
the strength of the recovery by increased investment, even if consumer
spending flags in the face of the tax increases.
The purchasing managers' index rose from 55.5 per cent in February to 56.6
per cent in March, its highest recorded level. The index, compiled by the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, is based on a weighted survey
of variables such as new orders and suppliers' delivery times. Any level
above 50 per cent represents an increase over the previous month.
Mr Peter Thomson, director-general of the institute, said: 'Output and new
orders have soared in the face of strong demand from the domestic market.
There is every indication that the acceleration in activity will continue.'
The companies surveyed also reported an increase in employment.
The one discouraging note reported by the institute is that upward pressure
on prices from suppliers' annual price reviews continued last month.
The Lombard Business Investment Survey, conducted by NOP, finds 61 per cent
of businesses likely to buy an important asset over the next three months,
the same level as in December. About 68 per cent of the companies surveyed
say that the tax increases will make no difference to their investment
plans.
However, there is a slight downturn in the proportion of businesses planning
to acquire a substantial asset over the next 12 months. This has fallen to
77 per cent from 83 per cent in December.
Mr Paul Gee, marketing director at Lombard Business Finance, said: 'Our
overall assessment of the survey results is that, although investment
intentions remain high, general business confidence is levelling off.'
About 63 per cent of companies surveyed expect their turnover to be higher
in real terms over the next three months than it was a year ago, while 12
per cent expect turnover to be lower. This positive balance of 51 per cent
compares with 53 per cent in December.
The Lombard survey shows a continuing pick-up in confidence in construction,
but the transport and distribution sector seems to have been most affected
by the prospect of tax increases. The sector's investment intentions and its
expectations of increased turnover have declined sharply since December.
The assets most likely to be purchased over the next three months are
manufacturing equipment, construction equipment and information technology.
There has been a decline in the proportion of companies intending to
purchase telecommunications equipment, cars and commercial vehicles.
The survey is based on telephone interviews with 451 finance directors.

FT  05 APR 94 / Review body tells Bar to reform complaints system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Big changes to barristers' working practices are recommended today by an
independent body set up to review professional standards at the Bar.
The review body, chaired by Lord Alexander QC, chairman of National
Westminster Bank and former head of the Bar, says in an interim report that
the Bar's complaints and disciplinary system should be modernised.
It recommends a complaints procedure separate from the disciplinary system
so that the Bar can deal more effectively with allegations of poor service
and pay compensation to victims of shoddy work. It adds that the Bar
compares badly with other professions in this area.
In an attempt to cut the number of briefs returned just before a trial, the
review body says barristers should be required to tell clients in writing
why they cannot continue with a case.
That would allow the client to take action if the reason for returning the
brief was inadequate, and would change the ethos towards returning work that
had been accepted.
The review body also calls for greater transparency in the way barristers
charge for their services so that clients know from the outset the basis on
which they will be charged.
It seeks barristers' views on other issues including:
Whether the rules prohibiting barristers from seeing witnesses in advance of
trials should be abolished.
Whether judges should be encouraged to take a more active role in reporting
long-winded or inept counsel.
The development of best-practice guidelines setting out counsel's
responsibilities in civil and criminal cases.
Whether contracts between barristers and solicitors would raise standards.
Whether junior barristers should be required to complete a probationary
period during which their work would be monitored.
Whether the 'cab rank' rule, under which barristers must accept a case if
they are qualified to conduct it, is still necessary.

FT  05 APR 94 / London and Dublin give ceasefire short shrift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British and Irish governments yesterday remained united in a rejection
of the three-day ceasefire which the IRA begins at midnight tonight to try
to win 'clarification' of the Downing Street peace declaration.
London and Dublin again criticised the short ceasefire as an inadequate
gesture and made clear their exasperation at the IRA's refusal to declare a
permanent end to violence, which they say could pave the way to lasting
peace.
The two governments hope their firm refusal to give any ground might
encourage the IRA to consider an extension of the ceasefire, though there
were no indications from the republican movement that such action is likely.
Republicans continued to insist that the next move must come from the
British government in the shape of an offer to open direct talks.
One Easter rally yesterday heard a warning that Britain could expect more
violence unless talks began.
Dublin, which has already provided Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA,
with clarification of parts of the Downing Street declaration, is making
clear that it will not put pressure on London to provide further
clarification.
Both governments have rejected suggestions that low-level talks might take
place with Sinn Fein during the ceasefire. But in the unlikely event that it
is extended beyond Friday, pressure to restart some form of contact would
soon mount.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, who is on holiday, is being
kept abreast of developments, according to a government spokesman. But the
latest statements from Sinn Fein leaders at the weekend 'have not changed
the situation', he said.
In separate speeches made on Sunday in Belfast and Dublin to commemorate the
1916 Easter rising, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, and Mr Martin
McGuinness, a prominent member of Sinn Fein's national executive, called on
London to respond to the 'potential' offered by the ceasefire initiative.
Cardinal Cahal Daly, the Roman Catholic Primate of all Ireland, yesterday
added his weight to that pressure saying that a 'meaningful extension' of
the ceasefire would help encourage a 'constructive response' from the
British and Irish governments.
Such hopes appeared to fade after a warning delivered at a rally in County
Tyrone, Northern Ireland by two masked IRA men who said: 'The British will
be glad to get out of Ireland when our work is done.' They claimed the
republican movement in Tyrone had never been stronger, more united and
confident and said last month's mortar bombings at Heathrow airport had
'worked wonders' for morale.

Average hours worked fell slightly in the year to autumn 1993. This
underlines that in spite of the increase in part-time jobs, which has helped
reduce unemployment, there was no net increase in work last year, says a

UK unemployment will fall by about 15,000 a month this year to reach 2.6m by

The Commission for Racial Equality has been asked by a union to investigate
allegations of racial bias in the selection of staff at Barclays Bank for
compulsory redundancy.
The Bifu banking union says that almost 17 per cent of 432 Barclays staff
selected for redundancy in London and the south-east are black or Asian.
This compares with an 11 per cent representation of ethnic minorities staff
overall in those areas.
The union call has been made as Barclays today begins hearing final appeals
against the redundancies.

FT  05 APR 94 / Inquiries about trains may move to premium phone rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rail travellers could be faced with paying premium rates for calls to
railway inquiry offices, Charles Batchelor writes.
Charging premium rates is one of the options being studied by Mr Roger
Salmon, the railway franchise director charged with selling off the British
Rail network.
He is attempting to put an end to the perpetual engaged tone at BR telephone
information offices and has invited four companies to submit bids to run a
national telephone inquiry bureau. Bids are expected in the next few days
and the winning company will be chosen in the next few months.
'We are keen to do this job a lot better,' said Mr Salmon.
The rate for calls is undecided, but the franchise director is considering a
range of options including introducing 0891 lines which charge premium rates
or 0345 lines which charge at local call rates.

FT  05 APR 94 / Post office deal on bills will cut gas showrooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas and Post Office Counters plan to announce that gas bills can be
paid at post offices in a move that will lead to the closure of about half
Britain's high street gas showrooms.
The deal, which will enable gas users to pay their quarterly and budget
bills without extra charge at post offices, is expected to be announced this
week.
Following the announcement of a Pounds 1.6bn structural overhaul of British
Gas last year, the company said it would scale down its workforce by 25,000
over the next five years. The change in staff numbers that results from the
closure of the showrooms will be included in this figure.
Those showrooms remaining out of the original 425 will focus on retail sales
of gas equipment. British Gas said that showroom staff had not been able to
provide retail services 'in the best way' because they had to accept bill
payments as well.
It said that facilities for customers to pay bills would eventually be
phased out of the showrooms.
Previously, customers could pay their bills post offices through the
'transcash' system, but such payments were subject to a charge of 83p.
The new arrangement will allow customers to pay cash or cheques to settle
bills free of charge. Current post office staff will handle the
transactions.
Post Office Counters said: 'There are potentially 18m customers coming in to
use the post office network. It will increase business.' Norweb, the
Manchester-based electricity company, is to supply gas to industrial users.
Norweb, which has 4.7m electricity customers in the north-west, wants to
take advantage of legislation opening up the gas market for businesses which
use more than 2,500 therms a year and typically have annual bills of more
than Pounds 1,100.

FT  05 APR 94 / Tory MP tells 'softie dummy' Major to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major will attempt to shore up his leadership by touring the Tory
heartland of Essex after more Tory MPs called for his early resignation.
While the prime minister's advisers were predicting that his latest regional
tour would galvanise his supporters, Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, a former
minister, said the time had come for Mr Major to resign.
The former solicitor-general for Scotland attacked Mr Major as a
'ventriloquist's dummy' and a 'softie' - and called on him to go after the
European elections in June.
Sir Nicholas, MP for Perth and Kinross, and neighbour to North Tayside
backbencher Mr Bill Walker - who has also appealed for a leadership change -
said the risks were greater of the Tory party tearing itself apart under Mr
Major's 'benevolent and inadequate' leadership.
Interviewed by BBC Scotland, Sir Nicholas said he favoured Mr Michael
Portillo, the rightwing chief secretary to the Treasury, to succeed Mr
Major.
Sir Nicholas said the prime minister was 'not up to the task'. Among his
shortcomings was a lack of stature, he said. 'He is vin ordinaire, and he
should be chateau-bottled.'
Conservative Central Office sought to shrug off the latest attack on Mr
Major, predicting that he would receive the support of ordinary people on
his regional tours.
But Lord Archer, a former deputy chairman, said the prime minister was
'distressed by the continual attacks on him, which are unfair'.
He told BBC Radio 4 that constituency parties would be 'livid' if a stalking
horse emerged to challenge Mr Major in the autumn.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president, accused Lord Archer of being
out of date. 'The Tory Party is already tearing itself apart in this phoney
war period in the run-up to the leadership election which is now
inevitable,' he said.
A number of MPs on the Tory right said they had privately asked Mr Portillo
to take part in any leadership election to prevent giving Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, a clear run against Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, has written to Mr
Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, demanding that he ask Labour spokesmen to
renounce their spending pledges or say how they are to be paid for.

Londoners who regularly rage over the inadequacy of the Underground system
are this week having to come to terms with an additional experience: a
Pounds 10 penalty fare if they travel without a valid ticket.
London Underground launched the scheme on Sunday with the aim of stemming
fare evasion that is estimated to cost around Pounds 30m per year.
Over the past 18 months, LU has spent Pounds 2m explaining the benefits of
the scheme and in giving training to 300 inspectors who will operate it.
Mr Donal McCabe, a spokesman for LU, said: 'By spending Pounds 2m on the
scheme, we expect to get back Pounds 6m which we would otherwise lose, and
we can spend this money on helping improve the Underground.'
The Pounds 6m, Mr McCabe is quick to point out, is expected to come largely
from people paying fares at the outset rather than risking penalty payments.
The free flow of as yet unproven statistics form part of a publicity
campaign aimed at reassuring Londoners that the scheme aims to help make
life easier for the majority rather than more difficult.
LU says that the penatly scheme offers a short-term revenue booster while it
is unable to finance electronic barriers more widely.
The inspectors have been drawn largely from existing staff and trained in
'body language'. LU says this is 'the skill of avoiding confrontational
situations' as well as knowing when 'to use discretion in implementing the
penalty'.
Among the inspectors on the Northern line - popularly known as the 'misery
line' - is Ms Nike Omolokun. Ms Omolokun confronts a collective and tense
glare as she walks through carriages.
She uses a 'Swipemaster' - a computerised gadget through which she runs
tickets and checks whether the information provided by the passenger equates
with the truth.
Ms Omolokun is among the higher paid of London Underground non-managerial
staff, with a salary of Pounds 21,400.

FT  05 APR 94 / Unions win rise in injury payouts
</HEADLINE>

Compensation payouts for union members have risen markedly in the past year,
says a report from the Labour Research Department. It suggests that the
total paid to members of unions affiliated to the Trades Union Congress last
year may dwarf the Pounds 300m in settlements for 1992.
The report says 15 large unions won a total of almost Pounds 175m in
work-related illness injuries compensation in 1993 covering 51,000 cases.
The report also pinpoints a large increase in claims covering repetitive
strain injuries. Eleven of the unions surveyed reported a rise in the number
of such cases.
Its findings will increase concern among business about the viability of
employers' liability insurance, which usually finances compensation.
Insurance companies have increased premium rates and reduced their exposure
to employers' liability business in recent years after suffering heavy
losses.
Buyers are worried that cover could be reduced next year as a result of
developments in the reinsurance market, where reinsurance companies plan to
limit their exposure to the business.
At its conference last week the risk and insurance managers' association
warned that compensation claims were 'snowballing' and that 'serious steps'
were needed to reduce soaring costs.
The Labour Research survey covers 18 of the largest unions, representing 87
per cent of TUC membership. Of the 13 unions that supplied researchers with
a comparison, 11 said there had been an increase in payouts last year, and
two said the figure was similar to that in the previous year.
The TGWU general union, the largest in the survey, won more than Pounds 81m
for its members last year, an increase of more than Pounds 8m on 1992. The
highest single award was Pounds 800,000 won by the TGWU for a lorry driver
who remains in a coma after a road accident.
The survey revealed an increasing trend to settle compensation claims for
industrial injuries out of court, and most claims are proving successful.
Four unions had negotiated 'no-fault compensation schemes' with individual
employers. The report says Royal Mail and British Telecommunications have
taken out personal-accident insurance schemes covering employees who suffer
injuries resulting in permanent disability.
