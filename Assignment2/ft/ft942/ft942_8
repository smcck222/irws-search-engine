FT  20 JUN 94 / Government pressed to step up Ulster security: Reprisals
feared after loyalist gunmen kill six in village bar

The British government was yesterday under pressure to step up security in
Northern Ireland after loyalist gunmen shot dead six Roman Catholic men in a
bar.
The gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons as customers at the crowded
bar in the largely Catholic village of Loughinisland in Co Down watched the
Republic of Ireland's opening World Cup soccer match on television. Five
people were wounded.
The Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility for Saturday night's
attack, saying it was in retaliation for last week's shooting of two
Protestant men in Belfast. Police were last night braced for further
sectarian violence.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, condemned the killings
as 'inhuman savagery' and said the gunmen would achieve 'no political
purpose'. He pledged the RUC would never give up the hunt for the attackers.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said the incident had brought
him close to despair.
The attack prompted calls from Tory MPs for the introduction of internment
as part of a security clampdown.
Mr Andrew Hunter, chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland
committee, urged the government to 'lift' 30-40 republican and loyalist
terrorist ringleaders. He also called for the deployment of more troops on
the province's streets.
The attack came less than 48 hours after Mr Spring warned that a framework
agreement on new constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland was
unlikely to be ready for next month's Anglo-Irish summit.
However, Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his
Irish counterpart, are expected to try to give new impetus to the peace
effort when they meet at the European Union's summit in Corfu later this
week.
Mr Eddie McGrady, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP for South Down,
said he hoped there would be no reprisal of any kind for the shootings. He
said anyone attempting retaliation would be 'disowned by all our community
and will not be acting on anybody's behalf'.
Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, cautioned against the
reintroduction of internment, likening such a move to 'putting a lid on the
cauldron' and saying it would end any prospect of constructive peace talks.
The RUC Deputy Chief Constable Blair Wallace said: 'We are in the middle of
a series of tit-for-tat killings. They started on Thursday and Friday and
this was undoubtedly one of that series.'
He said that but for the activities of the security forces there could have
been more attacks 'because it is quite clear the terrorists are endeavouring
to out-do the other in the enormity of their bloodlust'.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Seoul prepares for talks with N Korea

<TEXT>
South Korean government ministers will meet today to discuss preparations
for a possible summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea,
the first since the peninsula was divided in 1945.
The summit could be the first test of whether former US president Jimmy
Carter has succeeded in defusing tensions over North Korea's nuclear arms
plans following his private mission last week to Pyongyang.
Mr Carter briefed President Clinton's foreign policy aides yesterday on an
offer by North Korean President Kim Il-sung to meet South Korean President
Kim Young-sam. The offer, made without pre-conditions, was immediately
accepted by the South Korean president on Saturday.
'I personally believe the crisis is over,' Mr Carter said. 'The next step is
to assure that the agreements that were worked out between me and Kim
(Il-sung) are carried out.'
Assistant US secretary of state Mr Robert Galluci told reporters at the
White House that Mr Carter may have 'brought back something from which we
can build' to defuse the tension which has built up over the past three
months.
Meanwhile, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, claimed that
North Korea did not yet have a nuclear bomb. He quoted 'experts' as saying
it would take the former Soviet ally three to seven years to develop one.
While reiterating criticism of the US for failing to consult Moscow on
proposals for phased sanctions of increasing severity against Pyongyang, Mr
Kozyrev said there was no point in rushing ahead with them because they
would be vetoed by China in the UN Security Council.
The media in South Korea yesterday suggested the summit will be held within
a month in Pyongyang. South Korea wants the summit agenda to include
implementation of the North-South Korean 1991 denuclearisation treaty, the
reunification of divided families and the establishment of business ties.
The South Korean president offered to meet his Northern counterpart last
year, but backed away from the proposal as the nuclear dispute deepened.
His sudden acceptance of the summit offer from Pyongyang suggests that Seoul
is worried that Mr Carter's mission could pave the way for direct talks
between the US and North Korea, which could leave South Korea as a
subordinate party in resolving the nuclear issue.
However, some US and South Korean officials expressed caution about the
summit meeting, explaining that Pyongyang might use it as the opportunity to
drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington.
The South Korean government has been criticised by opposition politicians
for following too closely Washington's lead on the nuclear dispute.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Rail union may call more strikes despite talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RMT, the railway union, may decide to extend its campaign of one-day strikes
after weekend talks with Railtrack failed to bridge what negotiators
describe as an 'enormous gap' between the two sides of the pay dispute.
Railtrack, which operates the railway infrastructure, is to resume talks
with the union early this evening at the offices of Acas, the conciliation
service, in a final effort to avert a second 24-hour shutdown of the network
on Wednesday.
Railtrack's board is to meet this morning after the company's negotiators
said at the weekend they would reconsider the costings behind the pay offer
to signal staff.
Under industrial relations law, the union has to give seven days' notice of
any industrial action. That gives it the next two days to decide whether to
call a third strike for a week on Wednesday.
For their part, Railtrack's negotiators are re-examining the costings behind
their original offer to see whether they can offer signalling staff more pay
in return for improved productivity.
RMT insists that signalling staff should have an 'up-front' payment of 11
per cent before entering talks on a longer-term offer linked to changes in
working practices to boost productivity. Railtrack says it can only offer
2.5 per cent now for all its employees.
It has told the signal staff that it will offer substantial but
self-financing rises of at least 11 per cent once changes in working
practices are agreed.
However, 7 1/2 hours of talks on Saturday failed to achieve a breakthrough
in spite of Acas officials' attempts to establish common ground between the
two parties. Railtrack insisted on a 48-hour adjournment of the
negotiations. Union officials were annoyed at the delay.
The rail union is convinced that Railtrack's industrial relations executives
lack the full authority to negotiate, and have to keep going back to the
Railtrack board - and, indirectly, the government - to decide their next
move.
The weekend disclosures that Ms Jill Rutter, a member of Mr John Major's
policy unit in Downing Street, attended a Railtrack board meeting last
Friday at the behest of the Department of Transport has reinforced union
suspicions that the government is involved in the dispute.
The government took pains yesterday not to comment.

FT  20 JUN 94 / Berlusconi faces clash with banker on sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A battle is looming between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier, and
Mr Enrico Cuccia, the country's most powerful banker, over the ownership of
Stet, the telecommunications monopoly, after it is privatised in the autumn.
Mr Cuccia, honorary chairman of Mediobanca, the Milanese merchant bank,
wants to form a syndicate of shareholders in conjunction with Pirelli, the
tyres group, to effectively take control of Stet after the state's 53 per
cent holding is sold.
Mr Berlusconi is under pressure from other members of his government to
block Mr Cuccia and ensure that Stet is sold to the widest possible range of
private shareholders and investment institutions.
However, research by the Financial Times shows that Mr Berlusconi faces a
conflict of interest in deciding whether to do battle with Mediobanca
because Mr Cuccia is in a position of great importance in the restructuring
of Fininvest, Mr Berlusconi's business empire.
Mediobanca has considerable influence through cross-shareholdings over three
of Fininvest's five biggest bank creditors - Banca Commerciale Italiana,
Credito Italiano and Banca di Roma - which between them have lent L1,300bn
(Pounds 536m) to Mr Berlusconi's businesses. Fininvest's reorganisation -
aimed at both cutting borrowings of about around L4,500bn and redistributing
it among Fininvest's subsidiary companies - will go through only with their
co-operation.
Mr Romano Prodi, who re-cently announced his intention to resign from the
chairmanship of IRI, the state holding company that controls Stet, said it
was 'nave' to ask whether Mr Cuccia would try to use his role in respect of
Mr Berlusconi's private interests to influence government policy. 'Of course
he does,' he said.
Mr Berlusconi has not responded to questions put by the Financial Times on
Mediobanca's influence over Fininvest.
However, last month he indicated he would try to prevent Mediobanca and its
corporate allies from acquiring strategic stakes in privatised industries
when the government said it would set a 5 per cent share-ownership ceiling
for syndicates of related investors' shareholders in future privatisations.
A banker close to Mr Cuccia said Mediobanca wanted to form a group of
investors to buy a strategic stake in Stet and force management changes.
'Stet is very important for the industrial base of this country,' he said.
'I do not believe it will become more efficient if is owned by a diverse
group.'

FT  18 JUN 94 / Drilling for damages: The aftermath of an oil spill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US is said to have more than a million millionaires. It may soon have
about 13,000 more. An Alaskan jury has to decide whether Exxon, the biggest
US company by sales, should pay maximum punitive damages of as much as
Dollars 15bn to those Alaskans who claim their lives or property were
damaged by the worst-ever oil spill in US waters.
This week a federal court jury in Anchorage, Alaska, found that reckless
conduct by Exxon and Mr Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez,
contributed to the ship running aground shortly after it left the state's
main oil port of Valdez in March 1989.
Almost 11m gallons of crude oil spilled into Prince William Sound. In the
five years since the accident more than Dollars 3.5bn has seeped from
Exxon's cash flow to cover the cost of the clean-up and to settle federal
and state criminal charges.
Exxon, the world's biggest oil company, has also settled some civil claims
voluntarily. But there are 13,000 or so potential plaintiffs who could
benefit from this week's decision, including fishermen, local landowners and
native Americans.
Their lawyers will go before the same federal jury on Monday and ask the
nine women and three men to accept their claim for Dollars 1.5m in actual
damages, before setting punitive damages at Dollars 15bn. The jury is
expected to make its decision this summer. If it accepts the plaintiffs'
arguments, individual damages could average between Dollars 1.1m-Dollars
1.3m.
The case has sparked off intense speculation among oil industry observers
keen to calculate the potential damage to Exxon. It has also highlighted the
arbitrary way in which damages are awarded in US cases of corporate
negligence. IN addition, it could affect the tort law reform campaigns which
are under way in many states in US, following pressure from companies which
have been badly hit in product liability cases.
Mr Arthur Miller, law professor at Harvard Law School, notes that 'corporate
America is deathly afraid of punitive damages. It is the lifeblood of the
plaintiff.'
That point is not lost on Mr Brian O'Neill, lead attorney for the plaintiffs
in the Exxon case. The Dollars 15bn punitive damages claim is based on
Exxon's earnings, he says. 'Exxon has made in excess of Dollars 15bn net out
of the pipeline' which brings the oil from Alaska's North Slope to Valdez.
Exxon believes its past financial success should not be an issue in any
further damages award. But the court earlier rejected the company's request
that evidence about its financial position should not be presented to jury.
Mr John Hervey, vice-president of research at Wall Street brokers Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette, believes 'Exxon's biggest liability is its ability to
pay'.
Uncertainty over the eventual level of pay-out has been exacerbated because
the US Supreme Court has never set standards for punitive damage awards. Its
guidance extends to two general areas. The first is that there must be some
relationship between the punitive damages and the actual damages. But there
is no guidance on whether that relationship should be two times, three
times, or a hundred times.
The Supreme Court says, secondly, that such awards should act as a
deterrent, but should not be excessive. The vagueness of that guideline
worries Mr Miller at Harvard. 'What will deter but not cripple? They've been
found reckless, but they're not Satanic . . . It's a wild card, and frankly,
it's what really frightens companies.'
Since this week's decision, Exxon's market capitalisation has fallen by
about Dollars 5bn. Industry observers say a decision to impose the maximum
Dollars 15bn penalty could cut its equity value. But the sheer size and
financial strength of Exxon is such that the company's survival would not be
jeopardised. That fact is beginning to sink in, and the share price, which
plummeted by 8 per cent on the news, has since recovered some of its lost
ground.
The swing in sentiment has been encouraged in part by a revision by many
analysts of the likely level of damages. Many now expect a pay-out in the
Dollars 6-Dollars 10bn range. Most are wary, however, of second-guessing a
jury assessing one of the country's most publicised and extensive
environmental disasters.
Mr Miller says this particular case 'has got to the heart of the economy and
society. It's not like dumping oil in the desert.'
But what could the effect of a big award against Exxon be on US industry? Mr
Miller believes 'corporate America would feel its usual sense of outrage
every time it gets kicked in the butt'.
Would the deterrent effect be widespread? 'That's what it is supposed to
do,' he says. 'Would it do it? There's no empirical evidence. But you have
to feel it has some effect.'
One of the ironies of the Exxon Valdez case is that Exxon is widely viewed
within the petroleum industry as perhaps the best-run and most technically
competent oil company in the world.
The plaintiffs will try to dispel that view by arguing that the company
consistently failed to deal with Captain Hazelwood's well-known drinking
problem.
'The people who knew about his problems didn't do anything. Dozens of
managers - the Gulf coast fleet management structure, the west coast fleet
management structure, the company's doctors - every single part of this
institution knew about this and didn't do anything,' says Mr O'Neill.
He attributes Exxon's failure in part to 'the lack of accountability you get
in a big organisation: (a belief that) someone else will do it'.
Exxon's public aloofness may help the plaintiffs in making such a case. The
company's public relations performance at the time of the disaster was
dismal. Mr Larry Rawl, the then chairman, declined to make a personal visit
to the site, saying it would make no difference to the clean-up operation.
That led to scathing treatment in the press, to the extent that the Exxon
Valdez incident is used by other oil companies as an example of how not to
deal with the media or the public in the aftermath of oil spills.
In recent years Exxon has built up a strong department of investor
relations, preferring to communicate directly to shareholders rather than
through the press and industry analysts. Observers who know the company well
say the isolation may be linked to a sense that it is being singled out for
what may prove the harshest punishment yet meted out to a US company.
But it can at least take some comfort that the incident occurred outside two
states where the penalties might have been far worse: California, the Exxon
Valdez's destination on its abortive journey, has the country's strictest
environmental laws; and Texas, Exxon's home base, where the juries
consistently find for plaintiffs.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Leading Article: A cautionary double act
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bankers and merchants of the City of London witnessed another outbreak
of prudence at the Lord Mayor's Mansion House dinner this week. The
chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, warned that there would be no tax cuts before
government borrowing was under control, and no return to boom and bust. For
his part the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, declared that
interest rates would have to rise in due course to moderate the pace of
expansion. Yet the markets remain largely unconvinced by this prudential
double act.
While short-dated gilts fell the following day in response to the interest
rate warning, long gilts, which might be expected to take cheer from
declarations of fiscal and monetary rectitude, also went into retreat.
Cautionary rhetoric will not be enough, it seems, to make a big dent in the
cost of servicing a Pounds 38bn borrowing requirement, equivalent to 5 1/2
per cent of GDP. Actions, not words, nor indeed a surfeit of bonds, are what
investors want to see.
At first sight, threats of a rise in short-term rates might seem premature.
As Mr George himself pointed out, though GDP is growing at the rate of 2 3/4
per cent, the economy is still operating below capacity. Retail prices on
the official measure of underlying inflation have increased by only 2 1/2
per cent on the year, or 1 3/4 per cent if indirect tax increases are
excluded. And the latest economic data offer further good news on the
inflationary front.
The biggest recent worry has been the 4 per cent increase in earnings
recorded in the year to March. This week's figures for the year to April
showed a reassuringly slower increase of 3 3/4 per cent. Growth in retail
sales, meantime, appears to have levelled off in May. Also striking, and
possibly with a bearing on the retail sales picture, is the sluggish
behaviour of the housing market.
House sales
By historic standards houses are now cheap in relation to earnings. Prices
have unquestionably picked up over the past 12 months, as has the volume of
transactions; and there have been quite sharp increases in prices in the
parts of London where City professionals, whose bonuses helped inflate the
March earnings figures, like to live. Yet a survey of 4,000 estate agents
indicated this week that the volume of house sales across the country was
down 12.4 per cent last month compared with May 1993. This the agents
attribute to two causes: the chancellor's tax increases and the deterrent
effect on first-time buyers of higher fixed-rate mortgages.
Both suggestions make some sense. The amount people spend on housing is
heavily dependent on what they can borrow. The maximum permitted borrowing
is related to their ability to service the mortgage debt. Because post-tax
earnings have been reduced since April, and mortgage tax relief has also
been reduced, purchasing power in the housing market has taken an
understandable knock. Midland Global Markets estimates that the cash loss
from the chancellor's fiscal tightening for a household with an average
mortgage is equivalent to a 1 3/4 per cent rise in mortgage rates.
Surprisingly buoyant
Meanwhile the cost of fixed-rate mortgages offered by the larger building
societies has gone from just under 7 per cent to well over 9 per cent. This
has encouraged some potential buyers to delay their purchase. And indeed the
whole housing market is still operating in slow motion when compared with
previous economic cycles because the housing ladder has broken down. There
are still well over a million people with negative equity in their homes.
When this is combined with the impact of the recent increase in gilt prices
on the cost of fixed-rate borrowing it is hardly surprising that the volume
of transactions is slowing down. If anything, the surprise is that
consumption in the UK, which is heavily related to activity in the housing
market, has been so buoyant in recent months.
In effect the British economy is becoming a little more like its continental
European counterparts, where long-term rates of interest have a greater
impact on the level of economic activity and where housing markets are less
prone to boom and bust cycles. It also appears that the gilt market is one
jump ahead of the Bank of England and the Treasury in restraining the pace
of expansion. That is not to say that Mr George will not need to raise
short-term interest rates before long. The gilt market's scepticism about
policy rests on the well-tested assumption that reduced taxes and lower
mortgage rates win elections for the Tories. If the prudential double act is
ever to convince, Messrs George and Clarke will probably have to raise short
rates in order to bring long rates down.
As in the US, the timing of the electoral cycle would point to a rise sooner
rather than later. This indelicate reasoning will not be recorded in the
published minutes of their conversations. But it is a safe bet that Mr
George will soon be making the case for an early rise in order to bring the
gilt market round.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Devonport dockyard to make 850 redundant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Devonport Management, which operates the Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth,
said yesterday that 850 workers were to be made redundant.
Four hundred of the job losses are to reduce overheads in support
operations. The remaining 450 jobs will go because the yard has insufficient
work on surface ships to maintain the workforce.
Yesterday's announcement followed the loss of 1,000 jobs on Thursday at two
other military sites in the south-west - RAF Chivenor in Devon and the Royal
Navy Engineering College, also in Plymouth.
Mr Peter Whitehouse, Devonport's business development director, said the
decision to allocate a large body of surface-ship refit work to Rosyth in
Fife had left Devonport short of surface-ship work. He added that the
company was dependent on winning the refits of HMS Birmingham and HMS
Cornwall next year to maintain the reduced workforce of 3,500.
Devonport said it could not rule out compulsory redundancies because it
needed to maintain high-tech skills in refitting ships and nuclear
submarines. 'We are approaching a critical mass below which we will be
unable to retain the capacity for surface refit work,' added Mr Whitehouse.
Dr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, condemned the job losses and
called on the government to plan defence expenditure so that companies had
time to adjust to the reduced work available.
'There is a lack of co-ordination which means that managements cannot plan
their businesses,' he said. 'The government has exacerbated a difficult
situation by leaving defence cuts to the market.'
He said there was worse to come when the defence cost review was completed
in July. 'Some 25,000 jobs will go when the Front Line First cuts are
completed,' he added.
Mr Jack Dromey of the TGWU general union called on the government to support
conversion of naval dockyards to civilian work. He added: 'The markets are
out there, the only question is whether it goes to Britain or our competitor
yards in the US or the Pacific Rim.'
Devonport insisted that it had tried to win civil work, including the 12
British Steel Challenge yachts, and that 20 per cent of its work now came
from non-naval work. But it added that the markets were very competitive and
slow to build up.
Mr Dromey said the dockyards were shedding labour while the Ministry of
Defence was prepared to pick up the costs before they were privatised in
1996.
The MoD said that commercial decisions on the workforce in the dockyards was
a matter for the managements involved.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Approval for Swans bidder delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French-owned company which wants to buy Swan Hunter has still not been
approved by the Ministry of Defence as a suitable contractor, with only
weeks to go before the MoD's award of a refit on which the Tyneside
shipbuilder's survival hinges.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said yesterday that
negotiations between Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie and the MoD on
the transfer of Swans' remaining frigate contract to CMN were continuing.
Swan Hunter went into receivership in May last year after failing to win an
MoD order for a helicopter carrier. CMN is the only potential bidder for
Swans as a going concern, but the deal is conditional on Swans winning the
18-month refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere. It faces keen competition
from other UK shipyards and naval dockyards. Receivers Price Waterhouse have
said that if Swans does not win Bedivere, closure of the company and the
piecemeal sale of its assets looks likely.
Mr Aitken's confirmation of continuing negotiations with CMN came in a
Commons written answer to Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend.
Mr Byers said it was still unusual for a foreign company to be allowed to do
MoD work. 'A degree of caution is understandable, but they've had a long
period to arrive at a conclusion and the delay is causing concern,' he said.
Mr Fred Henderson, bid-team leader for CMN, said agreement on the transfer
of the frigate contract, discussed since March, had been reached with MoD
officials on June 1, but ministerial approval was still awaited.
He dismissed as 'completely, absolutely and totally untrue' suggestions in a
Commons question tabled by Mr Keith Hampson, Tory MP for Leeds North West,
that Triacorp, a company controlled by CMN's majority shareholders, could
have business links with the regime of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
On Thursday, Mr Henderson and Mr Iskandar Safa, part of the Christian
Lebanese Safa family which owns most of the shareholding of Triacorp and of
CMN's parent company Soffia, met MPs to rebut any suggestion of Iraqi links.
Mr Safa said yesterday that he had acted as a marketing adviser to arms
manufacturers in the Middle East, but not in Iraq. 'There have never been
links and there are no links,' he said.

FT  18 JUN 94 / CrossRail revival backed by 130 MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to revive a bill promoting the Pounds 2bn London CrossRail project
were boosted yesterday when it was announced that more than 130 MPs have put
their names to a motion backing the plan.
Mr David Lidington, MP for Aylesbury, said he expected to table a motion
early next week calling for the private bill committee to look again at the
proposal to build an east-west underground rail link. CrossRail, which has
the backing of British Rail and London Underground, suffered a surprise
rejection last month when the four-strong committee of MPs turned it down.
The route did not include links with the Channel tunnel rail link or the
Heathrow Express.
'Replies are still coming in and I am optimistic we will have a lot more
names by the beginning of next week,' said Mr Lidington. 'We have obtained
unprecedented cross-party support.'
In an unusual move, Conservative whips have given permission for
parliamentary private secretaries, who as part of the government 'payroll
vote' normally do not get involved, to sign the motion. Its backers include
seven Liberal Democrat MPs, with the remainder split equally among
Conservatives and Labour. Mr Lidington said backing had come from across the
country.
Senior figures supporting the motion include Sir Peter Hordern, chairman of
the public accounts commission, Mr John Watts, chairman of the Treasury
select committee; Sir Cranley Onslow, a former chairman of the 1922
backbench committee; Mr John Prescott, Labour employment spokesman; and Mr
Frank Dobson, Labour transport spokesman.

French police are investigating how cyanide got into a bottle of antibiotic

pharmaceuticals company, which produces the drug, said yesterday.
The company, a subsidiary of Rhone Poulenc, said the cyanide had been found
in only one bottle of its Josacine antibiotic drug and that its presence was
the result of a criminal act. It said, however, that it was taking the
precautionary measure of recalling all bottles of the drug, which is sold in
France, its overseas territories and some African and Middle Eastern
countries.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Nordic parties to decide on EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A big step forward in persuading the people of Finland, Norway and Sweden to
support membership of the European Union should be taken this weekend when
three key political parties hold special conferences to decide official
policy on the issue.
The Centre party of Prime Minister Esko Aho in Finland, Mrs Gro Harlem
Brundtland's ruling Labour party in Norway and the powerful Swedish Social
Democratic party will all make a formal decision on whether to back
membership in their respective referendums to be held in October and
November.
All three parties harbour strong anti-EU factions, but in each case the
pro-membership stance of the party leaderships is expected to prevail,
allowing the leaders to throw their party machines behind the Yes campaign.
The sharpest debate is likely in Finland, where Mr Aho has tied his future
as party leader and the future of his coalition to a Yes decision.
Mr Aho was unsettled earlier this week when a number of his MPs abstained in
a failed parliamentary vote of no-confidence because of their objection to
his pro-EU policy. But he has produced a FM4bn (Pounds 480m) package of aid
to help farmers over the adjustment to EU prices and should win the showdown
vote today.
Mrs Brundtland and Mr Ingvar Carlsson, leader of the Swedish Social
Democrats, are meanwhile confident of a safe pro-EU majority in their
respective party meetings.
Last Sunday's decisive vote in favour of EU membership in fellow applicant
Austria has given the Yes camp in the Nordic countries a boost. A poll this
week in Finland, which will vote next on October 16, put support for the EU
at 47 per cent, with 32 per cent against and 21 per cent undecided. But the
No side remains firmly in the lead in Sweden, which votes on November 13,
and in Norway, which votes on November 28.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Europe chemical recovery grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery in western Europe's chemicals industry is accelerating, according
to the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic).
'The west European chemicals business is benefiting from the economic
recovery currently under way,' said Mr Simon de Bree, Cefic's incoming
president and chairman of Dutch chemicals group DSM.
Western European chemicals output should rise by 2 per cent in 1994, faster
than the 1.5 per cent seen at the start of the year and compared with a
contraction of 1 per cent past year, he said yesterday.
'Our optimism is also justified by the favourable trend of stocks and order
book,' he said. 'Stocks of finished products were continuously reduced
during the second half (of 1993), returning to normal levels in early 1994.
This destocking masks the preliminary steps of a revival.'
He admitted, however, that growth in Europe was still too weak to create a
large rebound or to begin to catch up with the US chemicals industry.
Nevertheless, with annual sales of more than Ecu300bn (Pounds 230bn), the
western European chemicals industry remained the biggest in the world.
Employment is expected to fall for the fourth consecutive year, this time by
3 per cent to about 2m. This will bring the total number of jobs lost in the
European chemicals industry since 1990 to 200,000.
Nevertheless, Europe's unit labour costs had grown faster than prices. This
had not happened in the US, and 'the global position of the European
chemical industry is under threat.'
Taking the place of pharmaceuticals is plastics, where new manufacturing
technologies and rising prices are helping production rise by 3 per cent
this year.
Close behind are organic chemicals and paints, which are each growing by
more than 2 per cent this year.
Only fertilisers will see a fall in production, 1.9 per cent.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Dehaene to run for Brussels presidency: Belgian PM's
candidacy increases prospects of deadlock at EU's Corfu summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER, KERIN HOPE and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects of a deadlock at next week's summit of European Union leaders on
the choice of a successor to Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission
president increased yesterday as Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime
minister, formally declared himself a candidate.
Within an hour of the announcement, senior government allies of Mr Ruud
Lubbers, the retiring Dutch prime minister, underlined at a press conference
in the Hague that the Netherlands would not consider withdrawing Mr Lubbers'
candidacy.
The Dutch premier, until recently considered the front-runner for the job,
had announced he was seeking the job in May, but delayed a formal
declaration until after last month's general elections in the Netherlands -
in which his Christian Democrats lost their position as leading party.
Mr Dehaene, also a Christian Democrat, was in April approached by President
Francois Mitterrand of France and then Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to
make himself available for the job, according to Belgian officials. But
until yesterday he had refused to confirm he was seeking Mr Delors' mantle.
Mr Dehaene said he was making his candidacy public to remove all doubt that
he had the full backing of the Belgian government, which published a
statement calling for the support of Belgium's EU partners at the EU summit
in Corfu next Friday. Fears have been expressed that Belgium's centre-left
coalition could fall apart if Mr Dehaene steps down.
If both these Christian Democrats from small member states fight to the end,
they risk letting in an outside candidate.
Sir Leon Brittan, the British EU trade commissioner, has campaigned openly
for the job all year, with discreet backing from the UK. Mr Peter
Sutherland, outgoing director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, made clear he was available last month.
Although his chances were dismissed by his government in Ireland, some
senior EU officials still believe Mr Sutherland has an outside chance as a
tie-breaker in the event of a stand-off in Corfu. Sir Leon's chances are
marred because Britain held the job, with Lord (Roy) Jenkins in the early
1980s, because the UK's partners are suspicious of its intentions towards
European Union, and because by convention, after the 10-year tenure of the
Frenchman Mr Delors, the job should now fall to a small member-state.
Christian Democrat leaders meet in Brussels on Wednesday to try to agree a
single candidate.
This would be likely only if Mr Lubbers could be found a commensurate
international position, such as secretary general of Nato, a job not in the
EU gift. The Dutch premier was in Rome yesterday to lobby Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister being assiduously courted by all
candidates as a 'swing vote' at Corfu.
Amid this jockeying for top international positions, Mr Dehaene remarked
yesterday that if he was not chosen, 'I still have my job' as Belgian
premier.
Greece has nominated Mr Christos Papoutsis of the governing Panhellenic
Socialist Movement as its European commissioner for environmental affairs,
write Kerin Hope in Athens and William Lewis in London.
Mr Papoutsis, seen as a Pasok moderate, was re-elected to the European
parliament last week. He would replace Mr Yannis Paleocrassas, a
conservative former finance minister.
The nomination has caused irritation in Brussels, where officials say
protocol has been broken.
'The idea was to wait until the new president had been nominated and then
let him have a certain influence in composing his team,' one official said.
The nomination appears to be aimed at pre-empting yet another dispute within
Pasok.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Nuclear site clean-up costs more than double to Pounds 8.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of cleaning up the UK Atomic Energy Authority's nuclear sites has
more than doubled, according to government estimates released yesterday.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said the authority's liabilities were now
estimated at Pounds 8.2bn, against a previous estimate of Pounds 3.4bn. That
consisted of about Pounds 6bn to decommission the authority's own sites, and
a further Pounds 2bn for fuels and wastes and for cleaning up British
Nuclear Fuels sites.
Mr Eggar said that the increase was because of:
Inclusion of new costs - for example, looking after sites during the various
phases of decommissioning, which can last 100 years.
Costs for assessment studies and research and development.
The completion of fuller studies of dismantling costs and the volumes of
waste created.
Greater allowance for contingencies.
The authority's sites are mainly experimental nuclear reactors at Windscale,
Dounreay, Harwell and Winfrith. Since April, responsibility for
decommissioning has been with UKAEA government division. The remainder of
the authority, renamed AEA Technology and comprising the technology and
consultancy operations, is now being prepared for privatisation. Its sale
value has been estimated at Pounds 250m.
Mr Derek Pooley, chief executive of UKAEA government division, said
yesterday he hoped the decommissioning work could be completed below the
estimates. 'It's our job to get the costs down,' he said.
The actual, or discounted, cost of the UKAEA clean-up will be Pounds 5bn. It
is normal practice in the nuclear industry to set aside financial provisions
well before they are needed, and allow them to grow with compound interest.
The discount rate used is 2 per cent.
The latest estimates suggest that the total undiscounted cost of
decommissioning the UK's existing nuclear installations will be about Pounds
22bn-Pounds 23bn.
A year ago, the National Audit Office put the total cost at Pounds 18bn,
using the AEA's earlier estimates.
But it warned that those estimates were 'understated because of optimistic
assumptions and significant omissions'.
The British Nuclear Industry Forum, a trade group, said the new AEA figures
had no bearing on estimates for other nuclear installations owned by Nuclear
Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the two state-owned utilities.
The government is conducting a review of the nuclear industry to see whether
further expansion can be financed by the private sector. Decommissioning
costs are one of the key issues determining the economic viability of
nuclear power.

FT  18 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Dour opening tussle lives up to tradition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Defending champions Germany had the perfect start last night in their bid to
retain the title when they won 1-0 over Bolivia, who had their star player
sent off minutes after he came on as a substitute.
Opening games have a tradition of producing dour displays and few goals, and
after an undistinguished first half this one looked unlikely to be a
spectacle to match the noisy and colourful pre-game opening ceremony which
was watched - according to the organisers - by 750m people in 180 countries.
US president Bill Clinton welcomed players and fans, claiming 'soccer is the
universal language that brings us all together,' while guests among the
63,117 sell-out crowd at Soldier Field in Chicago were German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez De Lozada.
On a hot, humid day with temperatures above 30 degrees centigrade, both
teams were cautious and slow to get into their stride. The first yellow card
of the tournament was shown to Germany's Jurgen Kohler in the 7th minute, as
the Mexican referee sought to impose his authority early.
Most of the neutrals in the crowd were behind the South American underdogs,
who were content to soak up German pressure and grew in confidence as the
game went on.
In the 1990 tournament in Italy, Germany won their first game 4-1 against
Yugoslavia but probably never played as well again during the tournament.
Last night's German team included seven of the side that won the 1990 final
against Argentina, and two of them combined to break the deadlock on the
hour. A long ball by Lothar Matthaus beat the Bolivian offside trap and
striker Jurgen Klinsmann rounded goalkeeper Carlos Trucco to stroke the ball
into an empty net.
From then on Germany were rarely threatened and Bolivia looked to their
bench for salvation.
Marco Etcheverry, their key midfield playmaker - and little short of
national hero - had been struggling with a knee injury and was left out of
the starting line-up. When he came on for Ramallo, he had a quarter of an
hour to make his mark. With his first touch he set up a shot for Erwin
Sanchez and there was a sense that his very presence might inspire his
countrymen to greater efforts.
But with the ball at the other end of the field, he aimed a frustrated shove
at Matthaus and was immediately shown the red card. He had been in the game
for four minutes.
Having banked three points, Germany must now be confident of progressing as
they prepare for their next game against Spain on Tuesday.

Shares in Golden Vale, the Irish dairy group, closed 30 per cent down at 69p
yesterday, after plunging as low as 55p during the day, in reaction to its
profits warning on Thursday evening, delivered after the market close.
The company said its pre-tax profits for 1994 would be about one third down
on 1993's IPounds 19m because of falling prices for its products, tighter
margins being forced on it by multiple retailers, unanticipated
rationalisation costs, and a strengthening Irish currency.
These factors have not been 'fully matched' yet by a reduction in prices
paid to its farmer-suppliers for its milk supplies, directors said.
Dublin analysts do not anticipate similar profits revisions for the other
Irish food companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's Aeroflot, once the world's biggest airline monopoly but split into
321 small airlines since the Soviet collapse, plans to sell a 49 per cent
stake at a privatisation auction, officials said, Reuter reports from
Moscow. The former flag carrier would sell its shares for cash at an
investment tender soon but no final date has been set, Aeroflot officials
said yesterday.
The government would keep a majority 51 per cent stake in the Russian
state's international carrier, which became a joint stock company this week
to allow privatisation after two years of chaotic reorganisation. Aeroflot's
privatisation was delayed by a dispute between airline officials and the
government over whether it should be split up or sold as a single lot. But
airline officials said Aeroflot's 'daughter' companies would also be
privatised. The proceeds of the sell-off would go towards purchases of new
equipment and spare parts.
They gave no details about the sell-off, but privatisation officials say
public offerings for cash - due to start from July 1 after the expiry of the
voucher privatisation - will involve sales of block shares to foreign and
domestic investors. Russia's Aeroflot to sell 49 per cent of stakes.
Hundreds of domestic and international airlines have been set up since
Aeroflot was broken up as part of post-communist market reforms, plunging
civil aviation into chaos.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, eased yesterday
as Catalan nationalists in the Madrid parliament promised they would
continue supporting the Socialists despite their poor performance in the
European elections last week. The assurance was given by Mr Jordi Pujol, the
head of Catalonia's autonomous government and leader of Convergencia i Unio
(CiU), in talks at the prime minister's residence in Madrid on Thursday.
The support of the 17 CiU MP's is sufficent to allow Mr Gonzalez's
141-strong Socialist group in the 350-member parliament to continue
governing but Mr Pujol stressed that the backing was conditional on the
government's ability to maintain both its present pro-market policies and
its commitment to transfer increased responsibilities to the regional
governments.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For reasons that do not matter, I spent part of this week fossicking through
the FT's 'sportswire' basket, looking for stories about the World Cup. The
sportswire basket is one of the most obscure baskets in the FT's computer
system.
Only the most exotic journalists are allowed near it - no doubt on the
assumption that FT writers do not need to know the result of the Coronation
Stakes at Royal Ascot, or whether the Colombian soccer team is permitted to
smoke grass on World Cup rest days.
I, on the other hand, am allowed to rummage anywhere, including the
sportswire basket, which marshals all sports stories filed on the
news-agency circuits to which the FT subscribes.
Enjoyably, I found myself time-machined back into the macho milieu of
news-agency sports reporting. This is a rough, tough world. You sink or you
swim. You have to be good and you have to be fast. There is no room for
wimps. Funnily enough, I used to be a sports-writer, and was once offered a
job by Associated Press, the American news agency, in Virginia.
I could not get a work permit, so I drifted back to London. But my browsing
in the sportswire basket reminded me of the starkness and directness of
news-agency work, and of the values of sports journalism, which is often
regarded snootily by non-sports hacks.
Here is the start of a news-agency sports story filed this week from
Pittsburg:
Colin Montgomerie has been looking forward to the US Open more than anything
else this year. But when he tees off at Oakmont tomorrow the big Scot's
primary aim will be to try to avoid making a complete fool of himself.
And here is the start of another, filed from London:
It's just what soccer purists feared.
Now Americans are staging the World Cup, they plan to revolutionise the
sport, painting the field red, blue and yellow, breaking the game into three
thirds instead of two halves and having players wear skin-tight
body-stockings instead of shirts and shorts.
The new look to a sport steeped in tradition will come in a pro league
starting up next year in 12 American cities.
There is a great deal of technique at work here. Both stories hook your
attention at once, and hold on like terriers. For example, the first story,
about golfer Colin Montgomerie, used the delayed-action trick with
consummate skill. It wasn't until the fourth paragraph that we realised that
'making a complete fool of himself' had a technical - golfy - meaning, and
wasn't just abuse:
'By making a fool of yourself (said Montgomerie) I mean three- or
four-putting from 10ft, hardly moving the ball in the rough, or thinning or
shanking it.'
It strikes me that non-sports journalists in Britain could learn a great
deal by reading their own sports pages. There is a belief in some quarters
that Britain's national press is living through a dark age, or at least a
grey one, caused by the ascendancy of accountants and the drive for greater
journalistic productivity. As a result, Britain's newspapers, at least at
the quality end, have been bleached and leeched so violently that they have
become fuzzy and unadventurous. Their aggression has been stomped out.
I sometimes wonder whether this lack of aggression is the reason that John
Major has survived so long in office. John Major is prime minister of
Britain, though to look at Britain you would not believe that anyone was in
charge. This is how one story about Major started this week:
A surprise return by John MacGregor to the education department is one of
the options being considered by John Major as he prepares for a substantial
reconstruction of the government next month.
What a cop-out. How tame. Instead, a top wire-agency writer might have
written it like this:
Prime minister John Major couldn't spell 'hornswoggle' if he tried. He even
has trouble with 'dunce.' But to boost his government's IQ into the low 20s,
he is plotting a savage ministerial shake-up. Only trouble is, it features
the return of John 'Brains' MacGregor to the education job.
With the World Cup starting in the US, I would urge journalists on Britain's
up-market papers to study the skills and aggression that underpin the work
of the sports-writers. If we were as good as they are, Britain's troubles
would disperse like mist at the 14th tee.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Short - not necessarily sweet: The weighty political and
economic significance of a truncated name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week The Spectator received advance notice of an impending political
disaster. It came in the form of a letter from David de Pinna, which warned
that 'there is a possibility that Great Britain could have a prime minister
named Tony. Tony]'
Following the disastrous showing of the government in the European
elections, and the cracking start by Tony Blair in the campaign for the
Labour leadership, there is indeed a good chance of de Pinna's nightmare
becoming reality.
He concludes: 'That an important section of the western world could be 'led'
by Bill and Tony does not inspire. What lack of dignity. Flower-pot men
indeed]'
It is less surprising that an American President could be called 'Bill'. One
of the characteristics which distinguishes our former colony from the
motherland is the way in which its citizens make haste to shorten their
given names.
Have you ever heard of an American called Charles? Only 'Chuck' will do. If
you are called 'Charles' and you have spent any time in America, you will
know, all too embarrassingly, what I mean.
The Australians are similarly besotted with the instantly familiar
abbreviation. I have never been called anything other than 'Dom' by
Australians, something which no Englishman has ever attempted even as a
joke. But if it was Prime Minister 'Bob' Hawke, who am I to complain?
It is a pity, though, that the habit has caught on in Britain. I used to
enjoy teasing 'Chris' Patten at his insistence on the chummy familiar, and I
believe that it sounds even odder for a governor of Hong Kong. If Patten had
stuck to his baptismal name of Christopher, he could have enjoyed wearing a
plumed hat at his inauguration. But as 'Chris' he had no choice but to break
with tradition, and take the oath bare-headed.
The last time I raised this matter with Patten, he pointed out that at least
he, on attaining high office as a Cabinet minister, had not suddenly and
mysteriously transformed himself back into a Christopher.
I believe he was referring to Ken Baker, who reinstalled his 'neth' on
becoming a member of one of Thatcher's cabinets. I have a sneaking feeling
that Clarke has also encouraged more of the Kenneth and less of the 'Ken'
since he became chancellor of the exchequer.
I would have said that this was an essential political act, that a
chancellor called Ken was no sort of guarantee of the value of the pound.
But look, we now have a Governor of the Bank of England called 'Eddie'.
At first I thought this a national disgrace, but recently I have come round
to seeing the virtue in it. Just as a Labour government needs to be far more
financially prudent than a Conservative one to keep the markets happy, so I
believe that a Bank of England Governor called 'Eddie' needs to behave with
a wholly admirable caution in order to be taken seriously by teenage
currency traders who might very well also be called 'Eddie'. A grandee
called Sir Edward George might think he could get away with any sort of
nonsense.
However, what is good enough for the Bank of England and the future of the
currency is clearly not good enough for the residents of a private housing
estate in the town of Midsomer Norton. Those people are very unhappy that
the local council had determined to call the new estate 'Reg Jones Close',
after a miner who died two years ago.
The residents, apparently, had assumed that their estate was going to be
called Wellow Brook Meadow, and were convinced that the name Reg Jones Close
would cause the value of their property to suffer. It was not the fact that
Jones was a miner which was the problem, nor even his given name. It was
that damned abbreviation. One of the residents, complained: 'I wouldn't mind
Reginald at all. But 'Reg' sounds so ridiculous.'
Will the prospect of posthumous ridicule from irate property owners cause
Blair to reassume the dignity of 'Anthony'? No. I believe we will have a
Labour prime minister named 'Tony'. But at least he won't be called Benn.
That really would have been flower-pot time.

<TEXT>
Mankind's ancestor - or something very close to it - is lying quietly in a
drawer in Simon Conway Morris's study. Pikaia is two inches long, scarcely
more than a dark, minnow-shaped indentation in a flake of blue-grey shale.
It does not look like much. But Conway Morris has spent 20 years studying
this and other weird little sea creatures crushed in a Canadian mudslide
some 525m years ago. To him Pikaia is clearly a primitive chordate, a
precursor of the fish and, thus, of all vertebrates, including homo sapiens.
Conway Morris is perhaps more sapiens than most of us. At 42 he is a lively,
approachable and humorous sort of academic, with something of the scruffy,
fossil-hunting schoolboy about him.
But he is a whizz-kid of the palaeobiological world, one of a trio of
Cambridge University scientists - the others were fellow graduate student
Derek Briggs and their supervisor Harry Whittington - whose exploits were
dramatised in Wonderful Life, a prize-winning science book by Stephen Jay
Gould.
According to Gould, the trio's revelations about the multiplicity of strange
body-plans found in the Burgess Shale of the early Cambrian period - long,
long before the dinosaurs - should shatter Man's last illusions about his
special place in the universe.
We have been in psychological retreat for several hundred years. First we
were removed from the centre of the solar system, then we were exposed as
parvenu animals, then we were relegated to an obscure corner of the cosmos.
Now, argued Gould, it should be clear that we people are an extraordinary
fluke, the lucky survivors of an evolutionary lottery. And if you re-ran the
tape it would all turn out very differently indeed.
Well, not quite. The hero of this palaeontological detective story disagrees
profoundly with that kind of interpretation of his work.
Would you say, I asked him, that evolution is in some sense progressive?
'Yes, I would. This is not something which is popular. Gould makes the fair
point that we are one twig of an enormous tree of evolution, and in that way
we are no more privileged than the millions of other planets which are meant
to have life on them. Presumably on at least some of them something close to
what we identify as consciousness has arisen. It would be strange if it
hadn't'
So Conway Morris is not surprised that animal consciousness and big brains
emerged on earth. Indeed, he thinks that was indicated as far back as the
Cambrian when neural tissue was already evident and creatures had developed
enough nervous apparatus to escape their predators. A bigger puzzle, he
said, was why homo sapiens had been sitting around for 50,000 years doing
practically nothing before his mental life took off.
Nor was evolution such a great lottery. The appearance of any particular
species, such as homo sapiens, could be called a big surprise, but a bipedal
omnivore was not wildly unlikely. 'It is a lottery only in the sense that I
wouldn't be sitting here if my parents hadn't met. But almost certainly this
building would be here, and you can take things much further back.'
For although the body plans of the fossil creatures in the Burgess Shale
were very diverse, their mechanisms tended to converge. (He does not
believe, either, that the variety of creatures alive then was any greater
than it is today.)
'If there is air, you would expect flyers, if oceans, swimmers,' he
explained. 'And you can only move through water in about four different
ways. You can row, or you can have a sinuous movement like an eel, or you
can 'fly', or you can have jet propulsion.'
Can evolution tell us about our future?
'No, of course not, no. It was always clear that potentially the sky's the
limit. Very seldom is it achieved. I think you can't say more than that. But
at one level I feel we have almost progressed as far as we can.'
Our technical ability is outrunning our evolutionary development?
'Oh yes] Our ability to run social systems seems to be perilously awry. I
know that doom-gloom is the fashion, but . . .'
Does this view come from your palaeobiology?
'I think it has a negligible influence. That's just what I do extremely
well, in the same way as a woodworker or a potter.'
It was important for us to know our history. 'But it is no good appealing to
that as a justification for our behaviour, because it's been made perfectly
clear how we ought to behave.'
To argue that the size of the universe reduced us to insignificance was
nonsense, he continued, precisely because we had the ability to comprehend
it. 'We have the privilege to understand our biological history - and don't
misunderstand me, I'm a dyed-in-the-wool neo-Darwinian when it comes to
evolution. Its a fascinating story and it's fun to work out. But - and I'd
better be careful what I say - it really doesn't make a great difference now
we're here, because the experiment we're engaged in of rampant consciousness
is evolutionarily unique.'
Technically Conway Morris is at the peak of his trade; philosophically he
appears out of the mainstream. I was reminded of Teilhard de Chardin, the
French palaeontologist and Jesuit who tried to synthesise evolutionary
biology and Christian teleology. Did Teilhard's idea of a 'noosphere' make
any sense?
'That I'm much less sure of. It's very difficult. This is really my private
thing and I have to be very careful what I say, But my own sense is that
consciousness is much more than simply the sum of the parts plus a bit: it's
much more than epiphenomena.
'I think that there is something about consciousness which actually involves
one making contact with something. In other words, I don't think it's
entirely in one's head.
'But this is a completely unscientific thing to say. It's impossible to
justify. When someone dies their brain stops working and in so far as we
know they lose consciousness. So far as we know. My strong sense is - not
thinking in necessarily a Jungian or Christian way, let alone any other
religion - is that you are effectively making contact with something outside
yourself.'
With something more than, say, a collective unconscious?
'I suspect so.'
What makes you say that?
'Hunch. Total hunch.'
You're an odd biologist, then.
'Indeed, yes.' He pointed to a book among the heaps of papers stacked about
the room. It was entitled Mithras. 'You see, I'm quite interested in
theology,' he said.
Conway Morris hopes to spring another prehistoric surprise. With the freedom
he now enjoys as Reader in evolutionary palaeobiology at Cambridge, he has
been working in Greenland with John Peel of Uppsala University on a fossil
find about 10m years older than the Burgess Shale.
'Would you like to see?' He dragged out a blown-up drawing of what looked
like a woodlouse. This was Halkieriid, a sort of hard-topped slug which
Conway Morris believes will show how different body plans, or phyla, can
develop from a common parent.
'We think that we have more or less cracked the problem of the origin of
phyla,' he said. 'This sounds very hubristic. I've been wrong in the past.'
(He got one of his Burgess Shale creatures, Hallucigenia, upside down). 'But
if our ideas are accepted, it would mean we have cracked what has been
regarded as a fairly significant problem - the origin of a large number of
separate designs over a short period of time.'
This discovery, if so it be, coincides with the latest thinking of
Cambridge's molecular biologists who have found similarities in the genetic
instruction mechanism for creatures as different as mice and flies.
I asked him: Doesn't your engagement with these creatures from an
unimaginably distant age make you feel your own existence is pathetically
short?
'Hubristically, one would say you can always play it at two levels. By now
one knows one's own mortality. It isn't that one has some privileged or
special destiny - rather the reverse - but the very fact that one can get
such intense enjoyment from things like music, because you are carried out
of yourself, those sort of concerns shrink to nothing.
But the fact that we are apparently so contingent . . ?
'We have to grow up. I agree with that. But we are responsible for our
actions - that's never been denied.
'I dont think our 'contingency' makes a big difference. Some people may seek
a very high and noble vision through science - science acting as a
substitute for a spiritual crutch. I don't think that is achievable by
science alone . . .
'You may say our deep notions of purpose are just defence mechanisms, that
the whole thing is a complete joke - there's nothing out there, we're on a
small planet, we're all going to die, our species may last, maybe, a million
years. You could say we are just an awful mistake and the sooner we go, the
better. One doesn't want to believe that. And, as it happens, I don't'

THE RAGGED LION by Alan Massie Hutchinson Pounds 15.99, 240 pages
OLIVER'S TRAVELS by Alan Plater Little, Brown Pounds 15.99, 315 pages
Alan Massie in The Ragged Lion says: 'Novelists after all are liars. We seek
to persuade our readers that an imaginary event has the force and
significance of the real world . . .'; or rather he puts those words into
the mouth of Sir Walter Scott.
Massie is himself a liar in the above sense because he pretends to have
discovered a lost manuscript by Scott that he is transcribing from a faded
parchment. He confesses to a measure of scepticism about the authenticity of
this manuscript now to be made public for the first time. It reached him (he
says) from an Italian contessa to whom he gave English conversation lessons
in Naples in 1964. She in turn is supposed to have inherited it from her
great-grandmother who had an extra-marital affair with Scott's son Charles,
its first owner.
Massie gets around the main stumbling-block to his strategy by suggesting
that when Lockhart came to write his life of Scott he used the original of
this manuscript but suppressed those parts of it he considered discreditable
to Scott, and then destroyed it, unaware of the copy.
Here, then, is an unauthorised life of the laird of Abbotsford by a modern
Scottish novelist of great distinction. It is a quietly enjoyable read.
Massie is outstanding for his use of fiction as a commentary on history and
contemporary society. His novel about Vichy France was called A Question of
Loyalties, which would do just as well as a title here.
Massie presents a stalwart Scottish patriot who had a catch in the throat
when he spoke of the 'Fifteen and the 'Forty-Five, yet has a similar fierce
pride in arranging the ceremonial for the royal visit to Scotland of 1822.
Scott comes across as a born Tory with many Whig friends and attitudes; a
lawyer who became a poet - a rhymester and balladeer who invented the
historical prose novel - to mention but a few of the contradictory loyalties
Massie uncovers. He delights in the pride Scott took in administering his
own huge estate, his sense of creating a truly hierarchical community there.
If Border Country was Scott's location it is also Massie's, who since 1982
has lived six miles away from Abbotsford.
The novel is scant of plot, but is correspondingly strong on ideas. Hubris
comes when Scott lost his entire fortune in the collapse of the Ballantyne
printing works in which he had invested heavily. Massie shows him recalling
the intricacies of this disaster and his recovery from it. More original is
a supernatural strand that Massie weaves into the tapestry involving a
ghostly manifestation in a murky close in Edinburgh Old Town where the hero
suffers remorse for his past in a head-on confrontation with a childhood
phantom.
Alan Plater was born in Hull and made his name a quarter of a century ago
with his script Close the coalhouse door. It was a lively entertainment that
unfolded the troubled mining history of the North East in the Joan
Littlewood musical style.
Since then Plater has had dozens more successful scripts and novels to his
credit. His latest picaresque novel Oliver's Travel's follows a former
university lecturer with a passion for anagrams moving around Britain on the
trail of some very unsavoury operators, and partnered by a policewoman
suspended from duty. Their happy plight is clearly modelled on the pair
handcuffed together in Hitchcock's Thirty-Nine Steps movie (the earliest
version). The text is both stiff with wisecracks and soggy with nostalgia
but in spite of this Plater keeps his show on the road and leaves us in no
doubt of his disgust at the current state of the nation.

FOOTBALL AGAINST THE ENEMY by Simon Kuper Orion Pounds 14.99, 223 pages
Sport, as the coming weeks will remind us, is one of the last refuges of the
knee-jerk, politically incorrect national labelling which used to be the
staple of TV sitcoms and post-prandial discussions in any gentleman's club
of your choice. In no other field of activity can one get away with
references to languid Africans, jumpy Italians, cynical Uruguayans and those
determined, never-say-die Germans who will keep spoiling the carnival. Yet
where would today's football commentator be without access to this priceless
database of cheap stereotypes?
Simon Kuper's perceptive and highly entertaining account of his travels
round the soccer world puts some of these fervently-held beliefs about
national behaviour to the test, and finds that behind every kick of a
football, there lies a raging existential debate on citizenship and
nationhood.
Bill Shankly's pallid aphorism on life, death and Pele's beautiful game
would find some unlikely followers among Kuper's animated cast of
characters: there is Professor Dr L. de Jong, sober historian of the
Netherlands during the second world war, happily admitting to dancing round
the room when the Dutch side score; on a summer night in 1988, he watched
nine million of his 'staid' compatriots - more than 60 per cent of the
population - parade round the streets to celebrate the nation's 2-1 victory
over West Germany in a European Championship semi-final. In the centre of
Amsterdam, bikes were thrown into the air in symbolic revenge for the theft,
during the Occupation, of all the city's cycles by the German army. After
the match, the Dutch captain, Ronald Koeman, admitted to using his
opponent's swapped shirt as toilet paper; the beautiful game, indeed.
Travelling to Africa, Kuper meets Professor Paul Nkwi, a Cameroonian
anthropologist, who floats his theory that Anglophone Africans are much more
likely to succeed in European clubs than their Francophone counterparts as
they are more used to the overt racism of British colonisation and have not
been deceived by the French rhetoric of equality. Less sophisticated
analysts argue that the raw talent of home-grown stars is dissipated in the
wealthy North by the over-emphasis on organisation. The country, in the
meantime, continues to bask bizarrely in the glories of Italia '90; a rare
clothes emporium in Yaounde is called 'Bobby Robson' after the man who
engineered - well, stood on the sidelines and watched - their exit from the
tournament.
It is no great surprise that Kuper finds the most skilful football (as well
as another extemporising anthropologist) in Brazil. 'When our national team
plays, we feel that the identity of our country is being played out on the
field. Our values are being shown to the world,' theorises his reflective
academic, Luis Eduardo Soares. While Graham Taylor waits until he can look
another turnip in the eye, he may do well to ruminate on the fate of some of
his Brazilian counterparts: Claudio Coutinho, for example, whose effigy was
burned by fans on the very day Brazil reached the second round of the 1978
World Cup, for playing sacreligiously boring football.
Kuper's most extraordinary encounter is with a fan; a very serious fan
indeed. Helmut Klopfleisch was a 13-year-old supporter of Hertha Berlin when
the Wall went up and separated him from his beloved team. At first, he
joined a group of East Berlin Hertha fans next to the wall, listening to,
and echoing, the cheers from across the great divide. But when the club
moved westwards and out of earshot, he and his fellow non-travellers had to
content themselves with clandestine monthly meetings of the 'Hertha Society'
in the back rooms of cafes.
Soon, the boundaries between supporting a Western team in the East and
becoming an outright political dissident became irrevocably blurred.
Klopfleisch's activities attracted the attentions of the Stasi, who opened a
file. '(Klopfleisch's) family tries to use all opportunities to experience
Bundesliga teams live,' it warned ominously. Klopfleisch, resentful and more
subversive by the day, began to extend his support for any Western club
playing in the Eastern bloc; 'K. possesses a politically labile stance,'
countered the file. Friendly 'discussions' soon turned into arrests; once,
for presenting a toy Berlin bear to a bemused Franz Beckenbauer, and again,
for sending a good-luck telegram to the West German team.
Klopfleisch was allowed to emigrate in 1989. Months later, the Wall came
down. He now watches Hertha, but with half the passion he felt during his
years of ostracisation. It is a sad, grey story, a million miles from the
screaming colours of Rio or the ticker-tape snowfalls of Buenos Aires, and
on a different planet altogether from the commercial frenzy of the next four
weeks; a football story, nonetheless.

controversial American writer

<TEXT>
JAMES BALDWIN: A BIOGRAPHY by David Leeming Michael Joseph Pounds 20, 443
pages
It was the glossy black weekly Ebony which christened James Baldwin 'The
Angriest Young Man' in 1961. But it was his appearance on the cover of the
'white' Time magazine, and an adoring interview on CBS TV prime time news,
that established the most successful black writer of the early 1960s as a
household name in the US. The radical firebrand was created not on the black
campuses of America, nor on the streets of northern ghettos but in the minds
of white New York liberals.
White America came to believe that Baldwin spoke for the restless black
masses. But the truth is that Baldwin never had the credibility, the staying
power or, ultimately, the courage for the role.
Unfortunately David Leeming, who was his 'secretary' - a minder, nurse, and
fixer - between 1964 and 1967, subscribes to the myth. But it takes an
enormous feat of self delusion to sustain the notion of Baldwin as black
hero through 400-odd pages.
He was born in Harlem in 1924 and became one of Harlem's many precocious boy
preachers, able to move crowds with his righteous fervour. It is no accident
that his most famous essay title came from the biblical warning: 'God gave
Noah the rainbow sign - no more water, the fire next time'.
Harlem was then a ferment of political and artistic life. Baldwin sang a
little and had a flirtation with Trotskyite politics as an adjunct to a love
affair. But the uneasy awareness of his homosexuality, his evident
preference for the company of white schoolmates over black, and his
appearance - bulging eyes and a mincing gait - kept Baldwin on the edge of
Harlem life. Neither an athlete nor a brilliant scholar, he was headed for
life as a storefront preacher or a minor hoodlum. It was the black artist
Beauford Delaney who first introduced him to the world of painters,
musicians, writers and their white patrons.
Leeming seems embarrassed by Baldwin's homosexuality, presumbably because it
fatally complicates his position as a spokesman for a community that is
notoriously uneasy about what it considers to be deviant sexual behaviour.
Baldwin was famously promiscuous, yet Leeming feels obliged to tell us
several times that his relations with particular men were 'platonic but
profound'. Baldwin's alchoholism, his chronic self-pity and his feeble
attempts at suicide are equally glossed over.
But it is the failure to tackle the issue of Baldwin's authenticity that is
most disappointing here. Baldwin never really mixed with black people except
as a celebrity or perhaps as a kind of tourist. Most of his students were
white, as were his closest friends. He was greeted coolly by Martin Luther
King, who distrusted his dilettantism and disliked his explicit depiction of
homosexuality in Another Country. Richard Wright, the activist author of the
classic Native Son, engaged in a lifelong argument with Baldwin about
'protest writing'; Wright thought of Baldwin as a pretentious cop-out. The
greatest of black American poets, Langston Hughes, accused Baldwin of
confusion, saying his 'viewpoints are half American, half Afro-American,
incompletely fused'.
Baldwin's contribution to civil rights was in making whites feel guilty. At
dinner parties he would harangue them about their racism, then invite
himself to their country homes. He would whinge that a 'gifted man . . . is
burdened with his gift.' And he would shout at whites even on first meeting,
'where were you when Martin died?' This was all the more ironic since
Baldwin himself contrived to be somewhere else when the battle was at its
hottest.
America semed to offer him little scope as a writer and he fled to Paris in
1948 - the first of several such excursions which continued until 1971 when
he finally settled in the South of France. So when Rosa Parks triggered the
Montgomery bus boycott by refusing to move to the back seats, Baldwin was in
Paris.
Later when the black radicals led by Stokely Carmichael took the initiative,
leading to the rise of the armed militants in the Black Panther movement, he
was in Turkey. When Malcolm X was shot, in the Audubon ballroom in New York,
Baldwin was elsewhere.
Leeming suggests that Baldwin's remoteness from the struggle may have had
something to do with an artist's sensibility. Asked by Marlon Brando to
attend a protest meeting he refused, saying he was 'emotionally unable' to
come. Norman Mailer assessed him as 'too charming to be major'. In the end,
even his considerable mastery of language let him down. His last two books
were all but unreadable. He died, as ever, away from the action in the South
of France in 1987.

ON TOP OF THE WORLD by Rebecca Stephens Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 196 pages
BEYOND THE LIMITS by Stacy Allison with Peter Carlin Little, Brown Pounds
16.99, 282 pages
It turns out to have been a well-kept secret. But few who know her well
doubt that Rebecca Stephens has a fascinating tale to tell of how a
beautiful upper-middle class English woman became the first Briton of her
gender to make it to the top of the world's highest mountain.
With few big climbs under her belt she is disarmingly frank about her lack
of climbing experience. Up to the very moment of her Everest triumph with
the aid of bottled oxygen on May 17 1993, two Sherpas at her side, she does
little to hide her reliance on other team members - an act of humility of
which the average macho male mountaineer would be incapable.
But for most of the book she is less forthright. There is no mention of the
startling fact that the famous picture of her on the summit of Everest with
her two Sherpa colleagues was in part a fabrication. Virtually every
newspaper published it but that flag - with the carefully delineated
initials of her main sponsor, DHL, flying from her ice-axe - was taken not
at 29,028 feet but at ground level, and patched in afterwards in England. As
one of her Everest expedition colleagues put it later: 'To some extent you
can sell your soul to your sponsors.'
In a sport traditionally associated with amateurism the issue has become
even more controversial since last autumn's phenomenal increase in peak fees
charged by the Nepalese government. The result has been that Everest by the
traditional South Col route has become almost exclusively the preserve of
commercial expeditions who charge their clients up to Dollars 65,000 per
person for the privilege of being guided up. When Stephens launched her
attempt by the same route in spring 1993 the writing was already on the
wall: some 85 people climbed the mountain in the five weeks prior to her
ascent, 13 of them women.
It would be churlish to fault the author for her decision not to elaborate
on her sometimes stormy romantic relationship with the colourful and often
controversial John Barry, leader of the 16-person expedition that put her on
top of Everest. But one longs for a detailed description of her more unusual
team members. Where, for example, is the portrait of the acerbic and
powerful Bill Barker - a man central to the history of the still unclimbed
North East ridge of Everest - and where the tale of Joe Smith, who missed
his flight in Moscow and spent three days trying to get out of Llubianka
prison to join his fellow climbers on the expedition?
Indeed the central dramatic moment of the DHL Everest expedition - Harry
Taylor's oxygenless ascent on May 10 and his epic struggle to stay alive
afterwards - is given surprisingly short space. There is hardly a quote from
this highly regarded former member of the SAS who nearly died just a few
hundred yards above Stephens' and Barry's tent on the South Col, bringing
her first summit attempt to a fearful and abrupt end. Nor is there a mention
by name or nationality of the two heroic but angry Basques who left their
own tent that night to drag the blind, frost-bitten climber down to a
perilous kind of safety at 26,000 feet.
Less than a week later our heroine's own defining moment - the debate over
whether she should make a second summit attempt or not - is described in a
way that is a model of diplomacy and possibly naivety. With the weather
looking threatening and her climbing partner out of action because of his
efforts to rescue Harry Taylor, all but John Barry argued strongly in
private that she should descend - a fact of which she seems to have been
unaware. That she chose instead to go back up is history and true testament
to Rebecca Stephen's courage and tenacity.
Although twice in her account she refers to coarse remarks suggesting she
had no chance of succeeding, she gives little or no space to discussion of
'the woman's role' in the highly masculine world of Himalayan
mountaineering. One suspects that for Stephens feminism is not an issue. And
there is certainly no soul-searching about the nature of mountaineering or
the universe for her.
In sharp contrast Stacy Allison reveals all you ever wanted to know and more
in her enthralling account of the first American female ascent of Everest in
1988. She bares her soul, her life, her climbs and loves, as perhaps only an
American could.
In occasionally embarrassing detail, she gives us an account of a life,
seemingly one long battle between the sexes, on and off the mountain.
She tells of the blond god Scott Fisher; Sue 'killer' Giller, the macho
maiden; of how her own mother was deserted by her drunken father; how her
husband beat her up; and how she manoeuvred to beat her female colleague to
get to the top of Everest first.
She tells too of how a French expedition hurled its dead sherpa off Everest
in front of her; and how she combatted the expedition leader's chauvinistic
half-truths after the climb. And top place goes to her pride in her
achievement of becoming a woman housebuilder. Interspersed with all this is
a bravura discussion of the philosophy of mountaineering.
For climbers, feminists, psychologists and others this is a must read.

<TEXT>
The best of miracles, said GK Chesterton, is that they sometimes happen.
Possibly; but our own century's apparent miracles have a way of backfiring,
or emerging as mountebank's legerdemain or the self-deluding optimism of the
faithful.
Recent revivals of A Doll's House have reminded us of Ibsen's conviction
that sexual equality would require a miracle in people's attitudes. And
another great dream of our time, the Utopia formulated by communism in
response to Marx's theories, is still wistfully or bitterly lingering in the
cold dawn of triumphant market forces. Manifesto at Battersea Arts Centre,
aptly installed in the paternalistically self-assertive architecture of the
old town hall in Lavender Hill, is a threnody for communism that almost
turns into the kiss of life.
Volcano Theatre Comany, directed by Nigel Charnock, presents physical,
stylised performance. They have adapted work by Steven Berkoff and Tony
Harrison but for their latest show has no specific author. Manifesto draws
from sources as diverse as Arthur Koestler and the Dadaists; the French
Revolution and Mayakovsky; above all, Marx and Engels.
A sloping ramp like an indoor ski-track is manipulated in the course of this
75-minute exercise. The company comprises four men and two women who play
with lithe grace, sinewy elegance and a mixture of menace and irony. At
times the text becomes a kaleidoscope of the cliches of political jargon.
All sides are given a hearing or, if you prefer, allowed to condemn
themselves: revolutionaries, fat cats, liberals, reactionaries, artists and
philistines. Other certainties besides death and taxes emerge: that the
bourgeoisie ultimately gets clobbered by everyone; and that no Lloyds name
should underwrite a creative artist in times of social upheaval.
Images and music range from dancers spouting dialectic as they niftily
execute Fred and Ginger numbers; and a prisoner's blindfolded eyes as they
no less niftily execute him. Words include first-person recollections of
political violence against the bosses of industry, and the pleasantly
materialistic credo of a successful businesswoman.
After about an hour the elegiac tone for the Utopia that never was leads to
an apparent ending and applause. The actors sidle back, glaring at the
audience, pretending to spot such contemptible types as the
'Guardian-reading pseudo-feminist new man radical', though mercifully not
the costive, jaded note-scribbling Financial Times theatre critic. The
company has a gift for the striking tableau, the acrobatic tumble, the
sculptural grouping. Nothing much is settled, nothing finalised, no decision
reached, except perhaps that revolutionary politics is still a primal soup
from which something terrible or beautiful or ploddingly mundane may come.
The sad little realisation, perhaps, that man is a competitive creature;
collectivity is not in the nature of the beast. Full marks for vigour,
freshness and passion. I am still not sure about the miracle.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: Sweet Bird takes flight - A new production at the
National
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were moments during Richard Eyre's new production of Tennessee
Williams's Sweet Bird of Youth in the Lyttelton Theatre when the American
accents affected by a predominantly British cast slipped so badly that I
started fantasising about a production done unashamedly in English
theatrical tones - a sort of Ascot Williams, full of Wildean pronunciation
and poise, though without changing a word.
The power of the play certainly would not be dimmed and a point about its
dogged universality would, perversely, be made. Better, at any rate, such
bizarre stylisation than a performance in which the linguistic mask of raw
passion is constantly being dropped and something like an Ealing comedy
seems snickering behind every other vowel.
The worst offender is Richard Pasco's Boss Finley - Bible-bashing demagogue
in the Southern American town of St. Cloud - whose public and private
ranting passes muster but who cannot make his conversational tones
convincing for a minute. Alison Fiske's Aunt Nonnie substitutes sobbing for
speech tones, which is cheating a bit. Diane Langton's bar-propping southern
belle, Miss Lucy, tries too hard with her accent and is often
unintelligible; while Emma Amos as Boss Finley's pretty blonde but - so we
discover - venereal daughter, Heavenly, is so measured of speech as to be
incredible.
Robert Knepper in the male lead as Chance Wayne is, though, a native speaker
and with his James Dean looks, prettily muscled torso, and his authentic air
of twitching, fast-talking, last-ditch desperation, altogether appropriate
in this gigolo role (originally taken by Paul Newman). But even he produces
oddities of speech. Lost in the hotel of heartbreak, he twice at the end
tells his client, the ageing film star Alexandra del Lago, 'I couldn't go
past my youth, but I've gone past it;' and each time emphasises the 'it'
(rather than 'gone'), which does not quite work as an off-the-cuff
allegorisation of the enemy Time.
Chance is a chancer indeed; but when his head is held to the mirror by
Alexandra and she exclaims 'Face it', I am not sure what I reckon to that
particular pun: is it poetry or bathos? This would, of course, be a
criticism of the text rather than the production. The text which Eyre uses
is, however, specific to the production, compiled (as he writes) from five
manuscript drafts, and considerably at variance with the Penguin edition.
It is, for instance, not clear whether Chance is the direct or only indirect
agent of Heavenly's infection. The last scene, in which Alexandra's career
is restored by the phone-call that seems to finish his hopes, and he remains
in St. Cloud to face emasculation by Boss Finley's men, is altered in a way
that toys with the idea of redemption.
There are strengths to Eyre's production - this final tableau suggesting
purgation is perhaps one of them. I liked the indigo-violet sunset
cyclorama, designed by Anthony Ward. Clare Higgins as Alexandra, aka The
Princess Kosmonopolis, gives a wonderfully spirited and witty performance,
her accent holding as she despatches such Dorothy Parkerisms as 'I'm being
used. Why not? Even a dead race horse is used to make glue.'

FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: Celebration at the fairs - Business is booming at both
Grosvenor House and Olympia this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one is more surprised than the dealers. From Grosvenor House and Olympia
to the specialist Ceramics Fair at the Park Lane Hotel, the London art
market is humming. Last year, visitors to the Grosvenor House Art and
Antiques Fair idly inspected the odd item. But as the doors opened this
year, and those at the head of the queue purposefully strode in, it was
clear that business was about to be done.
It was clear, too, that the dealers were there to move their stock. Most
seem to have decided that they can no longer afford to use Grosvenor House
simply as a showcase. Gone are the Pounds 1m pictures, the Pounds 6m
sculpture, bravura displays of suites of powder blue and gilt Austrian
furniture. Truly exceptional works of art were relatively few, although
Angela von Wallwitz was rewarded by showing her spectacular Meissen wine
ewer in the form of a fantastical roaring beast. Modelled by JG Kirchner for
Augustus the Strong's Japanese Palace in Dresden around 1728 and over half a
metre high, this found a new home in the first two hours of the private
preview.
Most stands appealed to the middle of the market and recorded a high
turnover of less expensive items. Good 'brown' English furniture was, as
ever, the mainstay of the fair; Apter-Fredericks, for instance, sold half
his stand on preview day. The demand for jewels and precious objets d'art
appeared no less enthusiastic. By noon on the first day, New York-based A La
Vieille Russie had achieved sales exceeding the total of their business at
the 1993 fair and by the first weekend, silver dealers JH Bourdon-Smith had
sold 30 exhibits.
Much to the dismay of the Jeremiahs, the long-overdue abolition of dateline
restrictions this year did not alter the character of the fair. Instead it
treated us to Yves Mikaeloff's appropriately surreal display of the
petal-backed ebony armchairs that Sue and Marie created for a famous Paris
perfumery in 1923, and the traditional likes of the Phillip de Laszlo
portrait at the Christopher Wood Gallery. The most unexpected sight was the
bare buttocks and suspenders of an Allen Jones tucked in among the old and
modern masters at The Dover Street Gallery.
Far more dramatic was the transformation for the better of the appearance
and quality of experience at the fair. George Carter's elegant, understated
and unifying design gave the stands a more substantial feel (no more flimsy
partitions) and substantially higher ceilings. Even the air conditioning
seemed more efficient. The Grosvenor House Fair, which closes this Saturday
at 6pm, could not have hoped for a better Diamond Jubilee.
Over at Olympia, the Fine Art &amp; Antiques Fair could celebrate its 21st year
too. Long considered the poor relation of Grosvenor House, it has gone from
strength to strength, attracting ever more serious exhibits and visitors as
well as finding room for more off-beat collectables.
Here, too, furniture and silver enjoyed an exceptional year - some even
record sales. Silver dealers Marks Antiques, for example, sold a pair of
Paul Storr wine coolers for around Pounds 40,000, and two rare James I
goblets for the same sum. The fair drew a record 37,549 visitors - and
purchases out of the Metropolitan and Berlin Museums.
A similar tale was told at the International Ceramics Fair which got off to
a rip-roaring start on June 10. What was noticeable here, unlike Grosvenor
House, was that all the really good things seem to have sold, mostly on the
first day. English exhibits were far more interesting this year and the
quality of the French porcelain as good as ever. Crucially, prices were more
competitive too. It was the liveliest fixture in years.
Anyone doubting that it is still possible to find exceptional and relatively
inexpensive works of art on the market should make a pilgrimage to Agnew's
current show, Arte Sacra Antica (43 Old Bond Street, W1, until July 22). In
pride of place among this small but choice group of 14th and 15th century
panel paintings, illuminated manuscripts and maiolica hangs a 'lost'
crucifixion by Gentile da Fabriano, the leading Gothic painter in Italy. The
panel, its gold ground overpainted, had been sold at Phillips in 1991,
catalogued as workshop of Ugolino di Nerio, for Pounds 68,000.
The Crucifixion has been identified as the crowning panel of Gentile's
partially re-assembled 'Valle Romita' altarpiece of 1410-12 in the Brera
Gallery, Milan, where it was on display last year. Despairing of a sale, or
perhaps to force the Italians' hand, the painting is on offer in London at
Pounds 2.5m.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: Lohengrin as a parable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Wagnerian debuts go, Robert Carsen has done rather well. The prolific
young Canadian has spent most of his career scoring successes in French and
Italian repertoire. Given his ability to tap singers' acting skills and his
refusal to over-conceptualise, he was ripe for the wider spaces of Wagner.
Lohengrin at Geneva's Grand Theatre fulfils most expectations, while
suggesting he still has something to learn.
Carsen sees Lohengrin as a parable of man's political and social condition.
Like the people of Brabant, we all seek a better world - preferably one in
which problems are solved in a twinkle by some miraculous swan-knight - but
are brought back to earth by the self-destructive tendencies of human
nature.
Brabant, in Paul Steinberg's designs, is a bombed-out concrete shell of a
building, not unlike a modern theatre or military hangar. Its drab,
easily-manipulated inhabitants are all too ready to share Elsa's dream of a
saviour to deliver them from internal strife and external threat. That the
dream bears no relation to reality is clear when Lohengrin arrives like a
romantic crusader stepping out of a 19th century painting.
Dressed in a business suit for Act two, Lohengrin imparts confidence like a
politician or merchant banker. After 'In fernem Land', he withdraws as he
arrived - leaving young Gottfried to plant a tree of hope for the future.
The moral? Don't count on Messiahs, there is no quick fix; humanity must
learn to solve its problems the hard way.
Within this late-20th century allegorical framework, Carsen allows words and
music to speak with uncommon freedom. His handling of Telramund and Ortrud -
Wagner's Macbeths - is psychologically acute, while the subtle variety of
lighting (Dominique Bruguiere) is alone worth the ticket. On the debit side,
the choral processions find Carsen floundering for ideas. There is a touch
of bathos in the way Lohengrin's swan bows its head like a mechanical toy,
and the bed-making routine in the bridal chamber is a comic lapse of taste.
On this evidence, Thomas Moser is probably the finest Lohengrin since James
King. The voice has a sweet lyrical ring rather than clarion power, and he
shows exemplary control and musicality. With his tall, bearded appearance,
he is every inch the part. His Elsa is Eva Johansson, a blonde bombshell who
sings radiantly and makes a playful bride. Hartmut Welker is the stentorian
Telramund, Marilyn Zschau a two-faced Ortrud who could be auditioning for
Dynasty. Eike Wilm Schulte repeats his fine Herold from Bayreuth, while Hans
Tschammer's King Henry - dressed like a general - is a model of dignity.
No reservations about the cast - nor about Christian Thielemann's
conducting. His speeds are spacious but powerfully sustained, so that
Wagner's long crescendos develop a crowning inevitability. He elicits string
playing of extraordinary finesse at the crux of Act two, and the work's
melodic poetry comes over strongly. Thielemann's Lohengrin has the stamp of
authority usually associated with an older, near-extinct breed of German
conductor. Nothing could be more reassuring.
Final performances June 20, 24, 27 and 30.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: A long way from the Nile - Elijah Moshinsky's new
production of 'Aida' at Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With its challenging lead roles and prohibitive demands for choral and
scenic splendour, Aida is an opera that companies do not essay often.
Failure in it can be both spectacular and costly, as the opera tempts the
incautious into stagings that only end in boom or bust.
The Royal Opera had a bad experience with it last time in 1984. This new
production has been entrusted to Elijah Moshinsky, whose previous encounters
with Verdi had shown him to be a safe pair of hands. Faced with a relatively
small stage and a budget probably of the same proportions, he elected to try
the bare stylish look in vogue in so many other recent productions.
Moshinsky and his designer, Michael Yeargan, seem to have seen them all. An
informed opera audience could spend happy hours spotting visual references
that were striking elsewhere and (given the lack of anything else to
exercise the mind) probably will. Do not expect pyramids or vistas of the
Nile. An imposing curtain decorated with hieroglyphics is the only pointer
towards Egypt, while the costumes are outlandish in every sense: the triumph
scene looked like a United Nations convention attended by Arabs, Indians,
assorted Africans and a few guests who had turned up in fancy dress.
Without being told beforehand, one would be hard pressed to tell that this
was a new production, so diffuse is its concentration. For all its pomp and
show, Aida focusses intently on several of the themes most personal to
Verdi: the tension between church and state, the dilemma of the individual
forced to choose between private emotions and public duty. In the final act
these opposing forces should generate such intensity that the characters
seem torn apart from within.
In fact, the only individual on whom Moshinsky gets a grip is Radames. In
this production we watch his precipitous tumble from triumphant warrior
hailed in a shower of gold to a grizzled, grey-haired, broken man, buried
alive while the rigid Egyptian society which has condemned him carries on
its daily routine above. Dennis O'Neill is no Pavarotti (the steely vibrato
in the voice is an unappealing feature) but he has spontaneity, passion and
guts. He delivered the goods.
Singing her first Aida, Cheryl Studer signally failed to do that. This
voice, which has excelled in so many types of music on disc, is essentially
a lyric soprano, on the shallow side for the heavier Verdi roles. It was
clear from the start that she wanted to make a lyrical (not a dramatic)
Aida, spinning long Straussian vocal lines, but as the evening progressed
her confidence seemed to slip away and her sense of pitch slipped with it.
Later performances may find her in better form.
Luciana d'Intino is a young and attractive Amneris, with a fondness for
old-fashioned gestures. Her voice is firm, well-centred, just big enough at
Covent Garden: she keeps strictly within her means, which would be admirable
in any role but this, which asks for a singer who will let rip (as Cossotto
did so memorably). Alexandru Agache makes a forceful, brutish Amonasro. Mark
Beesley's King had trouble keeping in tune. A bald Robert Lloyd looks as if
he is leading the local Hare Krishna group, but sang with gravity as Ramfis.
His incitement to war failed to enthuse the chorus, whose cries of 'Guerra'
were so tepid as to promise immediate surrender. Edward Downes is the
conductor, who roused himself and the orchestra to more urgent action after
the interval. Even so, this is a score of violent contrasts, of sounds
wildly high and low, loud and quiet, harsh and soft, which he renders as a
solid grey. A self-confessed Egyptologist assures me that, when translated,
the hieroglyphics on that curtain read, 'Yes, bust again] Better luck next
time'.
Sponsored by P&amp;O. Further performances until July 22 (with changes of cast).

FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: Narrative painting gets lost for words - The RB Kitaj
retrospective at the Tate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ronald Brooks Kitaj was born in 1932 in Cleveland, Ohio. His early adult
life was spent as a merchant seaman, with intervals of study at the Cooper
Union in New York. Then, in the mid-1950s, came National Service after
which, in 1957, he came to England to continue a now subsidised education
under the terms of the GI Bill. He spent the next two years at the Ruskin
School at Oxford, followed by a further three in the Painting School of the
Royal College of Art in London. By the early 1960s he was established as a
central and influential figure within a loose freemasonery of artists that
included not only such college contemporaries as David Hockney, Adrian Berg,
Allen Jones and Derek Boshier, luminaries of the British strain of Pop-Art,
but ranged from Bacon and Freud, Caro and Paolozzi to Hodgkin, Tilson,
Blake, Andrews and Auerbach.
He has remained in London ever since, not as refugee or committed
expatriate, but by habit, as he puts it, a cultural vagrant after the
fashion of Whistler, James, Pound and Eliot. He remains essentially American
and an outsider, conscious of his own displacement and ever intrigued by the
dissident, the stateless and the dispossessed. His own Jewishness gives such
self-awareness a particular edge. The diaspora in general and the Nazi
persecutions are his constant leitmotifs.
He has always been a narrative painter, which is to say one who would always
impose a reading, a story or scenario, upon the work, no matter how
ambiguous or imprecise the physical working of the painting may then render
it. Of one of the earliest paintings, the 'Tarot Variations' of 1958, he
says: 'My journal entries for this painting are lost and I can't remember
what exactly stands for what, but Eliot claimed that characters and genders
melt into each other in (The Waste Land) and anyway I have obviously
departed to suit my convenience.'
The assumption was and remains that there would indeed be a journal entry.
The danger is always that the journal entry, the literary content, might
move from mere explication to justification of the work. The visual interest
and quality of the painting, as a painting, should be what make it
interesting or otherwise, good or bad, no matter how recondite or abstruse
its exigesis - or every Crucifixion or Annunciation or Triumph of the Red
Army would be as good as any other. But Kitaj parades his learning
unabashed, his bookishness, his art-historical enthusiasms, his
philosophical and political obscurities, his louche fantasies and personal
adventures. Every picture tells a story.
At what point does the story-telling take over? Of his complex allegory, 'If
Not, Not' of 1976, he writes: 'its sense of strewn and abandoned things was
suggested by a Bassano painting, of which I had a detail, showing a ground
after battle . . . The general look was inspired by Giorgione's 'Tempesta'.
. . My journal reports a train journey someone took from Budapest to
Auschwitz to get a sense of what the doomed could see through the slats of
their cattle cars . . . Since then, I've read that Buchenwald was
constructed on the very hill where Goethe often walked with Eckermann.'
It may seem gross to carp at such things, but this intellectual
collage-making - which matches the collage-like technique of Kitaj's actual
picture-making - masks repeatedly the ever more perfunctory and formulaic
nature of the paintings themselves. 'Oh how clever and thoughtful and
serious an artist I am', he would seem to say, 'and so how clever, serious
and thoughtful my works must be.' It doesn't follow.
The few paintings which are successful, and actually beautiful, such as the
tall, thin figures of the mid 1970s, 'the Arabist', 'the Orientalist' and
the 'Smyrna Greek', are those which attempt a fuller resolution in the
statement of the image, and a richer, more considered quality on the
handling of paint and surface. In other words, they are more interesting as
paintings. Perversely they serve only to point the technical emptiness of
the rest, which amounts to drawing out and filling in.
The great Kitaj myth is that he is a consummate draughtsman. Rather he is a
mannered and careful draughtsman, precious of surface effect in the use of
pastel and charcoal. He looks to Degas, whose drawings 'are one of those
artistic achievements by which I measure all art', but shares none of that
infinitely greater artist's sense of adventure before the model, takes none
of his risks.
This retrospective is overdue for an artist of Kitaj's reputation. It is
indeed an important show, though not perhaps in quite the way expected,
re-evaluation rather than celebration. What is touching is his honesty, for
there is no doubt that he believes in the significance of what he does. Here
stands the Emperor in his innocent complacency, for us to see him in all his
mortal fallibility.
RB Kitaj: A Retrospective; the Tate Gallery, Millbank SW3 until September 4,
then on to Los Angeles and New York. Recent Pictures and Graphics 1974-1994;
Marlborough Fine Art, 6 Albemarle Street W1, until August 20. A Print

FT  18 JUN 94 / Outdoors: A perfect permanent partner - Gardening / Clematis
and roses climb to the top of Robin Lane Fox's league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One more weekend like the last and the ground will be like a brick. The
weeds will have to be dead-headed, refusing to be uprooted. Summer,
meanwhile, has brought on the roses with a rush.
Five years ago, I planted the climbing roses for my new garden: the
obligatory New Dawn; the tall and strong red Etoile de Hollande; the scented
head-hanging Lady Hillingdon; the quartered white Sombreuil; the
heavy-scented pale pink Caroline Teftout; silvery-white Madame Alfred
Carriere in memory of Sissinghurst; double-white Mrs Herbert Stevens; a
peach-white rambler which even Peter Beales does not list; and - my current
favourite - the silky pink-apricot Paul Lede which all but one nursery has
forgotten.
They have all flourished and anyone would like to grow them, but most of
them came to me because of invisible memories. Beside each of them, I see
past faces: the people, homes and serious gardeners through which these
roses came to my notice. Whenever I planted a rose, I planted a clematis
beside it; it is odd that so few people remembered until recently to do the
same.
The results are admirable and would suit any garden with walls, however
restricted. The plan is so good that all the books neglected it and even the
catalogues do not mention it, preferring to list clematis for trees, not
roses.
The reason must be the segregation with which the English regard their
national flower. They give it rose beds, rose gardens and rose arches;
roses, I was once taught at Kew Gardens, in Surrey, must never ever be
underplanted and in winter they must be pruned hard to look like bundles of
sticks. Control them, keep them apart, fan-train them on walls and never
imitate the French. The French nail roses on to posts and prune them hard
after flowering, packing them on to scaffolds, far too close together.
On English walls, roses must never criss-cross and we all used to be told
that nothing must interfere with a climber's health. The idea of mixing in a
clematis would strike a college-trained gardener as absurd. A clematis needs
a deep-root run and a site which does not dry out. The base of a wall is dry
and a neighbouring rose makes it drier still. If the clematis grew, it would
hang like a mop of green hair or go brown at the bottom and accentuate a
rose's lower nudity.
In fact, the two families twine together very well and allow us all to
double up our garden's seasons by ignoring Royal Horticultural Society
rules. The deep violet flowers of Clematis V President have threaded
themselves through the lower reaches of my large Madame Alfred; the
orange-yellow Lady Hillingdon is crowned with the sky blue Perle D'Azure;
sky-blue Lasurstern dominates the outer edges of the white varieties, while
various viticellas prolong the season by flowering in August.
Most of these clematis were planted within a foot of the rose and are none
the worse for it. Most of them stand beside gravel or a paved path while
their roots can run deeply, exploring the cooler soil underneath.
I would like to take credit for this easy combination, but I copied it from
better gardeners. Anyone can copy it, but they will need to think about the
height and width of their clematis and to be willing to feed and water it
whenever possible.
People go wrong by assuming that most clematis grow to a similar height and
can be planted without further thought. In fact, they vary hugely and need
to be matched to the task in hand. Tall twining roses, such as red Etoile
d'Hollande, need to be matched to a short-growing clematis so that all the
flowers do not appear at the top of a wall.
For tall roses, I recommend the white Clematis Henryi, mauve-blue Prince
Charles, the dusky red Madame Edouard Andre for pale-flowered roses, and the
blue H F Young, which flowers so profusely. Do not assume that all the
late-flowering viticella forms are relatively short-growing. They are not
and you should consult an explicit catalogue such as that produced by Valley
Clematis, of Hainton, Lincoln, for details of the potential height of each
variety.
The shorter types of climbing rose, such as Lady Hillingdon, are easily
suited in the opposite direction. The king of all easy clematis, the
wonderful Perle d'Azure, will race up above any such climber and reach 15ft
in height, crowning it with showers of its rounded blue flowers. I find it
much better than the yellow-flowered varieties which are sometimes
recommended but which are much too dense in leaf and growth.
Why not have two beauties where conventional books think only of one?
Promiscuity pays and I have got away with almost total neglect.
Double-planting does not double the effort, but it does double the season,
especially in enclosed urban gardens where the best planners know very well
that they must think in terms of a jungle with layers.
The one secret is to feed and water heavily whenever you can, adding
Phostrogen to a can of water and drenching the roots of the clematis as
often as once a week. Under the quiet moon of these recent warm evenings, it
is an enchanting labour, tending a second presence among the curtains of
roses which have just sprung to their yearly best.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Outdoors: A cast full of characters - Fishing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
When it comes to machismo in fishing, one bearded figure springs immediately
to mind - that of the ultimate macho fish slayer, Hemingway.
It is difficult to imagine that Ernest would have regarded any of our
freshwater fishes as exemplifying masculinity, or - much more to the point -
being capable of challenging his. For him, the battle took place at sea,
with fish huge enough to shatter a man's strength and break his spirit. They
must be muscled monsters, lords of the ocean, creatures such as sawfish,
mako shark, broadbill tuna, or the marlin of The Old Man And The Sea.
The fish of our rivers, lakes and ponds are Lilliputian by comparison. The
tench, for instance: to Walton, it was the physician, curing the ailments of
other fish with the balm contained in its slime.
Utter tosh, of course. And neither is the tench an elemental force of the
deep. Rather, it is a lovely, golden-olive, smooth-scaled bottom-feeder; a
quiet, peaceable inhabitant of placid canals and dark, reed-fringed ponds.
Ruminating anthropomorphically, I could indeed see the tench as a GP in a
country practice: solid, respected, a source of sound advice and well-tested
prescriptions.
He is sensible enough, but in terms of brainpower must yield to the carp,
which is undisputed as the fishing world's repository of wisdom. The carp is
large, ponderous, with great mailed flanks, vast rubbery mouth, and a mighty
tail. He, too, is a fish of still waters, old moats, monastery ponds and the
like. His authority and reputation for sagacity spring from his size, and
the difficulty anglers experience in catching him.
I see him as the senior partner in a long-established law firm - a fair and
moral influence, but sharp-witted too; and much respected in the community
for his work on local charities and as chairman of the school governors.
The carp rubs along nicely with the tench, for philosophically they have
much in common. But he has a powerful prejudice against his nearest rival in
terms of size - the pike. He sees him as a dangerous, troublesome element in
society: a savage, greedy, unscrupulous predator, immune to civilising
influences.
For his part, the pike fears the carp for his superior learning, and
despises him for eating worms and grubs when there are more substantial
meals around. The pike is a ruthless and dynamic businessman - a property
tycoon, perhaps, or hungry asset-stripper. I admire him for his dash, but
think the carp would make a more reliable friend.
I would be happy to make another friend of the chub. I like chub - most
anglers do. He could be a customs man, an electrician, even a hack. It would
not really matter. The thing about the chub is that he is a family man, can
take a joke, is keen on rugby and cricket, always stands his round in the
pub.
I like perch, too. They are handsome fellows, with their black stripes
across olive sides, and red fins. They bristle with pugnacity and
commonsense - would make good police officers, backbench MPs of the
no-compromise tendency, teachers of the old school.
The roach, on the other hand, is fastidious and delicate - in publishing, I
should say, or playing woodwind in a symphony orchestra. Bream are
slab-sided and boring, making dull speeches at dull council meetings. Eels
are slimy and sinister: offering loans to the gullible at murderous rates of
interest.
In the main, the coarse fish are professional types. The gilded nobility, of
course, is drawn from the salmonidae, with the salmon, inevitably, as
monarch; the trout in its finery as prince and princess; the grayling as
top-drawer aristocracy.
But how might I see myself, were I to be catapulted into an underwater
world?
I should like to think that I combined the wisdom of the carp with the
athletic glory of the salmon, the natty elegance of the chalkstream trout
with the hidden menace of the pike, the explosive power of the marlin with
the . . .
But no, not really. I would be content as a chub, or better still, as a
barbel: big but not bloated, handsome but not effete, strong but definitely
not macho, thoughtful, even a bit moody at times, but at bottom (which is
where the barbel feeds) a thoroughly decent, dependable, yeoman farmer type.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Property: A French connection - Cadogans's Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HOUSE-HUNTING in France is fun, and a voyage of self-discovery. But do not
disdain advice if you want to succeed. It is worth letting yourself be
nannied.
'Work through a UK consultant,' advises Sarah Francis at Sifex. She says
they are of great use for those who want to be helped through the process,
but adds: 'Decide which one you want to go with. If you use several, you
will probably end up with the same agents in France showing you the same
houses.'
There is no extra charge, as such a consultant will split the vendor's fee
with the French agent or British agent working in France.
Here are some other points to remember:
Besides the consultants' and agents' lists, useful magazines are Belles
Demeures, Demeures et Chateaux and Le Figaro's Proprietes de France.
Advertisements are often in English as well as French. There is a huge range
of properties, many of which have been on the market a long time with the
price falling gradually. Prices tend to be higher in favourite regions such
as Brittany, the Dordogne, Normandy and Provence.
When you set out to inspect properties, allow plenty of time; you will not
then have to rush for a telephone in the heart of the country to tell the
agent you are running late. Remember also that the agent has lunch from 12-2
and be certain to arrive at the agreed hour.
'Never offer the asking price,' says Crabb &amp; Templeton Associates (0225-810
531), a property consultant and financial broker. And make sure at the start
that you have enough land if you want a tennis court or swimming pool. Also,
inquire what might happen next door. A visit to the mayor will be helpful.
Before you settle, get estimates for work that needs doing. An architect or
surveyor might not be necessary but the local builder is. Small firms of
British builders are now working in France on old houses.
If you need a mortgage, says Crabb &amp; Templeton, consider getting one in
francs. It will be of the old-fashioned type, with repayment of capital and
interest, and probably will run for 15 years. At the moment, mortgage rates
in France (about 10.15 per cent ) are higher than the UK. But there is a
sporting chance the coming election will spark a devaluation, which would be
the moment to exchange sterling.
The extras - mainly taxes and fees of the notaire - are likely to be 11 to
13 per cent of the price.
'If you have any worries about the transfer, ask a solicitor who knows
France to spend half an hour looking over the documents,' advises Tim
Urquhart, of Bristol solicitor Osborne Clarke (0272-230 220); also London,
Paris and Lyon. But, in general, he thinks it is not worth instructing a
British solicitor for a property below Pounds 100,000. 'If two families are
buying together, forming a company (a Societe Civile Immobiliere) is a sound
idea,' says Francis. Otherwise, if somebody dies in a car crash the Code
Napoleon will apply and the property will be split up. Crabb &amp; Templeton
recommends making a will in France as well as the UK.
There is also the matter of health insurance. C&amp;T says that form E111,
issued in the UK, is fine for holidays, followed by E106 which is good for
two years. But, after that, you might not be covered.
If you are under 65, the best solution is to start paying into the French
social security system, which will look after 75 per cent of your medical
bills, with the rest covered by private insurance. But if you are over 65,
it is too late to join. And private insurance can be expensive.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Property: A listed 'planning blot' - Gerald Cadogan views a
house, fit for fictional detective Hercule Poirot, which could be an
enticing prospect for a fan of 1930s' architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new house was a blot on the landscape in 1931, an austere white fortress
on a bare Chilterns hillside above Amersham, Buckinghamshire. Inspired by Le
Corbusier, the Swiss-born architect, it contradicted the home sweet home
notions of Metroland (the suburban development of Middlesex and Bucks along
the Metropolitan Railway).
The planning authority gave permission 'with extreme reluctance' and the
locals called it the 'aeroplane house' because its long slabs of wall,
interrupted by steel-framed windows, looked like the wings and struts of a
biplane. Now, it is a listed building; indeed, it was a setting for filming
Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot television series.
The house was called High and Over, after a windy hill on the South Downs in
Sussex. A New Zealander, Amyas Connell, designed it for Bernard Ashmole, a
friend who then was professor of classical archaeology at University
College, London. Christopher Hussey, writing in Country Life, called the
building 'the conception of young men'. He went on to acclaim it as 'the
home of a 20th century family that loves air and sunlight and open country'.
Connell built it with a concrete frame; brick filling rendered with cement
and white-washed; and concrete blocks inside. Its utter lack of compromise
and clean lines must have reminded Ashmole of ancient Greece, one of his
specialities.
The two met in Rome when Ashmole was director of the British School and
associating with a lively group of artists and archaeologists such as Rex
Whistler and Barbara Hepworth (as he tells in his autobiography* which
appears on June 22, the centenary of his birth). The son of an estate agent
in Ilford, Essex, he was related to the Elias Ashmole whose collection is
the basis of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.
That background was ideal for a classical art historian, as he became after
surviving the first world war with wounds and the Military Cross. In the
second war, he volunteered for the RAF and found himself everywhere from
Shetland to Sumatra.
As Keeper of the British Museum's Greek and Roman department, his greatest
feat during the war was to pack up all its classical treasures  - including
the Parthenon sculptures - and hide them in an unused tunnel of London's
Piccadilly underground line. Years later, he was showing them to John Paul
Getty. And how much would they cost? asked the US billionaire. 'Even more
than you, Mr Getty, can pay,' came the answer.
Water fascinated him. Returning to Oxford as its professor of classical
archaeology, he lived first in the Old Mill at Iffley, where he built a
water system in the garden with a fountain basin cast by pouring concrete
into an upturned umbrella. At High and Over, he put up a water tower to feed
the swimming pool which he and the gardener dug out from an old chalk pit.
As it did not have planning permission, it was called a pond.
The three storey-high house was built as a Y, to fit the contours of the
bare hill and 'take utmost advantage of the scanty English sunshine' while
having a superb view of the Misbourne valley. It stood dominant on a podium,
and the design was a triumphant combination of intelligence and technology.
The electric lighting was behind panels of frosted glass set in the ceiling
in brass frames - as you might expect on an ocean liner. Upstairs,
washbasins were tucked into alcoves - again, like a boat - and the number of
cupboards was quite unusual. The front door was chromium-plated steel, as
was the stair railing.
On the ground floor, one of the three prongs of the Y was the professor's
study - art history needs space to spread. Another was the drawing room, and
the third the dining room and kitchen. The prongs met in a hexagon, floored
in black marble with a fountain, at the heart of the house and overlooked by
a round gallery on the first floor landing.
Most cunning was the second (top) floor, a flat roof containing the
children's play space (with a sand box plus concrete shelters with hooks for
hammock and swing) and penthouse nurseries.
The Ashmoles lived in High and Over until after the war, and the garden
grew. Today, the house is hidden by splendid trees (protected by
preservation orders) and it is hard to imagine what a threat it was to
Amersham 60 years ago. Beyond the pool, a wood adds to the privacy. But most
of its 12 acres was lost to development around 25 years ago and the house
was split into two - not vertically but with different wings and floors
projecting into each other, like a layer cake.
This meant many alterations, which obscure the Bauhaus cleanliness of the
original design. Partition walls have been put up and panel lights and
shelves covered over or removed. Even the fountain is under a fitted carpet.
Today, one part - which includes the hexagonal fountain room and the library
 -is for sale, with a guide price of Pounds 229,500, through Amersham agent
Peter Robson (0494-724 999). It could be an enticing prospect for a fan of
1930s' architecture. Tear down the new partitions and put back the detailing
 -the fountain and shelves and light panels. The result would be an austere
and sophisticated urban cottage, true to the vision of Connell and Ashmole.
And who knows: perhaps, one day, the two halves could become a whole once
again.
*Bernard Ashmole, An Autobiography, edited by Donna Kurtz, Oxbow, about
Pounds 18.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Travel: In search of the Japanese spirit - Christopher
McCooey experiences early morning on Mount Fuji
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MCCOOEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four o'clock on a July morning on the rim of a dormant volcano. It was dark
and chilly, the wind swirling out of the 700-ft crater behind me. I was not
alone, just one of hundreds gathering on the summit of Mt Fuji, at 12,388ft
the highest point in Japan.
Some people had slept for a few hours in mountain huts on the trail or at
the summit. Others, like myself, had climbed through the night and were
resting - conversing in low voices, sharing chocolate and anecdote in
time-honoured mountain tradition - and waiting for the sunrise.
Climbing Mt Fuji is more than just getting to the top of a mountain. For the
Japanese it is a religious experience, confirmation of their true Japanese
spirit, and to be there at dawn, to pay homage to the rising sun, is the
ultimate high.
The eastern sky began to lighten perceptibly as more and more parties of
climbers, some urged on with whistles and megaphones, snaked their way to
the top. Their progress could be monitored by watching their torches
swinging from side to side, following the trails below.
At this altitude it is necessary to rest every few steps as the final few
hundred feet are the steepest and the loose volcanic ash and clinker make it
very tiring: three trudges up, half a slide down, wheeze, rest, gulp for
oxygen, gaze at the stars. Altitude sickness, a red-hot steel needle
inserted behind the eyes and twisted slowly for effect (or so it feels), may
be a problem. If you are prone to this, take altitude pills.
Fuji is an almost perfect volcanic cone about 60 miles south-west of Tokyo.
On days when strong winds have swept away the pall of pollution that
inevitably hangs over Tokyo, a city of nearly 12m, the graceful mountain,
snow-capped in winter, can be seen from downtown.
The volcano must be considered dormant rather than extinct. Since 800 AD,
seven eruptions have been documented; the most recent took place between
December 16 1707 and January 22 1708.
It was in that eruption that the cone lost its perfect symmetry. There is a
hump on its south-east slope called Hoei-zan (san or zan means mountain in
Japanese, which is why Fuji is often called Fuji-san, or Fuji-yama, yama
also meaning mountain). Ash spewed out from Hoei-zan and covered the
capital, called Edo in those days, to a depth of 6in.
When I was there, Hoei-zan, at 8,864ft, was as black as spilt ink against
the patchy low cloud that hung wispily in the valleys below. I could make
out areas of coniferous trees planted in angular blocks on its slopes, and
then a huge area, lighter in colour, along Fuji's southern flanks.
This is a kind of tableland that was denuded of its forest cover when
Hoei-zan erupted. Today it is an area of open moorland used by the
Self-Defence Force as a training ground for its troops, tanks and jets.
Beyond that were swathes of lights from towns and cities, part of the most
dynamic industrial region on earth, the Pacific seaboard from Tokyo to
Osaka.
It had taken me four hours to reach the crater rim from where I had left my
car at the road-head. The trails are steep, but easy to follow. If you are
reasonably fit then a steady plod will get you to the top.
I reached into my rucksack for a sweater as the chill wind at the top
quickly nullified the body warmth caused by my exertions. I found a
sheltered hollow.
My wife had prepared onegiri for me, and I began to munch on the rice ball
wrapped in dried seaweed. In the centre was a pickled plum, tangy and sour,
and I sucked on the stone, enjoying its refreshing taste.
On peak summer weekends as many as 40,000 people climb Fuji. Like any
mountain area, accidents occur, and Fuji has claimed its share of lives.
Some Japanese have actually chosen this sacred mountain as the place where
they want to die. On the north side is an area of virgin forest called
Aoki-gahara, the Sea of Trees. One of the trails that goes from the base of
the mountain to the summit passes through this area.
Hikers are advised to keep to the trail as it is easy to get lost, and
minerals in the rocks cause compasses to malfunction. Japanese bent on
suicide drown in the Sea of Trees; they wander off the trail and get lost,
spending their last earthly hours on the slopes of their beloved Fuji. Each
year the police and the Self-Defence Force combine to search the area; on
average 20 bodies are found.
With proper equipment it is possible to climb the mountain during any month,
but in the winter it should be regarded as a serious alpine expedition.
Several thousand climbers are on the summit at dawn on January 1, to greet
the New Year.
However, the safest time to climb is during July and August when all of the
mountain huts are open. Even so, care is needed because of rock slides.
In August 1980, 12 people - mostly schoolchildren and elderly people - were
killed by a rock slide as they descended Fuji by the sunabashiri (sandslide)
on the north side. This is a large patch of volcanic sand, and it is
possible to get from the summit down to the car-park in an hour if you run
and slide.
The sky had changed from black to deep purple and was now lightening to
blue. The moon was a pale yellow in a panoply of silver blue stars and
orange planets and, tracking through them, a satellite. In the growing light
I became more aware of my immediate surroundings. The garbage that
desecrates the mountain is unbelievable.
Down below there were huge screes of rusting cans beside each hut; on the
trails were candy wrappers and soda cans discarded by climbers; around me at
the summit were empty boxes that had contained rice meals, smashed beer
bottles, orange peel, cigarette ends and wooden chopsticks used once and
dropped. It seems incredible that the Japanese venerate this mountain so
deeply yet treat it so shabbily.
At the summit there is a post office as well as numerous vending machines
selling sake and beer and soda. Snack stalls offer hot noodles at prices
reflecting the altitude. The toilet facilities are primitive. There are
souvenir shops selling charms and trinkets and, if you have a hiking stick,
you can get it branded to prove that you made the conquest.
It is estimated that just under half the 400,000 who climb the mountain
every year are female - which is only right when it is remembered that the
guardian divinity of the mountain is a female one: the goddess who makes the
flowers bloom.
I was lucky, for conditions were perfect the day I climbed. Thousands of
feet below, smoke-grey cloud covered the forests and rice fields, factories
and cities. High above, the thin shavings of cirrus had already caught the
sun's rays and were bright gold, while out in front a blood-red dawn seeped
perceptibly along the eastern horizon.
And then the huge orb of the sun rose majestically out of the mighty Pacific
to a chorus of 'Banzai]' . . . 'Cheers]' . . . 'Long Live the Emperor]' . .
. 'Long Live Japan]'
When to go: the mountain climbing season is from July 1 to August 31. The
mountain huts charge about Pounds 40 with evening meal and breakfast, less
without. The huts are spartan and very crowded at weekends. No camping is
allowed on Mt Fuji.
All trails are about the same in difficulty: steep and with loose rock and
ash. Try and avoid weekends, which are busy. Fuji does not require special
mountaineering skills in the summer season, just reasonable fitness and
perseverance.
A stout pair of hiking boots is essential, with gaiters recommended to
protect your ankles from the sharp clinker and help keep out the cinders
that work their way into your socks. Warm and wind-proof clothes should be
worn or carried as it may be hot at the bottom and freezing at the top. Take
your own food, snacks and drinks.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Travel: A hot and dusty road to the last place on earth -
Leslie Gardner wanders through Thrace to Tekirdag, in Turkey, a small port
with a literary history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edirne, on the Bulgarian frontier to Istanbul, at the gates of Asia, is the
fag-end of the Orient-Express route. Every morning a pink motortren sets out
from Edirne, roams Thrace, stops everywhere and reaches the Bosporus in the
evening. A ticket to Corlu (Tchor-loo), the half-way house, about 110 miles,
costs 55p.
Two rough-looking boys were my fellow-passengers. They looked over my
shoulder as I sat studying the map of Turkey. One traced with his finger an
east-bound journey, far across Anatolia, to Mus, near Lake Van. His native
town. The other went farther, into the mountainlands of the Iraqi border.
'You're a Kurd,' I told him. Both laughed heartily. I pondered the mobility
of Turks in their vast land where, to one side, the Danube pours her waters
and, from the other, the Tigris and Euphrates flow. The Grand Signior once
summoned teams of virgins from the distant provinces, in order to have
samples of every region in his harem. By the time the Lake Van girls reached
Constantinople, a third of them were mothers.
At least they were spared an ordeal by motortren. Racked with cramp from its
narrow, straight-backed bench, I needed help to disembark at the wayside
halt of Buyukkaristi. (A sketchy knowledge of a few nouns interpreted it as
either the resting-place in the birch forest or the town of wooden
saucepans).
It was an oasis of rank vegetation in a harsh landscape. Roses fought with
cabbages, all tossed in a red and green salad. Hollyhocks and begonias stood
like signals along the line. Canary creeper festooned the fountain and the
crossing-keeper's white two-roomed house.
He lay sprawled under his fig-tree, a burly old fellow in braces and uniform
trousers. Custodian of this single-track link between east and west (down
the line: Istanbul, Ankara, Baghdad; up the line: Sofia, Vienna, Paris), he
led a contented life, pottering among flowers.
He exemplified the wisdom of Candide's philosophy: 'Il faut cultiver notre
jardin.' The pink motortren had not been worth getting up for, but when a
signal clicked and the dark-green Marmara Express loped through like an
exhausted animal, he put on his pill-box cap and saluted the driver.
I took to the hills. When the rains arrive, Thrace will be a delightful
country with oak, mountain ash and laburnum in leaf, wild cherry in flower
and clear streams racing down sandy channels to the Sea of Marmara.
Until then it is dusty, lifeless and swept by a gritty north wind. I kept
stopping to empty sand out of my shoes. A young man and a girl in a
donkey-cart overtook me and, as everyone does in Turkey, urged me to climb
up behind. He scowled when I declined, but the girl understood and her happy
young smile was as good as a glass of spring water to me.
Short cuts across the sheep pastures were a mistake. My guide-book mentioned
'playful Thracian shepherd dogs,' but those I met had never learned to play.
The first whiff of a stranger brought them racing in a pack, snarling and
spoiling for action.
Pretending to pick up a stone sometimes disarms a cur, but not the curs of
Thrace. The shepherd, thank God, is usually not far away. You offer a
cigarette (which he examines as though he has never seen one before) and sit
with him in a cavity of the dried-up torrent bank, out of the breeze.
Off-duty dogs chew scattered bones, probably those of some previous
passer-by. You offer the dogs a share of your lunch of black bread and kazan
dibi ('bottom of the barrel'), the treacle pudding which the Edirne
pastry-cook rolled into a ball and stuffed unwrapped in your pocket. The
dogs respond with growls.
Near Corlu a tractor-driver refused to take No for an answer, so I rode into
town on his trailer-load of sunflower seeds, 'Oberj?' He pointed down a
side-street off the asfalti, the shining racetrack of the Athens-Istanbul
highway. 'Yok turistik,' he said - not a tourist hotel, therefore not a
rip-off. Picturesquely old-fashioned (they even provide bedroom slippers for
your dawn raid on the mosque), the Oberj Hatman was half as costly and twice
as elegant as anything I had known in Turkey.
It served no food or drink (it was impossible to buy wine anywhere in Corlu,
although the place bristled with drunks), but I discovered a sort of garden
restaurant called Atsubay Orduvei. The lamb rissoles and nightingales'
nests, the kebabs and dolmasi were nothing to write home about, but the
commissionaire snapped off a salute as I arrived and the coffee-boys,
balancing tiny cups on trays slung from silver chains round their necks,
trotted about smiling.
On a low wall across the street sat a dozen old women, veiled and silent,
like a row of black crows waiting to pounce on the leavings. I asked one if
I could photograph her. She fled whimpering. I put the same question to her
neighbour, who immediately uncovered and gave the camera a brilliant smile.
The 15 miles from Corlu to Tekirdag (Tekky-da), downhill all the way, take
about four hours on foot. When you come out on the low, lonely Marmara
cliffs you can strip, beat the sand out of your clothes, wash and dry your
socks and swim in a mild sea.
Tekirdag is a small port among the dunes through which sandy trails of
streets are cut. Hustled by the gritty wind, clapboard houses rattle and nod
over their buttresses of sand. There was no sign of a population until I
peered into the mosque, where a spotty youth in a tasselled cap was reading
from the Koran.
A bell tolled. Out of the municipal offices the clerks came running, down
the broad steps two and three at a time. Surely one among them spoke English
or at least French? Surely someone was aware of the literary importance of
Tekirdag, the spot that Voltaire nominated (possibly because it appeared to
him the last place on God's earth) as that to which Candide and Pangloss
retired to cultivate their garden? The clerks could not make out what I was
talking about. A garden? At Tekirdag, where everything lay under 6 inches of
sand? Before dark I had surveyed the town, upwind and down. There was no
monument to that profound and original French philosopher, no bulvari
Candide, no sokagi Pangloss. Army trucks slithered through, each vehicle's
radiator proclaiming 'NATO-FUNDED.'
A coach from Greece stopped at the waterfront fuel point, all its passengers
asleep and the radio playing Mozart. One by one the arc-lamps of the
coasting vessels at the jetty went out. Incredibly, the coasters seemed to
have been discharging cargoes of sand and gravel.
I button-holed a sailor in French naval uniform. 'M'sieur, you know of

FT  18 JUN 94 / The Nature of Things: Scientists on the ball - A form of
carbon shaped just like a football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What does chemistry have in common with the World Cup? Answer: great
excitement about balls.
The most significant molecule discovered in the past 10 years is C, the
football-shaped form of carbon known officially as buckminsterfullerene -
fullerene or buckyball for short. An astonishing range of applications has
been proposed for fullerene and related compounds: from batteries to Aids
treatment; better photocopiers to super-slippery lubricants; rocket fuel to
ultra-strong fibres.
But chemists are not just excited about the potential uses of fullerene.
They marvel at its spherical shape - more symmetrical than any molecule
previously known to science. And they are delighted that pure carbon - long
known to exist in two forms, graphite and diamond - can take a third form so
different to both of the others.
In diamond, the hardest natural material, each atom is linked to three
others in a three-dimensional tetrahedral arrangement. In graphite, one of
the softest, the atoms lie in two-dimensional hexagonal sheets. Fullerene is
a 'truncated icosahedron', one of the 13 Archimedean solids known since
classical times. Its 60 carbon atoms are arranged in a regular cage whose
sides consist of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons - just like a soccer ball
(which usually has the hexagons coloured black and the pentagons white).
But the scientists who discovered C in 1985, Harry Kroto of the University
of Sussex in England and Richard Smalley of Rice University in Texas, were
not soccer fans. Instead they named the molecule after the late Buckminster
Fuller, the American engineer who designed geodesic domes with a similar
shape.
The discovery illustrates the spin-offs that can come from 'blue skies'
research pursued out of intellectual curiosity. The driving force behind it
was Kroto's desire to understand the nature and structure of matter in
interstellar space.
Kroto believed, on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, that long chains and
other clusters of carbon atoms existed between the stars. To investigate
further, he convinced Smalley to join a co-operative project, using special
equipment designed by the latter to generate atomic clusters from a
supersonic jet of gas in a laser beam. They found that molecules with 60
carbon atoms were particularly stable - and proposed the correct fullerene
structure - but could only produce them in microscopic quantities.
As it turns out, fullerene is widespread in nature. Spectroscopic studies
show that Kroto's 'celestial spheres' are indeed almost certainly present in
interstellar space. On earth, tiny traces of C have been detected in
65m-year-old rock dating from the end of the Cretaceous era; they may have
formed in the cataclysmic collision with a comet that exterminated the
dinosaurs.
The breakthrough towards practical applications came in 1990 when Wolfgang
Kratschmer of the Max Plank Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg and
Don Huffman of the University of Arizona in Tucson discovered a simple way
of making relatively large amounts of C. They vaporised graphite electrodes
in a low-pressure helium atmosphere, producing a sooty black mist from which
pure fullerene could be extracted as a reddish solution and then
crystallised as a slippery yellow solid.
Within months of the process being published, many scientific groups were
making their own fullerene and today the material is available commercially.
For example, Dynamic Enterprises, a UK supplier, sells more than 99.5 per
cent pure C at Pounds 100 a gram - and an educational Buckybox kit for
schools to make their own fullerene costs Pounds 95.
As well as C, the Kratschmer-Huffman process produces smaller quantities of
other previously unknown fullerene-like molecules. Most common is an
elongated form, C, which looks like a rugby ball.
More exotic variants include buckytubes - fullerene stretched out
indefinitely in one direction - and bucky-onions - concentric shells of
successively larger fullerenes. Researchers at NEC, the Japanese electronics
group, have recently made buckytubes only a few millionths of a millimetre
thick but more than a thousandth of a millimetre long, and filled them with
metal atoms. They are the finest wires ever made and are potentially far
stronger than the conventional carbon fibres used in industry.
At the same time, scientists are making chemical derivatives of C by
attaching other elements to its carbon atoms. One example is a fullerene
with two water-soluble molecular groups attached to its surface. This turns
out in test-tube experiments to block an essential enzyme in HIV, the Aids
virus, and is a long-shot candidate for development into an Aids drug.
Another avenue of research is to make fullerenes in which the cage itself is
made of elements other than carbon. Japanese researchers are investigating
N, a buckyball made entirely of nitrogen, which would release huge amounts
of energy as it reverted to nitrogen gas. It could be a rocket fuel or
explosive.
But the first application of fullerenes may well be in photocopiers. Xerox
recently received US patents for a process to improve the resolution of
photocopies, taking advantage of the fact that carbon buckyballs are 1,000
times smaller than the particles in conventional toner. The company is also
experimenting with a range of coloured fullerenes for colour reproduction.
From the English point of view, fullerene fever is sadly like the World Cup.
We invented the game and now all the action is taking place elsewhere.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Travel: A cold night with a camel - Mark Hodson sleeps under
the stars in north-west India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Our drivers insisted that the opium was for medicinal purposes. The two men
were squatting round a camp fire built out of dried camel dung. Darkness was
falling over the desert and the cold night closing in. One man crumbled off
part of a block of unrefined opium, placed it on his tongue and slurped it
down with tea. 'Just to keep me warm for sleeping,' he said.
It was getting chilly. At midday, the Thar desert in north-western India can
feel like the hottest place on earth. But half-an-hour after the sun set,
turning the sky ruby and gold, we were pulling on sweaters and huddling
round the flames.
A friend and I had hired camels and drivers from a local village chief and
we rode for three days while our brains were cooked and our kidneys ground
to a pulp by the constant rocking motion.
The drivers were Rajput men from small villages dotted near the border with
Pakistan. Under bright turbans their skin was dark and their eyes bright.
They wore patterned slippers and handlebar moustaches and when they grinned
they revealed rows of gleaming teeth. One kept us entertained by singing and
chatting incessantly; the other, assigned to me, did not utter a word in
three days.
Around the camp fire the talkative driver, named Isra, banged out rhythms on
an empty plastic water bottle as his friend prepared dinner. There was
vegetable masala, dahl and unleavened bread baked in sand beneath the fire.
The camels rested nearby, neither sleeping nor lying down, just kneeling in
the sand, their front legs tethered. We opened a bottle of hooch bought in
one of the villages. It was a kind of murky rum made from sugar cane and
oranges and was surprisingly drinkable.
When he had eaten, Isra told us some tall stories about gypsy curses and an
imprisoned princess. Then he wiped the plates clean in sand and started to
make his own supper - both drivers refused any food until the drink was
finished.
They made up our beds on the dunes - three thick blankets each - and tucked
us in. We lay fully-clothed, watching the shooting stars until sleep took us
off to dream of lesser things.
The cold woke us in time to see the sun rise, and then we heard of the
night's drama. One of the camels had chewed through its tether and made a
run for it. Isra, who had to jog for an hour before catching it, laughed as
he told the story. The camel, now chewing nonchalantly on its breakfast and
with fresh rope around its ankles, looked unabashed.
The incident might have ended there except that it seemed to inspire a new
spirit of rebellion in the other camel, which decided that it had had enough
of me.
From the start it had been temperamental, the drivers explaining that it was
just seven years old and not yet fully broken in. But now it was snorting
angrily, and when my driver tugged a little too hard on its reins it turned
and spat the fetid green remains of breakfast over its owner's white shirt.
The politics of human-camel relations dictate that when the animal spits,
negotiations have reached a temporary halt, and we waited a few minutes for
it to calm down. Then the driver tried, ever so gently, to coax and cajole
it into action, clucking and blowing kisses as if trying to persuade a
kitten to come down from a tree.
The beast relented, and two hours later we arrived at a group of homesteads
where half-a-dozen men were squatting in the sun beside a field of millet.
They looked up with opium eyes, the same smiling nonchalant gaze that the
camels gave us from beneath their long curling lashes.
The men were swallowing opium with tea from white china cups and saucers.
'It is just to stop them feeling the heat,' Isra assured us. Another man
appeared from a mud hut carrying his young son. The boy's back was pitted
with infected bites. We had no antibiotics, so we handed over a bar of Lux
soap for which the father grasped our hands in silent gratitude.
My driver's silence, which at first had confounded me, now seemed ideal. As
we ambled through the stark landscape, the only sounds came from the creak
of the leather saddle and the camel farting and panting. Occasionally we
would hear goat bells but otherwise the desert was quiet. In a country as
loud as India, this seemed to us almost magical.
I was even warming to the camel, whose ungainly appearance - all teeth, neck
and knees - had at first put me in mind of a friendly Spielberg monster.
Camels can hardly be called intelligent, but their languid gait and the
dainty way they pick their way over the sand can pass for elegance. There is
no escaping one fact, though: of God's many wonderful creations, they are
surely among the most flatulent.
At the next village we arranged to buy a chicken from a man who then ran off
with our money, promising to deliver the chicken later. We rode for another
hour, passing wild peacocks and a herd of gazelle and two girls, their faces
covered with bright veils; on their heads were huge water jugs.
As buzzards circled overhead, Isra chatted with an old woman herding goats
some 20 yards from us. We set up camp on virgin dunes and drank milky
cardamon tea as we waited for the chicken man. It was an hour after dark
before he arrived with the bird, which was taken behind a cactus and
discreetly strangled.
The delivery man declared it too late to walk home and invited himself to
dinner - a chicken and vegetable curry - before curling up to sleep beside
the embers of the fire.
If he had felt inclined he could easily have found his way back, for these
men know every inch of the desert. On moonless nights such as this, lone
camel drivers cross the Pakistani border. They smuggle out silver and
bottles of rum, and return with opium and gold.
Across India, gold is highly prized and forms the core of every rich girl's
dowry. But something strange happened in the history of these remote
villages, where the man's family must now supply the dowry. When times are
hard, young men may roam the desert for years with only their camel for
company, trying to save enough money to tempt a worthy bride.
Isra was lucky. Married young, he was now 35 - though he looked 10 years
older - with five children. He works for half the year, taking occasional
tourists on treks, and in the hot season, when daytime temperatures
regularly top 45`C, he stays home to 'make more babies.'
On the final day we arrived at a straw shack where a young couple lived with
their two small children. In their tiny fenced-off yard were all their
possessions: a stove, some rusted tins, plates and cups, one goat. They sat
us down, made tea and offered us cigarettes, asking for nothing in return.
I gave the man a postcard of London, one of a pile I had taken with me to
India, and told him it was a picture of my home town. He stared at it for a
while, turning it over in his black creased hands before handing it to his
daughter.
The girl, who was about four years old, with cropped hair and a snotty nose,
looked at it blankly and then walked away, clutching it to her torn T-shirt.
As we left, I wondered what they would do with the postcard - pin it to a
wall, throw it away, try to sell it - and imagined, in my arrogance, that it
might play a small part in that girl's life.
Would she wonder about the place that lay beyond the edge of the desert?
Would it make her want to go there? In such small ways are lives changed.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Fashion: Simply made to measure . . . perfectly - Linda
Watson opts for bespoke tailoring when a good fit is hard to find
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LINDA WATSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Call me old-fashioned, but I like fashion that fits. I like shoulders to
flatter, the sleeves to skim my wrists, the waist to meet mine. All I ask of
a jacket is that it allows me to stretch, bend, and cross my arms without
fear of asphyxiation or the buttons flying off.
Maybe I am asking too much: at a mere 5ft, I am a size 10 across the
shoulders, a 12 across the bust, a 14 around the hips. As a result of this
odd - but not rare - anatomical equation the past five years have been spent
in pursuit of the perfect jacket.
There comes a point in every woman's life when she must concede defeat: in
the eyes of the fashion industry Ms Average is around 5ft 6in, with a
beanpole physique. Although an alarming 47 per cent of Britain's female
population is size 16 or over, it is not simply a question of weight - but
the distribution of it - which causes headaches for high street retailers.
Millions of individual nuances in height and shape are the root cause of our
clothes not fitting properly. To some extent this is catered for in
specialist sub-sections, namely the outsize, the tall, and the petite. But
what happens when a few of these categories merge? Pity the small curvy
woman, the tall outsize shape or anyone else who does not fall neatly into
mass market statistics.
Ironically, for all the technological advances in clothingmanufacturing,
around 50 years ago this problem did not exist. Firstly, I would have been
in the majority (Ms Average circa 1940 was shorter and curvier - no wonder
original utility jackets have always fitted me like a dream), but more
importantly this was the era before mass manufacturing. When people were not
making their own clothes, they bought made-to-measure.
Today there seems to be a psychological barrier against made-to-measure. For
many, the art of choosing clothes is frequently squeezed in hastily during a
busy day's appointments.
Lycra has a lot to answer for. How many women, I wonder, are regularly
purchasing leggings or stretch velour trousers (easy to wash and just as
easy to wear) instead of the tailored ones?
But elasticated fabrics and frenetic lifestyles cannot be solely to blame.
Harry Sargeant, one of the shrinking number of bespoke tailors and a member
of the Federation of Merchant Tailors, says: 'We've become incredibly lazy
about the way we dress. It isn't enough just to be willing to spend more,
you must take a keen interest in your figure, have a feel for fabrics and
know what clothes can actually do for you. A certain amount of imagination
is required.'
But it is not just jackets which are a problem - it can apply to any
clothing item which requires an element of fit.
To be fair, the high street retailer has met us half way. In-store
alterations are more widespread than ever. But these can only go so far. Any
nips and tucks carried out at the point of sale only tackle basic
discrepancies - shortening or lengthening sleeves, narrowing or extending a
shoulderline. What they will not do is change the structure  - re-align a
waist point, re-cut a sleeve, reshape a collar.
Contrary to popular belief, bespoke tailoring is not a no- go area for
women. While any tailor will tell you men make up the majority of their
business, many have a small percentage of female clients. Women often assume
that custom-made clothing means outlandish prices. In fact, it often costs
much the same as up-market, off-the-peg labels. A pure wool coat (with a
small percentage of cashmere) at Jaeger, for example, will cost around
Pounds 400. A bespoke tailor (not on Savile Row) will charge you around
Pounds 350. Even a top-of-the-range ladies cashmere overcoat, from Huntsman
of Savile Row, is Pounds 2,836. Its mass-produced counterpart averages
between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 2,000.
Although tailors work on a one-to-one basis - effectively cutting out the
middleman and the usual 100 per cent mark up - their profit margin is
minimal. You therefore get more for your money. Custom-made clothes last
longer: partly because the quality of cloth is superior, but also the
personal touches - hand finishes, hand pressing and hand stitching  - cannot
be simulated on a production line.
Even when the garment is worn out, the original pattern will be on hand to
make an identical copy. During its lifespan, a coat can be regularly
re-lined and repaired. Seams (particularly with traditional bespoke-wear)
are generous enough to be easily taken in or out to accommodate fluctuating
weight.
But most impressive of all, knowing Ms Average does not exist, tailors are
trained to take individual posture into consideration.
It is best to try a personal recommendation first and, when it comes to
traditional tailoring, look for a tailor who is a member of the industry's
governing body, the Federation of Merchant Tailors.
The procedure is straightforward: at blueprint stage in buying a jacket, for
instance, a few questions will be asked: Will you be wearing it in the
country? Do you prefer thinner or thicker cloth? Do you intend to wear it
with trousers or a skirt? Two prices will probably be quoted - one with, and
one without the fabric (in which case the customer provides it).
Price decided, you pay approximately one third of the total price, the rest
to be paid on completion. One, possibly two fittings follow before the
garment is finished.
In total, you will have to wait at least three to four weeks for your
made-to-measure jacket.
If this seems an eternity, you could buy off-the-peg and wait around 10 days
for any alterations. Alternatively you could spend the next five years
looking for perfection. No contest: I am off to the tailor's tomorrow.

FT  18 JUN 94 / A flight from the slopes: FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. This week they moved from Europe to North
America on their way to Chile.
In her hooded white jacket and white jeans, Lucy looked like something out
of Colorado's 10th Mountain Division, the war-time unit of American troops
trained to fight on skis, as we set off on a misty dawn to ski a hillside at
Hintertux, Austria.
Not bothering to change into our ski suits for just one run, we drove to the
nearest snow-covered fields, tried to avoid the gentians and hoped the local
farmer would not spot us.
Once again we were skiing at an unearthly hour in order to leave ourselves
enough time to reach a distant airport before an inter-continental flight.
Frankfurt was 350 miles away, and our Air New Zealand flight to Los Angeles
was due to take off that afternoon. If we had waited for the lifts to open
and gone up to the glacier, we might not have made it.
The skiing at Hintertux, the best of the Austrian glacier areas, had been so
outstanding that we were tempted to lengthen our stay: we made fresh tracks
in powder all morning.
Earlier, at Saas Fee in Switzerland, we were rescued by the ski school
director, Heinrich Kalbermatten, who arranged a ride on a snow cat for us
when the summer skiing area was forced to close because of snow and high
winds. Our driver, Urs Niederer, drove us like a tank commander in a
white-out to a point on the glacier from which we could ski our obligatory
mile.
Now in California, our traditional landfall between continents, we drove all
night across the Mojave Desert to Mammoth Mountain, passing Edwards Airforce
Base, where most of the Space Shuttles land. It reminded us that Fran
Newitt, our expedition co-ordinator based in Kent in England, has started
referring to us as her 'time travellers'.
Faced with an itinerary which grows more complex by the day, she has been
gamely trying to keep us on course. But even she sometimes has to draw
breath. Her last message to us included the memorable sentiment: 'I'm sure
there's a way round all these problems - if only I could think what it is.'
At Mammoth, Ivan Russell had horses, Jeeps and snowmobiles standing by to
help us get to the snow while the gondola was closed for maintenance.
Our daily outing on skis has been down Scotty's, named after a skier killed
on this trail by an avalanche in 1968. We pass a monument to him every time
we ski his run. We hope he would have wished us well.

FT  18 JUN 94 / How to Spend It: Little black swimsuit - Flattering swimwear
designs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to swimwear there is a beach version of the little black dress
 -the beautifully cut all-in-one black swimsuit. The perfectly plain black
(or navy) swimsuit is what one reaches for on all those occasions when one's
stomach is feeling less than flat, one's thighs seem a strange shade of
white and one wishes one had embarked on some . . . any . . . kind of diet
at least three months ago.
In other words, bikinis or supportless 1920s high fashion numbers are for
those whose morale in the figure department is sky-high.
But there is a half-way house between maximum coverage and high-fashion  -
and that is Sam de Teran. I wrote about her two years ago when her first
swimwear collection caused, if not a storm, at least a little flurry in the
niche world of swimwear. Today, she is copied by everybody from our biggest
chain stores to some very upmarket houses indeed.
Her trademarks are classic sober colours (navy, black, cream), skilful cut
(she believes that little legs or skirts on swimsuits are more flattering to
the average thigh than all those vulgar high cut-aways) and dramatic
cut-outs on the body.
This year sees a new collection which homes in on what she does best - lots
of support (she uses a nylon/lycra fabric which, while heavier than cotton,
also offers more support), dramatic simple shapes and flattering lines. She
has added more little skirts as they proved so popular and so universally
flattering, and includes one number which can be worn straight from the sea
to a restaurant, so demure is its little skirt.
Her prices are not cheap but then for the little black dress of the
beachwear world, it is possibly worth paying for better cut, better fabric
and a bit of pizazz as well.
Her prices range from Pounds 45 to Pounds 110 and the range can be found in
Fenwick of Bond Street, London W1; Way In and First Floor at Harrods; Lisa
Sterling in Manchester; Dickins &amp; Jones in London; Kendal Milne in
Manchester; and Frasers of Glasgow.
Lest the chaps feel left out, Samantha de Teran has a streamlined collection
for men - mostly in black and cream. With lots of bold (and flattering)
stripes they sell at about Pounds 60 each and for the moment can only be
bought from Bodyworks, 40 King's Road, London SW3.

FT  18 JUN 94 / How to Spend It: Roller-blading hits town - A fast-growing
activity that provides fun, exercise and transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forget the gentle swish of leather on willow or thwack of tennis ball and
racket. The new sound in the parks this summer is the whoosh of
roller-blades on tarmac.
Roller-blading has hit London in a big way - and it is not just the teenage
set that has taken it up.
Roller-blading started in Minnesota in the early 1980s as a means of honing
ice-skating skills during the summer. Then people besides sportsmen realised
it was fun and it became a more general activity.
In the UK it is just beginning to take off, whereas in New York
roller-bladers are everywhere. 'In New York it is a new form of public
transportation,' says Eric Reguly, London correspondent of the Canadian
Financial Post and once an ice-skating star. 'It is also culturally
acceptable - in most stores in New York you can go into a store on your
roller-blades; you could go to the most expensive restaurant and nobody
would look at you twice. Executives roller-blading to work in their Armani
suits are a common sight.'
Eric himself roller-blades in the parks in London but is more nervous of
roller-blading to work because of the traffic. 'In New York they are not
confined to the parks: they can be seen all over the streets and New York
drivers, having become used to the many bicycle couriers, seemed to have no
trouble adapting to roller-bladers. People do it for fun, for exercise and
for transport.'
He started in his early thirties having resisted it initially 'because I
thought I was too old for it but my doctor recommended that I took it up for
my back - it's great for your muscles and is good aerobic exercise without
damaging joints. Many runners and joggers who have been told to stop running
because of the damage it was doing their joints have taken it up.'
It is not difficult to learn and anybody who already knows how to ice-skate
should pick it up very quickly. The main problem seems to involve stopping:
ice-skating has techniques for stopping; but there is no emergency stop for
roller-bladers - only diving on to the nearest grass, or making a couple of
360-degree turns, or doing a T-stop (but that wrecks the wheels).
Lessons are available for those who do not know how to ice-skate. In London,
Road Runner, Unit 002, Lancaster Road, (c/o 253, Portobello Road, London
W11. Tel: 071-792 0584) will organise lessons at Pounds 10 an hour and hire
out roller-blades at Pounds 8 a day. According to Road Runner, most people
need 1-1 1/2 hours before they are ready to take to the parks.
The activity is refreshingly free of any cult clothing. According to Road
Runner 'baggy shorts, bright colours (we're a lot less cultish and much
jollier than the skate-boarding crowd), and loose tops' are all you need to
wear - apart from the equipment.
Road Runner says it supplies gear to all ages - from children so tiny they
can hardly see over the counter, to the 'gold card' set, well over
retirement age. 'Lots of middle-aged people love it because it is low-impact
exercise and much more fun than aerobics. This year we're also getting lots
of the City crowd - people who work in merchant banks and love skiing in the
winter are taking to roller-blading in the summer,' says Road Runner.
The most common injury is a broken wrist and wrist-guards should be worn at
all times, while knee and elbow guards are advisable as well. Bicycle-style
helmets are a further precaution.
Weekend FT sent Carmel Allen, old enough to see over the counter but a long
way off bus-pass age, to have a go. She loved it: 'I'd just come back from
New York where I'd seen people having great fun roller-blading at the
open-air disco in Central Park. I was full of enthusiasm but a bit
apprehensive and worried about losing a tooth or grazing my face. So I
wanted to take lessons.
'Road Runner provided the inestimable Sven whom I had to meet at the kiosk
in Kensington Gardens. I knew it had to be him when I saw this pony-tailed
blond doing some very fancy foot-work just by the kiosk. He was sweet as
pie.
'The first thing I wanted to know was how to stop - once I could do that I
was ready for my turns. Two hours whizzed by and by the end I was able to
skate off, waving good-bye, into Kensington High Street. I had one dramatic
fall when I put my weight back and fell slap on my bottom. Now I feel ready
to experiment further on my own.
'The thing I like about it is that it is such a happy sport. People smile
when they roller-blade. When I used to go to the gym it was much more
competitive. In the park everybody was encouraging me and clapping if I
managed a difficult turn. And since friends have heard that I have taken it
up I have had at least four roller-blading invitations.'
Most good sports shops sell roller-blades - a good pair will cost anything
from Pounds 85 to about Pounds 200. Wrist-guards and elbow guards cost
between Pounds 15 and Pounds 20 and knee guards are about Pounds 20. As for
the boots, the wheels and bearings are what really matter technically - and
if you decide you like the sport you can upgrade them later on.
Road Runner also has a branch at 127 Queen's Road, Brighton, BN1 3WB
(0273-774266). Many other sports shops supplying roller-blades might be able
to provide a teacher.

FT  18 JUN 94 / How to Spend It: For those who serve . . . - What to wear
for tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are those who still care about what they wear when playing sports such
as tennis. Tennis wear for chaps has remained reassuringly much the same
throughout the years with the only real change being a welcome trend to
longer, baggier shorts and looser shirts (if in doubt buy a size or two up).
For women, though, it has been hard in recent seasons to find much that
looked tolerably feminine and yet fulfilled the practical briefs. Strictly
tailored little skirts with rather butch shirts have become the standard
wear, whether on rickety public courts or Centre Court at Wimbledon.
Anybody wondering what happened to the sweet little tennis dresses of
yesteryear (the sort that Chris Evert and Tracy Austin used to wear,
remember?) might like to know that this year, soft dresses are back on the
agenda.
Ellesse, for instance, has created a series of long-bodied, low-necked
dresses with skirts which twirl prettily as you serve and run and which
would look equally good at the club bar afterwards. In white, with a canary
yellow skirt, in cotton and lycra, it is Pounds 110 from good sportswear
shops including Lillywhites.
Another name to look out for is Belfe, better known for its excellent
ski-wear - like many a winter sports orientated company it needs to fill in
the income gap in the summer and this it does with some very beguiling
tennis-wear.
There is a sleeveless dress made from soft white cotton with a pink or blue
and white gingham skirt. Pounds 59 from Harrods Olympic Way.
Finally, if dresses are what you are looking for, there is Desrosiers, a
British company which has also decided that this is the year to go a little
bit more feminine. In particular there is a cap-sleeved, drop-waisted
version with a pleated skirt edged with a floral band for Pounds 55. Also
from Harrods Olympic Way.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Motoring: The eight-seater that acts like a car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peugeot's new people-carrier, the 806, is just 2in (5cm) longer than a 405
estate and a full 18in (45cm) shorter than the old 505, a jumbo-sized estate
regarded highly by parents of three or more children. They know only too
well that to travel legally, safely and comfortably en famille with luggage,
you need three rows of forward-facing seats and a reasonable boot.
Cars with these are few and far between. The 505 and the equally spacious
Citroen CX went long ago, although Renault still has the three-row 21
Savanna estate. Otherwise, it has to be a multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) such
as the Toyota Previa, Renault Espace, Nissan Serena or, if you live on
mainland Europe, Chrysler Voyager.
The same criticism applies to conventional estate cars (Volvo,
Mercedes-Benz, Rover Montego, for example) having a pair of child seats that
pull up from the load floor. These face backward and children tend not to
like them for anything but short trips. Parents worry about their
vulnerability to rear-end collisions - with good reason, I would think - and
luggage space disappears.
For 10 years, the Renault Espace has been Europe's best-selling MPV.
Arguably, it is still the most stylish, but this week it came under assault.
Peugeot's 806 'monospace' MPV, which has up to eight seats, went on sale in
France priced between FFr139,000 (about Pounds 15,850) and FFr202,000
(Pounds 24,630). That is FFr5,000 to FFr7,000 (say Pounds 610 to Pounds 850)
cheaper than a comparable Espace.
The 806 - and its soon-to-appear Citroen, Fiat and Lancia clones - has been
a joint PSA (Peugeot-Citroen) and Fiat project because neither group could
have afforded to go it alone. For the same reason, Ford and Volkswagen have
got together to produce their own MPV, due for launch in 1995.
At the moment, the 806 is offered only with 16-valve two-litre petrol
engines, one of them turbo-charged, although a diesel follows soon (and,
perhaps, a V6 later on).
Unfortunately for British families, 806s with right-hand steering are at
least a year off although a few left-hand drives will be available before
then. Holiday-home owners who spend a lot of time driving on mainland Europe
might well fancy one.
The 806 has a well thought-out interior offering a family freedom of
movement. There are two normal front doors, two large sliding ones for the
middle and back row passengers, and a large tailgate. The seats can be moved
around or taken out as needed.
Getting in and out is particularly easy. The floor is flat, the gear lever
sprouts from the fascia, and the hand-brake is tucked away between the
driving seat and door. A high seat gives the driver an unusually commanding
view of the road.
This apart, an 806 goes just like a car. Trying both models in France last
week, I found them unperturbed by rough surfaces, nimble on curving, hilly
lanes, and pleasantly quiet at autoroute cruising speeds.
The 150-horsepower turbo-charged version was particularly lively and pulled
like a train up gradients. The 123hp non-turbo engine was muscular enough
driving two-up, although I suspect it might have to work fairly hard when
propelling an 806 crammed with people and baggage.
The ride was as good in the middle and back-row seats as it was up front
with generous leg, knee, head and elbow room. Standard power steering and
large exterior mirrors made parking this roomy, but far from bulky, car very
easy.
A hard-driven MPV will always use more fuel than a sleeker, more slippery
saloon but a sensibly-driven, non-turbo 806 should average 28mpg (10
l/100km) and the turbo 27mph (10.46 l/100km).
While in France, I also tried the latest versions of Peugeot's big luxury
car, the 605. This has had a modest, mid-life face-lift and has been given
two new engines: a two-litre, multi-valve, petrol four-cylinder and a
2.5-litre turbo-diesel with two balance shafts.
The 605 has not made much of a mark in Britain, one possible reason being
that it is easy to confuse with the cheaper and less prestigious 405. But it
is an urbane and very comfortable car with a superb ride and an enormous
boot. I thought the two-litre went well but the turbo-diesel was better;
higher gearing made it quieter and more relaxed on the autoroute.
Alas, the ultra-refined, 130hp, 2.5-litre turbo-diesel 605 will not come to
Britain. Executive-class car drivers in France do not mind manual gearboxes,
but most in the UK insist on automatics - and Peugeot does not have one that
can cope with the 2.5's huge torque (pulling power at a given engine speed).

FT  18 JUN 94 / Cookery: Count your free-range chickens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many cooks struck veal and chicken off their menus when details of intensive
 -often cruel - production methods filtered through to the public. The
resulting drop in sales led to farmers making extra efforts to grow meat
more kindly and the results are becoming available more widely.
Genuine free-range chickens have been available for some time at good
supermarkets and specialist butchers (although, alas, it is increasingly
difficult to find a chicken complete with its giblets). More recently, whole
free-range chickens have been joined on supermarket shelves by free-range
chicken joints - packets of breast, thigh, drumstick or wing meat that are
very handy indeed for quick and easy meals.
Veal produced by humane methods is also becoming easier to buy. The Quantock
system, a more humane method of raising calves, is a definite step forward
from the so-called New British Standard method and the intensive crate
system. Fully free-range veal is rarer than the Quantock variety - but it is
preferable and worth asking for. This is the meat of calves raised with
their mothers and slaughtered at the weaning stage, rather than grown on as
beef cattle.
Unlike intensively reared veal, which is anaemically white and fine-textured
but almost tasteless, the free-range meat is pearly pink and tastes like
very mild and sweet young beef.
SCALLOPINE AL BALSAMICO (serves 4)
Veal sauced with Marsala was a favourite entree of the late 1950s and early
1960s, and very good it was, too. I have replaced the fortified wine with
balsamic vinegar to give the dish a new lease of life in the 1990s.
Ingredients: 1lb (or just under) escalopes of veal (or escalopes of pork);
1oz unsalted butter; 3-4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar; 4 tablespoons stock;
3-4 tablespoons thick cream (optional)
Method: Heat a large saute pan until very hot. Add the butter and, when the
butter foam dies down, saute the veal in batches for 2-3 minutes on each
side (or less if the meat has been beaten very thinly). Remove and keep hot.
Add the vinegar and stock to the pan. Scrape and swirl the mixture around,
letting it bubble up and blend. Add the cream if using it, season to taste,
and continue bubbling briefly to make a smooth, very savoury sauce.
Turn the heat right down. Return the meat to the pan, turning each slice as
you add it to coat it with the sauce. When all are in, tip the contents of
the pan on to a warmed serving dish. Wilted spinach scattered with toasted
pine nuts goes well with this dish.
LEMON TARRAGON CHICKEN WITH COURGETTES (serves 4)
Ingredients: 4 small boned and skinned chicken breasts weighing 3 1/2 -4oz
each; 1 1/4 lb courgettes; 2oz unsalted butter; 2 tablespoons lemon juice; 2
slightly heaped teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon.
Method: Separate the small fillets from the chicken breasts. Then, slice the
main part of each breast in two to make two thinner slices. Cut the
courgettes into batons.
Heat a large saute pan until very hot. Add a little of the butter and, when
the butter foam dies down, fry the courgettes until streaked with gold and
just cooked through. Remove and keep hot.
Add a little more butter to the pan and saute the chicken a few slices at a
time until gilded without and tender within. Remove and keep hot.
Add the rest of the butter, the lemon juice and a teaspoon or two of water
to the pan. Scrape, swirl, let the mixture bubble up, and season with salt,
pepper and tarragon.
Turn off the heat but leave the pan where it is. Slip the chicken quickly
into the pan and turn the slices to coat them with the fragrant, buttery
juices.
Lay the meat on a warmed serving dish, tip the courgettes into the pan, and
toss to anoint them with the remains of the sauce. Arrange the vegetables
alongside the chicken and serve with new potatoes or basmati rice.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: New lease of life for an old grape variety -
Jancis Robinson considers the merits of Malbec when it is grown east of the
Andes, in Argentina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If ever there were an argument that every grape variety has its perfect
place, then Mendoza Malbec is it. In the rest of the world Malbec is hardly
one of the great grapes. Once widely grown in Bordeaux, it is now
effectively known only in Cahors, where it is called Cot or Auxerrois, and
generally turns out rather tough, charmless, essentially country wines - in
spite of the millions of francs poured into Cahors by well-heeled Parisians
and New Yorkers pursuing a vineyard hobby.
In the higher temperatures and richer soils of Mendoza, however, Argentina's
main wine-making province just east of the Andes, Malbec seems to luxuriate.
The wines it produces are lush, rich, heavily spiced and yet the best of
them have enough acid and tannin to make them appetising bets for long term
ageing.
Not that Malbec is at all revered in Argentina. It is one of the cheapest
red grape varieties, commanding considerably less of a price than the more
glamorous Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon - perhaps because it sounds less
obviously French, especially when spelt Malbeck, as it often is in
Argentina. And in the vast domestic wine market (about the same size as the
entire US), French names enjoy the greatest cachet, no matter how
irrelevant.
Carcassonne, for example, is the curious name of a popular blend of Cabernet
and Malbec, and its popular sister blend of Malbec, Merlot and Syrah is
called Pont l'Eveque, a particularly smelly French cheese.
Malbec's ubiquity in Mendoza doubtless militates against its glorification.
For long it was the most planted red wine grape (although a vine pull scheme
has led to its being overtaken by a grape called Bonarda, which may be the
same as California's Charbono).
Parts of Mendoza can be extremely hot, as witness the ancient plane trees
which flank so many of the main roads, but Lujan de Cuyo, to the south of
Mendoza city (with Vistalba the highest sub-district), seems to offer
perfect conditions for Malbec. At an altitude of about 900m (nearly as high
as Switzerland's highest vineyard, for example), it can offer suitably cool
nights even in late summer.
With unlimited sunshine and unlimited irrigation water from the Andes
Mendoza has been one of the world's most productive wine factories since
Spaniards and Italians settled here in the late 19th century.
Mendoza's major natural disadvantage is its minute annual rainfall of about
180mm (4 3/4 in) - 500mm is generally considered a viticultural minimum
without irrigation - of which about 150mm falls at harvest time, often in
the devastating form of hail. Growers just have to reckon on sacrificing
between 10 and 20 per cent of each year's crop.
Raul de la Motta of Weinert, 'the small winery producing big wines' from
carefully bought-in grapes, has made more than 50 vintages there and is one
of the few Argentines to recognise that Malbec might be the Argentine wine
industry's trump card.
'The whole world makes Cabernet, but with Malbec, our wines have
distinction. Malbec ages very well here.' He can demonstrate the gamey, wild
animal smells of young Malbec as well as the mellower, richer characters of
Malbec aged for more years than would be thought wise in France in the giant
old oak vats that characterise this wine industry ripe for renovation.
Weinert believes in blending Malbec, which with Cabernet forms about a third
of his delicious Cavas Weinert blend, exported to the UK and US, and most of
the bargain-priced Carrascal for the domestic market.
In neighbouring Agrelo, Moet &amp; Chandon has been experimenting with ageing
Malbec (and Cabernet, and of course Chardonnay) in small French oak
barriques, with aromatic, juicy, well structured results. They are launching
these new- fangled varietals in Argentina under the name of the winery's
first oenologist. Luckily, for marketing reasons, he was called Renaud
Poirier rather than Reg Pratt.
A new Anglo-Saxon name on the Argentine wine map, however, is Peter Bright,
the Portuguese-based Australian winemaker who has been cooking up some fine
blends on behalf of the British supermarket Sainsbury's at
Penaflor/Trapiche, Argentina's biggest producer, also based in Mendoza. For
long a champion of Portugal's rich heritage of native grape varieties, he
was quick to see the potential of Malbec, and Bright Brothers' Malbec 1992
Las Palmas, available at Pounds 5.45 in 60 Sainsbury's, is worth seeking
out.
Other forward-looking winemakers, who have discovered that Mendoza Malbec
has an affinity with small oak barrels, include Alberto Arizu at Luigi
Bosca, who is actively looking for importers for fine wines which include
his 1991 Malbec from 40 year-old vines; Nieto &amp; Senetiner/Valle de
Vistalba/Santa Isabel (exported to Switzerland); and Bodega Norton, into
which vast sums are being poured by the Swarovski family of Austria. But
that is another, extremely promising, story.
Sainsbury's Argentinian Malbec Cabernet is Pounds 3.49 and is even fuller
than the older blend it replaces next week (other Trapiche wines are
available from Grape Ideas of Oxford on 0865-791313). A few branches of
Sainsbury's also stock Cavas de Weinert 1985 at Pounds 6.95, but John Armit
Wines of London W11 (071-727 6846) has a wider range, including Carrascal
1985, at Pounds 94 a case. Berkmann Wine Cellars of London N17 (071-609
4711) imports Norton's fine wines, including a small quantity of an
extraordinary, recently-bottled Malbec 1982.
Booths supermarkets, Bute Wines of Scotland (0700-502730), Christopher James
of Exeter (0392-73894), La Vigneronne of London SW7 (071-589 6113) and Mayor
Sworder of London SE11 (071-735 0385) stock Argentine wines from Navarro
Correas of Maipu. Its Cabernet Sauvignon 1988 gives a great deal of
full-blooded pleasure for about Pounds 8.50. The importer feels that Malbec
is not a sufficiently well-known name to be worth importing.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Ch Climens - drinking well - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL, JANCIS ROBINSON and NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chateau Climens of Barsac has an average production of 4,000 cases and is,
in quantity, eighth of the 12 first-growth Sauternes, but is second in
quality only to Yquem.
Past vintages are hard to find in the UK but recently Threshers held a
vertical tasting of 10 vintages from 1991 back to 1980, with the 1976 served
at the following lunch. In spite of variations, all were very drinkable.
1991 - light golden colour, rich nose, already fairly well developed
flavour.
1990 - less colour, less aroma and taste very closed, but with fine
prospects for the future.
1989 - lighter in colour than the '90, but more mature, botrytis (noble
rot)(noble rot) on the nose and flavour. A typical fine Sauternes.
1988 - the first of three acclaimed Sauternes vintages, it was more backward
than the '89, with medium gold colours, restrained aroma, good currently,
not exceptional.
1986 - one of Sauternes' finest years. Good but not too deep colour, very
rich nose and botrytis flavour, fine balance, and long in the mouth.
1985 - lacking botrytis in a very dry year, but a charming, appealing
flavour. Perhaps at its best.
1983 - the first top vintage of the decade, luscious and rich, similar to
the '66.
1982 - difficult to taste after the '83. Fair, agreeable drinking, but
lacking length and character, parallelling the exceptional reds.
1981 - better than '82, agreeable drinking, but lacks character and botrytis
at best now.
1980 - very deep colour, lacks balance of acidity and so rather heavy on the
palate. The '76 at the lunch had medium gold colour, a very distinguished
bouquet, and luscious, complete flavour, the best vintage until '83.
Threshers lists the 1991 at Pounds 21.99 a bottle. Bottoms-Up offers a case
of six single bottles, the '91,'89,'85,'82,'81 and '80, for Pounds 180.
Seventeen privately-owned Pride of Britain hotels, including Michael's Nook
in the Lake District, Calcot Manor in the Cotswolds, and the Elizabethan
Whitechapel Manor in North Devon, have dreamt up an appealing offer for July
and August this year. For Pounds 75 per person per night, they offer de luxe
twin or double accommodation plus dinner, breakfast, and a bottle of Piper
Heidsieck on arrival. The only stipulation is that the stay must be for at
least two nights.
Three new(ish) eating out guides to look for. The first is Richard and Peter
Harden's clever adaptation of their exhaustive restaurant data bank, Good
Cheap Eats in London, which includes 400 entries, maps and lists and costs
Pounds 3.95.
The second, for the computer literate, is the software application of Time
Out's guide to run on Apple Computer's Newton MessagePad. It includes 700
London restaurants, costs Pounds 54.95 plus VAT, and is available from
Dixons, Ryman and John Lewis.
Finally, Maureen B Fant, an American who has lived in Rome for the past 15
years, has just produced a comprehensive guide to eating there entitled Eat
like the Romans (110 pages, Pounds 5.95 plus p&amp;p) available in the UK from
Great Wen Publications, PO Box 1500, London SW5 0DX, fax 071-370 4459.
In London, twin brothers Mark and Max Renzland have moved again and,
although Le Petit Max remains in Hampton Wick (081-977 0236), they have
resusitated Chez Max at 168 Ifield Road, London SW10 9AF (071-835 0874).
Open lunch and dinner with a set dinner menu at Pounds 19.50.
Two new West End eating places with user-friendly hours include the Atlantic
Bar and Grill, 20 Glasshouse Street, W1 (071-734 4888), which is now open
Monday-Saturday noon to 3am and Sunday 11am-4pm. And at 245 Shaftesbury
Avenue, WC2, a restaurant called Alfred is open Monday-Saturday 12-4pm and
6pm-11.45pm (071-240 2566).
Canadian expatriates might like to celebrate Canada Day, on July 1, at
London's Savoy Hotel, where chef David Sharland will be including Canadian
lobsters on a special menu. First courses will be Pounds 7.50 each and main
courses Pounds 13.25. The Canadian theme at the hotel will be running until
July 9. (071-836 4343, fax: 240 6040). Jill James When she was at Books for
Cooks in Notting Hill Gate, west London, Clarissa Dickson Wright was a
godsend for any London writer seeking help, corroboration or advice on a

FT  18 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Wine auction nets Pounds 1.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cellar of some of the world's finest wines was auctioned in London this
week for a total of Pounds 1.4m.
It took place at Christie's on Thursday and, with the auctioneers holding
320 different commission bids before the first of the three auctions
started, bidding was always likely to exceed the already high reserves.
Prices for the younger wines were considerably in excess of current retail
levels.
Most wines were bought by private buyers with representatives of the
American, Swiss, German, French and Hong Kong wine trade flying in and out,
some empty-handed. A leading British wine merchant, prepared to spend up to
Pounds 500,000, came away with two cases and calculated that the British
wine trade bought less than 1 per cent.
A private British bidder spent more than Pounds 500,000 on rare bottles,
including the first of two 'super-lots' for Pounds 340,000 (estimate Pounds
200,000).
Other record-breaking prices were: a case of Cheval Blanc 1947 at Pounds
18,000 (estimate Pounds 4,500); Haut Brion 1961 at Pounds 6,200 (Pounds
1,200); Gruaud-Larose 1961 for Pounds 2,400 (Pounds 1,800) and a case of the
rare Pomerol Le Pin 1982 for Pounds 3,300 (Pounds 2,000). Until recently a
bottle of this last wine was on the wine list at the Dundas Arms, Kintbury,
for Pounds 50.
At Sotheby's on Wednesday three Nebuchadnezzars (20 bottles-worth each) of
Chateau Mouton Rothschild, 1975, 1982 and 1990, were sold to a Japanese
buyer for Pounds 36,300 - seven times the estimate. Some 32 other lots of
Mouton raised Pounds 89,375: the first jeroboam (six bottles) of
Chapoutier's Ermitage Le Pavillon 1990 sold for Pounds 572 and bottles of
the Salon champagne 1979, 1976 and 1974 reached Pounds 286-Pounds 330 each.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Sport: Learning at Oxbridge - Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERESA MCLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One could perhaps be forgiven for wondering whether Oxford University's
outstanding success last year - 10 matches, two wins and eight draws in
their first season undefeated since 1900 - was partly attributable to a
revival of the sport-above-all tradition.
Seven of the 1st XI went to Keble, a college much more famous for its
cricket, rugby and rowing than for its books when I was at Oxford in the
late 1960s. And six of the team were graduates and experienced sportsmen.
But I was assured by Dr Simon Porter of Nuffield College, and hon treasurer
of Oxford University Cricket Club, that brains are what matters.
'Brains are good for cricket,' he said.
Mike Atherton today, and Mike Brearley in the 1960s, have both captained
Cambridge and England, and both always give the impression that they have an
idea in reserve while on the field.
So how valuable is captaincy? 'It's crucial. Clever captains win matches.
Ray Illingworth understands that; he did it himself. Away from university, I
know, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if he works well with Atherton,'
said Porter.
Atherton is at once a modern and a traditional figure of Cambridge cricket -
modern in that he worked hard and did well academically; traditional in his
captaincy and batting skills.
In the past, cricket often mattered more than academic ability in retaining
a place at Oxford or Cambridge. Ian Peebles kept a place at Braesenose
College, Oxford, in 1929 because he was playing cricket well for Middlesex.
Worried about his law prelim, he asked his tutor how he had done.
In his autobiography A Spinner's Yarn he describes the tutor's answer: 'He
eyed me with doleful countenance. 'You got 1 per cent in one subject,' he
said 'But you were not quite so successful in the others.''
Peebles was not sent down and took 13 Cambridge wickets with his
leg-spinners in the 1930 Varsity Match.
Today, students work hard at both. 'Some of our present chaps are
exceptional. They do two or three hours work early in the morning, play
cricket all day, then work two or three more hours in the evening. I admire
that. It only works with a good coach (John Lenham of Kent) to keep them
keen and well trained,' says Porter.
Strong batting and fast fielding, including wicket-keeping, have always been
undergraduate specialities, usually alongside uncertain bowling. I was not
surprised that most county cricketers picked out the youth and fragility of
university cricket as part of its appeal - probably because it can be
plundered for cheap batting points.
But Oxford and Cambridge hold up their weaknesses in defence of their
first-class status. 'Young players get a chance to develop in another system
besides the county system to help them learn the game,' says Porter.
But the reality is that university cricket is seldom good enough to compete
with county cricket. In 1878 Cambridge University beat the Australians and
clearly had plenty to teach anyone who was interested. No one would expect
Cambridge to beat Australia now.
Even so, Kim Barnett of Derbyshire was just one of several county captains
who mentioned Cambridge and Oxford as good teaching places for county, as
well as university, players.
He explained: 'We like to blood our younger and less experienced players
against Cambridge. It gives them a first class game in a friendly
atmosphere. An early fixture against Cambridge helps us to work up to full
power for the season.'
Oxford University v Cambridge University is the oldest first-class cricket
fixture. First played in 1827, it has traditionally had an air of glamour
and panache, like all cricket played by the two universities. This year's
match take place at Lord's on June 29.
But there is a danger that Oxbridge cricket could fall short of first-class
cricket, on the road to its own first-class extinction.
It is time Oxford and Cambridge helped their cricketers fight the cause of
university cricket. Variety is the spice of life and a variety of cricket is
the spice of a first-class summer.
Bring on the cricket-loving tutor, distributing practice as well as lecture
timetables.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Sport: Rivals become partners - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thirty years ago their rivalry was such that the American golfing public
decreed it to be a clash between the good guy and the bad, with Arnold
Palmer cast very much in the former role and 'fat' Jack Nicklaus in the
latter.
Of course, the sport's followers learned in time to shower an equal amount
of affection on Nicklaus.
For a start, there is nothing that America likes more than a winner and no
one ever won like the Golden Bear.
But it is only in recent times that their own personal differences have
eased to the extent that they could kindle a friendship. Now, wherever there
is a golf tournament, and in particular a major championship, the pair are
often to be found in each other's company and they will always play at least
one practice round together as partners. Perhaps they are making up for lost
time.
Nicklaus, with the nice line in deprecation he has developed since his golf
skills have diminished, puts it this way: 'Thirty years ago we played a very
competitive game against one another knowing that whoever won would
invariably win the golf tournament as well. Now we play a very competitive
game to see who avoids having the wooden spoon.'
These days of grace are slowly coming to an end, though, or at least the
public aspect of it. Palmer has already given up visiting Britain to play in
the Open championship; and at Oakmont, Pennsylvania, on the eve of the US
Open, he announced that this would also be his last appearance in the second
of golf's four majors.
It is an appropriate place at which to take his leave. It was in 1942 that
Harry Saxman decided that the 12-year-old Palmer, who was born just 10 miles
away at Latrobe, had already acquired enough golfing skills to experience
the glories of Oakmont.
By 1952, with Oakmont in the process of being split by the Philadelphia
turnpike, then under construction - seven holes on one side of the road and
11 on the other - Palmer had already begun building bridges between the
trad-itional game of golf and the modern.
Palmer was the sport's Elvis Presley; he introduced an element of dare and
panache. Palmer respected all the game's codes and discipline but he tore up
the unwritten laws about playing sensibly and carefully. Peter Thomson won
one of his five Open titles by never using a driver off the tee.
Such an idea was anathema to Palmer. His idea of the game was to hit the
ball as far as possible, find it, and hit it as far as possible again.
Even today, he is a superb driver of the ball. He can still hit it 250
yards. But there are vast areas of Palmer's game which betray the fact he is
in his sunset years. His iron play is poor, his chipping mediocre and his
putting downright awful.
What he has never lost is his enthusiasm for the sport. 'There are days when
I just can't do a damned thing right and that's hard for me to bear. But
this game, it's my soul in a way and there will always be something during a
round that will give me pleasure and start me back to thinking that I can
still play the way I want to play.'
At Oakmont on Wednesday, the fact that Palmer did not walk down the centre
of the fairways had nothing to do with inaccuracy. He had to talk with his
people.
They called him Mr Palmer and they applauded rather too loudly when his ball
finished 40ft from the flag.
Nicklaus was playing poorly, too. He won the US Open here in 1962, defeating
Palmer in an 18-hole play-off, and in 90 holes he had just one three-putt.
In his final practice round - alone this time - he had seven.
Nicklaus has also recognised that the game which made his name has moved on.
He has hinted that this could be his last US Open, too.
There were days when Nicklaus could not stand the sight of Palmer - the
player with the looks, the style and the support of the crowd. Now it is as
if he cannot bear the thought of turning up at a major championship without
the man he has finally learned to call partner.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Sport: Kind route beckons Sampras - Tennis / John Barrett
discusses the Wimbledon seedings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the men at least, the 108th Championship meeting provides an
intriguing mixture of certainty and speculation. Defending champion and
world No 1, Pete Sampras, is certain to start an overwhelming favourite.
The 22-year-old American has lost only five of his 54 matches in 1994 and
has won seven tournaments, more than twice as many as anyone else. Yet the
weight of history is against him.
Only eight times since the arrival of open tennis in 1968 has the men's top
seed at Wimbledon won the title and in the last 13 years it has only
happened twice. Furthermore, defending a title successfully has proved
surprisingly difficult.
In the 48 years since the war the only men to have achieved that feat are
Lew Hoad (1956-7), Roy Emerson (1964-5), Rod Laver (1961-2, 1968-9), John
Newcombe (1970-1), Bjorn Borg(1976-80), John McEnroe (1983-4) and Boris
Becker (1985-6).
Sampras should win. He has proved himself to be the best player on fast
surfaces and since teaming up with coach Tim Gullikson two years ago he has
matured as a match player. Yet no-one is sure how he will be affected by his
two latest losses.
When Jim Courier beat him in Paris three weeks ago, to prevent him from
holding all four major titles at the same time, Sampras was strangely
inhibited. He never fully committed himself to all-out attack. This, just
two weeks after destroying the field in Rome.
It was the same last week at Queen's Club. Although fellow American Todd
Martin did serve particularly well, there was a worrying lack of urgency
about Sampras' performance. Perhaps, all along, the champion was simply
pacing himself, conscious of the need to preserve his best form for the
coming two weeks.
The draw has been kind. Sampras starts against his neighbour in Florida,
Jared Palmer, and has as his prospective third round opponent Yevgeny
Kafelnikov. The promising young Russian was within two points of beating
Sampras in Australia.
Sergi Bruguera, winner for the second year in Paris, is cast as his
quarter-final opponent but the Spaniard has not played at Wimbledon since
1990 when he lost in the second round and may not reach his appointed place.
The only reason Sergi has entered this time is to get some match play on
grass before Spain's Davis Cup tie against the Germans at the new grass
court centre in Halle on July 15-17.
There are three men who might face Sampras in the semi-finals, the two
former champions Stefan Edberg (1988, 1990) and Andre Agassi (1992), plus
Martin. Edberg (seeded 3), is going through another bout of double-faultitis
and has No 14 seed Marc Rosset, as well as dangerous floater Wayne Ferreira,
in his section. He may not survive.
Agassi is as enigmatic as ever and lacks match play. Yet that has been true
for the last three years during which period he has won the title once and
twice reached the last eight. It will be fascinating to see whether the
unpredictable Andre has retained Brad Gilbert as his coach. I believe
Gilbert's methodical approach denies Agassi the spontaneity on which he
thrives.
The lower half is equally interesting. After what Courier achieved last
year, who is to say he could not go one better this time? Petr Korda is one
who might, or rather should. But the Wimbledon form of this big-serving
Czech left-hander has been consistently disappointing. Last year's advance
to the fourth round is his best effort to date. Perhaps he will surprise us
this time.
Another left-hander with a lethal serve could be Courier's next opponent.
But Goran Ivanisevic, who so nearly won the title in that dramatic final
against Agassi, is nothing if not unpredictable. Do not bank on him.
In the lowest quarter the two former champions from Germany, Boris Becker
and Michael Stich, are cast as quarter-final opponents, as they were last
year when they produced a gem of a match, won in five marvellous sets by
Becker. Let us hope we are as lucky again.
However, Stich has the most dangerous floater of all in his section. The
tall Dutchman, Richard Krajicek, fully recovered from injury, has just won
on grass in Rosmalen and could beat anyone, as he has proved on a number of
occasions. Martin (6) is in a different category. A method player, he is a
delightfully normal, well-balanced individual who was a finalist in
Australia last January. He loves the grass courts and last year beat
Ivanisevic and Wheaton before going down to Courier.
He will be better this time and his potential meeting with Agassi in the
fourth round is a mouth-watering match indeed. Also defending a title is
Steffi Graf. Just 25, the German is at the peak of her considerable powers.
Steffi has won the title in five of the last six years and on a surface
where no-one else excels she should have something in hand. Yet, as we saw
in Paris, the unexpected does occur.
Mary Pierce is not likely to repeat that upset. For a start, in only her
second tournament on grass, she lost to a 15-year-old Czech, Ludmilla
Varmuzova, this week in the under-21 event at Eastbourne. Then her first
opponent is Julie Halard, of France, who has played well on grass.
In the lower half Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the only other player who has
beaten Graf this year, has a difficult first match against the middle of the
three Maleeva sisters, Katerina. Then it should be plain sailing to the
semis and a meeting with nine-times champion Martina Navratilova. In her
last appearance, the 37-year-old Czech-born American will be given an
emotional farewell - whenever it occurs.
After seeing her loss to Meredith McGrath at Eastbourne this week, I fear it
might be someone other than Vicario who will end the era.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Lunch with the FT: Trading his way to the winner's enclosure
 -Michael Thompson-Noel meets horse racing's Robert Sangster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At its highest level, horse racing is an amalgam of glamour, money, hope,
elation and despair, with some madness thrown in. To succeed, you have to be
rich, tough, lucky and fanatically determined: four of the qualities that
have made Englishman Robert Sangster one of the world's most successful
breeders and owners of racehorses this century.
He has made a flying start to the 1994 European racing season. Already, nine
horses owned or bred by Sangster have won or been placed in European classic
races. However, at Royal Ascot this week he was right out of luck.
He calls himself a horse trader. He jets far and wide from his tax-friendly
Isle of Man base, supervising a bloodstock empire that stretches almost to
the South Pole.
I asked this 58-year-old about his workload. 'Well,' he said, 'in March I
travelled on 20 different aeroplanes. I was in Dubai, Ireland, four states
of Australia, New Zealand and the US, where I travelled extensively.'
'So you're tough?'
'I guess I am. I saw the doctor this morning, and was given a clean bill of
health.'
'How about stress? What is it like to watch a horse you own on the brink of
victory, or of a photo-finish defeat, in a top race like the English Derby
or France's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe?'
I asked this because I knew that in June 1977, when The Minstrel, owned by
Sangster and some partners, was bullied by jockey Lester Piggott in the
English Derby to win by a neck in a savagely dramatic finish, Sangster and
his trainer, Vincent O'Brien, had been reduced to jelly. In the years since,
Sangster must have watched hundreds of pulsating finishes in which much was
at stake.
'Yes, it can be stressful,' he replied. 'At this year's Epsom Derby I was
watching a TV screen as my horse, Colonel Collins, made his finishing burst,
and someone slammed me on the back and shouted: 'Robert, you've done it]' By
the time I'd picked my binoculars up, Erhaab (the 7-2 favourite) had charged
past my horse and won. Yes . . . something like that raises the old blood
pressure.' (Colonel Collins finished third).
I had arranged to meet Sangster at The Square, an elegantly contemporary
restaurant in St James's, London. In the event, he asked if we could switch
to Wiltons, a gamey, establishment joint in nearby Jermyn Street. We could
talk for an hour, then join a lunch being held to celebrate the wines of
Domaine Ott. Sangster has a house in that part of southern France.
I agreed. We chatted. Then we joined the all-male group that had gathered to
enjoy lunch (crab, fish, raspberries) at Domaine Ott's expense. It was an
amusing, powerful group. All were rich and sporty. Many owned racehorses.
One of them at our table was a young Tory minister from the House of Lords.
'Yes, my lord,' the waiter kept saying. 'Yes, my lord.'
I could not work out what the group was for, so I asked one of its members,
a City businessman. I said: 'What is the common denominator?'
And he said: 'Piss artists.'
In company such as that, the quietly-spoken Sangster merges decorously into
the background. He is diffidence itself. He could be a bishop. If you passed
him in the street you probably wouldn't notice him. But he is friendly and
direct, and says that he enjoys the social side of racing.
'The people I deal with - trainers, jockeys, bloodstock agents, fellow
owners - are all very good friends. At Royal Ascot, I and my wife entertain
30 different people to lunch on each of the four days, and I enjoy that.'
The value of the horses that have passed through his hands easily exceeds
Dollars 1bn. As a trader, he spreads his risks, and is always willing to buy
and sell. Worldwide, his bloodstock holdings include a great many
broodmares, yearlings - he keeps some and sells others - horses-in-training
and shares (usually a 25 per cent stake) in about 20 top stallions.
For example, he owns 25 per cent of the Irish-based Sadler's Wells (stud
fee: Pounds 125,000), which he describes as 'probably the best racing
stallion in the world'. There are 40 shares in Sadler's Wells. The last
share to change hands did so for Pounds 500,000, says Sangster.
'You're a dealer,' I said. 'You buy and sell. Suppose I had Pounds 1m to
spend. What would you sell me?'
The horse-trader smiled. He barely paused to think. 'All right,' he said.
'At this point in the English season (June 9) I've had three two-year-old
runners, and all three won their first races impressively. For Pounds 1m, I
would probably advise you to take a one-third stake in each of them.'
'Would that be good for you? You'd show a decent profit?'
'I would.'
'Would it be good for me?'
'It would. There is a chance, I'd say, that one of them will win a classic;
that the second will fare extremely well; and that the third - well, that
might bang a knee tomorrow and never be heard from again. But at Pounds 1m
for the three, you'd be all right. As the vendor, I'd want you to come back
 -to do business with me again. You'd be better off buying a Pounds 333,333
stake in those three than spending Pounds 1m at the sales in Kentucky.'
(Pounds 1m does not go far in racing. All three of these creatures ran at
Royal Ascot, and none won, though Helmsman was only narrowly beaten. One of
them, General Monash, was injured).
'Do you bet?' I asked Sangster.
He was born to wealth, and is an expert on betting. He inherited Vernons
Pools, a business that takes bets on soccer matches, before selling it to
Ladbroke, and was involved in setting up large-scale lotteries in Australia
and New York. He sold Vernons five years ago because, he says, he heard the
authorities were considering a national lottery in Britain. They were: it
starts in a few months, and is expected to knock pools-betting for six.
'Yes,' he said, 'if I go racing I'll have a bet for fun.'
'What, to you, is a big bet?'
'A monkey: Pounds 500.'
'You're successful?'
'I show a profit once in three years. I could make a profit every year, but
I'd be very boring about it. I would probably only have five bets in the
year, and only two would win, but I would show a great profit.'
The speculative madness that infects the racing game in cycles can be gauged
from the roller-coaster fluctuations in bloodstock prices, whether for
yearlings sold at auction or for stallions being floated on the
international market.
For instance, in 1984-85, when the racehorse market was in frenzy,
Sangster's bloodstock empire was estimated, by accountants, to have been
worth almost Dollars 350m. By 1992, values had crashed, and Sangster's
empire had shrunk in value to Dollars 160m or so.
Values are recovering now. I asked the master horse-trader how his fortunes
stood.
'It's difficult,' he said. 'Until you come to sell something - a horse or a
painting - you don't know what it is worth. But the whole bloodstock
industry today is reckoned to be worth a quarter of what it was worth in the
early 1980s. In 1992, after an intense campaign to extract maximum value for
him, I sold one of my horses, Rodrigo de Triano, to Japan for Dollars 6m,
whereas 10 years previously I had sold Assert, a fairly similar sort -
similar breeding, the same sort of racehorse - to Kentucky for Dollars 24m.
'If I was selling Rodrigo today, he'd probably be worth Dollars 10m. In the
early 1980s, 50 yearlings would have been sold at international auction for
Dollars 1m-plus each. Today, it is only eight or nine.'
As a horse-trader, one of Sangster's attributes is memory-power. Others:
shrewdness and competitiveness. And he still studies hard: still pores over
racehorse pedigrees and other data.
If you were interested in the glam-mad world of international racing, you
would be delighted by his company. If you knew nothing about racing, his
stories would make your eyes pop.

FT  18 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Smart money backs South Americans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the next month, I plan to drub Britain's bookmakers until they weep,
writes Michael Thompson-Noel. Betting-wise, an event like the World Cup
requires a well-laid strategy, adroit money-management, a close watch on the
odds - and luck.
I am making title-winning bets only, and ignoring dangerous exotica such as
match, group and each-way betting, or who scores first in US vs Switzerland.
Current strategy: South America.
Bets struck: Pounds 70 on Colombia to win the tournament, at 9-1; Pounds 60
Brazil, 3-1; and Pounds 20 Argentina, 10-1. Colombia would be a big winner,
with a net overall profit of more than 300 per cent. For now, the other two
bets are savers.
First crunch date: start of the second round, on July 2.

FT  18 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Italy and Ireland stir up Big Apple's ethnic
passion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most eagerly awaited clashes of the World Cup first round, Italy
vs Ireland - today, in New York - is stirring passion and debate, especially
in Irish-American pubs and in Italian-American coffee shops.
'We'll beat (Italy) 2-0,' said Eamon Moyna as he sat on a stool in Grahams,
a bar in Kearny, New Jersey. A native of Ireland, Moyna is one of many in
Kearny who follow the Irish team fervently. He is also one of the lucky ones
with tickets.
Not far from Moyna sat Gerry Durning. Although he is a Scot, Durning
supports Ireland. 'The Irish lads have hearts like lions,' he said. 'The
Italians are all prima donnas.' But he agreed that the heat wave in the area
could help Italy. A temperature of around 32`C is expected.
Italian-Americans sitting at tables at the Caffe Intermezzo said they were
betting on the heat to wear down the Irish players. 'What do the Irish know
of heat?' asked Piero Santini. 'The weather, it is in our favour.'

FT  18 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: A global game for a global market - The
sponsors spreading the soccer gospel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Corporate America has a long history of pouring millions of dollars into
professional sports, either through direct sponsorship, television
advertising or marketing tie-ins. As a result, when the US won the right to
stage soccer's 1994 World Cup, there were plenty of big companies eager to
sign up as sponsors of the event.
The fact that the World Cup is a tournament of soccer, a game with an
extremely low profile in the US and largely absent from its TV sets,
mattered little to American companies, because the event was never expected
to draw a particularly large or enthusiastic domestic audience.
Instead, the event's lure was the opportunity for US companies to win
exposure to the vast global audience expected to follow every pass, tackle
and goal of the month-long competition. For corporate America, World Cup
football offered the chance to reach the parts that mainstream US team
sports - baseball, basketball, ice hockey and American football - rarely
reach: South America, Europe, Africa and the far east.
It was access to this football world beyond the US that persuaded seven US
companies to spend a reported Dollars 20m on official sponsorship rights to
World Cup '94. They were: Coca-Cola, General Motors, Gillette, MasterCard,
McDonald's, M&amp;M Mars and the battery maker Energizer (owned by Ralston
Purina).
For US companies with extensive business interests in many overseas markets,
the potential worldwide TV audience was the chief attraction. The largest
audience ever garnered by the Super Bowl of American football, the showcase
of American sports, is 750m people. In contrast, more than 2bn people
watched the soccer World Cup final in Rome four years ago. In 1990, the 52
games in Italy drew a cumulative audience of more than 30bn. That is a lot
of car owners and hamburger eaters.
Aside from the official sponsors, another seven US companies (American
Airlines, Budweiser, Electronic Data Systems, ITT Sheraton, Sprint, Sun
Microsystems and Upper Deck Trading Cards) have paid several million dollars
each to become marketing partners of the event, and dozens more have signed
up with the tournament as official product, service and equipment providers,
regional supporters and licensees.
More than 50 large US companies have paid the international and US football
authorities at least Dollars 250m in fees to earn the right to associate
their products with the World Cup.
Although soccer is a minor professional sport in the US, several of the
sponsors for this year's event are not new to the World Cup. Gillette's
involvement with the tournament dates back to 1970, Coca-Cola has been a
World Cup sponsor since 1978, and General Motors was involved with the
tournament in Mexico in 1986.
For sponsors like these, the diversity of the global audience is at the core
of the World Cup's appeal, whether the event is being held in the US, Europe
or South America.
General Motors, for example, plans to advertise its cars and trucks on
advertising boards placed around the pitches, but the boards will display
different makes and models of GM vehicles according to which teams are
playing in which game.
In a game featuring Germany, for example, GM will use its boards to sell
Opel, its chief European brand. When Brazil or Mexico are playing, the
boards will display the name of Chevrolet, GM's Latin American brand.
McDonald's - which sells an identical product the world over - plans to
treat viewers in Norway, Greece, Nigeria, South Korea and Colombia as a
single market by broadcasting the same commercial - identical everywhere
save for the language of the voiceover.
As for sports-loving Americans who normally show little interest in
professional soccer, the tournament's sponsors are hoping that promotional
events in local markets where the games are being played - combined with
media coverage and the excitement generated by the presence of a huge
international sporting event - will help to pique the interest of even the
most dedicated baseball fan.

FT  18 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Norwegians suffer blackout amid arctic night
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   REINE, NORWAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
There is no part of the world, it seems, untouched by World Cup madness and
the financial leverage such madness brings, reports Nicholas Woodsworth from
Reine, Norway.
Earlier this week, north of the Arctic Circle, in Norway's Lofoten Islands,
the villagers of Reine received a nasty surprise. Just days before Norway
was to play its first World Cup Group E match - against Mexico, tomorrow,
Norway's first World Cup match in 56 years - NRK, the Norwegian national
television network, went on strike.
Down by the docks, in the Gammelbua bar and restaurant, there have not been
such rumblings since the introduction of the EU cod quota. (The flairful
Norwegians were partly responsible for the England team's failure to qualify
for this year's World Cup finals).
'It is absolutely disgusting,' said Bent Henriksen. Like most villagers
here, Henriksen owes his addiction to soccer to the six-month-long arctic
night.
'The timing of this strike is no mistake. The last time NRK did this was the
World Cup in Italy; we had no sound until the semi-final. But when your own
country is involved, that is dirty play.'
How much does soccer mean to an isolated arctic island of fishermen? A lot,
says Henriksen.
The season is short, and the Reine junior team have to dig their pitch out
of the snow in May. In Bodo, 3 1/2 hours away by boat, the grass in the
municipal stadium grows only because of electrically-heated cables beneath
the sod. The Bodo team hold the Norwegian First Division Cup.
No mere strike, then, is going to stop Reine from watching World Cup action.
In case NRK's pictures do not arrive, the Gammelbua bar and restaurant has
sent off an order to the mainland for the express delivery of a large screen
and satellite dish to receive German television.
The management is confident that large crowds of desperate fans - plus
increased beer sales - will cover the cost.
Most Norwegians believe that if their team can overcome Mexico in their
opening match, they may even stand a chance against Italy next Thursday. The
real fear, though, is that the satellite dish will not arrive on time.
If that happens, there will be little warmth or cheer in the midnight sun of
Reine this summer.
The team doctor said that, as things stand now, all 22 of Norway's players
should be in shape for their opening game, despite an injury scare after
midfielder Oyvind Leonhardsen injured his right knee in training on
Thursday.

FT  18 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Stage ready for stars to shine - Peter Berlin
in New York wonders which of the world's great players will dominate the
finals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AMONG the tantalising prospects of the World Cup finals is the debut on a US
stage next Tuesday of an unlikely character: Diego Maradona, missionary.
North American newspapers and magazines have been packed with handy guides
to the soccer basics. Often, these previews were decorated with pictures of
Argentina's Maradona scoring by punching the ball over England's earth-bound
goalkeeper Peter Shilton in the 1986 World Cup - helped, claimed the cheeky
Argentine star, by the Hand of God.
In the US, partly for the wrong reasons, Maradona is the world's best-known
soccer player. Over the next four weeks, therefore, it is up to him to
spread the faith among the unbelievers - starting (if he is picked) in
Tuesday's match against Greece in Boston.
As ever, the World Cup finals will provide an important measure of world
soccer's health. They may also reveal something about the US. Is it closer
culturally to its neighbours in South America, or to western Europe? Players
and fans, superstitious as ever, are fretting for an answer.
Western European teams have won seven of the eight World Cups held in
western Europe but none of the six held in South America. When the trophy is
hoisted into the air in Los Angeles on July 17, we will know whether it is
easier to vault the Rio Grande than the Atlantic.
In the last 20 years, South American World Cups have been better than those
in Europe. The 1970 competition in Mexico drew its tone from the dazzling
victors, Brazil. Argentina, the hosts, won with attacking play in 1978.
Mexico, in 1986, was adorned by France, Denmark, the USSR, Brazil - and
Argentina's Maradona at his peak.
In Italy four years ago the style was set by the first and last matches,
both of which produced more sendings-off than goals and in both of which
defensive muscle triumphed over attacking skill.
Cameroon, who won the opening match, and Argentina, who lost it, were the
successes of the competition. More talented teams could not beat them. They
were only undone by the number of players penalised by red and yellow cards.
But Latin American World Cups are not always good. It might simply be that
recent World Cups in South America have coincided with richer-than-usual
crops of that most easily damaged commodity: the soccer star.
In 1990, the tournament was almost devoid of new stars. This time, things
could be much better. Alfio Basile, the Argentine coach, says that Maradona
 -who has scored almost as many goals for his country as his team-mates
combined - is in good form. This could be a bluff. But even unfit, Maradona
is a useful psychological weapon, as he showed in Italy, and could be a
decoy for Argentina's fresh attacking talent.
While the troubles of the last few years may have damaged Maradona's
waistline and psyche, the enforced rest will have given his tattered knees
the chance to recuperate a little. Four years ago, Maradona was unable to
shoot. That will be a test of his fitness in the US.
Even if Maradona is unable to establish a place for soccer in the hearts of
American sports fans, there are plenty of potential stars in the making. The
most likely candidates are players, like Maradona in 1986, in their middle
or late 20s who have been to the World Cup finals before. There is a gang of
such players.
If Tomas Brolin can reproduce his 1990 form, and if his Swedish team-mates
play well around him, he will come to the fore. The same applies to Enzo
Scifo of Belgium, who, at 28, is playing in his third World Cup, and the
temperamental Gheorghe Hagi, 29, of Romania. Both played well in Italy. Now,
both have better attackers in front of them to help make their creative work
shine.
Colombia's Carlos Valderrama, 32, is in the same position. In Italy his
passing was often decorative rather than dangerous. This time he has the
explosive Faustino Asprilla to pass to.
Asprilla is one of a crop of bad-tempered strikers who will catch the eye
one way or another in the US. Others include the Barcelona team-mates
Romario of Brazil and Hristo Stoichkov of Bulgaria.
If the Dutch are to match the glories of their past, Dennis Bergkamp will
need to rediscover his best form. And, whatever Basile says about Maradona,
Argentina's best hopes rest on the striking power of Gabriel Batistuta and
the sinewy mid-field play of Fernando Redondo.
Almost every team has potential stars. The question is whether they will be
given a chance to shine. Four years ago, intimidating defenders generally
held the upper hand over attackers - although, as Cameroon demonstrated,
there is no reason why a team cannot defend thuggishly and attack
artistically.
Anyone who still cherishes illusions about the innocence of Cameroonian
tactics should avert their gaze when they play Brazil in San Francisco next
Friday. That match should indicate the direction of these World Cup finals.
If the Brazilians are able to play at their best, it is difficult to imagine
how American sports fans could fail to be captivated.

FT  18 JUN 94 / As They Say in Europe: Free votes in an ideal election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those interested in Europe or elections, European elections are a dead
loss. There is no meaningful result and people 'don't know what they are
voting for'. For the political philosopher, however, they are a goldmine.
The cryptic cartoon in El Pais last Monday showed a book written by Rousseau
and other savants entitled 'All elections are general'. The International
Herald Tribune said all elections were local.
In fact, the European poll provided the platonic ideal of an election. How
would you vote if you were not constrained by fears of the result? How would
you vote if greed and self-interest played no role and your sole aim was to
reward virtue and punish vice? Thus the British were able to do what they
told the country's credulous opinion pollsters they would do in 1992. They
voted for the party that promised more money for the National Health
Service, and against the government. The Dutch voted for the party they
chucked out last month because it wanted to curb the country's bloated
welfare services.
The Germans, unimaginatively, used the occasion to vote as they always do;
the Italians to express their faith in their new Duce and his 'post fascist'
hangers on. The Spanish showed that they really disapprove of corruption and
the Belgians chose their esoteric mosaic of parties which ensures every
government in Brussels is the same.
As usual the British, modestly, and the French, spectacularly, provided the
drama. The French, however, took most advantage of the unusual opportunities
offered by Euro-voting. As Liberation remarked: 'The European elections are
always more exciting after the vote than before.' There was huge support for
symbolic candidates. Thus Phillipe de Villiers and Sir James Goldsmith
gained an eighth of the vote for their anti-Brussels, anti-free trade
campaign which suggested that peace, prosperity and full employment would
reign again in France once prohibitive tariffs were placed on imports of
Indonesian underpants.
Bernard Tapie, the businessman arraigned on corruption charges and master of
the Marseilles football team, also did well, largely thanks to the
under-25s. As Liberation pointed out, Tapie represented the divisions
between the official left and ordinary voters while de Villiers 'chewed up
the heart of the electorate of the right'. So the Euro-vote in France
resurrected ancient reflexes and anointed the fashionable rebel. There is
little room in a normal, general election for Bonapartism and glamorous
rascals.
Such attractive opportunities do not exist in any election in Germany. There
the occasion was taken seriously, but not seriously enough, and the
Frankfurter Allgemeine had to issue its standard indictment: 'The difficulty
of direct elections to the European Parliament is as always that the voters
have no basic understanding of what they are voting for. There are not the
usual alternatives of 'government and opposition'.' It lamented the lack of
what it called 'European parties'.
The trouble with such a notion is that it would allow no room for diversity.
Anti-Euro forces are powerful in most countries but in each case they resent
different aspects of the Union - usually those which make membership
acceptable to sceptics elsewhere. A cross-border Eurosceptic party would
make as much sense as a cross-border Nazi party. It would exist to fight
itself.
German gloom was taken to its logical conclusion by the Suddeutsche Zeitung:
'The Social Democrats lost, the Free Democrats lost, the Bonn coalition
lost. The Red-Green Alternative lost no less and finally Europe lost. For
Europe was discussed, before the poll and afterwards, as little as in a
domestic election.'
This was a universal complaint. But the paradox is that the day is coming
when European issues will dominate domestic elections. As people catch on to
how much Brussels and the European parliament matter they will look more to
their national governments to defend their national interests. I look
forward to reading diatribes on the way national issues have become
'submerged in ill-informed debates about the 'future of Europe'.'

<TEXT>
The headman wanted a translation. 'It's the eyes. Just watch. She never
blinks.' Satellite TV is illegal in Malaysia. But the more remote you are
the more the outside world intrudes.
Here, in the centre of Borneo, sitting in a tribal longhouse with shrunken
heads hanging on the wall, surrounded by dense jungle, headman Long Lihan
and I watch American TV news.
Long Lihan has tattoos on his feet, legs and arms. His mighty ears have big
gaps pierced in them. His face is like a collapsed football, wrinkled,
toothless and warm. He peers at the screen. 'What strange people. Do they
take drugs?'
Long Lihan's longhouse is 500km upriver from Sarawak's coast. At Sibu, near
Sarawak's coast, I'd climbed on board the Wah Wah. It was more a torpedo
than a boat. With engines kicking out 700-horsepower the Wah Wah sliced its
way up the Rejang river for five hours.
An on-board video showed a programme on how to take care of office plants. I
tried to read The Field Book of a Jungle-Wallah, written nearly a century
ago by a senior official of the Brookes, the White Rajahs of Borneo.
Journeys were more peaceful in those days.
'On a sandy point, a 100 yards or so away, my Chinaman is conjuring back
into life last night's fire . . . around me I hear the cry of awakened
beasts, the whistles and calls of many birds, the high treble of insects,
many varying voices.'
The only sounds I hear are talk of bio-feed for the potted plants and the
roar of Wah Wah's engines. But there had been plenty of excitement along the
way.
Journalists are not very welcome in Sarawak. The state feels too many
negative articles have been written about the logging industry and the
depletion of the tropical rain forests. Officials have become incensed as
foreign environmentalists have taken up the cause of jungle dwellers
protesting about the destruction of their homelands.
Outside the hotel in Kuching, Sarawak's capital, there was a whirring of
film. A rather inept special branch man was whistling nonchalantly round,
taking pictures behind his back. His camera must have been made from
rejected East German tractor parts. I think he got a good shot of my socks.
At the hotel in Sibu a Canadian psychiatrist insisted that I should consider
treatment. I should monitor my behaviour. We travelled upriver together. The
whole time, she talked about the Yukon.
The rule of the Brookes went little further than Belaga, a town of about
2,000 on the upper reaches of the Rejang river. From here I needed to
charter a boat to get into longhouse country. Upriver people drink a lot. A
deal was done over glasses of 'Brandi Coke' (Crocodile brand), a
paint-removing liquid sold at the local store.
Four more hours upriver. We stop at one longhouse. It is more than 200
metres long. Some 550 people live here, consisting of 92 families.
There is more drinking, this time of tuak, the local rice wine, poured out
of what looks like a petrol tin.
'We must go to see Long Lihan,' says the boatman. 'It is only a few minutes
upriver, over the rapids.' I choke on the tuak. 'Do you really think we
should . . . perhaps I had better stay here?'
No. Not to see the headman would be a serious insult. There is no choice.
Soaked and mildly sozzled, I clamber into the longboat.
We leap the rapids and cross whirlpools. The engine roars and stutters. The
rain lashes down. Then, around a river bend, peering ridiculously through
the pitch dark night, there is a set of fairy lights. Long Lihan's house. A
kingdom all on its own. He has his own generator - and satellite dish.
I loose my balance clambering up a river bank log. The headman nods a casual
greeting at this mud-caked stranger and makes a place in front of his TV. We
watch the US weather forecast. At some point I pass out on the floor.
We leave in the morning. Long Lihan is in front of the screen, mesmerised.
'She still hasn't blinked,' he says.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Thirst for success beats the
drought - A company's recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One dry, hot day in June 1976, Nick Handover and his wife Pauline, plus 16
staff, began on a contract to clean the stone of 52 buildings in Bath, Avon.
By the next day the project was dead.
'It was the time of the national drought. We were told in the evening that
our task was not an essential use for water and must cease. After eight
years hard slog we had developed a system, acceptable to the conservation
lobby, for the pressure water cleaning of soft stone and were turning over a
healthy Pounds 500,000,' Handover said. 'The next morning the company was
effectively finished.'
A pick-up truck and trailer, emblazoned with 'Drain Brain', the name
Handover had given his company, was permitted to continue essential local
authority work. This left the workforce doing very little for 2 1/2 months
until he opted for voluntary liquidation.
'Water has been my way of life for 26 years. I love the stuff - even
revolting dirty water - but it was water, or the lack of it, that finished
off my first venture,' said the 52- year-old English-educated South African.
'My big mistake, after the Bath episode, was being loyal to the workforce
and keeping them on. It eventually meant we had to sell our house and buy a
much cheaper one and I owed my creditors Pounds 87,000.'
It took nine years to pay it back but Handover had succeeded in convincing
his creditors that they would be better off if they allowed him to continue
trading rather than forcing him into compulsory liquidation.
'We put our heads down and kept going. It was drain cleaning pure and simple
 -two of us carrying out an essential service all over the west of England,
performing a task nobody liked doing,' he said.
By 1979 Handover felt things might be improving when Dyno-Rod tried to buy
his company name for Pounds 12,000. He could have done with the money, but
he declined.
In 1982 he was able to move again to a larger home near Cirencester where he
could house his four vehicles in the old stables. By 1986 the fleet had
grown to 12 vehicles and the company turnover was Pounds 1.6m. Two years
later it had grown to Pounds 1.8m.
Handover explained: 'Really, the growth had been much too fast. I didn't
have the management expertise to handle this sort of money and I was utterly
unsuspecting when a Frenchman rang and asked if he could come and see how
our operation worked.' He eventually asked if the company was for sale.
Handover said no.
The Frenchman returned a few months later, in February 1989, by which time
things had changed. 'He asked me if I would sell a share to the company he
worked for,' said Handover. 'I said yes. The press seemed to be full of
gloom about the impending recession, and we had lost a lot of work from
large developers.'
In July 1989 Sanitra, the drain cleaning arm of French water company
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, took over 76 per cent of Drain Brain. Handover was
given the property he lived in as a gift, as well as a lump sum, and
appointed managing director.
Soon after, he moved the business to a country site and was keen to build a
workshop, a store area and offices on the 2 1/2 acres he had leased from a
farmer near Bibury, Gloucestershire.
All was fine at first. Handover got on well with his new colleagues and
Sanitra willingly financed the Pounds 400,000 building project. However,
they were unhappy at the lengthy British planning processes, and especially
at the attitude of a neighbour who objected to the development.
By 1992 the French had provided more than Pounds 1m for buildings and
equipment, but turnover had dropped from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 1.7m. By the
time the recession took hold the books were showing a loss - minimal in
1990/91 but Pounds 300,000 the following year.
The French switched management and imposed financial restraints. 'It got
very fraught,' he said. 'I couldn't stand either of the two new key men.'
Eventually, it was Handover who stayed and the French who left, an outcome
largely due to the arrival of 27-year-old manager Matthew Byrne. He had
worked for Shell for five years and was headhunted by Sanitra, who saw him
as the saviour of their English operation.
'I think they thought that with my arrival Nick would give up and go,' said
Byrne. Instead, the opposite happened: Handover's practical experience
dovetailed with Byrne's efficiency and business sense.
After a dreadful 1992, in which the company lost Pounds 280,000, business
started to pick up, helped by the North Sea work that Drain Brain, or DB
Industrial as the company is known offshore, won because of the equipment
bought with Sanitra capital.
At the beginning of 1993 - the year DB Industrial went into profit again -
Sanitra pulled out. Handover and Byrne bought the company as joint managing
directors in March last year. They each put up Pounds 20,000 of their own
money and the total company debt of Pounds 400,000 was met by a Pounds
75,000 loan from the Rural Development Commission, Pounds 30,000 from Credit
Lyonnais, Pounds 35,000 (interest free) from Sanitra, and Pounds 200,000 set
against current debtors. The rest is secured by a bank overdraft.
'It was a phenomenal deal. Said Handover: 'It was probably silly to get
involved with the French, but in a funny sort of way they saw us through the
recession.'

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: When confusion reigns - Personal
pensions, last in the series on the true costs of investing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANET WALFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good investment performance will always compensate for high charges - but if
investment performance falls, you are left with the high charges. These can
have a dramatic effect on how much your personal pension plan produces when
you cash it in.
Although charges on such plans usually are stated explicitly in the product
brochure, working out their implications is almost impossible.
This confusion is made worse by the fact that while new rules on life
insurance disclosure come into force at the end of this year, all personal
pension providers (mostly insurance companies) must until then quote an
identical set of charges laid down by the regulator.
It is, therefore, impossible to tell which companies have high charges and
which are particularly competitive.
To make matters even worse, the standard set of charges is now so dated that
virtually all of the 100-plus providers have higher fees than the standard.
Personal pension plan charges come in a variety of guises and disguises,
from the relatively straightforward to the frankly incomprehensible. They
include:
Bid/offer spread
As with most shares quoted on the stock exchange, this reflects the
difference between the buying and selling prices, and is usually 5 per cent
plus a rounding charge.
Annual fund charge
All funds have an annual management charge, the norm being 1 per cent but
varying from nil on cash funds to 1.75 per cent a year for highly
specialised funds. Several companies return part of this fee at retirement,
re-labelled as a 'loyalty bonus.'
Policy fee, service or administrative charge
These fees are charged for collecting contributions. They usually start at
an innocuous level of about Pounds 2 a month, but nearly all are linked to
an index and will rise in line with its increases. Most link to the index of
national average earnings, which rises more rapidly than the alternative,
the retail price index.
Obviously, the smaller the contribution, the bigger the slice the policy fee
will represent. Even for single contributions (for example, a lump sum
transfer from another scheme), some companies still levy an administration
charge, deducted monthly by cancellation of units or as a single deduction
at outset of about Pounds 100.
Unit allocation
This is the percentage of the contribution actually invested in units. The
rate will vary enormously between the providers, how often contributions are
paid, and how far you are from retirement. Unit allocations are always
higher for lump sum contributions than annual: the lowest are for monthly
contributions.
Do not be fooled by companies that tell you the allocation is, for example,
102 per cent of what you pay. Although it sounds good, it simply means the
charges are being deducted elsewhere.
Unit allocations can be as little as 50 per cent of the first year's
contributions. But some smaller life companies, which sell pensions entirely
through their own sales forces, can have a unit allocation of zero for the
first two years.
Capital levy
This is the most obscure and, frankly, the most misleading of all charges
levied on personal pensions.
It is an old-fashioned method of taking out up-front charges and is used
simply to disguise this fact.
Life offices that operate this system will have two types of unit, capital
and accumulation. For the first one or two years, contributions will be
allocated to capital units which bear an additional annual charge throughout
the lifetime of the pension plan. Capital units do not apply to lump sum
contributions.
By operating this system, the brochure (or the salesman) will be able to say
that 100 per cent of contributions are invested from day one. Clearly, this
is better from their point of view than saying that half or all of your
first year's contributions are swallowed up in charges. The capital unit
method disguises this completely.
The sting in the tail
Watch out for 'hidden' charges that may not be apparent from the brochure or
the salesman. These are penalties levied if you cancel your policy in the
early years. This charge can be swingeing - General Portfolio, for example,
has a nil value on its personal pension if you cancel in the first five
years.
To show the effect of charges, we have taken a Pounds 10,000 single
contribution. If it were to grow at 10 per cent a year without any charges
deducted, it would be worth Pounds 25,937 after 10 years.
The average charging policy would deduct a total of Pounds 3,557 but the
highest charging plan - that of Royal London - would deduct Pounds 4,846,
which is almost 19 per cent of the fund value.
It is impossible for the layman to work out the effect of all these complex
charges, but there are two ways of avoiding the most onerous. You can pay by
single contributions or recurring single contributions; or pay an
independent adviser a fee, thus ensuring that the commission part of the
charges is re-invested in the pension plan.
In the example given above, the most competitive personal pension plan with
no commission deducted is from Provident Life. Its charges amount to a
deduction of Pounds 1,774 over 10 years, or 6.8 per cent of the total. But
do not forget that the cost of the fee, and lost interest on that, has to be
taken into account.

<TEXT>
I was particularly interested in your article on unit trust charges on May
14/15. Might I draw attention to two situations where there could be losses
in value for investors related to bid/offer spreads, in cases where managers
decide the timing of purchases and/or sales.
In the first case, it is possible for the individual investor to detect what
is happening, and perhaps even to reduce the impact. I am not sure if one
could establish the facts in the second case: I hope it does not happen.
Regular monthly savings in a unit trust: When operating a regular monthly
savings scheme, the managers may fix a few day(s) in the month when they buy
units for the regular savers.
On such days, purchases normally will outweigh re-purchases, in which case
the fund may move to an offer valuation.
Naturally, sales of units will, in general, be on other days, probably with
a bid valuation. This practice effectively increases the bid/offer spread -
in one case that I know, from 5.3 per cent to 8.6 per cent. The difference
would normally be less.
Managed fund of in-house unit trusts: For a fund consisting of in-house unit
trusts, it would not be surprising to find that when the fund sells units of
one of the unit trusts in the fund, the re-purchases for that unit trust,
for that day, outweigh purchases; and the reverse when the fund buys that
unit trust.
If the spread for the unit trust moves to the bottom of the permitted range
in the first case, and to the top in the second, then the spread effectively
is increased. With active management, the impact could be significant, even
when no initial charges exist (or when those that do exist are rebated).

Do you have to pay tax when selling shares. I am a non-taxpayer.
You have to pay CGT only if your total capital gains (after indexation
relief) amount to more than Pounds 5,800 in 1994-95. As you are a
non-taxpayer, the next Pounds 3,000 of capital gains beyond Pounds 5,800
would be taxed at 20 per cent; the next Pounds 20,700 at 25 per cent; and
the rest at 40 per cent.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Suspect - but I wasn't told
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On August 18 1988, I bought 2,000 shares in Trilion plc (an independent
television production company). As of March 17 1989, this firm had Pounds
25m in cash for the sale of Limehouse Studios on Canary Wharf in east
London.
I have been in touch with (the industry regulatory bodies) Fimbra and Lautro
but it appears Trilion plc was not a member of either.
I bought the shares through a firm in Norfolk which was a Fimbra member but
left on May 14 1992. I learnt only recently that it should have told me
Trilion plc was not registered with any back-up organisation and that I
risked losing all my investment should Trilion go out of business.
It did not give me this information, however. Is there any action I can take
to recover my money?
Huge debts forced Trilion into receivership in December 1992 and we regret
that your former shareholding is worthless. To advise you on whether you
have any ground for action against the Norfolk firm, we would need to know
the nature of your relationship with it.
If you were asking it merely to act as an execution-only broker, then your
investment in Trilion can only be written off as a bad loss.
If, on the other hand, it had a specific discretionary investment management
agreement with you, and specifically disobeyed instructions not to invest in
such small companies, then you might well have a right of action.
Unfortunately, Trilion was a sad example of a small company not surviving in
tough industrial conditions. (Answer by Murray Johnstone).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the heady days of the mid-1980s, I was persuaded to invest in Bitter
Corporation, a German company run by one Eric Bitter, engineer extraordinary
and maker of the fabulous, up-market Bitter luxury sports car.
The last I heard was a curt letter - possibly in 1988 - saying that Bitter
shares could now be dealt with on the NASDAQ system in the US. What happened
to Bitter? Are the shares still tradeable?
Bitter shares are certainly not dealt with on NASDAQ and, as far as we can
determine, the company is no longer trading. (Answer by Murray Johnstone

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Countdown to rolling settlement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are only two complete account periods left until rolling settlement -
the new system of settling payment for buying and selling shares - begins on
July 18.
The stock exchange divides the year into account periods named by letters of
the alphabet. Yesterday was the last day for dealings in account period L
and a bill for the net amount for all trades conducted in the period, which
began on June 6, has to be settled on June 27. This allows investors who
dealt early in the account up to 15 working days to settle.
Being able to settle the net amount is useful for all investors. Speculators
aiming to make a profit within the same account can, if successful, make
money without ever having to put up a penny.
Account periods will disappear from July 18, although investors who deal in
the last period - account N - can still settle in the usual way on July 25.
But from July 18, the settlement day will be 10 working days after dealing
day - or T+10.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Go private - if you can - Why it can
be hard to get medical insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scare stories about age discrimination in NHS hospital treatment may be
making more elderly people think about private medical insurance. Yet, while
the government has encouraged this in recent years by offering tax relief on
medical premiums for those over 60, the last Budget cut the relief available
to a maximum of 25 rather than 40 per cent.
Medical insurance will be hit also by the 2.5 per cent tax on all insurance
premiums due to be imposed from October this year. But one spot of good news
for pensioners is that the tax is added before relief is calculated - so you
end up getting tax relief on the tax element, too.
Relief is available to whoever pays the premiums, whether they are
themselves the policyholders or are paying for elderly relatives.
The rules about which insurance schemes qualify for relief are fairly
strict. Any plan which offers cash benefits for nights spent in NHS
hospitals, or covers GP or dental treatment, will not qualify.
Changes announced last week mean that plans covering occupational therapy
and a few other treatments are no longer excluded, but any scheme including
alternative medicine will not be eligible.
Jan Lawson, a specialist adviser on medical insurance with the Private
Health Partnership, says the biggest barrier for over-60s seeking medical
cover is not finding a policy which qualifies for tax relief but getting
cover for existing conditions.
By the time they reach their 60s or 70s, many people have minor medical
problems which, in themselves, are not likely to lead to any claims but
could contribute to future problems that would require surgery or other
treatment. These include such conditions as mild high blood pressure and
arthritis which, if it deteriorated, could require a hip replacement.
Most insurers operate a moratorium policy: if you have had a medical problem
in the past, but have not seen a doctor about it, taken medication or had
any other form of treatment for it in the five years before joining the
insurance scheme, any recurrence will be covered immediately.
If it has been active within five years, you need to be free of the problem
for at least two years after joining the scheme before it will be covered.
But if you have high blood pressure, and are taking daily medication, you
will never have a two-year period without treatment.
Thus, the insurer can refuse to pay for anything needed to correct problems
that could be traced back to this condition. Ignoring medical advice and
failing to take the pills will not help you, either.
Some insurers are more sympathetic than others, however, so using a
specialist broker could be a good idea if you have had any health problems.
Medical insurers often refuse to accept new customers in their 60s or older
because they are seen as high risk. Clinicare, one of the few insurers which
will underwrite existing conditions (for a higher premium) rather than
imposing a moratorium, does not usually take on new clients over 64.
Since tax relief was introduced, though, many other insurers have introduced
special policies for retired people and have increased their upper age limit
for new business.
WPA offers one policy that accepts new customers up to age-75, and another
which has no age limit. PPP also sets no limit, while Bupa will take new
customers up to 75 in most of its plans.
Obviously, cost is an important consideration, but many factors will dictate
which scheme is right for an individual - including how flexible it can be
if circumstances change. Pensioners can choose from plans with no-claim
discounts, high excesses, six-week waiting list systems, and a myriad other
ways of cutting premiums.
But as long as insurers impose such strict conditions on covering a person's
medical history, the best advice seems to be to sign up for insurance while
you are young and healthy. Otherwise, when you need it, you could find you
are too late.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Variable rates drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BAYLISS, Moneyfacts
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although building societies did not react to February's base rate cut of
0.25 per cent by reducing their standard mortgage rates, they have been
reducing variable investment rates; indeed, some have lowered these more
than once. Others, such as Buckinghamshire and Manchester, have withdrawn
their market-leading postal accounts to new investors because of
overwhelming response.
While interest on variable-rate products has been dropping, escalator bonds
continue to be the 'in' thing due to the low cost of funds on the swap
markets. They are now offered by most of the major societies, the top payers
being Birmingham Midshires (the only four-year term), Newcastle and West
Bromwich. These bonds offer tempting rates but should be viewed as long-term
investments as earlier access, if permitted, is costly.
The sometimes exceptionally good rates offered in the fifth year may,
however, be misleading and, in some cases, the average rate offered over the
term does not match ordinary five-year fixed rates. The best average, from
the Newcastle at 8.55 per cent is also worth a look. If investors require
gross interest, Confederation Bank Jersey offers a five-year bond paying
8.25 per cent.
Gross fixed interest can also be obtained from the Retail Co-operative
Societies. There are several offering rates above the 7 per cent mark. The
CWS (061-835 2345) is offering up to 8 per cent fixed for five years and
7.75 for four years on sums from Pounds 5,000. The Brighton Co-operative
Society (0273-606 722) offers up to 7.3 per cent fixed for five years on as
little as Pounds 100.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Winners? They just lost less - Unit
trust performance this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To speak of unit trust 'winners' since the UK market peak in February is to
talk in entirely relative terms. The so-called winners have simply lost
investors less money than other unit trusts.
Since the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, raised short-term interest
rates on February 4, the only sectors (see table at right) to have been
profitable, on average, have been Japan and money markets.
The Japanese market has turned since a period of decline, but analysts
differ about how quickly it may recover. The markets of the Far East
generally have been in decline since February, so Japan's performance helped
to pull up the Far East (including Japan) sector compared with Far East
(excluding Japan).
Europe has been less of a disappointment than other parts of the world, with
smaller companies delivering the stronger performance and a gradual fall in
interest rates.
The Fed's move was designed to pre-empt a rise in inflation, fuelled by the
potential of a stronger than expected recovery, but it upset nervous US and
UK markets. The Dow Jones index fell by 5 per cent between February 1 and
June 1, recovering from a drop of almost 10 per cent at the beginning of
April.
The FT-SE-A All-Share fell by just under 15 per cent over the same period,
after an extended period of strong performance. The bottom of the unit trust
performance table is inhabited by UK funds, with the notable exception of UK
smaller companies.
The tables on the left list the performance of the top and bottom funds in
each UK sector over the period.
A cursory glance at the funds which are not preceded by a negative sign (UK
Equity General and Gilt and Fixed Interest) shows some good gains, of up to
13.4 per cent. But a closer look reveals that all but one of these are
reverse index or 'bear' funds, which use derivatives to deliver the opposite
of an index.
In the UK Equity Growth sector, a noticeable number of the better-performing
funds are recovery trusts. These stocks usually do well when an economy is
coming out of recession but are not usually associated with good performance
in falling markets. But Mary Blair, Fidelity's product development director,
believes the UK market has over-reacted in the degree to which it has
dropped, and that recovery is still the dominant theme.
'The markets have gone down because of fears that interest rates will go up
but, ironically, that fear is because it looks as if the economic recovery
is happening,' she says. 'Small companies and recovery stocks are productive
companies which benefit in a consumer recovery.'
Some of the over-reaction could be due to the use of trading in derivatives.
Since there are no futures contracts in smaller companies, the UK Smaller
Companies sector has been insulated from the type of volatility associated
with these instruments.
George Luckraft, director at Carrington Pembroke (which changed its name
recently from John Carrington &amp; Co.), believes that just as futures have
helped to magnify falls in the UK market, they were also the driving force
behind the strength of the market towards the end of last year.
Two of the company's funds - Pembroke and Pembroke Balanced - appear among
the winners in the UK Equity Growth and UK Equity General sectors. Luckraft
says they have not done as badly as others as some of the smaller stocks in
them have delivered good performance and also because some stocks were
shifted into oils in the past few months. Integrated oil has been the
best-performing UK sector since the market peak.
Given the recent turbulence in the bond markets, it is no surprise to find
that the international fixed-interest, UK gilt and fixed interest, and
sectors exposed to holdings of bonds - such as the UK Balanced sector - are
all down. Bond prices had begun to drop before the Fed's move and, as Graham
Bowley explains on page V, the continued fall in bond prices indicates that
inflationary fears are not yet over. But Luckraft believes that after the 15
per cent fall in equities prices in the UK, it is not a good time to sell UK
unit trusts. 'It will be a quiet summer but, at the end of it, when interim
results come through showing improved earnings, we could have a good end to
the year.'

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: In from the cold at last - The
resurgence of the Johannesburg stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite South Africa's years of isolation, the Johannesburg stock market is
no stranger to foreign investors - indeed, the exchange was set up largely
at the behest of British financiers involved in the gold industry at the end
of the last century.
Rather than speculators, however, the market now is trying to attract the
new masters of the global market place: fund managers and their investors.
Helping the drive is the fact that, in a sharp turnaround, South Africa now
is regarded as an ethical investment by many of the individuals and
institutions that shunned it for its racial policies during the apartheid
era.
It is not just changing political considerations, however, that have led to
the increased interest in the market. The JSE has performed very strongly
over the past 18 months, providing attractive returns virtually across the
board.
And although price/earnings ratios and yields are near historical highs by
local standards, the market remains relatively undervalued when considered
in a global context.
The JSE's recent inclusion on several global market indices - most notably
the International Finance Corporation, which tracks emerging markets - also
has boosted confidence. Many funds which base their portfolios around such
indices are expected to shift their weighting in favour of South Africa over
the next few months, with a potential windfall of billions of dollars.
Yet, although classified as an emerging market, the JSE is better regarded
as a re-emerging market. It is a mature body with a wide range of stocks; a
market capitalisation around Dollars 160 billion, putting it just outside of
the world's top 10; and a well developed regulatory and legal framework.
There are, however, a couple of peculiarities about the market of which the
prudent investor needs to be aware. Most important, and confusing, is the
country's two-tier currency.
Non-residents invest using the financial rand exchange rate; this operates
at a variable discount (now around 25 per cent) to the commercial rand, the
country's main trading currency.
Intended originally to deter foreigners from withdrawing their capital
during the sanctions and disinvestment era, it also provides an attractive
incentive for new investment. Because all dividends are paid in commercial
rands, foreigners stand to augment substantially their yield on local
shares.
Nonetheless, the currency is quite volatile, especially during times of
political uncertainty, and investors could just as easily see their capital
gains negated from currency depreciation, even while yields soar.
Another problem with the JSE is its low liquidity; annual turnover last year
amounted to only 7 per cent of market capitalisation, far below global
norms. This is, largely, the result of two factors: the existence of large
conglomerates unwilling to trade their shareholdings; and exchange control
restrictions which make it illegal for domestic investors to send funds
abroad, so encouraging them to retain local blue chips.
This can be irritating for foreigners who, sometimes, find their stocks have
low tradeability. But the exchange authorities recently have made a number
of proposals to try to improve the situation. And with further pressure
coming from both inside and outside the country, it is likely things will
continue to improve.
Even with these problems, though, the JSE remains a relatively good bet.
Just as a century ago, the most popular investments among foreigners are
gold stocks, which tend to be relatively undervalued compared with their
American and Australian counterparts and remain a good hedge against
inflation.
But several industrial shares, particularly those in building and
construction, have been performing very strongly recently because of the
expected rise in spending on housing under the new government's
reconstruction and development programme.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Gilts fall on hard times - Why
investors may well remain wary of bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are there any reasons to be cheerful about the UK government bond market?
After all, it keeps on falling, despite the occasional respite, and probably
has still further to fall.
The answer depends on whether inflation and interest rates remain low. Even
then, the battered investor might take a lot of persuasion to return to
gilts.
The yield on long-term gilts has risen by more than 2 percentage points
since the beginning of the year, to 8 1/2 per cent, and their price has
crashed by more than 20 per cent. Why? 'It was just an unfortunate
combination of events. There's no single explanation,' says Ian Shepherdson,
an economist at Midland Global Markets.
'The initial sell-off began when the hedge funds ended their feeding frenzy
after pushing bond prices up to unsustainable heights and decided to take
their profits and move on.' Hedge funds are large pools of speculative
capital which are switched between financial markets to exploit short-term
opportunities.
Then came a succession of events, beginning with the move on February 4 by
the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to put up short-term interest
rates.
'This signalled the end of the low interest rate era. Funds flowing out of
US suddenly changed direction,' says one City analyst. 'Investors, afraid
that the dollar would soon rise, quickly dropped bonds denominated in
European currencies.'
The markets were particularly unnerved by the fact that the interest rate
rise came when most inflation indicators were pointing downwards. 'That
suggested that the authorities knew something the markets did not,' says
Shepherdson.
The UK base rate cut on February 8 was taken very badly by the gilt market.
'Maybe it was justified on fundamental grounds,' the analyst says. 'There
had been some decent activity numbers.
'The problem was the timing and the subsequent revelation that Eddie George
(governor of the Bank of England) didn't want it. It was seen as blatant
political manoeuvreing.'
Next came anxiety over rising earnings figures, which were seen as a
precursor to rising inflation. Finally, there was the Conservative party's
protracted political woes, which added to uncertainty and scared off many
investors.
Many believe this succession of 'unfortunate' events has changed the
fundamental nature of the gilt market. City analysts say investor confidence
has been damaged in a way they have never seen before. What, then, will it
take to restore confidence in gilts?
One answer comes from Simon Briscoe, an economist at SG Warburg: 'There has
to be continued low inflation and low average earnings numbers, more subdued
consumer activity, and a slowdown in the housing market.'
Data published last week showing a drop in earnings, subdued growth in the
retail price index and a marked fall in construction orders, was duly
welcomed by gilts.
'If this continues, then there is no doubt that current yields are extremely
attractive,' says Briscoe. He is confident that inflation and interest rates
will remain low for the remainder of the year, although he thinks the
outlook for gilts is less favourable beyond that.
Another necessary condition for a recovery in gilts is a slowdown in the US
economy in order to retard the rise in official US interest rates and dampen
any propensity the dollar might have to rise.
Investors also have to be convinced that all the speculative positions have
finally been unwound. 'That will probably happen when speculators come to
show their half-year results at the end of June,' says Ste-phen Lewis, of
London Bond Broking.' Investors also have to build up large amounts of cash
before they are ready to invest - and that will take a month or two yet.'
Analysts agree the UK's political uncertainty must end. Recent talk of tax
cuts to boost the standing of prime minister John Major 'would be the last
thing the gilt market wants,' another analyst says. 'It would not smack of
sound political management.'
There are signs of optimism among some investors, though. Barry Woolf,
investment director at Mercury Fund Management, says: 'We have been gently
adding to gilts at this level. All bond markets are going to remain highly
volatile but, provided we are right on the fundamentals, there's money to be
made in gilts.'
The problem is that even if all these conditions are met, the large
institutional investors with the funds to change market sentiment may still
be wary of committing themselves after having their fingers burnt so badly.
In his Mansion House speech in the City this week, Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer, pledged that the government would not create a
new boom and bust cycle generating a 'fraudulent, inflationary, feel good'
factor among voters. 'We will cut taxes again,' he said, 'but only when we
can afford to do so.'
The impact of Clarke's words was softened, however, when George warned that
interest rates would have to move upwards at some time in the future 'to
maintain the (economic) expansion at a sustainable pace'. This might hardly
have been news, but it would not have encouraged the gilt market.
There are reasons to be cheerful, and the chancellor will continue to do his
best to keep investors' spirits up. But with the market in its present
nervous state, needing several pieces of good news to offset every single
bit of bad news, it will take a lot of good news to convince investors to
take their first tentative steps back into gilts.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: South Africans come to town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

British investors will soon have access to their first South African
investment trust. The Old Mutual South Africa trust, run by the republic's
largest life and fund management group, will invest in a wide range of local
concerns, although with a bias towards industrial and financial stocks and
smaller and medium sized companies.
This is because some of the largest, best-known South African companies also
have shares traded on the London market, making them easily accessible
already to UK investors. But when it comes to smaller companies, Old Mutual
thinks its team of 42 analysts can provide value for overseas investors with
its stock-picking approach to investment management.
Small and medium sized companies may also have more to gain from the
restructuring of South Africa's economy as it reintegrates with the rest of
the region and the world.
Old Mutual says the fund is extremely unlikely to hold gold stocks in the
foreseeable future. So, if you are looking for a play on commodities, you
would do better to pick one of the specialist gold or mining funds.
Institutions are expected to be the main investors in this new fund, but the
minimum investment (Pounds 1,000) has been set low enough for smaller
investors to get involved, too. The trust is not expected to provide a
particularly high yield, though - the Johannesburg stock exchange now
returns about 2 per cent.
Meanwhile, anyone preferring a unit to an investment trust will not have
long to wait. Save &amp; Prosper plans to launch a South African unit trust at
the start of July.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Every year as summer begins, the number of deals by directors tails off.
Thus, it is unusual to note a steady number buying at present.
Seven members of the board at Life Sciences International, a maker of
scientific and hospital equipment, took the opportunity offered by a dip in
the share price to buy stock at 117p. The largest single purchase was by Sir
Christopher Bland, previously the chairman of London Weekend Television, who
bought 1m to more than double his holding.
Halkin Holdings used to be known as Hoskins Breweries. Over the past year it
has had a complete change of management, and its share price has begun to
perform better. Directors bought last summer at 55p and have been back in
the market again. Chairman Howard Hodgson and Bruce McGuire acquired 50,000
each at around 62p.
Dewhirst Group, a clothing and toiletries company, featured in this column
when vice-chairman James Dewhirst bought stock in May. The share price has
moved very little since then and another two directors have taken the
opportunity to get into the market. Chairman Timothy Dewhirst and Robin
Horsell, an executive director, bought 120,000 and 19,960 respectively at
123p. Timothy Dewhirst now holds more than 4.9m while Horsell's holding is
more than 850,000.
Quicks Group, a motor distributor, has enjoyed steady price increases over
the past two years. In the summer of 1992 Alexander Murray, the chief
executive, and managing director, and Frederick Royle bought stock around
110p. Timothy Franey, a non-executive director, has taken the opportunity to
sell some stock - initially at 185p last September and latterly at 190p. He
remains the single largest shareholder on the board with 4.6 per cent of the
stock.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Into the black - The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the Pounds 149m pre-tax loss last time, British Steel has started the
long climb back into the black. On Monday, even the most pessimistic of
analysts is expecting a pre-tax profit of Pounds 60m for the year to March,
and forecasts range as high as Pounds 95m. Most believe a maintained final
dividend of 1p per share is likely, making a total of 1.5p for the year.
Wessex Water is expected to draw the sector's reporting season to a close on
Tuesday with the biggest dividend increase of all the top 10 water
companies. Forecasts are for a pay-out of between 23.5p and 24p, against
last year's 21.5p. The main issues, as with its fellow companies, will be
cost savings and the performance of the non-regulated waste management
business. Wessex is expected to score highly on both counts. Profit is
estimated to rise by 20 per cent to about Pounds 103m.
East Midlands Electricity has prepared the market already for a
disappointing pre-tax profit figure for 1993/94. The total will be depressed
by Pounds 130m as a result of post-privatisation acquisitions which have
performed disappointingly. That will leave pre-tax profit, to be announced
on Monday, at around Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m. The dividend should be
unaffected at about 22.7p.
Manweb, which distributes electricity in north Wales and Cheshire, is
expected to announce pre-tax profit of about Pounds 125m to Pounds 130m on
Tuesday. The dividend should be about 22.5p.
Hazlewood Foods is expected to announce an annual pre-tax profit of up to
Pounds 50m on Tuesday, down from the previous year's Pounds 55m on turnover
of Pounds 761.8m. Last year's figure is unlikely to be matched even after
taking out exceptional charges related to restructuring and the sale of a
Dutch subsidiary.
Wednesday sees the first annual result from specialist chemicals group BTP
since it acquired most of ailing MTM in June last year. The MTM businesses
have been coming through well and analysts expect pre-tax profit to have
jumped from Pounds 20.5m to around Pounds 29m. The MTM deal was funded by a
rights issue, which will hold back growth in underlying earnings per share
to about 15 per cent. Forecasts for this year vary widely, so the shares
will be sensitive to comments about present trading.
Rothmans International, the tobacco group now shorn of its luxury goods
interests, is expected to report a lower annual profit on Thursday due to
the Pounds 48m costs associated with the demerger of Dunhill. BZW, the
broker, is forecasting a pre-tax figure of Pounds 440m, down from a pro
forma Pounds 470m the previous year.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Your lapses are their profits . . .
 -If you're baffled by life policy surrender values, so was the Office of
Fair Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the continuing great mysteries for Mr and Ms Policyholder has been
how to calculate how much cash will be returned if an insurance policy is
cashed in early.
While there are no official figures on how many policies might fall into
this category, data prepared for securities' regulators two years ago
suggest that one-quarter to one-third of all policies are cashed in during
the first two years alone. The Office of Fair Trading says its own
information suggests that the policies most likely to lapse before maturity
are unit-linked and sold by direct sales forces, while those least likely
are with-profits policies sold through independent financial advisers.
This week, the OFT released results of a study aimed at taking some of the
mystery out of early surrenders. Aided by an actuarial consultant, Alexander
Clay and Partners, it looked at how 60 of the UK's largest life insurers
treat their customers.
It found that a number of companies actually profit from early lapse rates -
and that many people holding policies with companies that have relatively
high lapse rates are actually worse off than if they had no policy at all.
The OFT concluded: 'On the basis of assumptions about lapse rates and
projections of surrender and maturity values, the policyholders of some
companies appear to receive average rates of return which are no more than
marginally positive, or even negative.'
The OFT noted that the reason for there being mystery about surrender values
was because life insurers had never been required to disclose them. From
January, new rules - urged by the OFT - will help to remedy that.
The data compiled by the OFT shows huge differences in surrender values:
On a 10-year with-profits policy paying Pounds 50 a month, Equitable Life
will return 98 per cent of actual premiums if surrender takes place in the
first year, and 113 per cent - if policy is surrendered in year five. If you
add in notional investment income to the premiums, as we have done in the
tables, the figures are still a respectable 94 per cent.
On exactly the same type of policy, Royal Life pays nothing if surrender
occurs in the first year and only 75 per cent of premiums for a policy
surrendered in year five.
For a 25-year, unit-linked policy paying Pounds 50 a month, TSB Life returns
43 per cent of all premiums paid if surrendered in year one, and 93 per cent
if surrender occurs in the fifth.
Allied Dunbar returns zero per cent of premiums if surrendered in years one
or two, and only 50 per cent if surrender occurs in year five. The OFT study
also attempts to explode one of the great myths of life industry
advertising. This has placed great emphasis on the final maturity values of
long-term policies. Financial publications also tend to give these figures.
Moreover, some companies pay very low surrender values in early years but
deliberately tilt their policies to give the greatest bonus in the final
year, effectively propelling them to the top of the league tables.
The OFT argues, however, that because the vast majority of clients are
unlikely to hold their policies to maturity, it would be more helpful to
look at each company's weighted average rate of return (WARR). And
policyholders whose company is at the top of the final maturity value league
table may find that the WARR is actually less attractive than that of
competing providers.
The OFT prepared tables showing how this works. It identifies two companies,
Company H and Company L (each of which is a composite of three) and
demonstrates how they treat customers with a 10-year policy.
By adding a five per cent maturity bonus, Company L comes top of the league
table with a final value of Pounds 7,690. But for policies surrendered in
year one, Company L pays nothing while Company H offers a refund of Pounds
343.
In year two, Company L pays Pounds 532 while Company H pays nearly twice
that, at Pounds 957. In fact, in nine of the 10 years of the policy, Company
H is the better bet, a fact which never shows up in the league tables at
all.
Moreover, the OFT said, the idea that unit-linked policyholders could
understand readily the surrender values of their policies simply by reading
the product literature was quite false.
John Mills, head of the OFT's consumer policy division, added: 'These things
are not only obscure to the average consumer but to the informed consumer as
well.'
The OFT, in attempting to compare the charges on unit-linked policies, found
that companies used so many different mechanisms that it was almost
impossible to judge one against the other.
It discovered that nine of 42 used a 'reduced allocation' in early years,
while eight had a device called 'capital units' upon which management fees
of three to four per cent were levied.
One company reduced investment returns for early leavers, one set penalties
on premiums outstanding, and six had cut both allocations of units and
investment returns.
All tables based on OFT statistics. Total premiums of Pounds 3,625 include
Pounds 625 of accumulated interest.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Markets: A sporting charm that failed to work - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Wall Street's best-loved, if more obscure, market theories - the
Ranger Rally - was put to the test this week.
The theory holds that every time the New York Rangers ice hockey team wins
the Stanley Cup (North America's championship trophy), the stock market
stages a rally on the following day.
Of course, to say 'every time' is a little misleading because, before this
week, the Rangers had won the cup only three times and their last victory
was way back in 1940. On Tuesday night, however, a 54-year-old curse was
lifted when New York defeated Vancouver 3-2 in the last game of the finals.
Pandemonium broke out throughout the city, and hordes of hungover but happy
Wall Street brokers and traders trotted into work next morning looking
forward to the first Ranger Rally in more than half a century.
Alas, it never materialised because investors - or those outside New York,
at least - seemed unimpressed by the Rangers' splendid achievement. After
posting a quick eight-point gain at the opening bell, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average reversed course. By the end of the day, it was down more
than 24 points and back below the 3,800 level.
The reason the Rangers' charm failed to work its magic is the same reason
the Dow has struggled to make much headway in recent months: inflation - or,
to be more precise, the bond market's fear of inflation. Wednesday's
declines were prompted by heavy selling of bonds by fixed-income investors
unnerved suddenly by a sharp rise in commodity prices.
Although the jump in the Commodity Research Bureau's index (from 3.31 to
238.61) on Wednesday was caused by political, not economic factors - in this
case, rising tension on the Korean peninsula - it was enough to overshadow
the morning's good news on inflation, an easing in the capacity utilisation
component of the May industrial production figures.
The reaction of bond prices to these two sets of data shows just how nervous
the US Treasury market remains about inflation in spite of the Federal
Reserve's round of four monetary policy tightenings. These were designed to
nip inflationary pressures in the bud and reassure fixed-income investors
that the value of their assets would not be undermined by rising prices.
Capacity utilisation - the extent to which the capital stock of the country
is being employed in producing goods - is a key inflation indicator. It has
been watched closely all year by investors worried that demand in the
rapidly growing economy will, eventually, outstrip companies' ability to
boost production to meet that demand. As any student of economics knows,
when demand increases relative to supply, prices rise.
So, Wednesday's news that capacity utilisation had eased in May should have
delighted the bond market, especially as it came a day after the May
consumer prices index was released showing an unthreatening 0.2 per cent
increase. Yet, jittery bond investors chose instead to focus on the CRB
index, which rose sharply because gold and oil prices had firmed amid fears
of a war between North and South Korea.
The fact that the rise in the CRB was likely only to be temporary - and
proved as much on Thursday and Friday when a meeting between former
President Jimmy Carter and North Korean leaders in Pyongyang raised hopes of
a diplomatic solution - did not dissuade the bond market from retreating at
the first sign of higher commodity prices. This has been the pattern all
year: the bond market has over-reacted to all the bad news about inflation
while paying little attention to most of the good news.
The stock market, meanwhile, also has continued to do what it has done for
most of the year - follow blindly in the bond market's footsteps. Thus, the
Dow, which rose 32 points on Tuesday because of higher bond prices, fell 24
points on Wednesday because of lower bond prices, then rose 21 points the
next day because of higher bond prices.
This will have to stop at some stage but, for now, the Dow seems handcuffed
to the 30-year bond. Investors face a long, trying summer of modest rallies
interspersed with equally modest declines, and a Dow likely to be stuck in a
range somewhere between 3,750 and 3,850.
As for the defunct Ranger Rally, sport-lovers will have to look elsewhere
for a new market theory. Basketball, perhaps? The New York Knickerbockers
are now playing the league championship finals, tied at two games apiece,
against the Houston Rockets. I wonder what the Dow did the day after the
Knicks last won the national title, back in 1973?

FT  18 JUN 94 / Markets: Clients who face a life sentence - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, personal finance editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life insurance companies are inured to criticism. This is fortunate, for the
Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has just put in the boot again.
It is already common knowledge that if you cash in a life insurance policy
early, you will probably get back less than the premiums you have paid over.
In some cases, you get nothing back for the first couple of years.
Yesterday's OFT report on surrender values - what you get back if you cash
in a life insurance policy early - makes a few commendably simple points:
The higher the proportion of policyholders surrendering early, the more
money some companies make.
There is a suspiciously close correlation between companies with a high
proportion of policyholders surrendering early, and those with miserly
surrender values.
If you average out policyholders' returns (to include both those who
surrender early and those who stay the full term), returns from some
companies are negligible or negative.
No wonder the OFT is moved to question 'the extent to which (certain
companies) are likely to be working in the interests of their customers'.
A second major cause of concern is the wide variations in surrender values
between different companies. These are most dramatic in the early years. But
even after five years, pay-outs can vary by more than 50 per cent. How many
ordinary customers know which companies are likely to impose the biggest
penalties?
The OFT also highlights the close connection between surrender penalties and
charges. Surrender penalties are really charges under a different name. When
the explicit charges fail to cover the initial costs of getting the customer
on their books in the early years, surrender penalties plug the gap. So,
when your friendly insurance salesman spells out the policy charges, do not
forget the sting in his tail.
Our series of articles on investment charges (page VIII this week) shows how
hard it is for investors to work out the true costs of investing. We
reviewed only the most popular types of equity-based investments: unit and
investment trusts, shares, personal equity plans, life insurance and pension
plans.
All have several different charges, and the charges vary from one type of
investment to another. It is hard enough to make meaningful cost comparisons
even between investments of the same type; virtually impossible to do so for
different types of investment.
How much does this matter? Costs are pretty tedious and conventional wisdom
insists, rightly, that performance matters more than costs.
True. But although low charges cannot turn a bad investment performance into
a good one, high charges can damage a good performance seriously.
How about this as an irresistible offer? 'Give us Pounds 10,000 now and we
guarantee to give you back Pounds 8,500 over the next five and a half years:
ie, you will get no interest and lose 15 per cent of your original capital.'
Not tempted? Try this one. 'If the FT-SE 100 index doubles over the five and
a half year period, we will give you back Pounds 16,000: ie, your original
capital of Pounds 10,000 plus Pounds 6,000.'
Better, but still not very alluring. If you invest in the FT-SE 100 itself,
and it doubles, you will get back a total of Pounds 20,000 plus more than
Pounds 2,000 in income.
Enough of such titillation. The product we are talking about is called
Millennium Monthly Bond, and its message to investors in advertisements is
rather different: '10% pa paid monthly free of basic-rate tax,' says the
front page of its leaflet. The figure 10 is more than 2in high.
Further down the leaflet, in smaller type, come the details about minimum
and maximum total returns which we quoted at the beginning.
The deal is fairly simple. Your 10 per cent monthly income rolls in come
hell or high water, and totals Pounds 5,500 over the whole period. What you
need to keep your eye on is the return of your original capital.
The basic guarantee is that you will get back 30 per cent of it. If the
FT-SE rises by between 4.99 per cent and 9.99 per cent, you will get back
100 per cent. Your maximum possible capital return is 105 per cent, which
you get if the index rises by 10 per cent or more.
General Portfolio, the insurance company which sells the bond, points out
that stock market growth for similar periods of time has averaged 9.3 per
cent. What it does not point out is that its chosen reference period
includes two of the biggest bull markets of modern times. Many pundits argue
that these returns were exceptional, and are predicting much lower ones in
the 1990s.
But the more important point is that it is possible to get a guaranteed
return in the upper half of the Millennium range with absolutely no risk. A
conventional five-year guaranteed income bond, which repays all your
original capital, offers up to 8 per cent annual interest or nearly 7 per
cent if you insist on monthly income.
So, for an extra two percentage points on your income, you are risking 70
per cent of your capital if you opt for Millennium.
(Millennium: period of good government, great happiness and prosperity -
OED. Oh really?).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Holders of units in the City of London emerging markets unit trust are about
to be invited to swop their units for shares and warrants in a new
investment trust being set up by City of London fund managers. The
investment trust will, like the unit trust, invest in closed-end single
country funds for emerging markets, rather than directly in companies.
City of London expects about two-thirds of unit holders to take up the
offer, after which new investors are likely to be invited to subscribe for
more shares. The unit and investment trusts will be run in parallel, and
there may be arrangements for easy switching between the two funds.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Oil prices rise sharply - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices have risen sharply since the February low of just under Dollars
13 a barrel. The benchmark Brent blend rose above Dollars 17 a barrel at one
point this week for the first time since the end of September last year.
The most recent rise is caused by a number of factors including concern over
tensions with North Korea while Wednesday's decision by the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to cancel its September meeting was taken as
confirmation that Opec will stick to its present production ceiling of
24.52m barrels aday until the end of the year. Worries over fighting in
Yemen and a raised forecast of world oil demand from the International
Energy Agency have also helped the bullish sentiment.

Gilt prices have been falling since early this year. Yields have been pushed
up more than 2 percentage points, indicating an expectation of higher
inflation and higher interest rates. The gilt market has been volatile in
its reaction to both political and economic news, domestically and

FT  18 JUN 94 / Markets: Now it's a nightmare for Sid - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Sid, the advertising character created to promote the privatisation of
British Gas, bought those shares in BG back in 1986, he was hoping for a
profit, not a regulatory nightmare. But a nightmare is what he got. Ever
since the government called in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission nearly
two years ago, the prospects for Gas have been bedevilled by uncertainty.
Michael Heseltine, the president of the board of trade, settled things down
somewhat in December when he accepted the MMC's recommendation to liberalise
the gas market. But Sid still had to contend with Clare Spottiswoode, the
gas industry regulator - and the news from her this week was not good.
Under the liberalisation plan, British Gas is supposed to hive off its
network of pipelines and storage into a separate unit. This unit will still
be owned by BG, but it will sell its services at arm's length both to BG and
the independent gas suppliers who want to get into the market. On Wednesday,
Spottiswoode produced a formula governing the prices that the new unit will
be able to charge for transporting gas around the country.
She set it at 14.16p a therm, starting on October 1. After that, the price
can go up by the rate of inflation minus five percentage points a year. This
arrangement will continue until March 1997, when the liberalisation of gas
will be complete and a longer-term pricing formula can be devised.
Spottiswoode's formula was a lot tighter than BG had been hoping for, and
chief executive Cedric Brown wasted no time in going on the attack. It was
'extremely tough', he said, and would probably prevent BG from raising its
dividend this year. But although Brown might have been disappointed by the
formula, he cannot have been surprised.
The MMC report contained recommendations which Spottiswoode had indicated
she would follow, and the market was prepared: when the news hit the
screens, the shares fell only 2p. It was only when Brown made his remarks
about the dividend a few minutes later that the shares fell another 15p. Was
this just bluster or a genuine cry of pain?
It is true, as Brown says, that BG is under a lot of regulatory pressure at
the moment: it must yield to competitors the larger part of the market for
big gas users, something which is eating into profits. It also has an
aggressive cost-cutting plan to shed as many as 25,000 jobs, so there are
not many more savings to be had from that quarter. Then, starting in 1996,
competitors will be allowed to enter the domestic gas market in stages until
a fully competitive market is reached in 1998.
There is always a possibility that these pressures could force BG to
overstep Brown's warning and actually cut its dividend. But analysts doubt
very much that that will happen.
Nick Antill, at Hoare Govett, says the worst for which shareholders should
brace themselves is an unchanged dividend over the period of the market
restructuring. 'Neither balance sheet or cash flow considerations justify
worrying about a cut,' he writes in a research note.
The analysts at NatWest Securities take a similar view. They think BG can
maintain its dividend over the transitional period provided it gets good
profits from its unregulated exploration and production businesses, although
the dividend cover will fall.
At Kleinwort Benson, Paul Spedding also sees no dividend increase for the
time being, at least in real terms, and he sympathises with Sid's
predicament. 'He must be heartily fed up with all the bad news,' Spedding
says, 'and now he doesn't know what his dividend is going to be next year.'
As Spedding points out, BG shares are yielding 6.7 per cent, which is more
than you get in a building society account. But the lower-yielding water and
electricity sectors offer much better dividend growth prospects, and many BG
investors may prefer to switch to escape the nightmare once and for all.

There was a time when guests of the Lord Mayor of London strode into his
official residence, the Mansion House, under a pediment depicting 'The City
of London trampling on Envy and receiving the benefits of Plenty'.
The pediment is still there, but guests on Wednesday slipped in through a
side-door, now the devalued main entrance, to hear Ken Clarke give the
chancellor's annual speech to the Mayor and City. He promised that the
government had forsworn boom-time policies based on 'a fraudulent,
inflationary, feel-good factor', which inevitably led to busts.
But if the Government has stomped on inflation, where are the benefits of
growth? A raft of economic statistics released this week showed that
inflation was indeed moderate but growth was worryingly weak in some
respects.
The markets had to cope with this and several disturbing external factors
such as rising commodity prices in the US and acute tension over North
Korea. Commendably, London equities held their own even as their nemesis,
the European bond markets, fell further. Despite these pressures, the FT-SE
100 index slipped only 33 points to end the week at 3,022.9.
A rising stock market is a leading indicator, running perhaps some 18 months
ahead of economic growth. Judging from the accompanying chart, however, the
stock market has been ambling along over recent years, foreshadowing very
moderate growth at best.
This year and next, gross domestic product will rise by 2.8 per cent,
according to the consensus forecast of 36 predominantly City firms. But four
of them - Citibank, Kleinwort Benson, Panmure Gordon and Robert Fleming -
expect growth to be well below 2 per cent next year.
The gloomsters were quick to seize on the dark lining to every silver cloud
in the economic sky this week. Factory output prices rose only 0.1 per cent
in May from the previous month, but input prices were up 0.9 per cent thanks
to higher prices for oil and other commodities. Retail prices excluding
mortgages were up 2.5 per cent in May from a year earlier but sales volume
was virtually flat. The growth rate of average earnings moderated slightly
in April to 3.75 per cent but the unemployment rate slipped 0.1 of a
percentage point to 9.4 per cent in May.
Kleinwort Benson identifies a number of weaknesses in the economy. These
include: the wearing off of the one-off boost to consumer spending from
lower interest rates; stagnant employment growth, which will lead to only a
moderate rise in real personal disposable income; particularly meagre export
orders, now that the post-ERM devaluation benefits have passed; and the
creation of a fiscal policy, due to the government's extensive spending
cuts, which is 'even more deflationary than the Howe budget of 1981'.
Given this flaccid economic outlook, there is no reason for an interest rate
rise, Kleinworts said. In fact, close scrutiny of the minutes of meetings
between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie
George, show that the chancellor is aware the economy might slow and that he
is prepared to act if it did.
For his part, governor George told the Mansion House audience that a rise in
interest rates would be the right response to underlying strength in the
economy and the prospect of rising inflation. This was taken by some in the
City to mean that interest rates were about to rise.
But for Robin Aspinall of Panmure Gordon, the risks lie on the downside. He
believes that the Governor is too obsessed by the danger of inflation. 'We
are rapidly approaching the point where the economy will demand still-lower
interest rates, yet Eddie's paranoia threatens us with the biggest economic
error of judgment since Nigel Lawson was made chancellor.'
If rising oil prices did anybody any good this week, it was British
Petroleum and Lasmo. BP shares ended the week at 411 1/2 p, matching their
all-time high. Buying of the stock continues strong on both sides of the
Atlantic and will accelerate if, as expected, the Clinton administration
approves the export of oil from BP's Alaskan fields.
For Lasmo, a rising oil price could float it off the rock of Enterprise's
takeover offer. The bidder marginally improved its terms on Tuesday; no cash
is on offer but Lasmo shareholders would end up with 44.5 per cent of the
enlarged group rather than the 40 per cent first proposed.
But Lasmo shares are a good play on the crude price. A number of key
institutions holding both Lasmo and Enterprise shares might prefer to
maximise that opportunity by keeping the two companies separate. The offer
closes on July 1.
A number of departures of varying kinds were flagged by companies this week.
Amstrad is moving away from 'pile-it-high, sell-it-cheap' retailing by
buying Viglen, a maker and direct seller of computers; Glaxo is saying
goodbye to Sir Paul Girolami, its chairman through its breath-taking organic
growth. He distrusted acquisitions so the company might now warm-up to a
large takeover; EMAP turned itself into the third-largest publisher of
consumer magazines in France through Pounds 108m of purchases; and Central
Railway launched a Pounds 6m placing, seed money for its multi-billion pound
plan to build a 180-mile railway from Leicester to the Channel Tunnel. It
would be the first new mainland route in more than 50 years.
If Central's trains ever run, they would plunge through the Eurotunnel
portal in Kent. Judging by Eurotunnel's plunging share price this week ahead
of the close next week of its rescue rights issue, a pediment should be
erected over the entrance: 'Bankers trampling on equity and receiving the
benefits of penury'.

'This time it's going to be different.' It is the regular plea of the
salesman, the politician and the bad payer, but prudent long-term investors
will prefer to assume that things will stay much the same. We even had a
rail strike this week to remind us of the old days.
Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, told the City on Wednesday that there would not
be another boom-and-bust cycle. But many Tory backbenchers see tax-cutting
as the only means by which they might salvage their parliamentary seats at
the next general election. In any case, coldly calculating City investors
will reason that in two or three years' time the Tories could be swept away
and replaced by a Tony Blair-led Labour government with a commitment to full
employment.
So far, certainly, the British economic recovery looks like a throwback to
the past. Consumer spending has been the engine of recovery, based on a
falling rate of savings, and import volumes have been rising faster than
export volumes. Compare this with the recovery now beginning in Germany,
where domestic consumption is flat but export orders are rising sharply.
History suggests that although the Treasury may not repeat its mistakes it
is liable to make a new one. This is the department, remember, that guided
the British economy into the Lawson boom of the late 1980s, when an economic
miracle was declared; that steered the economy into a deep recession that
John Major had said need never happen; and next, directed us into the
European exchange rate mechanism which we would never be forced to leave. As
for current policy, it is ill-defined but is somehow based on regular
discussions between Kenneth Clarke and Eddie George at the Bank of England,
who between them will manipulate short-term interest rates at precisely the
right time.
But they are like old soldiers re-running the D-Day invasion when today's
battles are developing elsewhere. The big problems now concern long-term
interest rates, which have been rocketing up all year. Not only has this
taken the Treasury by surprise but it shows little inclination to grasp what
is going on or to realise that there will be important policy implications.
Kenneth Clarke's contribution on Wednesday was, rudely, to accuse the City
markets of being 'schizophrenic' in that traders and investors were
panicking over inflation when the analysts and economists in the next office
were forecasting that the government's targets would be immaculately
reached.
Personally, I can no longer use the word schizophrenic in this column. When
I do, the Schizophrenia Association of Great Britain complains that I am
trivialising a distressing condition. Quite. In any case, Clarke has got it
completely wrong, in two ways.
The allegedly perspicacious analysts, are part of the sales teams used by
the big securities houses to persuade investors to buy stocks and bonds,
including billions of British government gilts. There is no reason why
traders and investors should take what they say at face value, any more than
they should have put their money behind Clarke's promises on Thursday
morning (which they did not).
Secondly, it is misleading to suggest that inflation is the main problem.
Certainly, many investors are expecting some cyclical pick-up over the next
year or two (to 4 per cent by the end of next year, according to the latest
Smith New Court/Gallup opinion survey). Yet this scarcely explains why gilt
yields have jumped by more than two percentage points this year, still less
why German ten-year bond yields this week rose above corresponding returns
on US Treasuries.
Could it be that we are finally heading for the global capital shortage
which has been much predicted? It was temporarily deferred by last year's
speculative bond market bubble but, with economic recovery now getting under
way in continental Europe, the conditions for a serious global capital
squeeze are slotting into place. The boom continues in the third world, and
the former Communist states of eastern Europe are accelerating, not least in
their demands for imported capital. Investment demands are rising globally.
Only the continued recession in Japan offers a moderating influence and a
compensating flow of savings.
A couple of years ago, the Treasury mapped out its recovery strategy against
the background of a growing and liquid global bond market. The UK could run
very large twin deficits - a public sector borrowing requirement which
peaked at Pounds 43bn in 1993 and a balance of payments deficit which was
Pounds 11bn last year and is likely to rise. We could live beyond our means
and borrow the difference. A recovery based on high consumption and
declining savings could be tolerated. Sometime like, er, 1999 we would
eventually return to balance.
The UK was not, of course, alone in this. Too many countries have tried to
put their snouts in the same trough. Some face worse problems, such as Spain
and Italy where government bond yields are above 10 per cent.
In a world of scarce capital, borrowing is not a cheap and easy option. Even
last year the Bank of England was reluctant to issue long-dated gilts at 7
per cent or less, but now it faces market rates of over 8 1/2 per cent. The
policy response is likely to be to roll over the accumulating deficit on a
short-term basis, largely through the banks, but that will threaten loss of
monetary control (now troubling the Bundesbank) and an eventual confidence
crisis.
A different economic strategy is required: further tax increases to curb
consumption and reduce the deficits. In a growing world economy there is
scope to rely much more heavily on exports to support output and employment.
And when capital is expensive it pays to be a lender, not a borrower. That
does not look like a way of winning an election. But it really would be
different.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Religion: are we better off without it?: The age-old dispute
between science and religion has resurfaced. But science has the moral high
ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN POSTGATE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is it that a society that has reaped such enormous benefits from science
should have developed such a widespread suspicion and dislike of it?
Consider, for example, the following from a columnist in the The Oldie
magazine. 'Modern science has become a lucrative, prestigious racket,
maintaining its hold over us by force and propaganda . . . It is expensive,
dirty and dangerous. It is eating up the world's resources, spreading filth
over its surface and creating ever more lethal devices . . . Despite the
billions that have been lavished on medical research, there has been . . .
no significant reduction in deaths from cancer and heart disease.'
This shows all the petulant silliness that has informed much recent
anti-science writing, and reflects a widespread outlook, which almost always
includes a Christian or Islamic bias. Why has the old dispute between
religion and science resurfaced in so crude a form?
The reason, I suggest, is that science has come to occupy the high ground of
morality, which has prompted bizarre attacks against it. Moral superiority
may seem an odd defence against accusations that science is responsible for
almost all of the environmental and social problems of the modern world, but
the effect of science is not the central issue. It is an old truth that
science is neutral, that its applications are as good, or as evil, as people
make them.
Some recent attacks on science have been more subtle. It has been argued
that the neutrality of science means that it is dehumanising. Being neutral,
it imposes no spiritual or moral value. It denies the existence of God and
rejects any transcendental purpose to justify our existence. It belittles
mankind's status in the universe, and threatens a reductionist, materialist
interpretation of our thinking and being; it dismisses the possibility of
rewards and retribution in an after-life, and enjoins no imperatives towards
goodness, kindness, altruism, or even considerate behaviour towards one's
fellows. In short, it is amoral as well as inhuman.
I will not rehearse the counter-arguments, that science is as spiritually
rewarding as a religious experience. Arguments about spirituality are
sterile, but those about morality are not. And science is far from being
amoral; it imposes a stern, austere morality on its practitioners, one which
pervades their lives and
results from the fundamental nature of science.
Science is a continual linking together of observations and experiences,
codified as self-consistent logical structures (catalogues, hypotheses and
theories) into what we call knowledge. It requires a particular way of
thinking about the world, which we call reasoning.
This is not to say that scientific inspiration is necessarily rational;
often it is not. But before an observation or concept becomes part of the
logical structures of science, it must be seen to be rational when
dovetailed into the existing body of knowledge.
Those structures are constantly open to challenge and modification, which is
the crucial difference between science and religion. There are no dogmas, no
absolute certainties, in science; what are thought and spoken of as
scientific truths are simply probabilities so high that we can treat them as
if they were certainties. Science approaches ever closer to the truth, but
never gets there. So for a scientist there is no absolute truth.
Why, then, does anyone bother to seek knowledge? For the same reasons that a
baby or a puppy explores the world around it; there is no other way. The
more we understand our surroundings and can foresee opportunities and
events, the safer and happier we feel. This search for what we call
scientific truth imposes its own morality of honesty, co-operation and
sharing.
These virtues are imposed not by priests or mystical authority, but by
utterly practical considerations. You do not, as a scientist, advance
knowledge or your own reputation if you are guilty of deception, or
self-deception; nor if you disregard unwelcome or inconsistent evidence, nor
yet if you conceal rather than share data.
Why? Because deception, plagiarism and falsification of evidence will be
found out, usually very soon; self-deception will engender contempt;
concealment, such as failure to publish, will be self-defeating through loss
of scientific credit; but above all such behaviour will delay scientific
progress.
Of course, there are scientific cheats and fraudsters, but they are happily
rare. The most common transgression today is probably concealment. It
happens for reasons ranging from industrial or military secrecy to gaining
an advantage in a race for publication. It rarely amounts to more than a
delay in announcing one's findings, and it is always shaming. Fudging
results to support a point of view is probably the next most common
transgression, but it is rare because every scientist knows it is ultimately
pointless.
Of course, scientific communities have their share of jealousy, greed,
prejudice and envy, but all scientists know that in the end progress depends
on openness and the sharing of data. Opinions and convictions may be held as
strongly as in any walk of life, but a window of open-mindedness and
self-criticism is essential.
This becomes a general outlook which can make scientists exasperating to
live with; it is also the reason why so few scientists are to be found in
politics, or hold religious beliefs. Those scientists who are religious have
to think in compartments, closing down for religious thought the critical
faculties that they would use for scientific work.
Yet in spite of the strong moral foundation of science and the material
progress which it has delivered, scientists must be careful not to
underestimate the benefits of the world's religions. They have given
purpose, morality and social coherence to people's lives. They have nurtured
art, learning and literature and, in earlier times, produced the substantial
technical and material benefits which stemmed from religious architecture
and land use.
So if one counts up the benefits of science and religion, the score is
roughly equal. But the world's religions have also brought the horrors of
human sacrifice, crusades, pogroms and inquisitions. In the modern world
this darker side of religion has become dangerous. For unlike science,
religion is not neutral; it tells people what to do. And one of the things
it tells them is, 'Kill the infidel'.
Just consider, for example, Ulster, Yugoslavia, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Sudan,
Kashmir, Armenia and Azerbaijan to-day; observe Protestant, Catholic,
Serbian and Russian Orthodox Christians, Jews, Shia and Suni Moslems,
Hindus, Sikhs and minor sects, in their tens and hundreds of thousands,
murdering each other, often in revoltingly medieval ways. All in the name of
their god or gods.
It is sometimes claimed that the conflicts are not religious but ethnic,
tribal, nationalist or political. A few surely are - especially in Africa,
for example, where genuine tribalism persists - but try asking those who are
sniping and shelling in Bosnia, shouting slogans in Tehran and Baghdad,
sacking temples in Kashmir, shooting tourists in Egypt, planting bombs in
British shopping malls.
Some say that these fundamentalist killers are deviants, distorting the true
teachings of their religion and perverting its morality; that these
modern-day holy wars are a negative fall-out of religion, analogous to the
pollution, environmental damage and unethical experiments which disfigure
the applications of science.
There is something in this, but it does not stand up to close examination.
Most religions do indeed forbid killing; a few of the belligerents are
mindless thugs, sadistically disobeying this injunction; but most such
fighters are ordinary people, following a religious imperative. They find
support from their myths and texts, among their priests and their silent
co-religionists, because retribution is part of religion. In some devious
way they are convinced that they are carrying out their god's will.
Therein lies the moral advantage of science. Its morality is incompatible
with such imperatives: scientific principles, and logic, cannot be construed
as incitement to mass killing, or even individual murder. Science has had
its back-sliders: a few scientists have shown themselves capable of murder
in the name of research, as happened in Nazi Germany and Japanese prison
camps during the second world war. Doubtless, too, there are enthusiastic
participants in the current spate of religious conflicts who, in another
compartment of their minds, are moral and dedicated scientists.
Every walk of life has its aberrants, but can you imagine scientists, in
hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands even, arming themselves and
murdering, torturing and maiming their fellow beings for some scientific
principle or 'truth'? Many people will need religion for decades to come,
probably for centuries, because science is comparatively young and the
morality it imposes, by example and not precept, is still inaccessible to
many people. But to-day religion, with its backbone of retribution, jihad,
crusade and battle, presents a threat to mankind that is quite as serious as
any of the environmental and social perils attributed to science, and much
more immediate.
A couple of years ago, I remember a scholar of Byzantine history saying he
hoped that 'mankind will soon learn that religion is too important a matter
to kill each other about'. It took me two days to realise how tragically
mistaken that thought was. I wished him to say: 'If only mankind would learn
that religion is too unimportant a matter to kill each other about.'

FT  18 JUN 94 / Inflation worries hit bonds and dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN, GRAHAM BOWLEY and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government bonds slid yesterday while the dollar fluctuated sharply, as
markets were haunted by fears of rising inflation and interest rates and
large budget deficits.
Political uncertainty after the European elections reinforced the bearish
sentiment that has dogged the markets this year. During the week, German,
French and Italian bond prices hit lows for the year.
Meanwhile, US Treasuries were bruised by a falling dollar, climbing
commodity prices and data showing a rise in consumer confidence, all of
which fuelled fears of further US interest rate rises.
Continuing bond market weakness depressed equities in bourses across Europe
and North America. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average ended 34.88
points lower at 3,776.46.
The dollar fell sharply against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM1.6299.
In New York, it lost a further two pfennings to finish at DM1.6095 as
nervous markets reacted badly to a report that the Conference Board, an
independent think tank in New York, had said the dollar might fall 10 per
cent against the D-Mark over the next 18 months.
The US bond market outperformed European markets last week, as German bond
prices fell 3 points, forcing 10-year German yields above US Treasuries for
the first time since last November. The 10-year German Treuhand yield ended
the week at 7.14 per cent, while the 10-year Treasury was at 7.115 per cent.
Ms Marie Owens-Thomsen, international strategist at Midland Global Markets,
said yields on German bonds might rise by another 50 basis points compared
with short-term interest rates, suggesting that European markets would
continue to underperform the US.
Government bond prices are highly volatile, because of thin trading volume.
Large buy or sell orders are causing sharp price movements, and there seems
little hope of any immediate improvement in sentiment.
'Institutions generally don't like to buy falling markets,' said Mr Phillip
Saunders, fixed interest investment director at Guinness Flight. 'Indeed,
with the end of the quarter in sight, some people are throwing in the towel'
and selling bonds.
Italian bonds posted the worst losses last week amid concern about the new
government's handling of the budget deficit.
The difference between Italian and German 10-year bond yields, which
reflects investor confidence, widened to 388 basis points from 310 a week
earlier. The UK bond market outperformed other European markets.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Heseltine eager to remain at DTI: Trade secretary insists he
has no desire to be Tory chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine yesterday ruled himself out as next chairman of the
Tory party and insisted he wanted to remain in his present post as trade and
industry secretary.
Mr Heseltine took the unusual step of openly declaring his wish to stay in
his present position in an interview with the BBC. His comments were
immediately interpreted as a show of disloyalty to Mr John Major.
'My interest is in being president of the board of trade - everybody knows
that,' Mr Heseltine said.
'I think there have been too many changes in this department over the course
of the last years and my interest is in staying where I am,' he added.
Mr Heseltine's reluctance to fill the vacancy caused by Sir Norman Fowler's
decision to stand down is thought to stem partly from a desire not to tie
his own fortunes too closely to those of Mr John Major, thereby scuppering
his own leadership ambitions.
Speculation about Sir Norman's successor has mounted since Thursday when he
announced his intention to step down at the time of the reshuffle.
Yesterday's suggestion that Mr Heseltine should succeed came from Mr Kenneth
Baker, a former chairman and cabinet minister.
Mr Heseltine is regarded as the one of most effective and energetic
campaigners in Tory ranks - the man who would restore the party's flagging
morale.
'What is needed now is a wartime chairman,' Mr Baker said. 'He has to be a
street fighter, he has to be combative and he has to be a drum major. The
one who most fills that role certainly would be Michael Heseltine.'
Likening the situation to a Hollywood movie, Mr Baker continued: 'You need a
hard cop and a soft cop and the party chairman has to be a hard cop over the
next two or three years.'
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, is the favourite to succeed Sir Norman
after a year in which he has won widespread plaudits for his confident
campaigning style.
But many Tory backbenchers nursing inadequate majorities see Mr Heseltine as
a better bet to minimise casualties in the next general election. Labour's
strong performance in last week's European elections will probably have
reinforced these views.
Other possible contenders for the post of party chairman include Mrs
Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, and Mr Tony Newton, leader of the
Commons.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Mitsubishi bank's bad loans put at double under US rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Evidence of the damage inflicted on Japanese banks by bad loans emerged
yesterday when Mitsubishi Bank disclosed that its non-performing loans -
calculated by US accounting standards - were almost double the amount
disclosed in Japan.
Mitsubishi, one of the 11 main commercial Japanese banks, is listed on the
New York stock exchange where it is required to file accounts to conform
with Securities and Exchange Commission criteria. It reported bad loans of
Y1,150bn (Pounds 7.3bn) for the year ended March 31, against a figure of
Y572bn yen in its Japanese accounts last month.
In the late 1980s, the so-called 'bubble era', Japanese banks provided vast
sums to companies, many of which indulged in speculative property and stock
investment that cost them dearly when prices collapsed and the economy
contracted.
Under Japanese rules, banks count as non-performing only loans to bankrupt
companies and to those with interest in arrears for six months or more. US
accounting practice requires banks to disclose the amount of restructured
loans, on which interest payments are reduced in order to keep borrowers
afloat.
Japanese banks have been forced to restructure loans to many troubled
clients, but the extent of the damage has been unclear. Mitsubishi disclosed
that its restructured loans jumped by 182 per cent overall in the year,
while its restructured loans to businesses in Japan rose 272 per cent.
According to its Japanese accounts, total problem loans rose by 14 per cent
over the same period.
Mitsubishi is generally regarded as one of the strongest of the Japanese
banks. Its non-performing loans declared in Japan represent 1.8 per cent of
total loans, against a sector average of 3.8 per cent. The US results show
that figure to be closer to 4 per cent, and if other banks' restructured
loans are in the same range as Mitsubishi's, some may have non-performing
loans representing 13 per cent of their loan book.
Another sign of the difficulties of Japanese banks came yesterday when bank
officials suggested that the annual wage increase at the 11 main commercial
banks might be the lowest on record.
Employers have offered a pay rise of just 0.7 per cent in response to union
demands for a 1.5 per cent increase, and the final figure is likely to be
closer to the employers' offer.
Japanese accounting procedures have been widely criticised for not giving a
true picture of bank balance sheets, and investors have had to guess at the
likely total of non-performing loans. In Mitsubishi's case, the most
pessimistic independent estimate - by Salomon Brothers, the US securities
house - put the probable figure around Y740bn, well below the new figures
released.
Banks say they would like to increase their provisions for bad loans but
face opposition from the finance ministry, which is anxious to avoid the
loss in revenue such a measure would have on the country's finances.

FT  18 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: LVMH/Guinness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It did not take the equity market long to figure out that the restructuring
of LVMH's relationship with Guinness might be a better deal for the French
company than first appeared. It has allowed LVMH to focus more closely on
its luxury goods and perfumes business, which has so far enjoyed a stronger
recovery than champagnes and spirits. The result is a 22 per cent rise in
turnover in the first five months and an official forecast of a 30 per cent
rise in first-half earnings. Cognac sales suffered a striking slowdown
during the last couple of months while champagne turnover is up only 10 per
cent so far this year.
On the basis of such figures it is not surprising that LVMH shares have
out-performed Guinness by some 20 per cent since the restructuring was
announced. Yet, it would be wrong to conclude that Guinness had fumbled the
affair. The deal should still turn out to both companies' advantage. The
difference is one of timing.
Given Mr Bernard Arnault's broad ranging ambitions for LVMH, it made sense
for Guinness to home in on the drinks side. Moreover, it added to its
interest in Moet Hennessy at the bottom of the cycle. Economic recovery and
a lower price of grapes should eventually put some fizz back into champagne
sales, while the rising Tokyo stock market may tempt Japan's salarymen to
splash out on expensive drinks again. The trouble, as before with Guinness,
is that recovery is painfully slow. It does not help that no replacement has
yet been found for Mr Crispin Davis, who resigned as head of its spirits
business last October.

FT  18 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Recs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The other regional electricity companies are set to follow Eastern
Electricity down the share buy-back route. This week London and SWALEC said
they would seek authority to buy back up to 10 per cent of their equity.
Southern and SWEB also plan to ask shareholders for permission.
The recs are unlikely to act until Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry
regulator, finalises price caps for their distribution businesses in August.
But it is hard to see the price regime being so tough that their scope to
restructure their balance sheet vanishes. At worst, their current cash
inflow could turn into a modest cash outflow. But, given the starting point
of low or zero gearing, there would still be an opportunity to buy back
equity.
For shareholders, there are three main benefits. First, it should boost
shareholder returns. Second, there would be less danger that rec managements
would embark on foolish diversifications if they were no longer flush with
cash. The record to date has been, at best, patchy. Third, it would be
better to have the cash out now than risk dividend controls or punitive
regulation under a future Labour government. For all Mr Tony Blair's talk
about creating a 'dynamic market economy', that must be a possibility.
Managers have an incentive to buy back shares too. If they do not, they will
attract predators when the government's golden shares expire next year.

FT  18 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Greycoat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's Pounds 47m rights issue from Greycoat underlines how much
baggage many property companies are still carrying. Like Wates City of
London's cash call on Thursday, Greycoat is making a second demand only
months after asking shareholders to rescue it from the brink. Also like
Wates, a large slice of the proceeds will go towards refinancing an existing
property. Greycoat is taking full control because a partner is unwilling to
put up additional funds when outstanding debt falls due. One wonders how
many more recently distressed property companies will be tempted to come
back for a second helping.
By pricing its rights at a 30 per cent discount to net asset value, Greycoat
is at least offering something like fair value. Although the company will
still be 137 per cent geared after the issue, most of its debt is fixed
rate. With its portfolio fully let, servicing the debt burden out of rental
income should not cause sleepless nights. The company's largest properties
are also in the west end of London, where the prospects for rental growth
are brightest.
With some of its largest tenants already paying higher rents than the market
norm, though, much depends on Greycoat's ability to add value though
development. Its interest in sites such as Paternoster Square, near St
Paul's Cathedral, certainly gives plenty of scope. Finding the right
institutional partners and striking attractive development deals will be the
real test.

FT  18 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Staying afloat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
They scarcely need reminding, but gilts traders will certainly see
yesterday's floating rate auction announcement as another sign of how
difficult market conditions have become. The Bank of England has not
auctioned conventional medium-dated stock since February. While the floating
rate device spares the need for abrupt cancellation of auctions in the
unfortunate manner of Germany, Austria and Spain, it must hope that normal
business can be resumed soon. There are sensible reasons for issuing
floating rate debt, but they will fail to convince if such auctions become a
habit.
As long as the Bank believes in its own ability to hold inflation down - and
therefore base rates at reasonable levels - floating rate borrowing may turn
out cheap. The trouble is that the more frequently the Bank issues floating
rate debt, the more its critics will worry that it is adding to inflationary
risk. Some economists are already anxious about the expansion of M0 money
supply and the low real level of short-term interest rates. Since the main
buyers of floating rate gilts are banks, they will fret that the Bank is
monetising government debt as well.
Such mutterings are muted at present. But they are bound to grow louder if
many more floating rate issues appear. That speaks for the occasional large
issue rather than a continuing series of smaller ones. The first floating
rate gilt was a modest Pounds 2.5bn affair that has proved to be illiquid.
The Bank would appear under better control of its funding policy if it now
risked a much larger floating deal. It could then announce that no more
floating issues were to follow and that it would not return to the fixed
rate market until conditions really do improve.

FT  18 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Triple-witching expiry
unnerves Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US shares prices retreated yesterday in the face of a sell-off in bonds and
a powerful wave of trading related to the triple-witching expiration of
futures and options, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 34.56 at 3,776.78, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 3.48 at 458.45. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite receded 1.52 to 440.26, and the
Nasdaq slumped 5.62 to 729.35 amid fresh weakness in the technology sector.
Although there was no first-tier economic news to drive the market, activity
was robust. Investors were busy unwinding positions linked to quarterly
options on individual stocks and market indices, and future contracts on the
indices.
Some 373m shares were exchanged on the NYSE. Trading accelerated in the
final hours of the session, as the triple-witching activity tripped a
battery of program-guided orders. Declining issues swamped advances 1,405 to
760.
Unfortunately for investors, the program trading exaggerated a negative move
inspired by plunging bond prices. The benchmark 30-year government security
fell nearly a point, as traders reacted nervously to a third consecutive
monthly rise in consumer confidence. The University of Michigan consumer
sentiment index came in at 94.5, compared with 92.8 in May.
Bond traders were even more disturbed by a fresh rise in commodity prices
and a sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the D-mark.
Despite the sour mood in general, there were no strong sectoral trends
dragging stocks down. The Dow components were broadly lower, led by cyclical
issues. 3M was down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 50 7/8 , DuPont lost Dollars 1
to Dollars 60 3/8 and International Paper slipped Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars
70 3/4 . Boeing was down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 48 3/8 .
Exxon, which shot down and then up during the week, levelled off at Dollars
58 5/8 , finishing with no change on the day. Chevron lost Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 43 1/2 after Smith Barney Shearson downgraded the issue.
Relative calm returned to banking stocks after two days of heavy selling.
Most issues were down marginally, but First Interstate shed a further
Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 75 3/4 and First Chicago fell Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 49 3/8 .
The spotlight yesterday turned to Quaker Oats. The stock jumped Dollars 7
1/4 , or more than 10 per cent, to Dollars 78 5/8 . The gain was struck on
speculation that either Nestle or H J Heinz was interested in acquiring the
food group. Quaker declined to comment.
In semiconductors, Micron Technology dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 33 1/2
and Texas Instruments Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 78 1/8 .
On the Nasdaq, technology issues came under renewed fire. Lotus Development
was marked down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 51 5/8 , in spite of the
announcement that it was buying Softswitch, a communications software
supplier. Analysts said the deal was a good strategic move.
On the Amex, Cheyenne Software plunged Dollars 8 1/2 or 51.9 per cent to
Dollars 7 7/8 after issuing a profits warning.
Canada
Toronto stocks closed slightly lower in moderate trading, with the TSE 300
composite index down 6.67 in 60.6m shares valued at CDollars 746.8m.
Advances and declines were almost even, with advances outpacing declines 361
to 360.
Ten of the 14 stock groups ended lower, with the banking sector recording
the largest drop of 1.50 per cent. Consumer products and industrial products
fell slightly, energy stocks were flat, and mining rose moderately.
Golds jumped 2.95 per cent on index.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo were up 6.72 per cent, helped by active trading ahead
of Monday's options settlement.
The Bovespa index climbed 2,037 to reach a high for the day of 32,376 in
volume of Cr616.7bn (Dollars 266m).

FT  18 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Weak bonds, derivatives
closures hit bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a morning recovery, a serious weakening in bond market sentiment hit
bourses hard again in the afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
In some cases, the bourses' problems were exacerbated by added volatility on
the closure of futures and options contracts.
FRANKFURT seemed to be negotiating its way through the DTB options
minefield, the Dax index closing just 4.19 lower on the session at 2,050.72
and down 3.9 per cent on the week. But the closure process extended into the
afternoon, when equities were hit by bond market weakness and a report of
management changes at Deutsche Bank.
Deutsche Bank denied the report that a board member, Mr Rolf Breuer, was to
be relieved of his responsibility as head of securities trading. But, said
Mr Nigel Longley at Commerzbank, the market was already edgy following the
arrest of the managing director of Procedo, the factoring company, and the
revelation of derivatives trading on a massive scale at Balsam, Procedo's
biggest customer.
Turnover soared on the DTB closures, from DM6.7bn to DM25.6bn. In the post
bourse, Deutsche Bank fell to DM722.50 and the Ibis-indicated Dax to
2,031.80. A further drop on Monday would threaten the closing low of
2,020.33 for 1994.
PARIS drifted at the end of a week which saw the CAC-40 index slide more
than 4 per cent, in spite of further good news that economic recovery was on
course. The index eased 6.86 to 1,935.95.
The highlights of the session were Schneider and LVMH, both up against the
trend after forecasting higher profits in 1994. Schneider rose FFr8.10 to
FFr365 and LVMH FFr5 to FFr840.
Rhone-Poulenc slipped FFr3 to FFr127, but dealers said that it was largely
unaffected by news that it was to recall a batch of its antibiotic drug as a
precaution after one of the bottles was tampered with.
Eurotunnel suffered further as fears arose that it would fail to get its
rights issue away, the shares finishing down FFr1.15 at FFr25.65.
ZURICH, once again, saw a firm trend early in the day dispelled in the last
hour. The SMI index fell 39.0 to 2,627.6 for a 4.9 per cent decline on the
week.
Banks, the hardest hit sector, remained under pressure. UBS bearers lost
SFr25 to SFr1,115, for a fall over the week of 9.1 per cent. CS Holding
bearers lost SFr17 to SFr533, off 10.1 per cent.
Among the large blue chips, Nestle gave up SFr12 to SFr1,133 and Roche
dropped SFr80 to SFr6,520.
MILAN remained concerned about the outlook for interest rates and the
constitutional court ruling on pensions that could cost the government up to
L30,000bn. The Comit index finished 1.79 lower at 698.90, down 7.6 per cent
on the week, amid rumours that the sharp fall in prices earlier in the week
was the result of selling by domestic brokerages to cover the cost of losses
in the bond markets.
Fiat bucked the trend with a L56 rise to L6,256.
Mondadori lost L720 to L15,660 but remained solidly over the L15,000 price
set for the public offering and placement of 66m shares, which ended
yesterday.
MADRID was half a percentage point higher at midday but it closed with the
general index down 3.52 at a new 1994 low of 307.79, down 5.4 per cent on
the week.
Utilities fared badly. Dealers said that there was a huge seller in
Sevillana, down Pta32 at Pta638; and Iberdrola, which fell Pta29 to Pta936
was hit like Pryca, the retailer, by its high weighting in the Ibex, real
time index. Futures and options dealers were selling baskets of Ibex stocks
in the cash market as contracts expired.
AMSTERDAM, too, had to endure the volatility of options expiry and the AEX
index closed the day down 3.12 at a new 1994 low of 392.62, for a week's
fall of 3.4 per cent.
KPN, the partially privatised telecommunications and postal group, closed
its first week of trading off 40 cents at Fl 49.30, 45 cents below its issue
price.
ISTANBUL continued to improve with a 4.7 per cent gain on the day and up 16
per cent on the week. The composite index rose 911.78 to 20,233.45, in spite
of mid-session profit-taking.
Turnover was TL1,26bn.

FT  18 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo recovery hopes bring back
memories - Prospects for Japanese equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brisk sales of the Kabushiki Shimbun, one of Japan's financial tabloids
catering to retail investors; a rally in speculative favourites such as
ball-bearing companies or sewing machine makers; and the sharp rise in daily
market volumes. In Tokyo's equity market, this combination has brought back
memories of the boom days in the late 1980s.
The sudden realisation that the economy and corporate earnings may be in for
a recovery has prompted a rally which, many Japanese brokers hope, will pull
the Tokyo market out of its four-year slump.
'The whole market is looking like a cyclical stock,' says Mr Jeff
Bahrenburg, a strategist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. Corporate profits were
better than expected for the past year - down 16 per cent before tax rather
than the forecast 25 per cent - and a flow of data suggests that the economy
has stopped falling, at least.
The catalyst for the recent rally has been active buying by foreign
institutions, which have been shifting funds to Tokyo due to the weakness in
global stock and bond markets. While net buying has been unable to better
the levels earlier this year, when overseas investors bought record amounts
of Japanese shares, the rise in share prices has triggered further buying by
domestic investors, eager not to be left behind.
The strong rise, says Mr Bahrenburg, indicates that 'people have come to
grips with the potential growth'. Although higher share prices have pushed
up the price to earnings ratio for the Nikkei to over 100, the figure
anticipates a firm rise in profits over a two- to three-year span.
On conservative estimates, he says earnings for the corporate sector could
grow by 152 per cent in the next five years, against real economic of 2.7
per cent. This predicates a 42 per cent potential rise in the Nikkei, the
bulk of it coming over two to three years.
However, unlike the 'bubble' era in the 1980s, when every investor
participated in frenzied buying, many domestic institutions remain
unconvinced of a sustainable rally. While some, not wanting to be left out
of the rally have cautiously joined in, many fund managers do not believe
that they should be buying stocks actively at current levels.
Mr Yasuhiko Jinza, stock investment manager at Nippon Life, the country's
largest institutional investor, regards current price levels as an
'overshoot'. 'Once the foreign buying stops, the optimism is likely to
fade,' he says, adding that Japanese stocks will not look attractive unless
the Nikkei index falls below the 20,000 level.
Japan's life insurance companies are smarting from the low return on assets,
mainly due to the buying of low-yielding equities in the late 1980s. The
leading 27 life insurers are looking at an average 4.3 per cent on their
Y148,000bn of assets, lower than the 4.96 per cent needed to cover payouts
to policy holders. 'I know people are talking about us coming back into the
market, but it's just not going to happen,' says Mr Jinza.
With rising interest rates in the US threatening liquidity inflow, foreign
buying is expected to start falling. The question many market participants
are now asking is where share prices will go from here.
Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel in Tokyo, says that individual
investors, who have been absent for the past few years, could be wooed away
from low-yielding fixed interest investments and take the place of overseas
fund managers.
Evidence that this is already happening can be seen in the rally of retail
market favourites, slightly low quality, speculative stocks such as Oki
Electric and Towa Real Estate. A recent stock market survey indicated that
the percentage of individual investors holding equities earlier this year
rose by 2.8 points to 23.7 per cent, the first rise in five years.
Meanwhile an additional concern for investors is the large outstanding
arbitrage position. According to the Tokyo stock exchange, long arbitrage
positions as of last Monday totalled Y1.46bn, slightly lower than the record
high Y1.49bn in April 1992. A build up of arbitrage balance puts share
prices in a vulnerable position against negative news once trading volumes
start to fall.
For the next few months, says Mr Alexander Kinmont, a strategist at Morgan
Stanley in Tokyo, there are two possible scenarios. Individuals could pile
in, sending the Nikkei up into the 23,000-24,000 range, followed by a
correction; or small lot buying by domestic investors could push prices
gradually forward.
During the summer, when trade talks between the US and the Group of Seven
summit talks are scheduled to be held, volatility in the yen could cause
fluctuations in the stock market. The attractiveness of Japanese shares for
overseas investors could change in the face of weakness or strength in other
leading stock markets.
Mr James at James Capel believes that a correction is likely during the
summer months, but sees the downside of the market to be around 20,000. He
expects that the spate of interim earnings estimates and previews will bring
some cheer into the market, and forecasts the Nikkei around the 21,000 level
at the end of September.

Rising hopes over increasing dialogue between North Korea and the US, and
the weakening of the yen encouraged buying but selling around the 21,500
level stunted the day's rise, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 135.83 to 21,503.30, up 0.5 per cent on the
week, after a low of 21,398.68 and a high of 21,572.41 in the morning
session on arbitrage buying. Heavy selling by financial institutions
countered foreign and individual buying.
Volume rose to 500m shares from 381m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks gained 7.00 to 1,705.53 and the Nikkei 300 1.08 to 309.63. Gainers
led losers by 683 to 342 with 158 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei
50 index rose 3.25 to 1399.87.
Analysts said that a further rise of the market depended on the
participation of private investors: a rise in individual favourites was an
encouraging sign, but retail investors tended to be short-term players.
Oki Electric Industry, the most active issue of the day, rose Y40 to Y815 on
foreign and individual buying. Isuzu Motors also gained Y22 to Y559 on
retail support.
Financial institutions bought cheap laggard car stocks, with Fuji Heavy
Industries rising Y13 to Y500 and Mitsubishi Motors advancing Y26 to Y989.
Foreign investors picked up chemical and textile stocks, with Unitika, a
textile maker, up Y17 to Y405 and Nippon Zeon, in a synthetic rubber, by Y21
to Y575.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y3,000 to Y845,000 but East Japan
Railway gained Y5,000 to Y508,000.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 172.59 to 23,783.14 in volume of 72.5m
shares.
Roundup
Mixed fortunes affected the region's markets.
HONG KONG recovered most of Thursday's fall on a late round of bargain
hunting and arbitrage-related buying.
The Hang Seng index closed up 91.04 or 1 per cent at 9,113.96, barely
changed on the week, in turnover up from HKDollars 2.93bn to HKDollars
3.13bn. However, the key index did recover from a fall below the 9,000 level
just after the opening, and the June index futures contract closed 210
higher at 9,180.
Cheung Kong lost 25 cents to HKDollars 36.25, having reached a low of
HKDollars 35.25 earlier on fears that property sales would be affected by
the government campaign to cool down the overheated property market.
SEOUL moved strongly ahead on expectations that the North Korean nuclear
crisis would be resolved peacefully.
The composite index rose 17.46 to 918.54, up 1.9 per cent on the day and 1
per cent on the week.
Turnover was Won684.05bn after Thursday's Won565.29bn.
BOMBAY finished at a 26-month high as both domestic and foreign investors
came into the market on the first day of the new account. The BSE index rose
102.62 or 2.4 per cent to 4,290.37, barely changed on the week.
Brokers said that the rally was mainly led by buying in Reliance Industries
and Tata Iron and Steel, the former up Rp6.25 at Rp397.50 and the latter up
Rp3.75 at Rp300.
TAIPEI turned cautious after its recent volatility, the weighted index
rising 10.10 to 6,159.74, up 2.7 per cent on the week, as turnover fell to
TDollars 68.6bn from Thursday's TDollars 96.04bn.
Selected banking stocks with high profit expectations attracted buying:
China Trust, the day's second most active issue, rose TDollars 1.50 to
TDollars 72.
MANILA was depressed by a sharp drop in PLDT after analysts lowered their
earnings forecasts. The telephone group's shares lost 3.6 per cent to 1,735
pesos, pulling the composite index down 33.73 to 2,882.83.
The newly listed Megaworld Properties bucked the trend, rising 1.85 per cent
to 5.50 pesos. The debuts of the shipping group, Negros Navigation, and the
ice cream company, Selecta, were expected to give the market further
incentive next week.
Turnover was 707.9m pesos.
SYDNEY retreated slightly as activity was undermined by the continued
weakness in the bond market. The All Ordinaries index fell 4.8 to 2,051.2,
in turnover of ADollars 472.6m, off 0.8 per cent on the week.

Dealers reported a dull and uneventful expiry of the June index options and
index futures, leaving traders to focus on weaker gilts and early losses on
Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo.
The mid-morning expiry in futures saw the June contract finish trading at
3,038 on volume of 6,083 lots. September, the new market leader after June's
close, finished at 3,013, at a 5 point discount to cash, on volume of 16,341
lots.
Turnover in traded options was 36,942 contracts, of which 19,758 was dealt
in the FT-SE 100 option.

FT  18 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel weak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel tumbled another 15 to 288p, in heavy
trade of 1.6m, as selling pressure overwhelmed buying orders from clients of
the company broker S G Warburg's.
In spite of continuous bidding for stock from Warburg, market watchers
continued to suggest that large institutions were unlikely to take up their
rights in the company's Pounds 858m issue. They also warned that the
continuing slide in the share price had begun to undermine the confidence of
the small shareholders in one of the UK's biggest cash calls ahead of its
close on Wednesday. One broker said: 'There is little appetite for small
holders to take up the issue.'
Sentiment was further weakened when UBS yesterday reiterated its
long-standing sell recommendation. UBS said: 'We believe the shares are
fundamentally overvalued even at the rights price of 265p.'
Food retailers continued strong yesterday with J Sainsbury leading the
charge amid talk of prospective US support. Britain's biggest grocer
confirmed it is to visit institutional shareholders in New York and Boston
to host meetings with US fund managers, although it denied market talk in
London that it will apply for a 'big board', or full, listing in New York to
facilitate greater US liquidity in its shares. Sainsbury shares are already
traded in ADR form on Wall Street.
Back in London, dealers said that pent-up demand for the leading food retail
stocks, which have been slowly creeping back into favour in recent weeks,
has been causing stock shortages and pushing up prices. Some more
longer-term investors have also been spurred by renewed speculation that
food price inflation will return to the system by the year-end.
Sentiment has also been helped by broker research - notably from NatWest
Securities - which forecasts a continuing lean time for food manufacturers
as food retailers maintain pressure on margins. Sainsbury shares motored 12
1/2 to 416 1/2 p on 6m traded, Tesco gained 5 1/2 to 229 1/2 p with 6.1m
turned over, while Argyll's good run faltered and stayed steady at 252p.
Northern Ireland Electricity was a lone bright spot in the electricity/power
generation area of the market after Hoare Govett, the stockbroker,
highlighted the short-, medium- and long-term attractions of the stock. The
shares rose 7 to 221p.
Hoare's utilities team pointed out that the stock's recent underperformance
against the sector was because of the impending and final 120p call on the
shares, due on June 28. The shares trade in fully paid form from Monday.
Property developer Greycoat, which underwent a financial restructuring last
year, unveiled a three-for-eight rights issue at 13p a share to raise Pounds
47m. The shares slipped 1 1/2 to 15 1/2 p.
There was speculative buying among both television and radio stocks
yesterday. In the former, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, which has been highlighted by
Granada as a potential bid target, advanced 5 to 315p. The latter added 4
1/2 to 533 1/2 p. Among radio stocks, Capital Radio added 5 to 399p and
Metro Radio 13 to 393p.
A stock overhang left Caradon trailing 11 at 300p. Lucas Industries shed 3
to 175p after Strauss Turnbull was said to have downgraded profit
expectations.
In the transport sector, yield buyers were seen for Ocean Group, and the
shares improved 8 to 263p.

FT  18 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil bid alert
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Enterprise/Lasmo bid battle flared up again with the latter the market's
heaviest traded stock and the former the FT-SE 100's best individual
performer as the takeover saga moved into its closing two weeks.
Lasmo shares underperformed a generally strong oil sector early in the
session, still weighed down by worries that the Enterprise takeover bid will
fail. However, late in the session the stock price perked up, eventually
closing a net 8 higher at 149p after very heavy trade of 15m shares.
Enterprise, meanwhile, were always on the uptick, and raced ahead to 416p
before closing a net 16 1/2 higher at 414 1/2 p with a good 3.5m shares
changing hands.
Close observers of the takeover struggle said that the outcome was much
closer than the market was indicating. Others, however, said that with Lasmo
shares still at a discount to the bid terms - worth around 170p a share -
the odds favoured a Lasmo escape. It was also pointed out that the recent
strong performance of the oil price was making Lasmo's assumptions in its
defence document look increasingly conservative.

FT  18 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP peaks in heavy trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum, the UK's flagship oil company, raced up to an all-time
high of 415p in mid-session before coming off the top and settling a net 3
higher at 411 1/2 p as the stock market became increasingly optimistic about
oil prices.
Brent crude for July delivery was trading around Dollars 16.90 a barrel late
yesterday and looking to move even higher, dealers said. Oil prices have
moved up by around a dollar a barrel over the past week following the Opec
meeting in Vienna, viewed as reasonably successful, a technical squeeze and
increasing worries about the situation in Korea.
Analysts voiced some concern over the current excitement about the possible
lifting of a US ban on exports of Alaskan oil, a move which would provide a
big boost to BP's earnings. 'There is mounting opposition in the US Senate
to a lifting of the ban, which could delay a decision until September,' said
one oil analyst.
It was also pointed out that the Kuwait Investment Office may be taking a
hard look at the performance of crude oil prices and the BP share price with
a view to placing its 9.7 per cent stake of around 540m shares at a
considerable profit. At least one US brokerage is known to have bid for the
KIO stake in BP with a view to placing the stock across the globe.

FT  18 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gains reversed after gilts prompt
late sell-off - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market, encouraged at first by a better tone in global bond
markets, turned off in late dealings yesterday when gilt-edged securities
fell on the announcement that next week's auction of government securities
will be a further tranche of Floating Rate Treasury stock.
The last day of the UK equity trading account was dominated by expiry
operations in derivatives markets in London, Frankfurt and New York. Traders
ascribed an initial gain of nearly 20 points on the Footsie Index to the
traditional book-squaring operations surrounding the expiry, at about
10.20am, of index options and index futures on the London International
Financial Futures (LIFFE) market.
The day's peak of 3,049.7 left intact the upper end of the current trading
range. Shares drifted lower once the derivatives expiry was out of the way
and the Footsie showed a fall of 13.1 at 3,017 as London waited to see if
New York would build on its overnight gain.
The FT-SE Index closed a net 7.2 down at 3,022.9, with the Dow Average 8
points off as London traders set off for home. British Petroleum stocks
continued to do well on the back of more positive views on oil prices, and
both Enterprise Oil and Lasmo, its bid target, strengthened as the market
awaited developments.
The broader market, less closely linked to the derivatives expiries, traded
easier and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell 7.1 to 3,527.1. Seaq business
increased to 736.8m shares from 619.8m on Thursday, with non-Footsie stocks
making up around 62 per cent of the total - a further indication of the
focus on the derivatives-linked blue chips.
The Footsie has fallen by 33 points over a week which has seen investment
confidence challenged by domestic and international factors. The Mansion
House speeches from the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of
the Bank of England failed to unsettle equities in spite of their rejection
of early tax cut suggestions and warning that UK base rates will rise later
this year.
But renewed uncertainty in world bond markets such as oil and commodity
prices has arisen, because at one stage this week international doubts
unsettled shares and continued to overhang markets last night.
Over the two-week account which closed last night, the Footsie has risen by
about 0.8 per cent, leaving the 3,000 mark still a testing level for market
support. UK equities have found it impossible to move far away from this
level over the past month.
Government bonds put on more than half a point in early trading yesterday
before turning off smartly on the news of a Floating Rate auction, which was
seen as an indication that the authorities are as aware as the market of the
uncertain mood of the bond market. By the close, long-dated gilts were a net
 5/32 lower, with the shorts just a touch off on the day.
The gilt-edged team at Yamaichi commented to clients that the bond market is
'caught in the dual grip' of domestic uncertainty on inflation policy and
the global inflation concerns reflected across the broader range of bond
markets. Yamaichi believes that the UK market has established a wide trading
range consistent with these uncertainties. While confident that gilts will
break out higher as investors perceive that inflation concerns have been
overdone, Yamaichi sees a downside risk in the near term.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar dives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar crashed through its technical support level of DM1.6270 in late
trading yesterday when an independent forecaster said it could drop to
DM1.50 against the D-Mark by late 1995, writes Motoko Rich.
Within half an hour of the European markets closing, the dollar dropped
nearly two pfennigs, bringing the day's fall almost three pfennigs in very
light trading.
The US currency had attempted a rally earlier in the day. But concerns about
Federal Reserve Board monetary policy and a jittery Treasury market put the
market in a bearish mood.
The lira was hardest hit in Europe as the European bond markets were routed.
The D-Mark benefitted from a flight of investors to cash.
Markets had already built up a downward momentum against the dollar when the
US currency extended its losses on reports that an economist at the
Conference Board, an independent think tank in New York, saw the potential
for a ten per cent depreciation of the dollar against the D-Mark by late
1995.
Although the precipitous drop was unusual given a lack of hard news, Mr
Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist, said the markets were just
following a normal interbank trading pattern.
'It was a conspiracy of circumstances combined with already bearish
sentiment,' he said. 'The headline came out at 4:30 on a Friday afternoon in
Europe on a day in which there had been very little trading so the market
reacted dramatically.'
In the morning the US currency had attempted to retrieve losses made earlier
in the week. Short covering after the Swiss national bank sold francs on the
forward markets gave the dollar a brief boost but by early afternoon it was
slipping back.
The dollar was quoted at DM1.6070 in after-hours dealings in London after
closing at DM1.6299, down from DM1.6319. It closed at Y103.495 from
Y103.335.
European bond market weakness hit the lira particularly hard as Italian
bonds plunged on fears over Italy's swelling budget deficit and concerns
about the debilitating cost of the country's constitutional court decision
on pension payments.
The D-Mark was the main beneficiary of bond market gloom, holding steady
against most European crosses. 'Investors are generally pursuing risk
reduction and flying into the relative safety of the D-Mark,' said Mr
Avinash Persaud, economist at JP Morgan in London.
The German currency closed against the lira at L983.8 from L981.0. It was
virtually unchanged against the Danish krone and the French franc.
Sterling followed the dollar's late trading fall, losing nearly two pfennigs
against the D-Mark to sell at DM2.4610/20 compared its close in London of
DM2.4765 and DM2.4805 on Thursday. It had closed at Dollars 1.5195 against
the dollar, from Dollars 1.5201.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided liquidity of Pounds
367m after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 350m.
In the futures market, the December Euromark contract ended unchanged at
94.81 and the December short sterling contract closed 93.75 from 93.76.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Bulls in the driving seat
at the LME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullish speculators were active in nearly all London's leading commodity
markets this week.
At the London Metal Exchange highs were reached by aluminium (3-year),
copper (21-month) and lead (20-month); the North Sea oil price spiked above
Dollars 17 a barrel for the first time since last September; and London
Commodity Exchange robusta coffee futures briefly touched 7 1/2 -year highs.
One disappointment, however, was gold's relatively lacklustre response to
deepening concern about the situation on the Korean peninsular.
Copper's climb, which peaked yesterday morning when the three months
delivery position touched Dollars 2,454 a tonne, added Dollars 61.50 to the
Dollars 500 rally that began in mid-April. It continued to be fuelled by US
investment fund buying, encouraged by the improving fundamentals for the
metal.
Aluminium's fundamental's are also perceived to be improving. Although LME
warehouse stock remain at a near-record level a sustained drawdown is widely
expected to begin soon as a result of the voluntary production cuts agreed
by leading producing countries at a meeting in Brussels in January. This
trend is also likely to be helped by increased demand for the metal by car
manufacturers and builders.
After being towed higher in copper's wake LME aluminium prices began to
strengthen on their own account last week. And that performance was
sustained as the market burst through successive resistance areas this week.
At yesterday's close three months metal reached Dollars 1,470.50 a tonne,
adding Dollars 64.25 to last week's Dollars 50 advance. A Dollars 26 rise
yesterday was encouraged by news of a strike call at Norway's Elkem, which
produces 20,000 tonnes a year at its two smelters.
Lead's strength of late has been attributed chiefly to anticipation of
increased buying by car battery manufacturers in preparation for the
northern hemisphere winter. A further boost was given on Thursday, however,
when Metaleurop, a Preussag subsidiary, announced that it planned to halt
primary supply for two months to help reverse the recent heavy build-up in
stocks. That should take about 30,000 tonnes out of the market. The news
contributed to a Dollars 7.25 rise yesterday that left the three months LME
price Dollars 19.50 up on the week at Dollars 559.75 a tonne.
The oil market had several bullish factors to feed off. The Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries decided at its Vienna meeting this week to
keep its production ceiling unchanged and cancel the scheduled September
meeting. That bolstered confidence in the cartel's determination to keep
output under control while it awaited an expected pick up in demand. Short
term demand has been increased, meanwhile, by supply bottlenecks in the US.
With the North Korean situation spicing the dish the August futures position
at London's International Petroleum Exchange jumped to a peak of Dollars
17.06 a barrel on Thursday before edging back.
Coffee futures were all over the place this week. The LCE's September
position traded in a Dollars 290 range before closing yesterday at Dollars
2,335 a tonne, up Dollars 187 on balance, but Dollars 155 off the high. The
market got off to a flying start, buoyed by a US Department of Agriculture
forecast that 1994-95 world output would be down 4 per cent at 90.6m bags
(60kg each). The buying that encouraged continued - though somewhat
erratically - until the price peaked early on Thursday.

FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: LVMH sees strong profits growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LVMH, the French luxury goods group, was on course for strong profits growth
in 1994 after benefiting from buoyant sales during the opening months of the
year, Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman, confirmed yesterday.
The group expected net profits to rise by 'more than 30 per cent' during the
first half of 1994 from FFr935m (Dollars 164m) during the same period last
year, Mr Arnault told the company's annual meeting. It is in the throes of
acquisitions after reducing its debt by unravelling a cross shareholding
agreement with Guinness, the UK brewer.
Mr Arnault forecast the group, which last year was affected by a downturn in
the champagne market and by the impact of restructuring costs on the
contribution from its Guinness stake, would achieve a profits increase of
'at least 20 per cent' in 1994 from FFr3.57bn in 1993.
The improvement in the group's fortunes reflects a wider recovery across the
international luxury goods industry.
The luxury market, which flourished during the 1980s, was one of the first
casualties of the economic recession in the early 1990s. However, the
industry has since last autumn benefited from increased demand in the US and
in its emerging south-east Asian markets.
LVMH owns some of the world's most high-prestige products including Hennessy
cognac and Louis Vuitton luggage.
The group recently reported a 28 per cent increase in turnover to FFr6.02bn
in the first quarter of this year, fuelled by healthy sales growth for
cognac and luggage.
Mr Arnault yesterday confirmed that the upward sales trend had continued
during the second quarter. LVMH, he said, had registered a 22 per cent
increase in sales in the five months to the end of May.
In the meantime the group is pressing ahead with its acquisition plans. Mr
Arnault said he hoped to develop the group's interests outside the drinks
sphere by expanding its other luxury activities, such as fashion and beauty
products.
Since the unravelling of the Guinness agreement LVMH has taken control of
Guerlain, the French fragrance house in which it held a minority stake.
It is understood to be in negotiations over the acquisition of Van Cleef &amp;
Arpels, the Paris-based jeweller. If the deal goes through Van Cleef could
become LVMH's first foothold in the real jewellery market dominated by
France's Cartier and Tiffany of the US.

FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ruhrkohle considers Venezuelan
coal venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ESSEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ruhrkohle, Germany's largest coal producer, said yesterday it was
considering taking a stake in a Venezuelan coal mining venture to increase
its coal imports.
The company will take 25 per cent in a four-way venture with Shell and two
other companies to produce 4m tonnes annually. An entry price is still being
discussed.
However, the group said improved results in the power generating and trading
divisions could not prevent a 34 per cent decline in profits to DM49m
(Dollars 28.8m), from DM66m the year before.
Turnover fell 5 per cent to DM23.41bn, in spite of slightly improved sales
in the non-coal divisions.
Mr Heinz Horn, chief executive, said the Essen-based company hoped to break
even this year, helped by a better steel market where increased demand had
helped to reduce its coke stockpiles.
Mr Horn said the Venezuelan venture was designed to broaden the company's
supply of cheaper, imported coal which is becoming increasingly attractive
for Ruhrkohle's electricity generating clients, such as Preussenelektra,
which have historically used German coal but are slowly turning to imports.
'We regard this as an extension of what we can offer our clients, especially
our smaller clients,' Mr Horn said.
Germany imports 20 per cent of the 50m tonnes of coal needed by power
stations, but this will rise to about 30 per cent in coming years.
Ruhrkohle produced 15.5m tonnes of coal in the first five months of this
year. This compares with 17.9m tonnes in the same period of the previous
year.
Projected output for the whole of 1994 is 37.4m tonnes, down from 41.9m
tonnes last year.
Ruhrkohle will shed more of its 75,000 coal miners in coming years as it
moves towards a projected workforce of about 60,000 by the end of the
decade.
Overall, the group employs 111,150 people.

FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft raises
DM1.2bn in sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the heavily-indebted German mining, metals and
industrial group, has raised DM1.2bn (Dollars 706m) from the sale of its
near-80 per cent stake in Buderus, an engineering and building supplies
subsidiary once regarded as a jewel in the Frankfurt-based conglomerate's
crown.
The sale, handled by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, was conducted through
an international placing of 2.03m Buderus shares at DM600 each.
Deutsche Bank, the biggest creditor to Metallgesellschaft, said the placing
had been oversubscribed in spite of poor market conditions. Applications for
shares had to be scaled down.
The proceeds, less commission for the two big banks, will initially flow to
Metallgesellschaft, although it is highly likely the money will find its way
back to banks which are owed a total of about DM9bn.
Deutsche and Dresdner banks, both big shareholders in Metallgesellschaft,
will be the main beneficiaries.
The banks have security over Buderus's assets dating back to December last
year when they advanced an emergency loan to Metallgesellschaft.
The group came to the brink of bankruptcy in January after running up
DM2.3bn losses in US oil derivatives trading.
Metallgesellschaft said it would realise an extraordinary profit on the
Buderus sale.
It did not quantify the gain but bankers close to Metallgesellschaft said it
would offset fresh provisions arising from the involvement of MG Corp,
Metallgesellschaft's New York-based trading subsidiary, with Castle Energy,
a north American oil-refining company in which MG Corp has a large minority
stake.
Deutsche Bank yesterday denied rumours that Mr Rolf Breuer, a board member
who is also chairman of the German Stock Exchange, would be resigning as
head of the bank's securities trading activities.
In spite of the denial, shares in Deutsche Bank dropped DM10.60 to close at
DM721.10.

FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ferfin sues auditors for L650bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the listed holding company of the collapsed
Ferruzzi group, yesterday announced it was bringing a L650bn (Dollars 401m)
damages suit against auditors Price Waterhouse.
The claim relates to the alleged negligent role played by the auditors in
presenting accounts from 1987 to 1992 that failed to give a true picture of
Ferfin's accounts.
It follows an earlier claim against Price Waterhouse lodged in April for
damages of L1,000bn for the negligent preparation of the Montedison group
accounts.
Montedison is the principal subsidiary of Ferfin.
Last November, Ferfin shareholders voted to take legal action for damages
against Price Waterhouse.
However, the size of these two claims is bigger than expected and in the
case of Montedison it covers accounts prepared by Price Waterhouse from 1983
to 1992.
Price Waterhouse has filed a counter-claim against Montedison taking the
view that the previous management should be held responsible for 'deliberate
and systematic fraud' rather than the accountants. The company was not
available for comment last night but is expected to pursue the same robust
line over the latest claim.

FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Pharmacia offer will generate
SKr9.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish government said yesterday its offer of a 47.4 per cent voting
stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 pharmaceutical groups, had
been heavily oversubscribed and would raise a total of SKr9.4bn (Dollars
1.2bn).
It expected to meet its target of selling a maximum of 82.2m shares after
giving underwriters the chance to allocate an additional 10.2m shares to
institutions.
Institutions will pay SKr120 per share, and the Swedish public SKr110 per
share.
The institutional price is SKr1 lower than Pharmacia's closing price on
Thursday but SKr5 lower than the average price during the subscription
period.
A total of 47.5m shares will be allocated to Swedish retail investors, and
34.7m to institutions. Non-Swedish institutions will take 70 per cent of the
institutional tranche, increasing foreign ownership in the group to 11.5 per
cent from 2 per cent.
Mr Per Westerberg, Swedish industry minister, said the privatisation had
been a success in spite of bond and equity market turbulence during the
subscription period. He added that the institutional offer had been 2.5
times oversubscribed and the public offer 1.8 times.
The state retains 10.1 per cent of Pharmacia's votes, making it the second
largest shareholder after Volvo, the vehicle group, with 28 per cent. Volvo
wants to sell its stake but has agreed not to do so before 1996.
Pharmacia was the biggest single sale in a privatisation programme which has
raised SKr23bn since it was unveiled by the centre-right government in 1991.
The government has promised more privatisations if it wins the September
general election, including Nordbanken, Telia, the telecommunications group,
and Vattenfall, the power group. The Social Democrats, who are favoured to
win the election, have ruled out sales of Telia or Vattenfall.

FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Digital revises shake-up plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment is not ready to unveil a broad restructuring this month as
planned. Instead, the struggling computer company will announce cost
reductions as they occur over the coming months.
Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive, has told senior managers in
a memo 'that some work remains to be done, so it is premature to discuss our
detailed plans and subsequent actions. We will make announcements when we
are ready to do so.'
Last month he said that about 20 per cent of the company's workforce, or
about 20,000 jobs, had to be cut if the company was to become cost
competitive in the computer industry. His statement followed Digital's
third-quarter results with heavier-than-expected losses that revealed
weaknesses in management systems and a continuing decline in profit margins.
Losses widened to Dollars 183m, from Dollars 30m in the same period last
year. Revenues for the quarter declined 6 per cent to Dollars 3.26bn.
Yesterday, Digital said that the scale of the downsizing reduction plan was
unchanged. 'This is a complex process and it will be conducted in an orderly
fashion,' the company said.
In his letter to senior managers, Mr Palmer said the board of directors
'unanimously supports our direction and progress'.
However, the delay in announcing detailed restructuring plans appears likely
to increase concern both within the company and among investors about future
cuts.

FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Unisys held back by slow
mainframe sales in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unisys, the US computer company, has warned that slow European sales of its
mainframe computers will result in lower-than-expected second-quarter
earnings.
Its share price dropped sharply to Dollars 9 from Dollars 10 3/4 when it
released its statement just before the market closed on Thursday. Yesterday,
in early trade, the stock hovered around Dollars 9.
The group, which has been making a strong recovery after several years of
heavy losses, blamed the setback on both operational and economic weaknesses
in Europe. European revenues represented 25 per cent of Unisys' total 1993
revenues of Dollars 7.7bn.
Sales of large computer systems in Europe continued to decline, particularly
in France, Germany and Italy, Unisys said.
Although the company has seen stronger demand among its European customers
for desktop computers, these products carry a lower profit margin.
'The net result of this situation is lower sales margins and profits,' said
Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive. In March, Unisys appointed Mr
Malcolm Coster, a former Coopers and Lybrand consultant, to head its
European operations.
Mr Unruh said the new executive was 'taking steps to focus the business on
growth opportunities and improve programme execution'. Unisys aims in
particular to expand its services and systems integration businesses.
'While European orders in the second quarter may be up, year over year, and
the rate of revenue decline is slowing, a meaningful business recovery is
not yet under way. We will not plan on a positive turn in our European
business until the fourth quarter at the earliest, which is later than we
expected at the beginning of the year,' said Mr Unruh.
Unisys said revenues from its services and systems integration grew strongly
in the first quarter, in Europe and elsewhere, and the trend was expected to
continue.
However, the company noted that in the services business revenues were
spread over the period of long-term contracts.
Sales in the US and other international markets continued to grow and were
expected to exceed last year's second-quarter and first-half figures, it
added.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Slough Estates has extended its offer for Bredero Properties until July 6,
but it stated that the offer was 'final and will not be increased'.
Slough offered 10p a share for the remaining 50 per cent of the property
developer that it doesn't already own, but by initial close of the offer on
Thursday, it had received acceptances from only 6.76 per cent of outside
shareholders.
Sir Nigel Mobbs, Slough's chairman, said yesterday: 'No other proposals have
been made which would secure Bredero's future as an independent company, or
provide a better return to Bredero's shareholders.'
The share price rose last week when British Land purchased a 6.9 per cent
stake, but Bredero's board said it had received no proposals from the
company, and it continues to recommend the offer.

FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Rugby makes Dollars 93m US purchase
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rugby, the cement group, has paid Dollars 93m (Pounds 61.2m) to acquire the
US building materials distribution business of Bunzl, the distribution and
cigarette filters group.
To pay for the acquisition, Rugby is placing 48.9m shares with institutional
investors at 125p each. The placing is being organised by Schroders.
Following the announcement the cement group's share price rose by 3p to
134p.
Bunzl said the sale would result in a net goodwill charge of about Pounds
35m in the current financial year. It intends to use the sale proceeds to
cut group borrowings.
Its share price yesterday was unchanged at 164p.
Mr Peter Carr, Rugby's managing director, said the acquisition was expected
to be earnings enhancing in the first year.
The group is buying a distribution business with 7 branches in north-eastern
states; 10 branches in the mid-west and 8 in the west. Products supplied
include doors, windows, roofing materials, ceiling and floor tiles, lumber
and plywood.
It made an operating profit last year of Dollars 6.4m (Dollars 1.2m in 1992)
on sales of Dollars 359m (Dollars 364m). The business reported net operating
assets of Dollars 76.8m at the end of December.
Mr Carr said that the acquisition would complement Rugby's existing US
operations involving 22 wholesale distribution branches in the eastern part
of the country.
'Where overlap occurs its impact is generally limited by differences in the
product range and customer base,' said Mr Carr.
The deal would enhance Rugby's purchasing power, allow cross-fertilisation
of product lines and increase the company's ability to service national and
regional customers, he added.
The US was recovering from recession with a consensus forecast of 3.6 per
cent economic growth this year.
The final purchase price will depend upon a revaluation of Bunzl Building
Supply's net operating assets, subject to a ceiling of Dollars 94m.

FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Gloom for Eurotunnel underwriters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gloom continued for underwriters of the Pounds 858m Eurotunnel rights
issue yesterday, as the share price dropped a further 15p to 288p, leaving
it just 23p above the rights price.
Brokers reported a substantial increase in sales from both UK and French
small shareholders, with some 2.7m Eurotunnel units traded, the highest
level since the pricing was announced, and close to 8m of the nil-paid
shares.
The offer closes at 3pm next Wednesday. Given the 16 per cent share price
fall last week, and no signs of institutional support, there is an
increasing possibility that underwriters will be called upon to cover a
sizeable slice of the issue.
At the time the issue was announced, the talk was of artificial devaluation
of the share price through short selling, and it bounced strongly in the
aftermath.
But there has been no more good news to support the shares, and once more
investors have focused on the long distance to profitability and dividends,
and news reports of breakdowns in the freight service.
Monday will be the last day trading the nil-paid rights shares, and the
outcome of the issue should become clearer.

FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Challenging the traditions - Benfield's new
Pounds 50m reinsurance venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch this week of Benfield Re, a new Pounds 50m London-based
reinsurance company, might at first sight appear unexceptional. After all
the company is only one of a number of new ventures in the international
catastrophe reinsurance market over the last 18 months, with more than
Pounds 3bn pumped into the market by international investors over the last
18 months.
Yet two factors make the new venture worthy of attention. Firstly, the
backer of the project, Benfield Group, is one of London's most successful
reinsurance brokers in recent years, with its 1993 full year pre-tax profits
of some Pounds 30m amounting to nearly 75 per cent of its turnover.
Mr Matthew Harding, the group's ambitious 40 year old chairman, has already
generated a personal fortune recently estimated at Pounds 135m, and last
year started to diversify his interests by acquiring a significant minority
stake in Chelsea Football Club.
Together with three of his co-directors, Mr Harding figures among the 500
most wealthy people in the UK, according to one recent survey.
Secondly, Royal Bank of Scotland, whose other investments in the insurance
industry include Direct Line, the UK's most successful insurance company of
recent years, is backing the project. Its venture capital arm, Royal Bank
Development Capital, is one of three institutions providing Pounds 12.5m in
new equity to Benfield for the new venture.
Benfield's achievements to date are in part due to the way it has challenged
many traditional business practices in the London insurance market.
Mr Harding is fiercely critical of traditional ways of broking, for example.
Many brokers physically carry contracts around the market, frequently
queueing at underwriting 'boxes' - the open plan offices where Lloyd's
underwriters work - to obtain support for deals.
'Benfield brokers do not go out with their binders and tramp through the
streets on a wet Wednesday afternoon,' insists Mr Harding. The group
conducts the vast majority of its broking business either by telephone or in
pre-arranged meetings and is usually the only broker involved in a
reinsurance deal.
'In the bad old days in the mid to late 1980s, syndicates would often
reinsure through a dozen or so reinsurance brokers. We would often structure
the whole programme ourselves,' explains Mr Harding.
In addition Mr Harding believes brokers must take a long-term approach to
reinsurance business, developing stable connections with underwriters who
are prepared to handle relatively large deals.
Benfield's position in the market has been strengthened by the collapse of
the 'spiral', the chain of reinsurance and retroinsurance (reinsurance of
reinsurance) through which dozens of underwriters and brokers traditionally
handled catastrophe risks.
Benfield's customers were generally less involved in 'spiral' and most
continued to trade through the market's difficulties.
And following the contraction of the capital base supporting the London
reinsurance market, Benfield was able to find alternative capacity
elsewhere.
This was at least partially through its links with overseas companies, such
as Fortress Re, a North Carolina-based agency which underwrites on behalf of
three Japanese companies, and Frankona, a reinsurance subsidiary of Gerling,
a leading German insurance company.
The group quickly became a leading force in the catastrophe market,
increasing income from Pounds 9.4m in 1989 to Pounds 39.9m in 1992 and
Pounds 41.3m in 1993.
Mr Harding introduced innovative elements into reinsurance deals, mainly
designed to prevent the re-emergence of a kind of reinsurance 'arbitrage',
in which some underwriters were able to underwrite business but retain very
little or no risk on their own accounts, and which was sometimes an
important feature of 'spiral' business.
At the same time Mr Harding and his team transformed Benfield's
organisation, by introducing 'state of the art' technology and systems.
Because it had brokered relatively few contracts, Benfield avoided the heavy
burden of processing thousands of small claims. The company's brokers do
their own secretarial work, using personal computers and dedicated software.
Benfield's new reinsurance venture gives it the possibility to diversify its
sources of income.
For the moment its ambitions in this field remain relatively modest. With
rates now beginning to soften as competition re-emerges, Benfield Re does
not expect to use its capacity to underwrite up to Pounds 125m in annual
premiums in its first year.
Initially at least the company will not 'lead' the negotiation of
reinsurance deals, instead working alongside a group of about a dozen senior
underwriters.
But the group is ambitious. Mr John Coldman, managing director, said this
week that it was looking for growth and would be able to increase its
capital base very quickly if necessary.

Portsmouth &amp; Sunderland Newspapers, the publishing and retailing group,
yesterday warned profits growth was expected to slow following the loss of
two substantial printing contracts over the next two years.
Mr Christopher Brims, chief executive, described the group's 20 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.5m as satisfactory in spite of
difficult trading conditions.
Sales for the 53 weeks to April 2 rose to Pounds 112.1m, compared with
Pounds 103m for the previous 52 weeks. Stripping out the extra week, pre-tax
profits were 6 per cent higher, on sales up by 7 per cent.
Mr Brims said P&amp;S would face a difficult two years, following the decision
by the Daily Mail not to renew its printing contract. The Independent
contract, which expires in 1996, was also under review. These two contracts
represented two thirds of the Pounds 12m printing business.
The chief executive was confident growth in the publishing and retail
business would offset the loss of the contracts.
Advertising was reviving across the board. The strongest growth came from
recruitment advertising, which was 20 per cent up in volume.
The convenience store division increased profits by 25 per cent on sales 11
per cent higher for the comparable 52 weeks. This was partly due to
expansion - nine outlets were added.
Publishing increased profits by 23 per cent on sales ahead 3 per cent. This
was due both to increased advertising revenues and the benefits of
rationalisation. P&amp;S took an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.7m to pay for
rationalisation.
Earnings increased were 13 per cent ahead to 41p. Excluding the extra week,
earnings fell by 1 per cent.
The final dividend is raised to 7.52p for a total of 10.64p (9.46p).

FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cater Allen in Pounds 23m acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cater Allen Holdings, the discount house and banking group, is raising
Pounds 32.3m via a rights issue to finance expansion, including the Pounds
23m acquisition of the banking operations of Jupiter Tyndall, the asset
management group.
The group also announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 18.9m) for
the year to April 30. Profits for the discount house fell to Pounds 5.8m
(Pounds 10.7m) because of last year's windfall from falling interest rates.
Mr James Barclay, chairman and managing director, emphasised that 'the
dividend policy of steady but sustainable growth was still firmly in place'
despite proposing an unchanged final dividend of 20p making a total of 28p
(27p), payable from lower earnings per share of 49p (56p).
The deal will increase Jupiter Tyndall's net assets by Pounds 9m and leave
it with cash of Pounds 30m, with which Jupiter said it would 'aggressively
pursue growth in our investment management business' as well as increasing
shareholders funds.
It may acquire Queen Anne's Gate Asset Management, the fund management
company responsible for investing the Pounds 2bn in assets of the privatised
water companies.
The performance of Queen Anne's Gate, which has been on the market for
several months, has been consistently above-average.
However, it has few clients and manages a large sum for each, making it
vulnerable to a sudden loss of business.
Cater's 1-for-3 rights issue will be priced at 410p per share, an 18 per
cent discount to the 518p at which the shares closed unchanged, less the
final dividend.
Jupiter's shares were also unchanged, at 255p.
Mr Barclay said the Jupiter banks acquisition would double retail banking
deposits to Pounds 690m and reinforce its status as a specialist deposit
taker.
The effective price was Pounds 15.5m because Cater would be able to free
Pounds 7.5m of capital by combining its bank arm with Jupiter's. It would
eliminate some separate capitalisation and cut regulatory capital needs.
The consolidated pre-tax profits of the Jupiter banks fell to Pounds 2.76m
in the year to December 31, against Pounds 3.36m, due to lower interest
rates.
The stated profit would have been some Pounds 168,000 lower under Cater's
accounting policies.
Mr Barclay said Cater would use a further part of the proceeds of the issue
to buy a 'substantial' trust company in Jersey, with which it was in
negotiations. It would also apply extra capital to its discount house and
stock lending arms.
COMMENT
Unchanged shares indicated a logical deal for both parties, with Jupiter
obtaining enough for a bank which it gained as part of an earlier
acquisition, and Cater broadening further from its discount house roots.
After rejigging the capital, Cater is paying a historic multiple of about
11.5. That is in line with similar deposit-takers. But the Jupiter banks are
not growing fast, and will have to be galvanised by the new management to
ensure that the price is worthwhile.

FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wainhomes beats float forecast with Pounds
6.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wainhomes, the Chester-based house-builder which came to the market in the
spring, beat its flotation forecast with pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.22m,
compared with Pounds 5.29m, during the 12 months to the end of March.
Turnover rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 69.4m (Pounds 56.8m). The pre-tax
figure was struck after lower interest charges of Pounds 866,000 (Pounds
1.17m). Earnings per share also rose by 22 per cent, from 7.9p to 9.6p.
Stock market sentiment has turned against housebuilders since the company
floated at 170p. Yesterday the shares fell 1p to 134p.
Wainhomes sold a record 965 homes last year, 22 per cent more than in
1992-93. Due to increased land costs and reduced selling prices, margins
declined slightly during the 12 months, the company said.
The number of housing plots it controlled for development rose over the year
by more than 700 to 3,102.
Mr Smith said: 'The strong demand experienced at the beginning of 1994 has
continued into the new financial year and consequently our cumulative sales
to mid-June are 46 per cent ahead of the comparative period last year.'

FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ex-FT chief joins O'Reilly group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Palmer, the former chief executive of the Financial Times Group, is
to be managing director of Independent Newspapers (Ireland), the Irish
publishing division of Mr Tony O'Reilly's expanding media group.
As well as being responsible for the Dublin-based group's main Irish titles
 -the Irish Independent, Evening Herald and Sunday Independent - Mr Palmer
will join the main board.
Mr Palmer, 53, spent 29 years with the FT as reporter, news editor and
deputy editor before moving into newspaper management. When he left the FT
abruptly in April 1993, Pearson, the paper's owners, cited 'differences in
management style'.
Mr O'Reilly, chairman of HJ Heinz as well as chairman of Independent
Newspapers, has been talking to Mr Palmer for several months following the
departure of the previous managing director, Mr Joe Hayes, in March to
pursue other business interests.
Mr Palmer, educated at Eton and Oxford, will move to Dublin to take up his
new appointment.
In the mid 1980s the former FT chief executive was in charge of a Pounds 75m
investment plan to introduce photo-composition at the paper and build its
new Docklands printing plant.
Although Independent Newspapers has expanded into South Africa, France,
Mexico, the UK and Australia, the core is still its main Irish newspapers.
Last year pre-tax profits rose 81 per cent to IPounds 29m (Pounds 28.4m).

FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Greycoat Pounds 40m in the red and calls
for Pounds 47m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greycoat, the property developer rescued from the brink of collapse last
November, has launched a Pounds 47m rights issue to purchase and refinance
the remaining 50 per cent of 123/151 Buckingham Palace Road, London, which
has been valued at Pounds 159m.
It is paying Pounds 18.2m for Sir Robert McAlpine Group's half of the
386,600 sq ft office and retail property.
Greycoat also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 40m (Pounds 167m) for the
year to end-March. However, the company returned to profitability in the
second half with Pounds 3.5m pre-tax. Losses per share were 10.5p (92.5p).
Mr Richard Guignard, joint managing director, described the latest
transaction as 'a housekeeping exercise'. A Pounds 125m loan attached to the
property was due for repayment next January, giving Greycoat the choice
between buying the remaining half, or selling the property. The loan will be
replaced with a Pounds 82.5m facility from Hypo Bank, and the remaining
Pounds 42.5m will be covered by the rights proceeds and internal resources.
The cash call will allow Greycoat to progress beyond mere survival, but the
stock market reacted unenthusiastically to the deal. The shares fell 1 1/2 p
to 15 1/2 p.
Some analysts expressed concern over the proximity to last November's
restructuring by Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger, the South African
investors who enabled the company to avoid receivership.
Mr Treger said: 'It is a one-off opportunity to consolidate the portfolio,
as part of the ongoing restructuring of Greycoat.'
The offer is on a 3-for-8 basis at 13p, a discount of 24 per cent to the
previous closing price. The issue is underwritten by NM Rothschild and
Samuel Montagu.
The rights will dilute net asset value from 17.4p, as of March, to 15.9p,
but it is sufficiently above the rights price to encourage support for the
issue.
Gearing will fall from 152 per cent to 137 per cent.
Greycoat will emerge with 100 per cent ownership of two significant
properties, and an option on a third.
Britannic House, in London's Finsbury Circus, was effectively ring-fenced to
protect Greycoat, but the company can repurchase it up to 2002, at a price
which reflects the obligations of the debtors rather than the value of the
property.
Once the property value, currently Pounds 133m, exceeds the Pounds 150m
value of debt, virtually all additional valuation increase would accrue to
shareholders, Mr Guignard said.
In addition, Greycoat revealed that it planned to proceed with the
controversial Pounds 350m development of Paternoster Square in early 1995,
subject to securing development financing.
It owns 21 per cent of the City project, which last August received planning
consents. Its Pounds 15m investment has been written down to nothing, and Mr
Guignard was adamant that Greycoat would not invest further capital into
development projects. However, Greycoat's project management role could
leave it with a carrying stake in the largest new development in the City.
Following the rights issue, the company is proposing a 1-for-10 share
consolidation.

FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: British Vita shares fall after statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in British Vita slipped 16p to 259p yesterday after the foam and
fibre group said that it was finding it hard to recover higher raw material
costs from its customers in the summer months.
Some analysts reacted by trimming their forecasts although the company
subsequently stressed that the statement was not meant as a profit warning.
Mr Jim Mercer, who heads the European rubber and plastics operations, said
that the situation had not worsened since the annual results were announced
in March. 'It certainly has not deteriorated and in some areas our ability
to push through price increases has improved,' he said.
In yesterday's statement the company said: 'While raw materials prices,
especially in foam chemicals, have increased, the levels of demand over the
summer months in several markets make it difficult to recover these costs
until the autumn.'
The statement accompanied news of the acquisition for Pounds 9.36m of
Jackdaw Polymers, a Lancashire-based group involved in the compounding of
engineering plastics.
British Vita said the company, which has sales of more than Pounds 10m and
has been consistently profitable, extended the scope of its existing
compounding activities and complemented its engineering thermoplastic sheet
business.
The consideration, Pounds 1.25m of which has been deferred under warranty
arrangements, is being satisfied by Pounds 5.61m cash and the issue of
936,330 shares.
Smith New Court has cut its profits forecast for the present year from
Pounds 47.5m to Pounds 45m and from Pounds 55m to Pounds 52m for next year.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Life assurance: the wrongs and rights
(2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM ROSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am rather disappointed that Peter Marsh's article lacked any
semblance of balance. Most of us in this industry abhor malpractice and
would like to see any practitioner found guilty of fraud or
misrepresentation locked away for a very long time. Only then will the
public enjoy a reasonable level of protection. It is a matter of some regret
that the courts have failed to pass severe custodial sentences when given
the opportunity.
You have chosen to highlight the sour comments of industry failures, but I
challenge you to produce a single widow who will complain that her late
husband was pressured into buying too much life insurance. The client of the
Pegasus sales lady who had to struggle to meet his or her premiums will, I
am sure, be eternally grateful in the event of a claim. Similarly, the
disillusioned Allied Dunbar salesman should consider his own shortcomings
rather than criticise the products of a group whose contracts are vastly
superior to those peddled by most banks and building societies.
The hard-working, enthusiastic and caring life insurance sales person has
nothing to be ashamed of. Life insurance sales people will continue to
perform a valuable function until the majority of the population makes
adequate provision for themselves and their families without the need for
persuasion.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is astonishing that life assurance offices should respond to Peter
Marsh's investigative journalism ('When he dies my dear, all this will be
yours', June 11/12) with cries of the industry being the subject of a press
vendetta.
It is not the press which imposed the recent array of fines on many leading
life companies for contravening the regulations, designed to protect
consumers; nor is it the press which suspended the entire Norwich Union
direct salesforce; nor did financial journalists invent the home income
scandal, the personal pensions scandal or the statistics showing that one
third of life policies lapse within two years.
It is the life assurance industry itself which has, by its unprincipled
disregard for the best interests of the public, earned its present appalling
reputation. An expression of deep regret and a promise of urgent reform
would have been the more appropriate response.
The public has reason to be grateful to financial journalists for their
incisive reportage, which has stirred the regulators into taking a measure
of effective action to protect consumers against the activities of many life
companies.
As a result, standards are beginning to improve but there is a very long way
to go. Financial journalists can make a further contribution to speeding up
the process by raising the question of accountability. Clearly it is the
directors and management of life offices that should be held accountable for
their companies' selling malpractices, rather than the individual sales
people.
The long-awaited change in regulation will begin with miraculous speed on
the day the regulators take public action against chief executives of life
offices which blatantly disregard their regulations.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Goodies in a mixed bag: Trends in UK retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the UK government waded through the latest batch of retail statistics
this week, it had reason to feel some summer-time cheer.
With economists watching carefully to see how the UK recovery will weather
April's tax rises, the verdict from the high streets seems to be 'steady as
she goes'.
So far there is little sign that consumers have responded to the tax
increases by slashing spending. Retail sales volumes rose by a healthy 0.9
per cent between March and May, compared to the previous three months, and
were 3.9 per cent higher in May than the same month last year. But neither
do consumers show any hint of embarking on a 1980s-style consumer binge.
There was no growth in sales volumes between April and May and prices remain
subdued.
Though the signs are encouraging for Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, who
committed himself to recovery free of boom and bust this week, excessive
celebration could be premature.
One reason is that consumers have yet to feel the full tax pinch. Though the
increases in national insurance contributions and the cut in mortgage tax
relief were felt in household budgets in April, the introduction of value
added tax on fuel will not hit quarterly fuel bills until this summer.
A warning note against any premature celebration was sounded by this week's
Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey. This showed
that only 44 per cent of retailers believed business was better than a year
ago. The proportion of retailers who were pessimistic about trading
conditions increased between April and May.
This increased wariness about business prospects together with flat monthly
sales indicated by the Central Statistical Office might hint at a
tax-induced slow down. But most analysts warn against too much gloom. A
recent Gallup survey showed that consumer confidence, although subdued, rose
in May. Meanwhile the CSO's monthly figures need to be treated with caution,
since Easter holiday spending straddled March and April this year, leaving
its statisticians uncertain about how to adjust for the seasonal swing.
Another reason for treating these numbers with caution is that monthly
figures remain volatile, and include a kaleidoscope of variations according
to regions, sectors and types of stores. A better conclusion to draw from
the divergences in data may be that the tax rises are hitting consumer
groups differently, while the retail sector is going through structural
changes.
One striking trend in the CBI survey, evident through much of the recession,
is that large store chains have performed better than smaller groups and
independent stores. While 54 per cent of multiple outlets said sales
increased in May compared with the previous year, only 28 per cent of single
outlets agreed.
This may be because large chains can offer better value for money than small
stores. As the recession made consumers more price-conscious, big stores
were able to harness their buying power and the distribution systems they
developed in the 1980s. That might explain some of the discrepancies between
the CBI and CSO data, says Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Midland Global
Markets, who says the CBI survey gives greater weight to smaller - and now
gloomier - businesses.
Different retail sectors are also experiencing mixed fortunes. Food
retailing, for example, is competitive, partly due to structural factors.
Superstore operators such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll, owner of Safeway,
have been forced to respond to the rapid growth of cut-price competitors
such as Kwik Save, by cutting prices and gross profit margins. The 'big
three' groups all recently reported small increases so far this year in
like-for-like sales volumes, which exclude newly-opened stores.
However, supermarkets' prices were in many cases lower than last year,
resulting in an overall fall in the value of like-for-like sales. The
superstore groups predict continuing slow growth and pressure on prices,
holding margins down.
The Do-It-Yourself sector, which like food retailing increased floorspace
and pushed up margins in the late 1980s, continues to struggle, owing partly
to the uncertainty in the housing market.
Clothing, however, is performing better. Marks and Spencer, Next and
Storehouse all recently announced healthy increases in sales, and in the CBI
survey 56 per cent of clothing retailers and 85 per cent of footwear and
leather retailers said sales were up in May.
Not just sectors, but different regions are seeing different levels of
performance.
Mr John Bowes, corporate marketing director for CWS, the largest
co-operative retailer, which has both small shops and superstores across the
UK, said Scotland and Northern Ireland were trading well, and south-east
England was recovering. The north-east remained competitive, while trading
was difficult in areas of high unemployment such as the Midlands.
There is also evidence to suggest that people on lower incomes suffered to a
greater extent from the April tax increases. Shoprite, the Scottish discount
food retailer, which targets the less well-off C2DE customers, recently
announced profit figures well below expectations. Kwik Save, the UK's
largest discount food retailer, with a similar customer profile to Shoprite,
was one of the few other retailers to agree that the tax increases had hit
its customers hard.
Nearly all retailers and economists agree that the 1990s recession, unlike
that of the 1980s, has left consumers value-conscious, and likely to remain
so when the good times return. 'There is more money for discretionary
spending, but it needs the right things, good products at good prices, to
bring it out,' said Mr Kevin Hawkins, corporate affairs director at WH
Smith.
These pressures could explain why retailers remain gloomy in CBI surveys
despite good volumes, says Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salamon
Brothers. Indeed Mr James May, director-general of the British Retail
Consortium, which represents more than 90 per cent of retailers, argues that
weak margins may yet force shops to push up prices.
But there is little sign of upward price pressure at the moment. And while
canny consumers may not make for happy shop-owners, they are good news for a
government trying to keep recovery on course without overheating.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Consumers should benefit more on
electricity prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr K H PRIOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Smith's well-informed article, 'Don't shoot, I'm only the
regulator' (June 15), pointed out the importance of Professor Stephen
Littlechild's Distribution Price Review to electricity users. This is the
opportunity to ensure a more equitable balance of financial benefits between
shareholders and consumers. While there has been a marked improvement in the
standard of service and supply reliability, non-investing consumers have
enjoyed comparatively limited financial benefit.
The regional electricity companies have clung to the upper limits of thc
price formula rather than pass on some of their cost savings to the
consumer. Consumer groups realise there is scope for a fall in prices of 15
per cent or more. Privatisation is improving the consumer's lot but, as the
RECs with their newly found independence have chosen not to act, the
regulator is capable of putting matters right - with the full support of
consumers, and very likely the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Rights and responsibility: The rethinking of the black
agenda in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We have locked arms and our circle will not be broken,' proclaimed the
Reverend Benjamin Chavis, executive director of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People this week. He was speaking at the end of a
three-day summit in Baltimore of more than 100 civil rights activists,
church dignitaries, academics and businessmen, which had ended with pledges
to follow a united black agenda.
Mr Chavis's ringing tones echoed the proudest years of the civil rights
movement in the 1960s, but the gathering drew scepticism from many black
commentators and politicians: this was a summit of leaders whose credentials
have been called into question. Memories revived from three decades ago did
not dispel the impression that the leaders were still fighting 1960s wars
and are not equipped to tackle 1990s problems - such as economic disparities
and urban violence, the causes of which are not only racial discrimination.
The prominent civil rights era activist, Mr Andrew Young, who was President
Jimmy Carter's ambassador to the United Nations, once argued the role of the
black leader is to lead whites more than blacks. 'Black people are the
victims of economic inequities in our society and, to change those, the
people we really have to change are white,' he said.
But while there is still much to be done to educate white Americans about
continuing racism and discrimination, many African-Americans feel the time
has come to look inward for help. 'Let's stop begging. Let's start doing it
for ourselves,' commented one black urban activist.
That will require considerable change in many of the organisations
represented at the Baltimore meeting, notably the NAACP itself.
The NAACP is the oldest US civil rights organisation but, even in the 1960s,
it was to a great extent bypassed by more energetic movements such as Dr
Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Its great
achievements came mostly in influencing civil rights legislation, and
litigation against discriminatory laws, at a time when it seemed that if
legal segregation of blacks and whites could be banished, everything else
would follow. 'The world was simple then; our enemy was an easy target,'
says Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr, chairman of the department of
Afro-American studies at Harvard University.
Today, with most legal obstructions to equality removed, the NAACP seems to
many blacks a less relevant organisation, and its membership has halved to
about 500,000 from its peak.
Mr Chavis, a 46-year-old firebrand who took over the NAACP leadership last
year, has tried to make the organisation more relevant, particularly to
younger blacks: for instance by organising meetings with inner-city gang
leaders. Yet these steps have alienated some older NAACP members, not to
mention corporate sponsors.
Other groups represented in Baltimore have also seen their influence
decline. Church ministers, though they still hold sway among many lower
income groups, are not the dominating voices they were, and have lost much
of their hold over better-educated, middle-class blacks.
Two groups were glaringly absent at the Baltimore summit. First, black
politicians. Although black political influence is disproportionately small
in relation to the US black population, the number of black elected
officials continues to grow rapidly, climbing in the past decade by 43 per
cent to more than 7,500, according to the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies, a Washington think-tank. There are now 40 African-American
members of Congress and increasing numbers of black mayors.
The second group poorly represented at this week's summit was the urban,
black young whose violence, low life expectancy and dismal economic
prospects are among the most pressing problems facing the African-American
community today.
In the past, the Reverend Jesse Jackson could legitimately claim to speak,
at least sometimes, on behalf of this disaffected group, but his career
peaked with his campaign for the US presidency in 1988.
One delegate at the Baltimore meeting who does reach today's angry black
youths was Mr Louis Farrakhan, head of the Nation of Islam, a black
nationalist movement whose anti-white rhetoric has made him, for whites, the
most controversial figure in black America today.
But even those blacks who denounce his hatred of whites acclaim the more
positive side of Mr Farrakhan's message: that blacks must build their future
for themselves and not wait for whites to give it them - an argument which
has more in common with the 'empowerment' agenda of right-wing Republicans.
It is partly because white groups continually call on black leaders to
denounce Mr Farrakhan that his appeal has grown so much.
But the anger of Jewish groups and the discomfort of some black politicians
at Mr Farrakhan's presence at the Baltimore summit diverted attention from
other issues confronting African-American leaders: gaping economic
disparities and inner-city violence. Professor Cornel West, professor of
religion and director of Afro-American studies at Princeton University, also
argues in his book, Race Matters, that a pervasive nihilism is 'the most
basic issue now facing black America'.
The statistics are grim. Black unemployment is more than 12 per cent, nearly
twice the national rate, according to the National Urban League, the civil
rights group. A third of black Americans live below the official poverty
line. Homicide remains the largest cause of death for black males aged
15-34. Suicide, once half as common among blacks as among whites, has
climbed, for black men, to white rates.
There is a consensus among black intellectuals that to solve this morass of
problems requires a less dogmatic approach by both black and white leaders
than has been the case over the past few decades. The white dominated
government, and society, need to improve opportunities and remove
inequalities but blacks need to take greater responsibility for their
future.
'The liberal notion that more government programmes can solve racial
problems is simplistic - precisely because it focuses solely on the economic
dimension. And the conservative idea that what is needed is a change in the
moral behaviour of poor black urban dwellers highlights immoral actions
while ignoring public responsibility for the immoral circumstances that
haunt our fellow citizens,' writes Professor West.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Rutland, contradictions over costings
and the government grant factor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW MAKEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You state in your leader 'Councils and the Concorde fallacy' (June 14)
that independence for Rutland could mean up to an extra Pounds 125 on each
Rutlander's council tax bill. As you will know, this council maintains that
the effect of Rutland gaining unitary status will be broadly cost-neutral.
May I explain the apparent contradictions between the two sets of costings.
The Local Government Commission acknowledges in its draft proposals that its
figures are based on the Ernst &amp; Young model which generally reflects
current county council management structures. This model was developed to
provide robust costings for comparison purposes over review areas as a whole
rather than small parts of them.
Our model, on the other hand, is specifically designed to be applicable to
the likely management structure of an authority the size of Rutland, taking
into account the reduction in overheads and bureaucracy which would result
from the creation of such a unitary authority. Taking this model,
independence for Rutland would be broadly cost-neutral to the local
taxpayer.
Both sets of figures can therefore be said to be correct, but both are in
any case purely hypothetical. It would be a dangerous exercise to try to
foretell council tax levels in 1996 since more than 70 per cent of council
funding comes directly from central government. Indeed, the commission
itself acknowledges that the impact on council tax would depend upon future
decisions by central government about the distribution of grant.
That is the biggest and most unpredictable variable, not the figures under
discussion here.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Partners dance to different tunes: As political uncertainty
becomes more widespread across Europe, Maastricht looks less relevant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spawned in the polling booths of 12 nations, a new form of late 20th-century
political hybrid has emerged this week: a many-headed Europe.
After the setbacks since 1991 to the Maastricht treaty goal of European
union, most governments had accepted the likelihood of a multi-speed Europe.
Already in immigration, foreign and defence policies, as well as monetary
co-operation, different groupings in the European Union have been
implementing integration at disparate paces.
The results of the European parliament elections on June 9 and June 12
indicate that post-cold-war Europe has become still more heterogeneous.
Euro-diversity now stems from the power of the ballot box.
The variety of the poll results helps explain why the plan for European
unity agreed in 1991 has been looking increasingly unrealistic. Europe's
political map, only three years ago painted in uniform integrationist hue,
is now polychrome.
'We have a multi-polar Europe,' says Lord Dahrendorf, the German-born
sociologist and former European Commissioner who is now Warden of St
Antony's College, Oxford. 'In nearly all countries, there is a tendency
towards greater splintering of political preferences.'
An article in 1991*, co-authored by Mr Karlheinz Reif, the head of the
European Commission's survey research unit, held out 'the prospect of an EC
that is united, not only politically, but also economically (as) no idle
dream.' That Euro-optimism has now withered in the harsher economic climate
and resurgence of inward-looking policies across the EU. Mr Reif says
electorates will again grow supportive of integration as the economy
recovers, 'but the problem (of attitudes on a united Europe) as such will
not disappear.'
Surprisingly, the Maastricht treaty is being questioned even by some of its
firmest supporters. In a book published this week, Mr Jacques Delors,
European Commission president, is quoted in an interview as calling the
treaty over-ambitious and poorly drafted. 'We shouldn't have made a treaty
on political union, it was too soon.'***
In similar vein, Prof Andre Szasz, an executive director of the Dutch
central bank, who strongly backs the Maastricht aim of economic and monetary
union (Emu), says: 'Rarely was a treaty concluded with such far-reaching
implications and such lack of clarity as to what was intended and why.'
Mr Szasz says the prospective widening of the Union - to 15 or 16 countries
next year, 20 or more by early next century - increases the necessity of
'deepening' existing structures. 'The alternatives are not either widening
or deepening. It is both or neither.' But far more clarity is needed. 'The
authorities should consider how long they can continue to argue that
monetary union requires economic and even political union'.
The one country that clearly favoured European integration on Sunday was
Austria, where 67 per cent of voters approved membership of the EU next
year. But Austria is aware of slackening momentum behind the Maastricht
treaty. 'On the question of institutional deepening, I remain rather
sceptical,' says Mr Manfred Scheich, Austria's ambassador to the EU and
negotiator on EU accession. 'Maastricht has exhausted, if not
over-exhausted, the potential for qualitative steps forward in this field.'
Austria will be part of the 'hard core' of countries eventually
participating in Emu, Mr Scheich predicts. But, recalling that German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl had recently queried whether Emu was feasible by
1999, he added: 'We all have doubts about the timetable laid down in
Maastricht. In economic integration, we should concentrate on making the
single market work.'
The questioning of Maastricht is just one of Europe's uncertainties.
Fissiparous tendencies in western Europe mirror the breakdown of political
structures and allegiances in eastern and central Europe during the past
five years.
Prof Loukas Tsoukalis of Athens university says cynicism about European
union and establishment politicians is part of a general malaise. 'This time
of pessimism is different from those in the past. It is linked to a crisis
of governance in most European countries.'
According to Mr Brian Gosschalk, managing director of the UK's Mori opinion
research company, 'There is a sense of disillusionment. Europe is suffering
from a lack of positive symbols.' His organisation has just carried out a
poll across Europe indicating only 30 per cent of the EU electorate supports
a 'United States of Europe', against 50 per cent who are opposed.
Since no member of the European parliament wields executive power,
Euro-elections - with a built-in tendency to amplify protest votes - provide
only an imperfect gauge of the public's views on European integration. But
the voting on June 9 and 12 gave some pointers to political trends. Voter
turn-out across the 12 members was 57 per cent, the lowest of the four
direct elections since 1979. Particularly large falls came in Ireland,
Netherlands and Portugal, states traditionally enthusiastic about
integration.
Under Maastricht and the 1987 Single European Act, governments have given
the parliament significant new powers to help correct Europe's 'democratic
deficit'. But a large proportion of voters still regard it with lack of
interest or sympathy. Additional powers for the parliament could thus,
ironically, widen rather than narrow the gap between European
decision-makers and the people.
Public doubts about the role of the parliament could increase if the greater
variety of parties represented there - especially on the right  - undermines
its cohesiveness. As a foretaste, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime
minister, apparently failed this week to persuade Mr Kohl to allow his
victorious Forza Italia movement to join the Christian Democrat group in
Strasbourg.
Overtly anti-Maastricht parties did well in France, Belgium, Greece and
Denmark. The conservative Popular Party, which topped the poll in Spain, is
more lukewarm on Emu than the governing Socialists. In Italy, Mr Berlusconi
emerged with his position reinforced as Italy's first Eurosceptic prime
minister since the second world war.
The elections brought contrasting results in France and Germany, the
traditional driving forces for greater European co-operation. In France, the
shift from mainstream groupings resulted in the two governing parties, the
neo-Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF, gaining just 25.5 per cent of the
vote.
In Germany, the governing parties showed they could still rally voters. Mr
Kohl's Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian
Social Union, achieved a better-than-expected 38.8 per cent, with
anti-Maastricht parties failing to win seats.
But fragmentation is making its presence felt in Germany, too. The score of
Mr Kohl's three coalition parties, including the Free Democrats, was 42.9
per cent, the lowest government result in a national German election since
1949.
Low scores for left- and rightwing mainstream parties in France was because
both the RPR/UDF and the Socialists 'mishandled the internal contradictions
of their European policies', according to Mr Didier Witkowski, a political
analyst at France's Sofres opinion research company. By contrast, he says,
Mr Kohl benefited from the general German perception that the country is now
the stronger partner in the relationship with Paris.
The French government wants to 'bind' reunited Germany within a strengthened
European framework. But a substantial part of the French electorate appears
to doubt whether French eagerness to follow a German lead over Europe is in
France's interests. Some of these doubts seem to be shared by Mr Edouard
Balladur, the French prime minister. Mr Balladur, who said this week the
splitting of the French presence at Strasbourg would weaken France's voice,
warned in 1989 it was an 'illusion . . . (that) we can bind Germany
irreversibly into western Europe'.**
Mr Kohl's success on Sunday underlines how he has become Europe's pivotal
leader. But for all the good intentions being displayed by Bonn ahead of
Germany's six-month EU presidency starting next month, any increase in
German assertiveness is likely to brake rather than speed moves towards
European unity.
One Bonn official says Mr Kohl benefited particularly from the support of
older people worried about a resurgence of nationalism in eastern Europe. He
adds, however, that these are voters generally hostile to the Emu objective
of replacing the D-Mark with a single currency.
Mr Gunther Nonnenmacher, co-editor of the conservative Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung, says Mr Kohl succeeded in 'defusing' monetary union as
an election issue. This reflects last October's ruling by the Federal
Constitutional court that Emu can come about only via strict fulfilment of
the rigorous Maastricht 'convergence criteria'.
Mr Hans-Joachim Veen, head of research at the Christian Democrats' Konrad
Adenauer Foundation in Bonn, says two-thirds of Germans oppose monetary
union. Mr Kohl is seen as the 'guarantor that, if the Ecu, or common
currency, comes one day, it will not be a radical change.' Since Bonn is
sticking to the slogan that 'stability (of the future European currency) is
more important than the timetable', Mr Veen accepts the date for introducing
Emu may slip beyond 1999.
On the future, he says, about 25 per cent of Germans want Europe to deepen
integration, 30 per cent want to widen it to the east, and 45 per cent
favour the status quo. 'We will have to muddle through.'
An opinion poll by Germany's Allensbach organisation this month showed
ambivalence in German attitudes to Europe. Although most Germans say they
favour closer co-operation, they show strong opposition to concrete projects
affecting German sovereignty.
If in coming years the future of Europe is to be determined by any one
country, it seems likely that the continent will be marching to music
composed in Germany. Yet it will not be a fast drum-beat, rather a slow and
cacophonous waltz with many pauses and contradictions. The travellers along
the European trail will be moving at varying speeds. And some, on the
evidence of this week's news, will be heading in different directions.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Men in the News: Opposite sides of the track - Robert Horton
and Jimmy Knapp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's UK rail dispute has witnessed the sight of two formidable
prizefighters squaring up to one another.
Robert Horton, chairman of Railtrack, gained a reputation as a corporate
hatchetman during his 35-year climb to the top of British Petroleum. Jimmy
Knapp, the gravel-voiced general secretary of the RMT transport union, has
acquired a name as a canny and experienced negotiator in the arcane world of
railway industrial relations over more than three decades.
They have been pitted against each other in the sort of industrial dispute
which many thought had died with the 1970s. The battle between the rail
union and Railtrack, the company which took over responsibility for British
Rail's track, stations and signals in April, led to a one-day shutdown of
most of the rail network on Wednesday and the threat of further action next
week.
The outcome of the first round appears to have been victory for Knapp,
leaving Horton and his negotiating team looking out of their depth. Faced
with an outrageous demand from the union for a no-strings-attached pay rise
of 11 per cent, Railtrack's negotiating team fumbled its hand.
Knapp got hold of internal company memos, indicating an early willingness to
make an offer of 5.7 per cent to the union. This had prompted the government
to intervene to avert any risk of a settlement which would break its
guidelines for a public sector pay bill freeze.
By allowing the dispute to flare up at this early stage of the privatisation
of the BR network, Railtrack has damaged its own credibility and harmed its
own prospects for a speedy and profitable flotation. This has awakened fears
in the rest of the rail industry about Railtrack's ability to manage its
affairs.
The question being asked is whether Horton, 54, who took up his Pounds
120,000-a-year job after being ousted as chairman and chief executive of BP
in 1992, has made a successful transition from the world of big oil to the
rail industry.
In his first 12 months at Railtrack he has tackled a mass of administrative
detail - on property ownership, access agreements with train operators, and
so on. It will be another year at least before Railtrack can show whether it
is reducing costs and improving the efficiency of the railway. But its
ability to deal with the rail unions will set an important signal.
Horton acquired his tough image at BP by abolishing head office committees
and cutting layers of management. But a sharp decline in profits during the
recession and a reputation for arrogance prompted his fellow directors to
press for his resignation.
There is a feeling in the rail industry that he carried over this
haughtiness into Railtrack, which has a monopoly of the railway
infrastructure and which is, by and large, dealing with far smaller
companies. 'There is a perception of Railtrack as an organisation with an
arrogant self-confidence,' commented one rail industry source.
To blame Railtrack for being remote from the concerns of railwaymen would be
a mistake, however. Many of its senior managers, including chief executive
John Edmonds and the industrial relations team, are long-term railwaymen.
There is speculation in the industry that Horton's management style may have
clashed with that of the old-timers.
Certainly, morale at Railtrack will not have been enhanced by Horton's
description of Colin Hall, author of the memo made public by the union, as
'an over-zealous, very junior manager'. In fact, Hall, production manager of
Railtrack's south zone, is fairly senior. 'I don't think British Rail would
have fingered a member of staff in that way,' said an industry source.
Horton, however, is keen to challenge his aggressive reputation, and be seen
as the railway's saviour, not executioner. 'I have a sense of responsibility
as the custodian of a great national asset,' he said recently. 'We have got
to jolly well use it. I would be disappointed if we are not carrying more
passengers over more miles in three years.'
Jimmy Knapp's public image is similarly deceptive. He resembles the last of
the trade union dinosaurs (though only 53), a throwback to the old labour
agenda of industrial strife. He once likened himself to 'the picture of
Dorian Gray in reverse'. But contrary to his appearance and thick, gravelly
Ayrshire accent, Knapp is not an old-style autocratic union leader.
Far from being a willing tool of the left wing which dominates his union's
policymaking, he is essentially a traditional socialist, with a strong will
of his own. He and his union activists have fought hard and long, but
without much success, against the privatising of the railways and for more
investment in the network.
He has lost numerous battles when his members have refused to heed the
union's strike calls - over, for instance, engineering workshop closures.
Knapp's years in office have seen the union fighting an often bitter
rearguard action against change on the railways, particularly in defence of
entrenched and obsolete working practices, such as insisting that even new
trains - operated only by drivers - should have guards on board.
Some critics believe Knapp and his executive are intent on sabotaging
privatisation by frightening off possible franchise holders with a display
of old-style industrial aggression. But Knapp is simply trying to preserve
the centralised industrial relations system of the pre-privatisation British
Rail while working with a management more sensitive to commercial pressures.
In the long run, such a strategy looks doomed to defeat, because the railway
needs to be modernised. For the moment Knapp appears to have thrown
Railtrack on to the defensive. Horton and his team have made a poor start -
but it would be foolish to underestimate their ability to recover.
This weekend, as the two sides meet at Acas, the conciliation service, they
will to be trying to bridge what they agree is the 'enormous gulf' between
them - before the next strike, due on Wednesday.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Goodwood switches to horsepower: A new motor racing festival
plans to bring back a bygone elegance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Glorious Goodwood', the cliche title of one of the main events on the horse
racing calendar, is acquiring a double meaning for Goodwood Company Estate,
the family-run company which controls commercial activities on the Duke of
Richmond and Gordon's 12,000 acres of West Sussex.
This weekend the Duke's heir Charles, Earl of March and Kinrara, is turning
the estate over to motor sport, for which it was once as famous as
Silverstone in Northamptonshire is now.
The 'festival of speed' includes an auction of racing and classic cars, with
the international classic car market looking for a turnaround in prices,
which have slumped since 1989.
The festival also includes a hill-climb intended to recreate the elegant
social atmosphere of early post-war motorsport - 'racing's equivalent of
Ascot or Henley' - according to Mr Robert Brooks, the Brooks auction house
principal helping to organise it. A hundred and thirty cars will race
against the clock near Goodwood House.
The estate is poised for a more ambitious project - to bring back
competition to the nearby Goodwood motor racing circuit. The circuit, which
also contains an airfield, is used for testing and high-speed driving
courses.
The Pounds 5m project, which includes a new museum of motor racing, will
create 300 jobs and provide an economic stimulus in this mainly rural corner
of southern England.
The proposals have met with some protests, mainly from a private housing
development near the circuit. In response, the number of proposed race days
has been cut and Glasgow-based Acoustic Services is to install acoustic
barriers around the circuit to prevent excess noise spilling into the
countryside.
The plans have won provisional approval from Chichester's environmental
health committee and the formal planning application was submitted two weeks
ago.
Goodwood Aerodrome and Motor Circuit, an estate company subsidiary, has
proposed three motor racing meetings a year, starting in 1996, featuring
Aston Martins, Le Mans Jaguars, Ferraris and other historic cars mainly
owned and driven by wealthy enthusiasts.
At least 25,000 people are expected at this weekend's festival, which is
expected to involve the most valuable collection of classic and modern
racing cars to compete in a single motorsport event. Several dozen of the
130 competing cars have previously been sold for more than Pounds 1m.
A pointer to what many might be worth now is expected tonight when one of
the world's most famous racing cars - the 1957 Aston Martin DBR2/1 driven at
Le Mans by Stirling Moss - goes under the hammer.
It is expected that prices of the nearly 100 cars being auctioned will
reflect a cautious strengthening since the spring.
Stirling Moss, whose own career was cut short in a 140mph crash at Goodwood,
will be one of the celebrities driving in the event, as well as McLaren
grand prix team owner Ron Dennis, and entertainer Rowan Atkinson. The
festival will mark the 100th anniversary of competitive motor sport.
Competing cars flown in from around the world range from a 1894 Peugeot
Vis-a-Vis, to the latest grand prix cars.

FT  18 JUN 94 / ITV quits race to televise lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV yesterday withdrew from the contest to televise the National Lottery -
blaming the Independent Television Commission's interpretation of the rules.
The withdrawal may have involved an element of face-saving; Camelot, the
consortium which won the right to operate the National Lottery, had made
clear it would probably prefer to work with the BBC. It is holding detailed
talks with the corporation and an agreement is expected by the end of this
month.
ITV put together a comprehensive package to try to win the high-profile
broadcast. It included the promise of promotion for the lottery throughout
the ITV system, making top ITV stars and shows available for the draw, a
two-year contract, a payment of more than Pounds 2m and the promise to share
exclusivity with independent local radio or even BBC radio.
However, ITV could not meet one of Camelot's specifications. In addition to
the main multi-million pound lottery draw on Saturday evenings, Camelot
wants a mid-week show with winners of scratch-card prizes taking part in a
quiz show with big winnings.
The commission ruled that ITV must retain editorial control - meaning that
it must be able to choose the contestants.
Mr Andrew Quinn, ITV Network Centre chief executive, said yesterday: 'ITV
made a very attractive offer to Camelot, and we are naturally very
disappointed that ITC regulations prevented us from proceeding further.'
The timing of the ITV announcement, before an agreement with the BBC has
been signed, could affect the terms of the deal.
ITV is still expected to cover the results of the lottery - which is due to
be launched in November. As soon as the winning numbers are chosen they
could be broadcast along the bottom of any ITV programme on at the time.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Bedfordshire may be split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bedfordshire yesterday became the eighth county in the space of a week to be
recommended for abolition by the Local Government Commission for England.
The commission recommends replacement of the two-tier system of local
government for the county - a county council and four lower-tier district
councils - by two new all-purpose unitary authorities, with boundaries
created by merging existing districts.
These would be North Bedfordshire, merging Bedford borough with Mid
Bedfordshire District Council, which includes Biggleswade, Flitwick and
Sandy, and South Bedfordshire, formed by a merger of Luton borough with
South Bedfordshire District Council, including Dunstable and Leighton
Buzzard.
The commission says this option would cost between Pounds 9m and Pounds 12m
to start up, with annual savings thereafter of between Pounds 1m and Pounds
4m.
A second preference from the commission would split Bedfordshire into three
unitary authorities, with Luton and Bedford becoming independently
self-governing, and Mid and South Bedfordshire merging to form a third
unitary. The commission believes this would save Pounds 1m per year at most.
A final option would be to create a unitary authority for Luton alone and
merge the other three districts.
In a departure from its practice in most of the recommendations of the past
week, the commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, has not left continuation
of the two-tier status quo as an option for local residents to consider.
A nine-week consultation period will now start, with freepost questionnaires
sent to every household in the county, asking people to state their
preference between the options.
This week, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria,
Lancashire and Oxfordshire county councils have all been recommended for
abolition, after similar recommendations earlier in the year for Avon,
Cleveland, Humberside, North Yorkshire, and Somerset.

<TEXT>
A framework agreement on new constitutional arrangements for Northern
Ireland is unlikely to be completed in time for next month's UK-Irish
summit, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday.
Talks between the political parties in the province are not expected to
resume before the autumn because of slow progress by the British and Irish
governments in drafting the framework document, which is intended to provide
a focus for the talks.
The governments had hoped to publish the document to coincide with a planned
bilateral summit next month, but following a meeting of the UK-Irish
inter-governmental conference in Dublin yesterday, Mr Spring admitted it
would be 'difficult to meet that timetable'.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the framework
document, which will flesh out the principles established in December's
Dowing Street declaration, would not be 'a blueprint or template' to which
the parties would have to conform.
But he stressed that it would have to address modification of the Republic's
territorial claim to Northern Ireland 'if it is to have any chance of
success' in bringing unionists to the negotiating table. 'It is central to
the problem,' said Sir Patrick.
Mr Spring said: 'There has to be compromise on both sides, by both
governments.' Modification of the territorial claim would be in the context
of a 'balanced accommodation' which would also involve modifications to the
Government of Ireland Act of 1920.
He referred specifically to Section 75 of the act, which states: 'The
supreme authority of the parliament of the United Kingdom shall remain
unaffected and undiminished over all persons and things in (Northern)
Ireland and every part thereof.'
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has indicated that it intends to
give its 'definitive response' to the Downing Street declaration early next
month - but is not now expected to recommend an end to the IRA campaign.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Talks on Severn crossing sackings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks between management and unions are due to take place today in an effort
to resolve a dispute that has halted work on the Pounds 300m second Severn
crossing between England and Wales.
More than 700 construction workers, who are seeking higher bonus payments,
were dismissed on Thursday when they took part in a 24-hour strike after a
ballot. Laing-GTM, the UK/French main contractor, said yesterday that the
men had been in breach of contract, but would be invited to reapply for
their jobs on Monday under the existing terms and conditions.
Today's meeting will be held with Ucatt, the construction union, and the
TGWU and GMB general unions. Mr Graham Read, of Laing-GTM, said: 'We've no
wish to shut down dialogue with union officials.'
A picket line was mounted yesterday outside the site of the privately
financed bridge, which is due to open in spring 1996.
The unions are complaining of low basic pay for work which they say is often
skilled, arduous and dangerous. GTM-Laing said existing bonuses were at
least compatible with those in other parts of the industry, and that workers
had accepted terms and conditions jointly agreed by management and unions on
the project.

FT  18 JUN 94 / MPs beef up inquiry into CSA structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commons social security committee is to undertake 'root and branch'
examination of the Child Support Agency amid mounting concern about the
organisation's structure and competence.
The committee, which began taking evidence this week, had intended only to
examine the possibility of changes to the formula by which absent fathers
make maintenance payments to their families.
But MPs on the committee are now to make the inquiry much wider. One
committee member said: 'The focus is moving away from the operation of the
formula to the competence and efficiency of the CSA itself.'
The government has repeatedly said that it is keeping the operations of the
CSA under constant review, amid signs that officials are increasingly
swamped by complaints from absent fathers about the level of maintenance
payments they are forced to make.
But the widening of the social security committee's inquiry is another sign
that pressure is mounting on ministers to introduce primary legislation to
reform the agency during the next session of parliament.
Most of the committee's recommendations from their first report into the
CSA, published last year, were implemented by the government. Ministers
privately acknowledge that the committee's next report, due in October, will
be examined for its insights.
An official at the Department of Social Security acknowledged this week that
some reforms would need primary legislation.
For example, changes to the principle whereby 'clean break' settlements
between divorced couples cannot be offset against maintenance payments,
would require a parliamentary bill.
One of the factors that has heightened the committee's concern is what one
Tory described as an apparent 'breakdown' in the CSA's system of
enforcement.
He said there appeared to be a 'concerted campaign not to pay maintenance on
behalf of absent parents'. But he warned: 'Absent parents are not going to
get away with it . . . There is an absolute determination in the committee
and the government that absent parents shall pay a realistic amount of
maintenance.'
The committee is also worried by growing evidence that neither the CSA's
first annual report nor its business plan will be published in this
parliamentary session.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Editor of Independent newspapers agrees to stand down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent, has agreed to
stand down as editor. Mr Matthew Symonds, one of the three founders and
executive editor, is expected to leave the group.
Mr Whittam Smith, who is editor-in-chief and chairman of Newspaper
Publishing, the company which owns The Independent and the Independent on
Sunday, will remain as chairman.
He has made his intentions clear to a number of directors and shareholders
of the company. The decision to step down is his own and the timing of the
announcement will depend on finding a successor.
Informal soundings have already taken place, and this process is now likely
to get under way in earnest. A very long list has already been drawn up and
shareholders are being encouraged to add names to it.
The list includes a number of broadcasters with little experience of
newspapers such as Mr Jeremy Paxman, the Newsnight presenter, and Mr Roger
Mosey, editor of Radio 4's Today programme. Ms Liz Forgan, managing director
of BBC Radio - who used to work for The Guardian - is also being mentioned.
The more orthodox names range from Mr Jonathan Fenby, a former Independent
journalist who now edits The Observer, and Mr Ian Hargreaves, deputy editor
of the Financial Times, to Mr Nigel Wade of The Daily Telegraph and Mr Ian
Jack, editor of the Independent on Sunday.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of HJ Heinz and of Independent Newspapers of
Ireland - who controls 29.9 per cent of Newspaper Publishing - had a further
meeting yesterday with Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of Mirror Group
Newspapers, which is also a significant shareholder in The Independent.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Labour urges tax pressure on dividends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jim Cousins, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, suggested in the
Commons yesterday that a Labour government should consider using the tax
system to encourage companies to limit dividends and increase investment.
While making clear that he was not advocating statutory control of
dividends, he said the government should 'steer and guide' through the right
kind of changes in existing financial arrangements.
Mr Cousins is one of the few members of the Labour front bench to have
nominated Mrs Margaret Beckett for the party leadership.
He criticised institutional and other shareholders for failing to devote
enough attention to the development prospects of the companies in which they
invested.
He complained that the banks had put more money into property development
'in five years of the 1980s' than they had put in to manufacturing industry
in 15 years.
Mr Cousins said this could not be corrected by legislation - but a different
kind of relationship was needed between businesses enterprises, banks and
institutional shareholders.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, denied that the government was
complacent about the need to encourage allocation of more resources to
research and development.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Large British firms improve liquidity in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's large industrial and commercial companies improved their
short-term liquidity positions in the first quarter of this year as they
used the proceeds of share and bond issues to build up current financial
assets and repay bank borrowings, Peter Norman writes.
Seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office yesterday
showed that the overall liquidity ratio of large UK companies increased to
144 per cent at the end of March from 133 per cent at the end of December
and 107 per cent at the end of March 1993.
The ratio measures current assets maturing in less than a year as a share of
liabilities that have to be repaid in less than a year. It is based on a
survey of 350 of Britain's biggest companies and gives an indication of the
short-term financial strength of the large-company sector.
Non-manufacturing companies, including oil companies, were especially flush
with liquid assets: their liquidity ratio jumped to 175 per cent at the end
of March from 159 per cent at the end of last year and 129 per cent at the
end of March last year.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Nimbies winning battle for Berkshire: Builders are watching
planning policy in a politically sensitive county
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leafy county of Berkshire, home of Royal Ascot and Windsor Castle, this
summer finds itself at the centre of yet another planning wrangle. The
outcome may determine how government intends to respond to demands from
housebuilders to be allowed to develop in politically sensitive shire
counties.
Prospects for builders seeking to expand output sharply in some of Britain's
most valuable property markets do not appear bright judging by recent policy
statements by the Department of the Environment.
The 1991 Planning and Compensation Act, supported by planning guidance notes
from the department, allows county and district councils much greater
authority to determine local needs and plans. The department's strategy was
to ease pressure on diminishing countryside by encouraging greater use of
urban land.
Importantly it reversed government policy of the 1970s and 1980s which had
assumed a presumption in favour of housing development to meet the growing
demand for homes in southern England.
The pro-development attitude reached its peak during the mid-1980s when the
then Nicholas Ridley, as environment secretary, seized on the acronym Nimby
(not-in-my-backyard) to attack local residents for trying to prevent
newcomers from living and working in their area.
In July 1989 Mr Ridley approved the construction of a country town of 4,800
homes called Foxley Wood at Bramshill Forest, in north-east Hampshire. The
proposal was made by Consortium Developments, a group of 10 of the country's
largest housebuilders. Three months later this decision was reversed by a
new environment secretary, Mr Chris Patten, now Hong Kong's governor.
For many of the post-war years, the main measure used by successive
governments of the effectiveness of their housing policy had simply been to
calculate the number of homes built annually.
Mr Patten signalled a marked shift in this strategy, announcing that the
previous guidance to planners to presume in favour of housebuilding was
being withdrawn. He added that it was up to local people, through councils
rather than central government, 'to decide how and where their (housing)
requirements should be met'. Within 18 months, Consortium Developments had
been disbanded.
The strength of government commitment to this new strategy has never been
fully tested. The desire of housebuilders to acquire expensive sites in
controversial areas fell sharply during the recession. Only now are
ambitious development plans beginning to surface as the housing market
recovers. Hence the importance attached by builders to the final draft of
the Berkshire structure plan.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, recently emphasised his commitment to
encouraging development in towns and cities. In a policy statement on
transport planning he said he wanted to 'ensure the vitality of rural areas,
so that people who live there do not become long-distance commuters'. He
added: 'Housing development needs to be accessible to public transport so
that there is an alternative to the car.'
Berkshire in the 1980s was the subject of a series of bitter battles between
housebuilders, planners, environmentalists and local residents. The latter
often complained that they were in danger of being over-run by concrete. At
the moment they appear to have the minister's ear.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Companies challenged on disclosure of results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quoted companies are exploiting regulatory loopholes to present their
financial results in the best possible light, Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday.
Most advertisements placed in the financial press to record a company's
performance do not comply with London Stock Exchange disclosure
requirements, it found.
The details are contained in a survey by Mr Roger Hussey and Ms Sarah Woolfe
of the University of the West of England, published yesterday by the
institute's research board.
Fewer than three-quarters of companies revealed their turnover and just over
a third showed their tax charge in results advertisements placed in the
Financial Times in 1992.
Publication of these and another dozen elements are required by stock
exchange listing requirements if the results advertisement is the only way
the data is passed on to shareholders. There are no requirements as to which
numbers are shown if the company separately sends out this full information
in a report to all shareholders.
With the exception of the large privatised utilities, most companies do send
out this separate report, so they are not breaking the law. But they are
only presenting highly selective information which often shows their results
in a favourable light.
'Results advertisements have to be read with extreme caution,' said Mr
Hussey, professor of financial services. 'There are mostly advertising the
company. Their information value is limited.' He called existing stock
exchange requirements 'silly'.
The authors highlight a wide degree of variation in the time lapse between
the date of the financial results and the date of their publication. They
say companies should provide greater balance-sheet information, and that
cashflow data at the half-year stage should be made compulsory.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Firms warn on conflict of interest: Fears over role of
investigating accountants grow in receivership debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two firms of chartered accountants yesterday added to the criticism of the
process by which investigating accountants appointed by banks to examine
ailing companies can then take on the role of receiver.
Kingston Smith, the 28th-largest firm, said there was a 'clear conflict of
interest' and that a negative report from an accountant which led to
receivership made it impossible for the firm to remain objective.
The comments followed those on Thursday by Mr John Jackson, chairman of
Brown &amp; Jackson, the owner of the loss-making Poundstretcher retail chain.
Mr Jackson called the practice 'objectionable' and called for an inquiry by
the Bank of England and the accountancy bodies.
Mr Michael Snyder, Kingston Smith's senior partner, said: 'We have had a
number of clients to whom accountants were appointed and played it safe (by
recommending receivership). It has been a real problem.'
He said there was a tendency for banks to instruct the largest firms, the
investigators from which 'are most likely to be insolvency experts with the
prospect of a future receivership in their minds'.
Mr Simon Rees, senior partner of Rees Pollock, a London-based practice,
said: 'There can be a conflict of interest and there is certainly a public
perception.'
He said there was a tension because investigating accountants were generally
paid by directors of an ailing company, but reported to a bank.
However, Mr Derrick Woolf, joint head of corporate support services at
accountants Levy Gee, which specialises in insolvency work, said: 'We would
never get another job from a bank if we recommended receivership when it was
not necessary.'
Mr Allan Griffiths, vice-president of the Society of Practitioners of
Insolvency and a partner with Grant Thornton, said receivership was
recommended in only a small proportion of investigations.
He added that it would prove very costly and more destructive to a business
if its banks had to appoint as its receivers a separate firm which lacked
knowledge of the company.

<TEXT>
An accountant asked by Brent Walker to review transactions criticised in the
press never learnt of close links between the property and leisure group and
the other companies involved, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr Philip Hardacre of KPMG Peat Marwick was called to help Brent Walker
answer criticisms of the arms-length nature of sales of film rights by Brent
Walker's film division to Universal Talent Management.
The prosecution in the trial of Mr George Walker, the former Brent Walker
chairman and chief executive, alleges the transactions were part of a fraud
to boost Brent Walker's profits by Pounds 19m.
Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director,
both deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiracy. Mr John Quested
and Mr Donald Anderson, both former directors of the Brent Walker film
division, are alleged to have been co-conspirators.
Giving evidence, Mr Hardacre said he discussed the transactions with the
four men, but did not become aware that UTM's bank account was controlled by
Mr Quested and Mr Anderson. Nor did he know that some of the money paid by
UTM would be refunded by Brent Walker itself. The trial continues on Monday.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Prince of Wales to pay Pounds 1m tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prince of Wales is expected to pay about Pounds 1m in his first tax bill
since he volunteered last year to pay income tax.
The prince will pay 40 per cent of the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall,
which totalled Pounds 4.08m in 1993, after deducting the costs of his
official duties. The details of his tax returns have not been finalised, but
the total is expected to be similar to the sum under the former system when
he voluntarily surrendered 25 per cent of the duchy's total income.
The duchy's accounts, published yesterday, showed that net income for the
year had increased from Pounds 3.41m to Pounds 4.08m. The value of the
duchy's assets increased from Pounds 76.2m to Pounds 87.7m. Income from
farmland and property was Pounds 9.1m compared with operating costs of
Pounds 5.6m. The high operating costs stemmed from the wide geographical
spread of holdings and higher-than-average maintenance standards. A further
Pounds 1.05m of income came from stockmarket investments, offset by a Pounds
1.05m interest charge that stemmed from acquisitions of commercial property
in the late 1980s.
The Duchy of Cornwall was created in 1337 by Edward III for the Black Prince
to provide an income for the heir to the throne. It comprises 130,000 acres
of agricultural land, mainly in the south-west of England and the Isles of
Scilly, a residential and property portfolio, and a Pounds 40m quoted
investment portfolio in environmentally sound companies.
The duchy said it aimed to be efficient, forward-looking and commercially
sensible while seeking to respond to the interests and concerns of the
prince.
The prince's advisers are finalising his tax return with the Inland Revenue.
All expenses connected with official duties, including the running of his
62-strong office, entertainment and uniforms, are allowable against tax.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Leadership Contest: Beckett breaks with party policy on
picketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Margaret Beckett yesterday sought to enhance her appeal to Labour
traditionalists by calling for the return of secondary picketing as part of
a root-and-branch reform of union law.
In a move which infuriated supporters of the other two Labour leadership
candidates, Mrs Beckett went beyond party policy by calling for laws
allowing a 'sensible, workable and fair' approach to secondary picketing.
Coming less than 24 hours after the left-led TGWU general union recommended
her for the leadership, Mrs Beckett's move looks set to enliven the contest,
putting daylight between the candidates on a specific policy issue for the
first time.
Mr Tony Blair, the favourite to succeed John Smith, this week rejected the
notion that all union legislation passed by the Conservatives since 1979
should be scrapped, saying he did not think it would be 'sensible'.
Mr John Prescott, the leading traditionalist candidate, has pledged to work
for the repeal of sections of Tory legislation, without being specific.
Interviewed on BBC radio, Mrs Beckett said that a sensible approach to
secondary picketing was needed to ensure workers were not treated 'without
any regard for reasonable industrial rights which would be enjoyed anywhere
else in Europe'.
She said there could well be 'a need just to sweep the board clear and start
again, keeping those elements of existing legislation which people thought
it was right to retain'.
She added: 'There are things many unions would want to see retained - some
of the methods of balloting and so on - but sometimes when you are trying to
replace legislation you can't do it bit by bit, you have to have a new act
and it may well be that is the right path to follow.' Blair and Prescott
supporters accused Mrs Beckett of pandering to her backers in the TGWU.
In a move more in keeping with the general trend among unions, the Unison
public-services union decided against recommending any of the candidates. It
said it had agreed 'strongly to encourage' all levy-paying members to
exercise their own judgment.
Mrs Beckett's remarks were seized upon by leading Conservatives who claimed
they showed Labour was in disarray about its union policy.
Sir Norman Fowler, the departing Tory chairman, said Mrs Beckett's decision
to 'let the cat out of the bag' had left Labour in 'a total shambles'.
He was supported by Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, who told MPs that
Mrs Beckett's backing for a return to secondary picketing suggested that a
Labour government under her leadership would re-create the industrial
problems of the 1970s.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Dishing the dirt on cleaning for the spooks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three cleaners working for the MI6 intelligence service were yesterday
hidden from the media in order to publicise their case.
The cleaners, all women, were forced to tell their tale of employment woe
from behind a screen - because they have been threatened with dismissal
under the Official Secrets Act.
At a press conference the women's trade union said they were three of 47
cleaners forced to sign a 'gagging order' promising not to speak to the
press about their complaints against the Foreign Office which is threatening
to make them redundant for refusing to accept a pay cut. They might have
been out of sight but they were not afraid to be outspoken - attacking Mr
Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, over the loss of their jobs.
Mr Jack Dromey, of the TGWU general union - which organised the press
conference - claimed they would face instant dismissal under the Official
Secrets Act if identified, and lose their redundancy payments.
Many of the women, who have been positively vetted, have worked for MI6 for
30 years. Their jobs were subjected to market-testing to see if they could
be done more cheaply by contractors. Mr Hurd, in a letter to two Labour MPs,
said the cleaners had 'rates of pay and allowances above the market rate'.
Strand Cleaners has won the contract to clean the MI6 offices when the
organisation moves this summer to a new building at Vauxhall Cross, south
London. The hourly rate for cleaners is to be cut from Pounds 4 to Pounds
3.50, with a reduction in holiday entitlement and sick pay.
One woman who has worked for MI6 for 19 years said she stood to lose as much
as Pounds 1,200 if she complained about her treatment and was identified.
Another said the cleaners had been 'victimised just to save money'. All said
that they were patriotic, law-abiding women who had been unfairly treated.
Mr Dromey said he was prepared to take the case to the European Court of
Justice.
The Foreign Office said that the government had acted within both UK and
European law over the market-testing.

FT  18 JUN 94 / DTI drops opposition to pension white paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A white paper on occupational pensions reform is to be released next week
following resolution of a dispute between two government departments on the
potential cost to employers of the reforms.
Industry sources said the Department of Trade and Industry had intervened to
block the release last week of the Department of Social Security's white
paper, which proposes legislation which for the first time would require
pension schemes to meet minimum solvency standards.
The paper is expected to propose that from April 1997 all schemes have
enough assets to meet minimum solvency standards. Those that do not will
have until April 2002 to add additional funds.
A DSS study of 500 company pension schemes found that 86 per cent would meet
the proposed minimum solvency test. But the 14 per cent of schemes which do
not meet the proposed standards include a significant number of large
pension funds.
The DTI became concerned over the costs to industry - the study showed that
meeting the new solvency standards would cost industry between Pounds 1bn
and Pounds 2bn because employers had not been putting enough cash into their
schemes.
The department was also concerned that the effect of the minimum solvency
standards would be to encourage pension schemes to sell equities and buy UK
gilts, hitting stockmarkets.
The white paper follows recommendations from a government-appointed panel,
the Pension Law Reform Committee, chaired by Professor Roy Goode. The Goode
Committee had recommended that each scheme be required at all times to have
'cash equivalents' - at least enough assets to provide each member with his
or her full benefits earned retrospectively if the scheme were wound up
immediately.
The industry objected, arguing that this would force schemes to dump
equities for lower-yielding gilts and drive up the costs to employers of
providing pensions. The Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries
proposed a compromise which would allow schemes to take greater account of
returns on equities when calculating 'cash equivalents'.
Whitehall sources said that the DTI had backed down after it became
convinced that the Goode Committee solvency standard had been watered down
so far that any further weakening would in effect mean abandoning the
measure.
Research for the DSS also suggests that the UK stockmarkets would be
unaffected by changes in investment strategy as fund managers adapt to the
new standard.
The research suggests that fund managers are likely to reduce holdings of
foreign equities and increase their purchases of UK index-linked gilts.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Talks on rail dispute planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both sides in the rail signalling dispute are due to meet today for joint
negotiations at the conciliation service Acas in an attempt to prevent a
further 24-hour shutdown of the network on Wednesday, Robert Taylor writes.
The RMT union said last night that it hoped to resolve the dispute over the
weekend but added: 'There is still a wide gulf between us.'
The union wants an interim pay offer for the signalling staff before
entering job restructuring talks with Railtrack. Its claim is for an 11 per
cent pay rise. It has been offered a 2.5 per cent basic rate increase for
all employees in line with the government's public-sector pay policy.
Railtrack said it was willing to negotiate a self-financing package for the
signalling staff in return for higher productivity but refuses to concede
any 'up-front' payment for past improvements in efficiency. It said: 'The
process of discussion is now obviously back on the tracks.'

FT  18 JUN 94 / Japanese fear credit squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The decline in Japanese corporate profits has started to ease but money
supply continues to be weak, fuelling fears of a squeeze on credit.
The Bank of Japan announced that the country's benchmark money supply - M2
plus certificates of deposit - grew 1.7 per cent in May from the same month
last year, a slowdown on the 2.2 per cent rise shown in April.
The broad measure of liquidity, including postal savings, state debt and
investment trusts, rose 3.2 per cent, against 3.3 per cent in April.
This is still well below the 5 per cent annual growth which economic
analysts believe is needed to fund a recovery, and is likely to add to
central bank concerns over credit creation.
Separately, a quarterly survey of nearly 20,000 companies by the Finance
Ministry showed a combined 5.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the three
months to March, from the same period in the previous year.
That was the 15th quarter of profits decline, but better than the falls of
6.2 per cent of the previous three months and 21.6 per cent in the period
before that. Corporate sales rose by 0.8 per cent in the first three months
 -led by service industries - breaking a decline of seven consecutive
quarters.
The mood in Japanese boardrooms, however, remains cautious: Mr Shoichiro
Toyoda, the new chairman of the Keidanren, warned in his first public speech
this week that he did not have much confidence in the economic outlook.

FT  18 JUN 94 / California faces new budget crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
California is once again facing a budget crisis, with an estimated Dollars
6bn (Pounds 4bn) cash deficit for the fiscal year which will end on June 30
and a furious political row over whether Governor Pete Wilson's budget
arithmetic for next year adds up.
Under the state constitution, the California legislature is supposed to pass
a new budget by June 15, but this deadline has passed and Mr Gray Davis, the
state controller, is warning he may once again have to start issuing IOUs to
pay the state's bills.
Governor Wilson's Dollars 57bn proposed budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year
was thrown out of kilter when voters rejected three ballot proposals 10 days
ago authorising nearly Dollars 5bn of bond issues to pay for repairs to
roads, bridges and schools damaged in January's Los Angeles earthquake.
Californian finance officials are also on edge as they wait for the Supreme
Court's decision on the case brought by Barclays Bank of the UK and
Colgate-Palmolive of the US against the unitary tax formula under which they
have in the past assessed taxes on corporations.
The Supreme Court is expected to issue its ruling as early as next week. If
it decides for Barclays, California would have to refund about Dollars 400m.
If it also decides for Colgate, another Dollars 1.3bn would have to be
refunded.
A repeat of the 63 day crisis in 1992 when California had to issue IOUs to
pay its employees and suppliers is threatened. Mr Davis said that he could
not legally issue more conventional short term debt unless convinced the
state was able to repay it.

The Coca-Cola company yesterday announced plans to reopen its South African
operations, eight years after it disinvested from the country.
The group will establish a Southern African division office in Johannesburg
later this year and purchase National Beverage Services, the South African
company which now provides marketing, technical and other support to local
Coca-Cola bottlers.
The new office will have responsibility for regional marketing in Namibia,
Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana.
The price of the proposed Natbev purchase has not been disclosed and is
subject to final approval from the South African Reserve Bank.
Coca-Cola products, currently sold through independent bottling franchises
in South Africa, make up about 75 per cent of annual domestic carbonated
soft drink sales of R3.5bn (Pounds 648m).
However, the market has recently become more crowded, and Coca-Cola's
announcement comes only a week after arch-rival PepsiCo decided to return to
South Africa in a joint venture with black businessmen.
Coca-Cola has said it too will try to accelerate black empowerment through
affirmative action, a management development programme, encouraging black
suppliers and participating in educational schemes.

Mr Manuel Camacho Solis, the Mexican government's peace commissioner in

less than a week after Mayan Indian rebels in the southern Mexican state
rejected a peace plan Mr Camacho had negotiated with them.
Mr Camacho had been directing Mexico's efforts to find a peaceful end to a
peasant uprising that broke out on January 1 in the impoverished state near
the Guatemalan border.
Mr Camacho launched a blistering attack on Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate
of his own ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) saying recent
criticism Mr Zedillo had made of his peace efforts had hurt his ability to
continue and damaged the peace process.
'At the very moment in which we had achieved ..a consolidated truce in
Chiapas, a vote of censure has been expressed with regard to my work, and
every resource has been used to broadcast it,' Mr Camacho said of Mr
Zedillo's repeated statements that the peace negotiations had been a
'failure.'

FT  18 JUN 94 / Berlusconi may break promise on taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's Berlusconi government indicated yesterday that it would be prepared
to break a campaign promise and raise taxes to cope with a constitutional
court decision ordering the payment of L30,000bn (Pounds 12.3bn) in pension
arrears.
In advance of a cabinet meeting late yesterday, officials said the
government would adopt a twin-track approach. The preferred option was to
suspend implementation of the court decision and stretch payments over a
period of years.
If that proved legally impossible, though, the government would impose a
one-off 'constitutional court tax', so named to underline that the court's
decision was behind the tax increase. During his election campaign, Mr
Silvio Berlusconi promised to cut taxes.
Fears that the pension payment would breach the 1994 budget guidelines and
push the public-sector deficit back above 10 per cent of GDP caused sharp
falls this week on the Milan bourse and in the bond market. Matters were
made worse by the government's delay in clarifying the precise cost of the
court decision.
The uncertainty has also affected the lira, which closed against the D-Mark
yesterday at L983, compared to L958 when Mr Berlusconi was named premier a
month ago.
Lawyers have raised doubts about suspending or not fully implementing the
court decision. The court itself says it would be difficult for parliament
to endorse any measure that sought to bypass its authority.
Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the budget minister, made clear on Thursday if the
arrears have to be paid in full, the 1994 budget deficit would still be held
down to the target of L154,000bn. That would mean either postponing payment
until the 1995 budget or immediately introducing a special tax.
On Thursday evening, union leaders reacted angrily to a government decision
to impose the one-off tax on pensioners who would benefit from the arrears
payments. They threatened immediate action if that were to happen and the
government retracted the proposal, indicating that the cost would be spread
evenly.
The unions also protested that the government had long been aware of the
court's impending decision and of its likely impact on the budget.
Whatever approach the government adopts, market analysts said the government
needs to produce broad outlines for its 1995 budget strategy as soon as
possible.
Even without the burden of the pension arrears, government critics have
suggested this week that its first measures - unfreezing public works
contracts and introducing tax breaks for new investments and job creation -
will add to the 1994 budget deficit.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Textile chief's sentence overturned

<TEXT>
Taiwan's Supreme Court has overturned the conviction and 2 1/2 year prison
sentence of flamboyant textile tycoon Oung Ta-ming in connection with a
Dollars 22m (Pounds 14.6m) stock-trading scandal which led to the
resignation of a cabinet minister, writes Laura Tyson in Taipei.
Mr Oung is the de facto head of the Hualon group, which recently signed an
agreement to establish a Pounds 157m textile plant in Northern Ireland, with
British government backing.
The case against him was thrown back to the country's high court for retrial
as there was not enough evidence to support the earlier verdict, according
to the deciding judge.
Mr Oung was convicted in 1992 on breach of trust charges for selling, below
market value, shares in an unlisted life insurance company to the daughter
of the former minister of transport and communications.
'There is not enough evidence to prove that Oung sold the shares at lower
prices than the actual value. The definition of high and low is very
subjective,' a court spokesman said.
The decision prevents Mr Oung being stripped of the parliamentary seat he
won in December 1992.
The Supreme Court upheld the acquittal of Mr Oung Yi-ming, a younger
brother, for improperly enriching others in a land scandal. Sentencing was
withheld in the case of another brother, Mr Oung You-ming, who was involved
in the share scandal. He fled the island in 1991 and has not returned to
face charges.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Compromise may help US bank bill pass soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury said it had resolved one of the issues holding up passage of
an interstate banking bill, but banking officials warn that negotiators are
still deadlocked over its application to foreign banks.
Bank officials said they believed the bill, which would allow banks to open
branches outside their own states, could become law as early as the end of
this month, and would certainly be passed before Congress breaks up in
August.
Treasury officials said they had reached a compromise on Thursday night with
consumer groups on the extent to which state laws would apply to banks
availing themselves of the the bill's new freedoms.
'This was the most divisive and intractable issue in the bill,' said Mr
Richard Carnell, assistant secretary for financial institutions at the US
Treasury.
Interstate banking bills have been passed by both the Senate and the House
of Representatives, but delegates from the two chambers are now locked in
negotiations on how to reconcile the differences between their two versions.
Under the compromise, state laws on consumer protection and fair lending
would generally apply to branches of an out-of-state bank just as they do
already to a bank incorporated inside the state. They would not apply if
federal laws specifically pre-empted them or if the Comptroller of the
Currency the chief bank regulator, determined they discriminated against
out-of-state banks.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, called the compromise 'a
significant and very positive step.' But agreement is still a long way off
on the issue of foreign banks. The Senate version of the bill would restrict
foreign banks from opening new branches in the US unless they operate
through a separately incorporated subsidiary with its own capital. While
some foreign banks have such subsidiaries, many have opened branches
depending directly on the parent company. Foreign banks say this would be a
breach of the principal of national treatment.
In a strongly worded letter to the House banking committee and the Treasury,
Mr Andreas van Agt, the European Commission's ambassador in Washington,
warned the Senate version 'might prejudice the important principles of
national treatment and freedom of investor choice ..'

Brazil yesterday reacted angrily to reports that Argentina, theoretically a
close ally, had backed Mexican President Carlos Salinas to head the World
Trade Organisation instead of the Brazilian candidate, Finance Minister
Rubens Ricupero.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentine economy minister, was asked to cancel a visit
to Brazil which had been scheduled for later this month. Brazil's Foreign
Ministry said the cancellation was not a reprisal, but the visit was
considered 'not opportune' because of Brazil's preparations to introduce a
new currency.
However, a ministry spokesman said the Argentine action had caused 'great
discomfort' and had been viewed as 'diplomatically inelegant'.
The row started on Thursday night at the close of the fourth
Iberian-American meeting in Colombia. Mr Salinas won the meeting's informal
backing to head the WTO, which is to succeed the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade next year. He was helped by Argentine President Carlos
Menem who privately proposed Mr Salinas as the Latin American candidate.
This led to allegations from Brazil, whose President Itamar Franco had left
the meeting early to attend a funeral, that Argentina had waited for the
Brazilian delegation to leave before raising the subject.
The informal backing of the Iberian-American group will strengthen Mr
Salinas' candidature, and only one candidate from Latin America is expected
to be considered by the new body. But Brazil insisted yesterday that Mr
Ricupero, the only person to have officially put his name forward, remained
a 'viable' candidate.
The row between Brazil and Argentina comes at a difficult time. The two
countries have until the end of this month to finalise a common external
tariff for the planned Mercosur common market, due to take effect on January
1. Brazilian officials are in Buenos Aires this week discussing the tariff
rates.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Paris offers 2,000 troops for Rwanda: Italy may also be
ready to help stop the slaughter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France told the Western European Union defence group yesterday it was ready
to send troops to stop the ethnic slaughter in Rwanda but apart from a half
promise from Italy won no immediate pledges of support from other allies.
France told a meeting of ambassadors from the nine-nation WEU in Brussels it
was ready to send a battalion and reinforce it up to a level of 2,000 troops
if necessary, diplomats said. Italy said it would not exclude sending
troops, but made no firm commitment.
Mr Willem van Eekelen, WEU Secretary-General, said after the meeting
ambassadors would meet again on Tuesday to assess which countries were ready
to make a contribution to the mission.
He said the WEU would coordinate any operation rather than run it directly
and that there was agreement that any mission would have to be carried out
with United Nations approval.
His comments follow pressure from France for African and European partners
to intervene in Rwanda to stop continued killing there.
Graphic pictures and accounts of the massacre of thousands of people brought
back by French television and visiting ministers, have helped spur France
into action, as well as frustration that a month after a UN resolution
authorising a new UN force, there is still no sign of it getting anywhere
near Rwanda.
France has intervened in Rwanda before. It sent in 600 soldiers in 1990 to
stop the Hutus and Tutsis killing each other and broker a power sharing
arrangement. This eventually bore fruit in last year's Arusha accords, an
investment of French diplomatic and military effort that Paris evidently
does not now want to see wasted.
To avoid charges of acting in a maverick or neo-colonial manner, France is
keen to persuade other Europeans to join it in sending troops.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur told the leaders of Benin and Mauritius that
French intervention would be strictly humanitarian, designed to bring some
calm and food to the country before handing over to planned UN
reinforcements.
Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, was meanwhile on visits to Ivory Coast
and Senegal. Paris hopes that Senegal, which has already offered troops to
the UN force, might be ready to send them earlier, under some sort of new UN
resolution covering the French initiative.
France would like UN authority under Chapter 7 of its charter; this would
allow intervention without the approval of all sides to a conflict that is
required under Chapter 6 and has so far stymied the arrival of the new UN
force.
General Paul Kagame, commander of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF),
reiterated yesterday his opposition to intervention by France, because it
had trained the Hutu-dominated government forces.
The French government yesterday strongly denied French soldiers may have
shot down President Julien Habyarima's plane on April 6, the incident that
triggered the violence.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Mexico's Chiapas peace commissioner resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manuel Camacho Solis, the Mexican government's peace commissioner in
Chiapas, has resigned from his post and temporarily retired from politics,
less than a week after Mayan Indian rebels in the southern Mexican state
rejected a peace plan Mr Camacho had negotiated with them.
Mr Camacho had been directing Mexico's efforts to find a peaceful end to a
peasant uprising that broke out on January 1 in the impoverished state near
the Guatemalan border.
Mr Camacho launched a blistering attack on Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate
of his own ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) saying recent
criticism Mr Zedillo had made of his peace efforts had hurt his ability to
continue and damaged the peace process.
'At the very moment in which we had achieved ..a consolidated truce in
Chiapas, a vote of censure has been expressed with regard to my work, and
every resource has been used to broadcast it,' Mr Camacho said of Mr
Zedillo's repeated statements that the peace negotiations had been a
'failure.'
The rebels want to spur a democratic transition in the country, while the
government is increasingly treating the conflict as a local one. Mr Salinas
reiterated yesterday efforts to deal with the problem would now be handled
by the Chiapas state government.
Widely believed to harbour presidential ambitions ,Mr Camacho angrily
resigned as mayor of Mexico City last November after being passed over by
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in favour of the late Luis Donaldo
Colosio as PRI presidential candidate in elections to be held in August.
He recently joined a group of private intellectuals and politicians seeking
to push for greater democracy and to promote stability after the elections
expected to be the closest in recent Mexican history.
Mr Camacho pledged not to participate in any political activities until Mr
Salinas' presidential term ends in December. While this seems to end the
possibility of an independent presidential candidacy an idea he has toyed
with since being passed over some analysts believe he may still present
himself as an interim consensus president if the existing candidates fail to
win a healthy majority.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Taiwanese hesitantly cast founder in a harsher light: The
ruling party is slowly cutting links with Chiang era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Statues of Chiang Kai-shek, the generalissimo who fled China in 1949 and set
up a nationalist government in Taiwan, are gradually being taken down or
moved to less visible locations as the Chiang family influence wanes.
Over the last decade, Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT), once dominated by
General Chiang and then by his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, has steered the island
from a backwater military dictatorship into an industrial powerhouse and
arguably the most democratic state in east Asia.
The party is moving to weaken the Chiang connections, but has stopped short
of repudiating Gen Chiang whose often brutal rule ended at his death in
1975. However, the political landscape has changed markedly since, shortly
before his death in January 1988, Chiang Ching-kuo set reforms in motion by
lifting martial law and a ban on the formation of new parties.
Debate in the parliament has become so tempestuous that brawls are the norm,
prompting Shanghai's Liberation Daily on Thursday to accuse Taiwanese
lawmakers of making themselves an international laughing-stock and behaving
like 'monkeys'.
In another sign of change, eight high-ranking generals were impeached
earlier this month by the Control Yuan, a government watchdog, for wasting
taxpayers' money in an arms deal from the mid-1980s. This public humiliation
of the military would have been unthinkable in the Chiang era.
Nonetheless, the generalissimo's stern visage still looks down from the
walls of government offices, banks, companies, and post offices. An
estimated 30,000 statues remain in place across the island, in traffic
circles, school grounds and other public places. But one statue of Chiang on
horseback, a target of vandalism by opposition protesters, was spirited away
this month at night under heavy police guard by the city government,
ostensibly to ease a traffic bottleneck.
The KMT is now run by Taiwan-born civilians, the military-linked Chinese
mainland faction having been decisively shoved off the political stage in
early 1993. But its present leadership remains reluctant to complete a
reassessment of history which would inevitably tarnish the former first
family's image.
This is not only because many senior government officials, including
President Lee Teng-hui, owe their political advancement to the family, but
because to reject Chiang would be to jettison his vision of reunification
with mainland China - tantamount to declaring Taiwan's independence, which
in turn might provoke Beijing into the use of force.
In an unusually frank interview with a Japanese scholar published a few
months ago, President Lee actually referred to the KMT as a 'foreign regime'
and termed Beijing's inclusion of Taiwan as a province of China a 'strange
dream'. Earlier this week a Chinese news agency for the first time attacked
President Lee by name, accusing him of trying to 'split the motherland'.
There are limits to change. 'The KMT is trying to de-emphasise the
connection between the present government and the past regime in what is
part of the 'indigenisation' of the party,' said Mr Lu Ya-li, a professor at
National Taiwan University.
'They've made several concessions to the demands of the opposition, but
they're afraid of sparking a conservative backlash if they go too far.'
In particular, the KMT refuses to release documents locked in military
archives which might shed light on events surrounding a massacre of
Taiwanese in the early months of 1947, known as the '2-28 incident' for the
February day on which it is said to have begun.
An estimated 15,000-30,000 people were either killed or disappeared at the
hands of KMT forces quashing Taiwanese rebels. Most of those killed,
scholars say, were from Taiwan's intellectual class.
While the genesis of the 2-28 incident has yet to be fully clarified, many
scholars believe the withheld documents would reveal what has long been
suspected: Chiang himself was behind the crackdown which took place two
years after Japan ceded rule of the island to the then Nanjing-based
Nationalist Chinese government.
Opening the archives would also unmask the names of military personnel who
carried out orders, possibly sparking a hunt for those still alive. 'There
are a lot of skeletons in the closet,' said Prof Lu.
On Wednesday, relatives of victims in the 2-28 incident demonstrated before
the KMT headquarters, calling the KMT a 'bandit' party. Protesters demanded
a formal government apology, compensation of NTDollars 10m (Pounds 240,000)
per victim and a public holiday for February 28 to commemorate the tragedy.
The KMT early this week agreed to pay families up to NTDollars 6m for each
person killed, although it declined to use the term 'compensation',
preferring the word 'arrangement'. But it rejected demands to apologise, to
declare a national holiday, and to force military commanders responsible to
face trial.
There are some concessions to the truth, although the KMT is still reluctant
to confront its past and that of Gen Chiang. In the last year, textbooks
have inserted for the first time a brief mention of the 2-28 incident.
'There will gradually be a more objective evaluation of Chiang Kai-shek's
place in Taiwan's history,' said Prof Lu. 'On the one hand he was
responsible for land reform here, and he maintained the economic stability
Taiwan needed to develop. But he has also been criticised for rigidity in
foreign policy and disregard for human rights, even brutality.'

FT  18 JUN 94 / California faces new budget crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
California is once again facing a budget crisis, with an estimated Dollars
6bn (Pounds 4bn) cash deficit for the fiscal year which will end on June 30
and a furious political row over whether Governor Pete Wilson's budget
arithmetic for next year adds up.
Under the state constitution, the California legislature is supposed to pass
a new budget by June 15, but this deadline has passed and Mr Gray Davis, the
state controller, is warning he may once again have to start issuing IOUs to
pay the state's bills.
Governor Wilson's Dollars 57bn proposed budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year
was thrown out of kilter when voters rejected three ballot proposals 10 days
ago authorising nearly Dollars 5bn of bond issues to pay for repairs to
roads, bridges and schools damaged in January's Los Angeles earthquake.
Californian finance officials are also on edge as they wait for the Supreme
Court's decision on the case brought by Barclays Bank of the UK and
Colgate-Palmolive of the US against the unitary tax formula under which they
have in the past assessed taxes on corporations.
The Supreme Court is expected to issue its ruling as early as next week. If
it decides for Barclays, California would have to refund about Dollars 400m.
If it also decides for Colgate, another Dollars 1.3bn would have to be
refunded.
The budget negotiations are complicated by electoral politics. Mr Wilson, a
Republican, is running for reelection in November. Mr Davis, a Democrat, is
running in the same ballot for the lieutenant governor's office.
This threatens a repeat of the 63 day crisis in 1992 when California had to
issue IOUs to pay its employees and suppliers.
Mr Davis said he could not legally issue more conventional short term debt
unless he was reasonably convinced that the state was able to repay it.
Governor Wilson's budget, he said did not provide a credible basis for such
a conclusion.
Besides the failure of the bond issue proposals, Mr Davis said Governor
Wilson had also underestimated health expenditures by Dollars 2.6bn.
An alternative budget proposal circulated by Democrats in the legislature
would cut some prison and law enforcement spending and extend a temporary
income tax surcharge on families with incomes above Dollars 300,000.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Russia knocks on west's doors: Moscow wants to enter three
clubs, but on its own terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the next three weeks, Russia will - barring last-minute surprises - step
at least halfway across the threshold of three prestigious western clubs:
Nato, the European Union and the Group of Seven industrial powers.
Although an end to the self-isolation of the Soviet regime is a
long-standing aim of the Yeltsin administration, diplomats expect Moscow to
haggle until the last moment over the size of its fee for appearing in the
three-act drama.
Nato said yesterday that Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister,
would sign up to Partnership For Peace, the western-inspired military
co-operation programme, in Brussels on Wednesday.
The following day, President Boris Yeltsin will travel to the Greek island
of Corfu where - with ships of the disputed Black Sea Fleet at anchor nearby
 -he will dine with the leaders of the European Union.
He will also sign a partnership agreement under negotiation for two years,
and intended to open the EU market for many Russian products.
Two weeks later, Mr Yeltsin and his western counterparts will converge on
Naples, for the G7 summit. For the first time, a Russian leader is expected
to play a full part in the group's political consultations.
The precise terms on which Russia joins the Partnership For Peace will be
the subject of vigorous negotiations over the next four days.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, the senior Russian diplomat who speaks for Moscow in
former Yugoslavia, arrived in Brussels yesterday to thrash out the content
of a broad Russian-Nato agreement that will be sealed at the same time as Mr
Kozyrev signs up to PFP.
Mr Churkin and Nato diplomats will be haggling about both the content of the
accord, and its presentation.
Nato has tried to play down the extent to which Russia is being treated
differently from the 20 countries, mostly ex-communist, already signed up to
PFP. Mindful of their sensitivities, the alliance has vowed not to conclude
with Moscow any legally binding instruments, treaties or protocols over and
above the standard entry form for PFP.
Nato wants any such deals to be agreed on as informally as possible. In the
words of a British diplomat, 'PFP must be the main dish, though there can be
a nourishing side-salad.'
However a binding protocol on the broader Russia-Nato link - which is
expected to include a dialogue on nuclear and non-proliferation issues - is
precisely what Mr Churkin will be demanding.
The Russians have already proposed one formula that would save the face of
both sides: the document would be described as a protocol in Russian, but it
would be stressed that the word does not have such a robust legal sense in
Russian as it does in most western languages.
As to the content of the extra-PFP agreement, the Russians wants it to
endorse their idea of subordinating Nato to the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe.
One Russian draft reads in part: 'The paramount aim of the partnership would
be. . . co-operation over settling crises, averting conflict, conducting
peace support operations, and forming an effective system of security and
stability in Europe that takes into account the leading role of the CSCE. .
.'
Other aims would include: 'Co-operation in the prevention of the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; the prevention of possible new
nuclear missile threats; the conversion of military industries to civilian
purposes; co-ordination of plans to produce new types of weapons - including
jointly produced weapons; (co-operation over) arms control and disarmament,
and the fight against nuclear and any other form of terrorism.'
Most of these ideas are broadly acceptable to Nato, as long as the west can
choose when it wants to discuss these issues with Russia and when it wants
to keep the discussion private. But Russia wants the opposite: a right, as
formal as possible, to participate in western deliberations on broad
security issues.
The Russian proposal's inclusion of non-proliferation and nuclear terrorism
is a reminder that on these issues, its interests coincide to a broad extent
with those of the west. Moscow has no wish to see rogue regimes or, even
worse, rogue individuals in control of nuclear weapons.
However Russia is keenly aware of how badly the US needs its vote on the UN
Security Council for any moves to put pressure on North Korea.
Mr Kozyrev will discuss this with Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of
state, before signing up to PFP.
Conceding to Russian aspirations on the form - and even the content - of its
relations with Nato may turn out to be the price that the US and other
western countries are obliged to pay for securing Moscow's co-operation in
dealing with nuclear miscreants.

The Norwegian government yesterday agreed terms with Phillips Petroleum for
new facilities for the ageing Norwegian North Sea Ekofisk field, ending two
years of uncertainty over the future of the field, the hub of the world's
largest oil transportation system.
The development of new facilities for NKr20bn (Pounds 1.83bn) is the biggest
investment in an oil field in the Norwegian North Sea sector in six years.
The agreement also demonstrates the government's willingness to be more
flexible on operating conditions: it extends production periods in Ekofisk
for oil companies which have been delaying commitments to develop new oil
and gas fields, claiming Norway's tax regime is too stringent at a time when
oil prices are relatively low.
In 1992 the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog,
threatened to close the 250,000 b/d field by 1996 for safety reasons.
Phillips last year submitted interim plans to improve the safety and
operational reliability of the field which were rejected as inadequate by
the authorities. However, the safety issue has been resolved because the old
facilities will gradually go as new investment takes place.
Phillips Petroleum Norway, which holds 37 per cent of Ekofisk, had been
reluctant to invest further in it because its operating licence ran only up
to 2011, long before production was due to end.
Under the deal, Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the industry and energy minister, said
the government would extend Phillips' licence to 2028 and waive a production
tariff for the new facilities during the period 1999-2028, saving an
estimated NKr900m.

Inflation in Canada has disappeared, with the year-on-year consumer price
index falling in May for the first time since mid-1955. Statistics Canada
said yesterday that consumer prices fell by 0.2 per cent last month. The
annual inflation rate for the year to May was also minus 0.2 per cent.
Inflation has been falling steadily since 1991 when it reached a peak of 5.9
per cent. High interest rates and the 1991-93 recession gave the initial
impetus to weakening prices.

Federal regulators in the US cannot apply more lenient regulatory

ruled yesterday. The Federal Communications Commission had allowed smaller
long-distance carriers, including MCI Communications and Sprint, to offer
rates and services without having to specify them to the FCC.
Because of the high cost of filing with the FCC, agency officials believed
that relaxing regulations on smaller telephone companies would allow them to
better compete against American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which controls 60 per

The French treasury, competing with Credit Lyonnais bank as a creditor of Mr
Bernard Tapie, laid claim yesterday to the politician's furniture. The
Budget Ministry said that, in a near replay of a swoop by the state-owned
bank last month, two bailiffs went to Mr Tapie's 16th-century Paris mansion
to stake the tax authorities' claim on antique furniture and art works. Mr
Tapie has said his collection represents some 40 per cent of his FFr800m
(Pounds 93m) worth of assets.
The authorities, alleging tax evasion and business fraud over Mr Tapie's
pleasure yacht, have asked for his parliamentary immunity to be lifted so
that investigations can go ahead.
The ministry said the treasury, in principle, has priority claim among
creditors. But sources close to the loss-making bank, while stressing that
it had no intention of engaging in open battle for the assets, pointed out
that his belongings are guarantees on part of the FFr1.2bn it lent him.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Oslo agrees terms with Phillips on Ekofisk field
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Norwegian government yesterday agreed terms with Phillips Petroleum for
new facilities for the ageing Norwegian North Sea Ekofisk field, ending two
years of uncertainty over the future of the field, the hub of the world's
largest oil transportation system.
The development of new facilities for NKr20bn (Pounds 1.83m) is the biggest
investment in an oil field in the Norwegian North Sea sector in six years.
The agreement also demonstrates the government's willingness to be more
flexible on operating conditions: it extends production periods in Ekofisk
for oil companies which have been delaying commitments to develop new oil
and gas fields, claiming Norway's tax regime is too stringent at a time when
oil prices are relatively low.
In 1992 the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog,
threatened to close the 250,000 b/dfield by 1996 for safety reasons.
Phillips last year submitted interim plans to improve the safety and
operational reliability of the field which were rejected as inadequate by
the authorities. However, the safety issue has been resolved because the old
facilities will gradually go as new investment takes place.
Phillips Petroleum Norway, which holds 37 per cent of Ekofisk, had been
reluctant to invest further in it because its operating licence ran only up
to 2011, long before production was due to end.
Under the deal, Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the industry and energy minister, said
the government would extend Phillips' licence to 2028 and waive a production
tariff for the new facilities during the period 1999-2028, saving an
estimated NKr900m. These two concessions helped pave the way for Phillips to
commit itself to the investment for the new facilities, as they underpinned
the economic viability of the field. The government estimates the sales
value of petroleum resources in the field at NKr130bn between 1999 and 2028,
based on an oil price of NKr108 a barrel.
The government also said it would take a direct 5 per cent stake in Ekofisk
separate from that of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, which holds
1 per cent.
The agreement must clear two hurdles before the development can be realised:
the Storting (parliament) must approve the deal and so must shareholders in
the field, including Petrofina, which holds a 30 per cent stake, and Agip,
which has 13 per cent.
The new Ekofisk plan calls for the construction of a simple well-head
platform to accommodate 40 wells and for a processing and treatment
platform. The well-head platform is due to be installed in 1996 and will use
existing processing and treatment facilities until the replacement platform
is completed for operation from 1998. Phillips will close seven existing
platforms when the new processing and treatment platform becomes
operational.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Procedo chief held as Balsam scandal spreads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The scope of the alleged fraud surrounding Balsam, a German sports-floorings
manufacturer, widened yesterday with the arrest of the chief executive of
Procedo, the largest factoring company in Germany and the largest creditor
to the Bielfeld-based Balsam.
The arrest of Mr Dieter Klindworth follows that of the entire four-man board
at Balsam last week. It took place after BfG Bank, the biggest creditor to
Balsam and Procedo, filed suit with Wiesbaden-based state prosecutors
alleging that Procedo was an active party to the fraud, rather than a
victim.
The latest arrest came on the day that creditor banks met in Wiesbaden to
formulate their response to what is developing into one of Germany's largest
post-war fraud scandals.
Bankers are owed DM1.74bn (Pounds 696m) by Procedo and face a further DM300m
to DM400m in losses arising from transactions undertaken by Balsam in the
derivatives markets. These are believed to have a gross value of up to
DM14bn, dwarfing Balsam turnover of DM460m last year.
Bankers were told yesterday that the fraud had been in place for up to 10
years before it was discovered this month. According to the head of the
Frankfurt branch of a UK bank, 'it was the perfect scam', at the heart of
which were faked applications for finance from the Procedo factoring company
which conducted two-thirds of its business with Balsam.
Under a conventional factoring arrangement, the factoring company advances
cash to its client against the security of unpaid invoices. It then takes a
commission for the service and assumes responsibility for collecting the
clients' receivables.
Bankers were told yesterday that Balsam obtained finance from Procedo on the
basis of grossly inflated or fictitious contracts with overseas customers.
They heard, for example, that the true value of UK contracts factored by
Procedo was just Pounds 250,000, compared to Pounds 76m in Procedo's books.
Most of the contracts relate to the US, where Balsam had a business building
sports arenas for schools and local authorities. Many of the contracts
against which finance was raised allegedly did not exist but Procedo
advanced the cash on the basis of 'comfort letters' purporting to be from
the St Louis office of the Arthur Andersen accountancy firm. These letters
were forged and Andersen has said it did not know about the letters - which
date back to 1984 - until June this year.
The representatives of the 50 banks owed money by Procedo are believed to
have expressed anger yesterday that Allgemeine Kreditversicherung, the
Mainz-based insurance company which owns 50 per cent of Procedo, is not
willing to advance cash to rescue the factoring company. AKV is itself 50
per cent owned by Allianz, Europe's biggest insurance company, and Munich
Re, its reinsurance associate.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Life insurers criticised for poor surrender values:
Household names offer low refunds when customers cash in policies early,
says OFT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some UK insurance companies offer such poor terms for cashing in life
policies early that customers could be better off holding their savings in
cash, according to the Office of Fair Trading.
An OFT report on 60 of the UK's largest life insurers yesterday discloses
wide disparities in the surrender values of life insurance policies.
The study shows that companies with household names are among those offering
the worst returns to policyholders. It will reinforce the OFT's campaign for
greater disclosure of costs and charges by insurance companies.
The OFT cites studies showing that one-quarter to one-third of policies
lapse in the first two years alone. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of
fair trading, said: 'On the basis of assumptions about lapse rates and
projections of surrender and maturity values, the policyholders of some
companies appear to receive average rates of return which are no more than
marginally positive, or even negative.'
For instance, on a 10-year 'with-profits' policy, involving payments
totalling Pounds 3,000 in premiums over the first five years, the
policyholder would earn a refund of Pounds 3,315 from Eagle Star but a
refund of Pounds 2,244 from National Provident Insurance.
On a 25-year unit-linked policy, where Pounds 3,000 in premiums had been
paid in the first five years, Scottish Mutual would refund Pounds 2,534
while Allied Dunbar would repay just Pounds 1,500.
The study shows that several companies that offer the worst early surrender
values are also those which have been fined or disciplined by Lautro, the
self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, for mis-selling. They
include Guardian, London and Manchester, Reliance Mutual, Legal and General
and Colonial Mutual.
Other companies offering poor value to early leavers in at least two product
types are Royal Life, Axa Equity and Law, Irish Life and Pearl.
Only one company whose products rank in the top five of value for money on
early surrenders - Norwich Union - has been fined for poor sales practices.
Equitable Life ranked in the top five for almost all products.
The study also examined the profit margin earned on each policy in each year
of its life and concluded that for some companies, greater profits are
earned on policies that surrender early. 'For a few companies, the pattern
of profits suggests that returns to the company are higher when more
policyholders surrender early with significant losses,' Sir Bryan said.

FT  18 JUN 94 / US disarray over policy on sanctions for N Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US diplomatic efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear dispute were in
confusion last night after indications of a breakthrough during talks in
Pyongyang were disavowed by President Clinton.
Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president seeking to broker a solution on a
private visit to Pyongyang, told Mr Kim Il-sung, the North Korean dictator:
'I would like to inform you that they have stopped the sanctions activity in
the United Nations.'
Cable News Network, the US television channel, showed him making the remark
and reported that he told Mr Kim he was doing so after consultations with
the White House.
However, Mr Clinton denied in Chicago there had been any change in US
policy, which he had outlined on Thursday, to seek UN sanctions to punish
North Korea for its failure to open its nuclear facilities to international
inspection. He had said the US would continue to seek sanctions while it
explored the credibility of the latest North Korean offers.
Mr Clinton said: 'I don't know what he (Mr Carter) said, and I don't know
that you know what he said. All I know is what I said, and what I said is
the policy of United States.'
The denial appeared to undermine the efforts of Mr Carter, who is scheduled
to end his three-day visit to North Korea today. Though acting in a private
capacity, he had been fully briefed by the White House before setting off.
During his talks, North Korea indicated it was willing to remain a party to
the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), and Mr Kim said two inspectors
from the International Atomic Energy Agency could remain at the North's
nuclear complex in Yongbyon. North Korea withdrew from the IAEA this week.
Mr Carter told the 82-year-old dictator that the Clinton administration had
'provisionally agreed' to a new round of talks with Pyongyang if it returned
to the International Atomic Energy Agency and agreed to freeze its nuclear
programme.
He suggested the US was ready to issue a declaration banning the use of
nuclear weapons against North Korea if negotiations proceeded smoothly.
North Korea has long sought such a guarantee.
In a goodwill gesture, Mr Kim said he was ordering the activation of joint
North Korean-US search teams to look for the remains of US soldiers killed
in the 1950-53 Korean war.
Although yesterday's talks may ease tensions on the Korean peninsula, they
did not directly address the issue of full nuclear inspections that lies at
the heart of the 15-month dispute.
The IAEA wants to examine the nuclear facilities to determine whether
plutonium was diverted in 1989 to build atomic bombs. North Korea has
blocked IAEA access to two suspected nuclear waste dumps and may have
destroyed evidence of activity by withdrawing spent fuel rods from the
reactor without allowing the IAEA to analyse them.
Mr Kim told Mr Carter he would allow full inspections if the US granted
diplomatic recognition and economic aid.
Government officials in Seoul noted previous attempts to arrange talks had
collapsed because of Pyongyang's refusal to accept IAEA inspections.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Gummer set for row with developers: Environment minister
acts to curb supply of rural land for new houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has moved to restrict the supply of
development land in one of the country's most sought-after housing markets.
His intervention comes as the government struggles to recapture its
traditional supporters in southern England, many of whom oppose further
housing development in rural areas.
However, Mr Gummer's action will anger housebuilders who have warned that a
shortage of development sites is pushing up housing land prices.
Environment department officials have suggested to Berkshire county council
that the government would prefer it to limit the supply of housing land in
its forthcoming structure plan to 40,000 homes between 1991 and 2006. This
is one-sixth less than the 48,000 homes recommended by DoE inspectors
following a public inquiry last year.
The intervention is non-binding but is understood to reflect Mr Gummer's
desire to strike a balance between the needs of development and of
protecting the countryside.
Berkshire councillors, who had proposed a lower development limit of 37,000
homes, will meet next week to discuss the department's letter. The structure
plan is due to go to a meeting of the local authority's environment
committee for approval next month. Mr Gummer may then overrule the council's
plan.
The issue is regarded as a 'landmark planning decision' by the
Housebuilders' Federation, which proposed a development target of 52,000
homes. It will be the most controversial structure plan to be endorsed since
the introduction of the 1991 Planning and Compensation Act which gave more
power to local authorities to determine planning issues.
The outcome in Berkshire, housebuilders say, will set the tone for future
structure plans drawn up by other county councils. Pressure for residential
developments in southern England is expected to increase as the housing
market recovers.
The federation has warned that a shortage of development sites has already
pushed housing land prices up by 50 per cent in the south-east during the
past year - 'stoking inflationary pressures in the rest of the economy'.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England, which supported Berkshire's
limit of 37,000 homes, is also likely to be dissatisfied with the 40,000
figure, which it says does not recognise environmental damage.
The need for the Tories to regain ground in southern England was highlighted
in last month's local elections when they won only 27 per cent of the
overall vote - the same figure as the Liberal Democrats who are seen by
local electors as being strong on environmental issues.

FT  18 JUN 94 / Political uncertainty and inflation fears push up bond
yields
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European government bonds fell yesterday on fears of rising inflation and
large budget deficits. Political uncertainty following elections to the
European parliament earlier this month reinforced the bearish sentiment
which has dogged the markets since the start of the year. During the week,
German, French and Italian bond prices hit lows for the year.
US Treasuries were bruised by a falling dollar, climbing commodity prices
and data showing a rise in consumer confidence, all of which fuelled fears
of further rises in US interest rates.
Wall Street closed sharply lower in the wake of the bond market slide. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 34.56 points down at 3,776.

FT  17 JUN 94 / East 'needs farm price stability'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union urgently needs to set up a system to help support stable
farm prices in east and central Europe, and lay the foundations of an
agricultural policy that will enable these post-Communist democracies to
join the EU.
This is the main conclusion of an independent report released yesterday,
commissioned by Brussels from Mr Henri Nallet, a former French agriculture
minister, and Mr Adrian van Stolk, a Dutch authority on trade and
agriculture.
Papers from a closed seminar on eastern Europe, which the Commission held in
March, highlight the 30 per cent drop in farm output between 1988 and 1992
in Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics, Bulgaria and Romania.
'The risk is that agriculture will quickly become the central point of
friction with our eastern partners,' according to the paper presented by Mr
Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner. 'By one means or another,' he
says, 'a mechanism has to be found to sustain certain primary products at
near world price levels.'
The Nallet/van Stolk report warns that the fall in east European output,
because of falling prices leading to lack of investment and access to
credit, is too dangerous to ignore.
The report calls for modest price supports to buttress production and
eliminate the huge swings in food prices caused by speculators. It proposes
an Ecu62 (Dollars 71.92) price support for wheat - from which other support
prices would be derived - against the Ecu100 per tonne price the EU expects
to reach in 1996.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Swissair ponders Sabena stake to gain EU hub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swissair is discussing a strategic alliance with Sabena that might see the
Swiss airline acquire a large minority stake in the Belgian national
carrier.
Swissair confirmed yesterday that it was holding talks with Sabena as well
as with other European airlines, but declined to comment on a report that it
was considering buying a 49.5 per cent stake in the Belgian carrier.
Sabena also confirmed talks with Swissair but added that it was also holding
discussions with American Airlines over a possible link-up. Last week
American confirmed to Sabena an undisclosed co-operation offer.
A Sabena official drew a distinction between talks and negotiations and said
Sabena was talking 'to a lot of people'.
But Belgian government officials described as 'completely plausible' the
report of the possible acquisition by Swissair of a minority stake in
Sabena.
They added that the Belgian government would not object to a Swissair
minority stake as long as the Belgian state maintained majority control of
its airline. Sabena is currently 61.8 per cent state-controlled.
A large minority stake in Sabena would finally give Swissair a base in the
European Union to take advantage of the EU single aviation market.
Swissair's biggest handicap is its lack of free access to the liberalised EU
aviation market, especially since the airline appears to have lost any hope
of overcoming it through an air transport agreement between the Swiss
government and the EU.
The Swiss airline also indicated that it intended to expand its airline
partnerships after the collapse last year of the so-called 'Alcazar' plan to
merge Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System and
Austrian Airlines.
'Several European carriers are involved in the discussions, including
Sabena,' Swissair said yesterday.
A report published today in Cash, the Zurich financial magazine, refers to a
detailed document setting out the strategic importance for Swissair to
acquire a stake in Sabena.
The report said Swissair intended to acquire a 49.5 per cent stake in Sabena
by buying Air France's 37.5 per cent holding and a further 12 per cent stake
in Sabena held by four financial companies controlled by the Belgian
government.
Swissair said the article was based on one of a number of papers prepared by
McKinsey, the business consultants. 'It is not Swissair policy to comment
publicly on any proposals or recommendations which such documents may
contain,' it added.
Air France said it had no comment on the talks between Sabena and Swissair.
It added that its original agreement with Sabena left open the possibility
for another airline to acquire a minority stake in the Belgian carrier.
Although Sabena has become increasingly unhappy with Air France as a
minority shareholder, the financially troubled French carrier may be
reluctant at this stage to shed its stake, airline industry officials said
yesterday.
The sale of its Sabena stake risked complicating its efforts to win European
Commission approval for its proposed FFr20bn (Dollars 3.5bn) French
government capital injection, they added.

The Peruvian government has sold its minority holding in Cementos Lima, the

over-the-counter primary offering for a privatisation.
Proceeds from the sale of the 49 per cent holding - comprising some 309,000
voting shares - topped Dollars 103m. The 39 per cent auctioned fetched
Dollars 82m while existing shareholders paid Dollars 21m for another 10 per
cent, the equivalent of the final price.
Lead managers for the sale were Bankers Trust of New York.
Thirteen stockbrokers presented bids which finally secured 41 per cent of
the allocation at the clearing price of Dollars 266 a share.

The German company would pay about DKr105m (Dollars 16.1m) for a 20 per cent
stake in the Danish company, while Dansk Kaution would acquire a 30 per cent
holding in Hermes's Swedish credit insurance company for DKr12m, Dansk
Kaution said yesterday.
Dansk Kaution's articles of association, which prevent any one shareholder
from owning more than 12 per cent of the company, must be changed before the
alliance can come into force.

FT  17 JUN 94 / CS chief plays down fears over Austrian bank bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of CS Holding, yesterday said that Creditanstalt
would remain 'a proud and independent Austrian bank with its own identity'
if his Swiss financial group succeeded in winning control.
Mr Gut said he was well aware of political opposition to the efforts of CS
Holding to take control of Creditanstalt, Austria's banking flagship.
He felt his group had an even chance of winning control against competition
from a rival Austrian-led consortium.
Mr Gut said he would prefer to buy all the government's 49 per cent stake in
Creditanstalt which offers 70 per cent of voting stock, but would also be
content with a smaller stake in the short-term.
He declined to disclose his offer price. Based on Creditanstalt's share
price, the government stake is worth about Sch14bn (Dollars 1.2bn).
Mr Gut was in Vienna to meet Mr Ferdinand Lacina, Austria's finance
minister, who wants to privatise Creditanstalt quickly, and to encourage
public support for his offer. Mr Lacina has said that his decision will not
be based on price but on national interest and the interests of
Creditanstalt.
'The CS bid for a large stake currently owned by the Austrian government
should not be seen as a 'Swiss solution' but an international solution,' he
added.
Mr Gut's earlier announcement that CS Holding is aiming for 100 per cent
control of Creditanstalt has aroused controversy in Austria and led to the
formation of the rival bid. It is made up of Creditanstalt, Generali, the
Italian insurer, Commerzbank of Germany and several Austrian institutions.
Mr Lacina, a social democrat, favours the CS Holding bid, but his coalition
partners from the conservative People's Party fear they would lose political
influence over the traditionally conservative bank.
The CS Holding offer has also stirred up fears of foreign domination in the
Austrian economy. Similar sentiments were voiced before the referendum on EU
membership last Sunday.
The outcome of a bidding race for Creditanstalt is quite open, financial
sources say.
CS Holding sees Creditanstalt, with its strong position in Austria and
central Europe, as a perfect supplement to its subsidiaries which include
Credit Suisse, Schweizer Polksbank and CSSB. 'We do not step on each other's
toes, we are a perfect match,' Mr Gut said. Creditanstalt would gain from
CS's capital, technological assets and international strength.

voters for his re-election bid later this month.
The appointment of Mr Vitaly Masol, who advocates a state-controlled economy
and closer ties with Russia, was backed by 199 of the 335 deputies, with 24
opposing him. Many market reformers and nationalists abstained from
participating in 'the lurch back to the communist system', as one put it.
Mr Masol served as prime minister of Soviet Ukraine from 1987 to 1990. He
was forced out of office in protests that delivered the first blow to the
Communist party's absolute rule in Ukraine.
It is unclear what Mr Masol, as a powerful prime minister, would bring
Ukraine. In his bid for parliamentary approval he astonished delegates by
saying Ukraine 'is a state with market reforms' and that 'we cannot act by
traditional methods'.
Last month he urged the restoration of strict state controls and condemned
Ukraine's leadership for 'liberalising prices . . . exiting the rouble zone
. . . (and) cutting credits to industry'.
Mr Masol's return to the premiership reflects Mr Kravchuk's vulnerability in
the presidential vote on June 26, where he is trailing Mr Leonid Kuchma, an
industrialist who is popular in the Russian-oriented eastern Ukraine.
Mr Kravchuk can bank on votes from western Ukraine, where a strong body of
nationalists back him. Ukrainian nationalists fought against Mr Kravchuk in
the 1991 election but now see Mr Kuchma's pro-Russian position as a threat
to independence.
The president's position in the west was also helped by the signing of an
accord with the European Union on Tuesday.
However, Mr Kravchuk is desperately seeking support in the more densely
populated east, where the mood is increasingly pro-Russian and
pro-communist.
On Monday he adopted the eastern call to make Russian an official language
along with Ukrainian.

FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (34): Those barefoot
millionaires - Third World
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMANUEL MARADAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Third World of soccer is not the same as the economic Third World.
Football's backward nations include prosperous Japan, while impoverished
Latin America joins wealthy Europe among the game's aristocrats, writes
Emmanuel Maradas
Nowhere will the unfolding drama in the US be followed more closely than in
football's Third World, where whole countries will grind to a halt to follow
the national team's fortunes in Dallas, San Francisco or New York.
In reality, there are two football Third Worlds. The first is the economic
Third World, embracing the city slums of Latin America, Africa and the Far
East. The symbolic power of possibly the world's greatest ever footballer,
Brazil's Pele, resides not so much in his skills on the pitch, however
startling, as in his rise from favela to international stage.
In nations such as Cameroon, football excellence is a chance to forget the
misery of everyday existence and assert a presence on the world stage. Look
at us,' such countries say. We can barely afford to eat, but in one area at
least, we are better than the richest of you.'
Hence too, the palpable sense of brotherhood across national boundaries. All
Africa supported Cameroon during the 1990 World Cup in Italy; if the African
sides are knocked out, their loyalty will always go to Brazil, Colombia or
Argentina, rather than Germany or Italy.
For individual players, who for the most part learned their football
barefoot in the empty lots of Third World cities, soccer offers one of the
few escape routes - barring a life of crime - from a life of drudgery. The
golden window opens for only a very few, but those who squeeze through it to
a life as professional players in Europe or elsewhere return home as heroes,
educate their children and live in a style unattainable by any other means.
So much for the economic Third World. On the pitch, economics are tipped
partly on their heads. Here, Latin America stands alongside Europe among the
elite, while the Third World embraces the rising football continents of
Africa and Asia. In this topsy-turvy world, economic superstars Japan and
South Korea, where football is still finding its feet, in many ways have
more in common with Morocco, Cameroon or Nigeria than with the rich nations
of the West.
In world football politics, Asia and Africa almost invariably vote as a
bloc, struggling to make their voices heard against the European and Latin
American barons. Africa fought long and hard to win its third place in the
World Cup finals; Asia is still trying to catch up. Europe dominates, with
13 of the 24 teams in contention in the US, and retains its stranglehold
over decisions shaping the future of the world game.
Will the Africans and Asians make an impact in the US? This will be the the
first World Cup in which Africa has had three representatives, thanks mainly
to Cameroon's brilliant showing in Italy four years ago. Asia keeps its two
places, filled by newcomers Saudi Arabia and third-time qualifiers South
Korea. In Africa, standards have improved massively since Morocco became the
continent's first regular participant in the finals in 1970, and Zaire were
humiliated 9-0 by Yugoslavia four years later. The continent already sets
the standard at junior and youth levels: together, Nigeria and Ghana have
won three out of the five Under-17 world championships held under Fifa
auspices and come second twice; the same two countries respectively took
silver at Under-20 level in 1989 and 1993.
Many of the youngsters given international exposure at this level have gone
on to successful careers in the European professional game, gaining a depth
of experience which means they can face the best of Europe and Latin America
on equal terms.
Locally-based players continue to lag behind. In few African countries do
they receive a regular salary; many national stadiums would be a disgrace to
an English third division club, and physiotherapy and training facilities
are almost non-existent. All three African squads for the US are thus built
around a core of overseas-based professionals.
In Asia, the equation is reversed. Local championships in countries such as
Japan and Saudi Arabia are awash with money and the facilities are as good
as anywhere in the world. As a result, there is little incentive for Asian
professionals to look abroad. Add the fact that Asian players are generally
not as robust or as skilful as the Africans, and it is not surprising that
the world's most populous continent has so far made such a feeble impact on
global football.
All that could yet change as China, the sleeping giant of world soccer,
finally awakes under a plan launched last year to develop the sport from
school level upwards. In the meantime, however, Saudi Arabia and South Korea
seem cast in the role of also-rans in the US. The Saudis, in Group F, will
do well to snatch a single point against Belgium, Netherlands and Morocco.
Group C, meanwhile, sees the Koreans lined up against reigning champions
Germany, as well as strong sides from Spain and Bolivia.
The Africans, on the other hand, have high expectations of USA 1994. All
three have taken their preparations much more seriously than before, taking
part in a merry-go-round of friendlies across the globe. Nigeria's Super
Eagles, fresh from their victory in the African championships in Tunisia
this April, boast an attacking combination to put fear into any opponent.
Cameroon have appalling money troubles, and the administrators have probably
spent twice as much energy squabbling among themselves over the past year as
preparing for the tournament. But nobody will underestimate the Indomitable
Lions' potential to cause havoc, and they - like Morocco - have a good deal
of national pride at stake.
As to Latin America, might 1994 be Brazil's year? The green-and-golds have
never missed a World Cup finals, and after a decade in the wilderness they
might just be in shape to regain their place at the summit of the world
game. Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Bolivia will also be there, banging at
the door.
Barring miracles from the African and Asian sides, the Third World will be
rooting for a Brazilian victory. The day that Romario, Rai, Jorginho and
colleagues hold up the World Cup trophy, it will be the proof that every
child, whatever the continent, can rise out of the dust and make his mark on
the world.

Star Player: Vincenzo Scifo
Country: Belgium
Club: Monaco - (also: Anderlecht, Torino, Auxerre, Bordeaux)
Age: 28
Scifo the prodigy is now in his prime. He played in his first World Cup in
Mexico at 20. His club form has often been inconsistent but in the 1990
World Cup he was often masterful. In Bologna he gave Paul Gascoigne a
two-hour lesson in midfield play before Gazza's long punt forward created
Platt's miraculous late winner. He is an excellent passer of the ball but he
can also beat a player and shoot from long distance. His neat, unspectacular
style often serves to disguise his gifts but, in a World Cup rather short of
old fashioned playmakers, he will be well worth watching.
Key Game: Belgium v Netherlands (June 25 - Orlando)
This is high noon for the low countries. The Dutch are unhappy about having
to play twice at mid-day in central Florida in June. The Dutch know that the
heat will give Morocco their best hope of victory in the final group match.
Even so, and in spite of the heat and humidity, the match offers the two
teams the only true chance to test their pretensions against serious
opposition before the demanding matches of the later rounds. - A victory for
either team here will secure a place in the second round - assuming both
sides win comfortably against Saudi Arabia - and will also go some way to
appeasing fans at home regardless of what happens next: the shape of the
draw means both the winner and runner-up in this group will face difficult
second round matches.

The first to arrive and the first to leave' - that's the world press's
considered opinion of the Saudi Arabian team's prospects in the World Cup.
The Saudis arrived in the US a full month before the start of the
tournament, but their chances look slim.
If they have one strength, it will be the element of surprise. Outside Asia
they are an unknown quantity, but in continental competitions they have
proved themselves a force. In 1984 and 1988 they won the Asian Championship,
but this will be their first appearance in the World Cup finals. They topped
a six team round robin tournament in Doha to win their place.
The behind-the-scenes story of that tournament illustrated the critical
weaknesses in the Saudi set up. Brazilian trainer Jose Candido was sacked
midway through the tournament for questioning a telephone order during a
match against Iraq to substitute the goalkeeper. The call came from a Prince
watching the game on television in Riyadh.
The Saudis do not lack for facilities or money and every care has been taken
in their preparations. All they lack is a team sufficiently enthusiastic
about taking part in the World Cup itself. Huge bonuses were paid to the
players on qualification, and Leo Beenhakker, one of Europe's most
experienced coaches, was brought in to take them through to the finals. He
lasted less than three months, sacked because the players and officials
thought he was working the players too hard. - The team's preparations have
been shrouded in secrecy. Publicity from the world media, so often the
oxygen for teams from the third world, is something they feel they can do
without. Instead only brief glimpses have been seen during matches they have
played in the build up. Jorge Solari, the man who brought Diego Maradona
back into club football this season with Newell's Old Boys in Argentina, has
replaced Beenhakker, but results have not been impressive. - They will be
led by the 35-year-old Majed Abdullah Mohamed (Al Nasr), known as the Pele
of the desert'. His experience may give the side the stability they need.
All the Saudi squad play their club football inside the kingdom. Their lack
of experience could be the prelude to disappointment for the travelling
Saudi fans.

Belgium were the big winners at Las Vegas. The draw put them in the weakest
group and paired them with their glamorous local rivals. The spotlight will
be on the Dutch stars but Belgium have done better in recent World Cups.
Belgium reached the quarter-finals in '82 and the semi-finals in '86. In
Italy, Belgium outplayed England in the second round before losing to David
Platt's late goal; the Dutch, meanwhile, were soundly beaten by the Germans.
Vincenzo Scifo (Monaco) will anchor the team. Scifo could have played for
Italy. Belgium's attack may consist of Luis Oliveira (Cagliari), a
naturalised Brazilian, and Josip Weber (Cercle Bruges), a naturalised Croat.
They may bring a vital dash of flair to a team which traditionally combines
resolute defence with methodical attack.

This is the third time Morocco have qualified for the finals, each time in
the Americas. In 1970, in Mexico, they were the first African side since
Egypt in 1934 to take part; 16 years later, again in Mexico, they became the
first to reach the second round.
In 1994 there is more than the usual dose of national pride at stake.
Morocco is still angry about the way its bids to host the World Cup, in 1994
and 1998, were brushed aside in favour of the US and France. King Hassan II
has put massive funds at the disposal of the team, and national coach
Abdallah Blinda will have some explaining to do if his charges do not reach
the second round.
He has decided to call mainly on overseas-based players, principally those
playing in Europe. The key to the side is undoubtedly Rashid Daoudi (WAC
Casablanca), a midfielder known as Magic Daoudi'. He is joined in midfield
by rising star Mustafa Hajji (23), who plays for Nancy in the French second
division.
Experience is represented by Mustafa al-Haddaoui (Angers), the sole survivor
of the 1986 World Cup squad. But many of the overseas contingent, having
grown up abroad, do not speak Arabic and have no language in common with
their home-based colleagues. If things begin to go wrong, the language
division could prove crucial.
The strategy will be to draw with either Belgium or the Netherlands and
notch up a good win over Saudi Arabia. That would see them through to the
second round. Success thereafter will be celebrated all the way to the royal
palace in Rabat.

The Netherlands continues to breed talented players. Dennis Bergkamp and Wim
Jonk moved last year to Inter Milan in Italy. They followed Ruud Gullit
(Sampdoria/AC Milan), Marco van Basten (AC Milan) and Frank Rijkaard (Ajax)
who led AC Milan to two European Cups. Van Basten, injured, and Gullitt,
sulking, seem set to miss the World Cup. Rijkaard will play as will the
middle generation of Dutch Italians - Brian Roy (Foggia) and Aaron Winter
(Lazio) - and the next generation, Marc Overmars (Ajax).
But the key to the Dutch performance will be provided by Ronald Koeman, who
followed the greatest Dutch master, Johan Cruyff, to Barcelona. Koeman is a
sweeper. His play in the European Cup final against AC Milan demonstrated
yet again that while he may be a great player coming forward, he is a
liability in defence. He is powerful in the air and strong in the tackle but
he is slow and he compounds the problem by poor positional play. - Against
Sampdoria in the European Cup final two years ago Koeman was let off by
Gianluca Vialli's poor finishing before winning the game in extra-time with
a pile-driver free-kick. Against England, in the last qualifying match,
Koeman was reprieved by a lenient referee after allowing David Platt to
escape and then felling him. Again he then settled the game with a goal from
a free kick.
Without the ruthless finishing of van Basten and with Bergkamp off form,
Koeman will have to contribute heavily in attack to keep himself in credit
and the Dutch in the World Cup.

Italy have a habit of leaning heavily on one man to supply World Cup goals.
Toto Schillaci scored five of their eight goals in 1990. Altobelli scored
four of Italy's five in Mexico in 1986. In 1982, Paolo Rossi, silent as
Italy trudged through the group matches, hit six goals in the last three
games to carry Italy to victory. Signori is quick, brave, bright and
skilful, but his greatest asset is his ferocious shot. He has no backlift,
so goalkeepers and defenders have little time to react; yet he shoots with
power and accuracy. He blasts penalties while standing still. He can score
against any defence. If he does so Italy will go far.
Key Game: Italy v Ireland (June 20 - San Francisco)
This is the hottest ticket in the World Cup. This match has captured the
imagination of New York, and not just its strident Irish and Italian
communities. The atmosphere should be raucous even if many spectators do not
really understand the game which will provide an intriguing contrast of
styles. It will also be fiercely contested. Neither team dares lose and both
will want the three points and the likely place in the last 16 a win brings.
Last time the two countries met Ireland had completed their fairy-tale run
to the quarter-finals in 1990 and were happy to die valiantly, exhausted at
the host's feet. Now, World Cup veterans and fresh from friendly wins
against the Netherlands and Germany, they, and their opponents, will have a
higher opinion of what the green shirts can achieve.

In 1990, Ireland rolled up for their first World Cup with the oldest squad
in the competition, failed to win a game and still found themselves in a
quarter-final against Italy in Rome. The strengths and weaknesses that
characterised that campaign will still be the hallmarks of the Irish team
this time.
They work hard, stick to manager Jack Charlton's simple plan and have much
better players than many critics realise - except in attack. They will again
struggle to score goals. In Italy they drew all three group games before
beating Romania on penalties after a goal-less draw and then restricting the
hosts to a 1-0 win.
This time they are in the toughest group. The change to three points for a
win in group games will penalise Ireland, who have lost the best of their
lacklustre crew of goalscorers, Niall Quinn (Manchester City), to injury.
Charlton's squad includes just four attackers. But it has had a much needed
infusion of youth: Roy Keane (Manchester United), a midfield bull, Garry
Kelly (Leeds United) a pacey defender and Jason McAteer (Bolton Wanderers),
a promising Liverpudlian midfielder who has opted for Ireland. They are
potentially top class and perfectly suit Charlton's system. - If some of
Charlton's ageing stars, notably Paul McGrath, Andy Townsend and Ray
Houghton (all Aston Villa), can shake off the lethargy that has settled over
their club play, Ireland will again be difficult to beat.
Recent friendlies, capped by a 2-0 win in Germany, have gone well. Tony
Cascarino, an ungainly centre forward not good enough to command a starting
place in Chelsea's routed FA Cup Final team, has brought aerial power to
Ireland's direct attacks.

Egil Olsen, the Norwegian manager, complained when he saw the draw. What
bothered him was not the presence of Italy but of Ireland. The two teams, he
says, play the same game. The two managers play the same games too.
Norway have even less of a football tradition than the Irish. But, as both
Jack Charlton and Olsen have said, this can be an advantage: they are not
bound by any history of stylish football. Wins are enough. Both have
embraced the much maligned, largely misunderstood long-ball game. Their
teams defend in numbers and harry opponents relentlessly. Their first
attacking weapon is the long, usually high ball out of defence which they
hope will yield a poor clearance or a corner or free-kick which they can
exploit.
This approach is regarded as crass in the more sophisticated soccer nations
and Olsen and Charlton are happy to play the naive country cousins. Last
summer Olsen, who claims to have earned more from poker than from football,
lectured Graham Taylor, the England manager, about the long-ball game.
Taylor picked an extra centre back to counter the threat and was astonished
to find the Norwegians shuttling the ball quickly along the ground. What
Olsen, like Charlton, wants to conceal is that he has a team full of good
players, led by Rune Bratseth (Werder Bremen), a world class centre half.
Even so Norway will not be pretty. Against England in their recent friendly,
Norway spent most of the game in densely-packed, often robust defence.
England had the ball for twice as long, but Norway managed more shots. Do
not believe Olsen. His team are capable of going a long way.

Mexico are genuine dark horses. Eight years ago when they hosted the World
Cup, the expectations of the home crowd were too much for them. This time
they will have none of those pressures, but they - will have the vast
numbers of Mexican Americans to bolster their support.
Mexico were banned from the 1990 World Cup for playing over-aged players in
a youth tournament. The only international experience for many of the squad
has come in the regional qualification tournament for this World Cup, which
they won with habitual ease, the 1993 central American Gold Cup, which they
also won comfortably, and the 1993 continental championship. It was their
first appearance and they surprised south America by reaching the final
which they lost 2-1 to Argentina.
Mexico have a mixture of youth and experience. Hugo Sanchez (Rayo Vallecano)
is the elder statesman. His striking partner will be Luis Flores (Atlas), a
veteran of the '86 World Cup, Luis Alves Zague' (America), a naturalised
Brazilian who scored seven goals in one Gold Cup match, or Luis Garcia
(Atletico Madrid).
Mexico's goalkeeper, Jorge Campos (UNAM), is from the Rene Higuita school
and has put his side in trouble on occasion with his excursions from the
penalty area. During the Gold Cup he even played two games as a forward.
This is a tough group. If they do get through, they may emerge as the
surprise package of the tournament.

Italy's manager, Arrigo Sacchi, is spoilt for choice. And if he carries on
as he did in the qualifying tournament the very richness of his squad may
prove Italy's undoing.
In his first two-and-a-half years in charge Sacchi picked more than 70
players. Entering the World Cup it is still not clear what he thinks his
best team is. Will he play Roberto Baggio in midfield or in attack? Even
though Robberto Mancini (Sampdoria) has dropped out, Sacchi still has
attacking decisions to make. Will he pick goalscorer Giuseppe Signori
(Lazio) - small, quick, skilful, ferocious shot - or Daniele Massaro (Milan)
 -small, quick, skilful, ferocious shot - or both? Or will he opt for the
height of goal-shy Pierluigi Casiraghi (Lazio) or the creative talents of
Gianfranco Zola (Parma)? The permutations are endless and Sacchi seems to
have been trying to run through them all. - Sacchi revolutionised Italian
football when he managed AC Milan. His team combined traditional Italian
skills with an up-tempo, pressing approach. Under his coaching the team won
the Italian league and two European Cups. Now he wants the national team to
play his system. There is little doubt that this works. But, as he says, if
he can persuade 22 players to fit into one system it will be an Italian
record'.
Sacchi is astute enough to know that if Italy are to fulfil their potential
and challenge for the World Cup he will need to find a settled team with
settled nerves.

Star Player: Augustine Jay-Jay Okocha
Country: Nigeria
Club: Eintracht Frankfurt
Age: 20
Position: Midfield or attack
Okocha is the most promising of Nigeria's rich crop of young stars, who won
the World Under-17 Cup in 1985, were runners up in 1987 and finished second
in the World U-20 cup in 1989. Big, strong Rashidi Yekini, a 30-year old
centre forward, will be the focus of attention for opposing defences, but he
cannot carry Nigeria far on his own. The form of the young Eagles, has
helped Nigeria to win the African Nations Cup and to reach their first World
Cup finals. Okocha can score from midfield and is a threat from free kicks.
He holds the key to Nigeria's progress in the US and beyond. -
Key Game: Argentina v Nigeria (June 25 - Boston)
Argentina have a chance to exorcise the ghost of their opening defeat to
Cameroon in Italy four years ago when they meet the most-fancied of the
African nations in this World Cup. Nigeria are appearing in their first
World Cup but their ambition is to go further than Cameroon did in 1990.
They do not lack experience, their team is packed with men who play in
European football. They are big, strong, fast, skilful and every bit as
rough as Cameroon. Argentina have a better attack than they did in 1990 but
their greatest strength is still their uncompromising defence. This will be
a severe test of both teams' pretensions and of Fifa's directive to referees
to punish overly physical play and tackles from behind.
Penalty king: Sergio Goicochea of Argentina
Stupendous power: Rashidi Yekini of Nigeria

Greece, helped by the withdrawal of Yugoslavia, one of the seeds in their
group, galloped through their qualifying matches. Apart from Germany, the
holders, they were the first European country to qualify for the US.
It will be Greece's first finals appearance. Even so, for many of their
players, it was too late: these are the ancient Greeks. In recent friendlies
they have used up to seven over-30s and three over-35s. Captain Tasos
Mitropoulos is 37, goalkeeper Antonis Minou is 36.
The team's recent form has been poor. It lost 3-0 at home to Colombia, was
booed in a 0-0 draw at home against Bolivia, and lost 5-0 at Wembley against
England. In that game the Greeks passed prettily and skilfully but were
carved open by the English. It seems that, on their debut, the Greeks will
be happy to adorn the World Cup. Even the one win that could carry Greece
into the second round could be beyond them.

France against Bulgaria, November 17, 1993. One minute left, 1-1, and France
have as good as qualified for the World Cup. Bulgaria break away with Penev.
He passes to Kostadinov who shoots. - He scores and Bulgaria and not France
have qualified. The French look dazed. Needing just one point from their
last two games, they have lost both in the last minute. - Bulgaria has a
poor World Cup record. In 16 attempts during the finals they have yet to win
a game, but Kostadinov's goal, unexpected and brilliant as it was, will give
them the impetus to break that duck. They will fancy their chances of
reaching the second round, mainly because of their formidable striking
options.
Bulgaria will resemble an Iberian select XI. With the exception of the
goalkeeper who plays in France, all of the team's foreign-based players play
their club football in Spain or Portugal. Their three first choice forwards
are Ivailo Yordanov of Sporting Lisbon, Emil Kostadinov of Porto and
Barcelona's Hristo Stoichkov. Stoichkov is capable of winning a match almost
on his own and will be one of the most marked men in America.
The midfield is held together by Krasimir Balakov (Sporting Lisbon) and
Zlatko Yankov, but the main area of worry for coach Dimitar Penev is the
defence. Unlike previous Bulgarian teams, the present side plays open
attractive football which leaves them vulnerable at the back.
Gone are the days when the Bulgarians would grind out results in true
communist fashion. In Mexico eight years ago they qualified for the second
round with three turgid displays. They have yet to convince the public that
they have turned over a new leaf. Ticket sales in Dallas, where Bulgaria
play their first two games, are the lowest of all venues.

Nigeria's Super Eagles are first-time qualifiers for the finals, but they go
to the US ranked seventh in the world and fresh from victory in the African
Cup of Nations in April.
At last, it seems, technical adviser Clemens Westerhof has welded a
match-winning combination out of the dispersed talents that make up Nigerian
football.
Success has been a long time coming for Africa's most populous nation, which
has so often failed to live up to its potential.
The Super Eagles squad is made up mainly of overseas-based professionals.
The outstanding talent is probably Rashidi Yekini. A striker of stupendous
power, who plays for Vitoria Setubal in Portugal, Yekini is the African
Footballer of the Year and was top scorer in both the 1992 and 1994 Nations
Cups. At 31, he is nearing the end of his career but he could be one of the
tournament's most exciting talents. - The Eagles' midfield, featuring Sunday
Oliseh, Austin Okocha and Mutiu Adepoju, is the rival of any in the world.
Their most suspect department is the defence. Benedict Iroha, a goal scoring
defender, is a definite for the side. But the rest of the back line are
untested against a world class attack.
Nigeria's most difficult fixture will be against Argentina, who were
ambushed by Cameroon in the opening game of the 1990 World Cup. Bulgaria and
Greece are unlikely to offer much obstacle on the way to the second round.
Nigeria's ambitions are much higher. - Football is almost a religion in
Nigeria, and the authorities know that success in the US could help keep the
lid on a disastrous economic situation. If harmony continues to reign in the
Nigerian camp, the Super Eagles could coalesce into a squad to astonish the
world.

Over the last four years the national team of Argentina has often looked
like a perverse joke at the expense of football. Don't say it too loud,
though, because Argentinians take their football seriously, perhaps too
seriously.
In Italy in 1990, Argentina squeaked into the second round as one of the
best third-place teams. They beat a more talented Brazilian side as well as
Yugoslavia and Italy (both these on penalties) to reach the final.
In the Copa America last year Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico and Brazil all
played dazzling attacking football but Argentina won the tournament,
eliminating Brazil on penalties and defending for most of the final against
Mexico before winning 2-1. - Argentina qualified for the US the hard way.
They lost their last group match in Buenos Aires 5-0 to Colombia, to
surrender an automatic place in the final. They then ground out a 2-1
aggregate win in their two-leg play-off against Australia. - So here they
are again: the black hats of football, threatening to spoil the party. Diego
Maradona and Claudio Caniggia are back from their cocaine bans. Maradona,
even fatter and unfitter than four years ago, his knees and his attitude
worse than ever, is more of a talisman than a genuine force. But he just has
to shake a magical boot over the ball and world class defences quake in
superstitious terror. - Argentina will again put their faith in defence in
depth backed by the miraculous goalkeeping of Sergio Goyocochea. But there
is a difference. Four years ago the unreliable Caniggia was their sole
attacking threat. Now he is the third choice behind Abel Balbo (Roma) and
Gabriel Batistuta (Fiorentina). Batistuta scored two brilliant goals that
beat Mexico last summer. - The three points for a win in the group stage was
introduced to discourage the defensive, draw-oriented strategy which carried
Argentina to the final in 1990. But they are now equipped to win games. The
joke is likely to be on Greece and Bulgaria.

Star Player: Jurgen Klinsmann
Country: Germany
Club: Monaco (also: Stuttgart Kickers, Stuttgart, Inter Milan, Real Madrid)
Age: 29
Klinsmann was a gymnast in his youth and is his team's best bet for goals.
When he stays on his feet he is fast and flamboyant, capable of scoring
great goals and missing easy ones. But some of his spectacular tumbles in
the opponents' box have been followed by penalty goals as decisive as goals
scored on the run. These penalties beat Argentina in the final and
Czechoslovakia in the quarter-final in 1990. He now leads an ageing corps of
strikers; during the recent defeat against Ireland in Hanover the fans were
reduced to calling for the 34-year-old Rudi Voller, star of 1986, to come
on.
Key Game: Bolivia v South Korea (June 23 - Boston)
This match offers both countries their chance of a first-ever place in the
second round. This the third successive appearance for the South Koreans in
the World Cup yet they remain largely ignored. North Korea beat Italy 1-0 in
1966 to reach the quarterfinals. In 1986 South Korea held Bulgaria 1-1 and
then terrified Italy, the eventual winners, before losing 3-2. Bolivia have
played three matches in the World Cup finals, scored none and conceded 16.
Both teams have talent and could scare the bigger, stronger but rather
lacklustre German and Spanish teams but this is their best chance of gaining
their first ever win and with it the three points now on offer for a
first-round victory. That should be enough to a place in the second round as
one of the four best third-place teams. -
Bolivia's hope: Marco Antonio Etchverry

As the South Korean team trudged disconsolately off the field after their
final World Cup qualifying match in Doha, it seemed that their 3-0 win over
North Korea would not be enough to take them to the US. News had filtered
through that Japan were beating Iraq 2-1. Then the scoreboard flashed a
scoreline that could change the face of South Korean football. Iraq had
scored an injury time equaliser. South Korea and not Japan had qualified.
There was pandemonium on the pitch among the players, but for the officials
looking on the result meant much more. South Korea is locked in a battle
with Japan to host the 2002 World Cup. The Japanese were hoping that
qualification would strengthen their case, but Korea can now boast five
World Cup finals appearances (including one by North Korea in 1966) to
Japan's none.
There is a strong professional league in South Korea, run by the big
industrial corporations who own the clubs, and because of this most of the
Korean squad play their football in Korea, although 28 year old Kim Joo-Sung
has experience with Germany's VfL Bochum. Kim, twice Asian Footballer of the
Year, is the pivot around which the side functions.
South Korea are strong in defence and, in 1993, kept 15 clean sheets in
internationals, but they do not possess a striker with a lot of experience
or goals to his credit.

Bolivia may one day win the World Cup, but first they will have to persuade
Fifa to host the tournament in La Paz. High up in the thin air of the Andes,
the Bolivians are almost invincible. They won all five World Cup qualifiers
there including a 2-0 victory over Brazil, the first time a Brazilian side
had been beaten in the qualifying rounds of the World Cup. But at sea level
the Bolivians are at best average and at their worst easy prey for the best
sides. In Brazil they were thrashed 6-0 by the sea in Recife.
Even with the thin air advantage this was the first time Bolivia have come
through the qualification rounds. In the 1930 and 1950 World Cups they
qualified automatically, but did not do well: three defeats, no goals scored
and 16 conceded. They face Germany in the opening match of the tournament. A
heavy defeat there could destroy their confidence, built up so well by
Spanish coach Xavier Azkargorta.
Six of the Bolivian squad, including Bolivia's best player, Marco Etcheverry
(Colo Colo), are graduates of one of sport's strangest institutions: the
Tahuichi Academy. It was formed 15 years ago to take the poor children off
the streets of Santa Cruz and has become world famous for the skilful
footballers it has produced. Etcheverry is struggling with an injury.
Without him Bolivia's warm-up results were mixed.
The Bolivians will find it tough to go far in the World Cup, but at least
they will be able to drink America's favourite drink. The head of the
Bolivian federation banned the players from drinking Coca Cola fearing dope
tests would be positive. He later relented.

The German squad has the look of a World Cup winner: the 1990 World Cup
winner. Only two of the regulars from Italy - Pierre Littbarski and Klaus
Augenthaler, both effectively retired - are missing. Manager Berti Vogts
could field an entire team of Italy veterans. This may be a sensible policy
of persevering with a settled winning side or it could be soccer sclerosis.
The 1990 final team contained only four of the 13 men who lost the 1986
final against Argentina. All four are again in the German squad for the US.
Three - Lothar Matth us (Bayern Munich), Andreas Brehme (Kaiserslautern) and
Rudi Voller (Marseille) are 33 or older. The fourth is Thomas Berthold (29)
of VfB Stuttgart.
Indeed one might reasonably have expected more change. Since 1990 Vogts has
had his pick of the experienced East German internationals. Only two -
Matthias Sammer (Borussia Dortmund) and Ulf Kirsten (Bayer Leverkusen) - are
in his squad.
The attack will depend heavily on Jurgen Klinsmann (Monaco) who scored both
goals in a recent win over Italy. His likely partner is Karlheinz Riedle
(Borussia Dortmund) whose form has dipped in the last couple of years. The
youngest of the five strikers Vogts named in his original squad is Kirsten
and he is 28 and has only a handful of caps. Stefan Kuntz (Kaiserslautern)
is 31 and did not win his first cap until this season. He offers age without
experience.
Perhaps, after three consecutive final appearances expectations are so high
that Vogts dare not experiment with youth. On the other hand his selection
could be a pragmatic reaction to a lack of young German talent.
Germany never rose above the general awfulness of 1992's European
championships but still reached the final. Since then they have played only
friendlies so it is difficult to establish a form line. But they continue to
achieve results, apart from a blip against Ireland. They were ripped apart
by Brazil in Los Angeles last June but salvaged a 3-3 draw. Even though they
lack pazzazz, the Germans know how to get results. Most of all they believe
in themselves. Franz Beckenbauer, coach of the 1990 team, said recently: I
don't really see much real competition for our team.' They could be back in
LA in July.

Spain are football's great under-achievers. Their club sides continue to
match the Germans and Italians for success in the European cups but the
national team does not. Their best World Cup finish was fourth in 1950. They
have qualified for the last three World Cups, but the pattern is always the
same. They come through the first round fairly comfortably but then go
quietly.
The problem is no doubt partly psychological and this team does not seem to
possess the talent to break that cycle. World class players such as Emilio
Butrage 1/16 o, Michel and Martin Vazquez have gone and been replaced by
lesser players. Only Julen Guerrero (Athletic Bilbao), just 20, offers
flair. The rest of the team is made up of disciplined, industrious, hardened
professionals. The frequently outrageous coach Javier Clemente is likely to
provide more entertainment than his team. The make-up of the group should
allow Spain to reach the next round as usual, but they are unlikely to
progress further.

Star Player: Rai
Country: Brazil
Club: Paris St Germain (Sao Paolo)
Age: 28
Brazil are spoilt for strikers but will depend heavily on Rai for midfield
creativity. Rai is the younger brother of Socrates, the leggy bearded
midfielder who played for Brazil in 1982 and 1986. Rai scored both goals for
Sao Paolo when they won the world club championship in 1992. This season he
moved to Europe and has allegedly played lethargically for his new club,
Paris St Germain. Nevertheless, PSG romped to their first French title, so
Rai cannot have been a passenger the whole time. Sao Paolo provided a
reminder of the greatest Brazilian football. Rai - must do for Brazil what
he did for his club.
Key Game: Brazil v Russia (June 20 - San Francisco)
The two most talented teams in the World Cup have warmed up with bitter
arguments over money. The Brazilians are used to this, but the Russian
players were brought up in the old Soviet sports system and are just
learning that the correct way to deal with incompetent, bullying football
administrators is to act like spoilt children. Both teams have long records
of World Cup frustrations. Russia's traditional World Cup is a mix of great
football - a 6-0 win over Hungary in 1986, 4-0 over Cameroon in 1990 - and
daft eliminations. They rarely fail to entertain and have played well in
warm up matches. They are the perfect opponents to bring out the best in
Brazil. And as go Brazil so goes the World Cup. A good early win could
encourage the masters to dazzle.

Sweden are the overachievers of World Cup football. This is their ninth
appearance in the finals. They were fourth in 1938, third in 1950, runners
up as hosts in 1958. But after 1974 (quarter-finals) their record tails off.
They missed 1982 and 1986 and suffered a nasty first-round prang in Italy -
losing to Brazil, Scotland and, worst of all, Costa Rica.
Sweden are in a tough group but the team is equipped to make solid progress.
They have an experienced goalkeeper, Thomas Ravelli (Gothenburg), a
hard-working midfield anchored by Jonas Thern (Naples) and Stefan Schwarz
(Arsenal) and a strong centre-forward, Martin Dahlin (Borussia
Moenchengladbach).
All the players offer the typical mix of characteristics found in
professionals across western continental Europe: easy ball skills, physical
fitness, stamina and a willingness to submerge themselves in a team plan.
However, perhaps for those reasons, the team is short of flair and relies
overheavily on the subtle talents of chubby Thomas Brolin (Parma) who
emerged from the wreckage of the 1990 competition as a 20-year-old star. The
more unpredictable Anders Limpar (Everton) may add some spice to their play,
but the Swedes will bring an earnestness to their attempts to emulate past
performances.

Everyone remembers the Indomitable Lions in 1990. Cameroon have trodden a
rocky road since then, and on paper they are not the force they were four
years ago. But nobody will underestimate again their capacity to do damage
when everything is at stake.
Cameroon scraped through to the finals, and then looked distinctly
lacklustre under their new coach, Frenchman Henri Michel. Political
wrangling between sports minister Bernard Massoua II and President Biya's
entourage paralysed the national football federation, which at one stage had
two rival chairmen - each with his own ideas. - By May plans to field an
almost entirely new squad gave way to a strategy built around veterans of
1990 - including the 42-year-old Roger Milla. The 1994 squad have been
playing together for nearly two decades. Captain Stephen Tataw leads a
defence that would put fear into the strongest attack. In front, Fran - ois
Omam Biyik scored the Lions' opening goal against Argentina four years ago,
and is relatively unknown only because he has lived so long under Milla's
shadow.
These old Lions could pull one more surprise before retiring for the last
time to their dens.

As the black market takes a grip on the economy and the Mafia flourishes,
Russia's chaotic World Cup preparations should not perhaps be too
surprising. As a result a nation which should have won the World Cup by now
will fail yet again in America.
Who could refuse such an opportunity to play in the World Cup? Well, rather
a lot of Russian players said: Niet, thank you very much'. Money is, of
course, at the centre of the controversy. Anatoly Byshovets, while coach of
the 1992 European Championship team, took the side of the players in a
dispute with the federation over bonuses. Byshovets was replaced by Pavel
Sadyrin. Sadyrin coached two unfashionable teams, CSKA Moscow and Zenit
Leningrad, to the old Soviet championship, but he is seen by the players as
a stooge of the federation. They want Byshovets back.
After qualifying for the finals, a group of the players signed an open
letter to the federation. Among the clauses about better training
facilities, a change of tactics and so on was one key demand: the return of
Byshovets. The federation, backed by President Boris Yeltsin, remained
unmoved. - The federation scored some successes, but three of the
foreign-based players stood firm. That is what makes this dispute unique. In
1974, the German players played a game of brinkmanship with their
federation, and won. The Dutch are past masters at it. Sadyrin excluded from
his squad Igor Shalimov, Internazionale's play maker, Andre Kanchelskis, of
Manchester United, and Karlsruhe's forward Sergei Kiriakov, Ivan Kolivanov
(Foggia) and Igor Dobrovolsky (Dynamo). - Russia has a huge reservoir of
talent. They will still put up a reputable performance, but to win the World
Cup you need all of your best players. Russia really should be contenders to
win the World Cup, but not this time.

Many football fans, even those under 24, can recite more names from the
winning side in the 1970 final than from both teams combined from the 1990
final. The 1966 final, exciting and emotional as it was, is embedded in the
memories of television viewers in shades of grey. The 1970 final glows in
sunlit greens, yellows and blues, as if the Brazilians had invented colour.
That 4-1 win over Italy is the yardstick by which all subsequent World Cup
matches have been judged. It is a heavy load for a team to bear and for 24
years Brazilian teams have failed to carry it.
This year's squad offers grounds for optimism. Although it is well stocked
with defenders - Mozer (Benfica), Aldair (Roma), Jorginho (Bayern Munich),
Ricardo Gomes (Paris Saint German) and so on - it still seems shakey in
defence, perhaps because the backs lack confidence in Claudio Taffarel
(Parma), the goalkeeper.
Over the last year this frailty has encouraged Brazil to put their faith in
attack where they are burdened with traditional riches. The best known
strikers are Bebeto (La Coruna), Muller (Sao Paolo) and, above all, Romario
(Barcelona). There may be more complete players at the World Cup, but none
who can do more damage in more ways in one second than Romario.
The 1970 Brazilians could draw confidence from Pele and their World Cup wins
in 1958 and 1962. The current Brazilians carry the weight of years of
relative failure, the expectations of a nation and the hopes of fans around
the world. The team is bickering. Brazilian fans and media are whining about
coach Carlos Alberto Parreira's selections. The Brazilian federation is
procrastinating over payments to players. But the talent is there ..

Star Player: Faustino AsprillaCountry: Colombia
Club: Parma (also: Tulua, Deportivo Cucuta, Nacional Medellin)
Age: 28
Faustino Asprilla is the dangerous soccer genius from central casting. He is
the focus of attention both off and on the field. He is notorious for
crashing fast cars around Parma. In the Cup Winners Cup final he allowed
himself to be distracted by Arsenal's defenders and spent much of the match
involved in arguments with the referee. - He is a devil,' said Franco
Baresi, the Italian defender. Yet Asprilla can also be divine. If he hits
his best form he could lift this talented Colombian team towards the World
Cup on his powerful shoulders.
Key Game: US v Switzerland (June 18 - Detroit)
This group will be decided as much by strength of nerve as depth of talent.
Colombia and Romania both have a habit of failing to fulfil their potential.
Switzerland and US are largely unknown quantities. Both have good players
but both squads contain many players who have largely been sheltered from
top level competition. This match will not only set the tone for this group
but for how the whole World Cup is received by Americans. The host nation
loves a winner and ignores a loser. A US victory could suddenly convince
Americans that soccer is a worthwhile sport and not just a nice hobby for
schoolgirls. -
High-flyer: Ciriaco Sforza, star of Switzerland's midfield

Colombia's loss to Cameroon in Naples in the second round in 1990 was one of
the most frustrating performances of that World Cup. It was as if the side
was more intent on asserting its bizarre identity than winning. Rene
Higuita, the goalkeeper, gave away a goal by trying to dribble around Roger
Milla outside his penalty area. In attack Carlos Valderrama orchestrated a
mesmerising web of interpassing that never seemed to take the ball near the
Cameroonian goal. - This time Higuita, just out of jail, is absent. But
Valderrama is back to act as ringmaster to a team that seems to have found a
greater cutting edge. Alongside Valderrama is Fredy Rincon, who scored the
late equaliser against Germany in 1990 that earned Colombia a second-round
place. In attack Colombia has Faustino Asprilla (Parma), the most
exhilarating but also the most frustrating star of the star-studded Italian
league. Adolfo Valencia (Bayern Munich), an old-fashioned bull of a centre
forward, is one of several possible striking partners for Asprilla.
Rincon has said of Colombia: we like to put on a show. Winning is a bonus.'
But his team showed they could do both when they walloped Argentina - 5-0 in
Buenos Aires last September to secure a place in the US.
With any luck they will continue to try to do both in the US. A few
confidence-building wins could unleash their exciting potential and the draw
has been helpful. Colombia should win this group. That would give them a
second-round match against a third-place team. They are capable of beating
anyone, but in Italy they beat themselves.

The Swiss have not appeared in the finals since 1966 and they have not won a
game at this stage since 1954 when, as hosts, they beat Italy twice. Two
good results against Italy in the qualifying rounds - a 2-2 draw away and a
1-0 home win - have brought them to the US.
The Swiss have two of Europe's brightest young stars, striker Stephane
Chapuisat (Borussia Dortmund) and midfielder Ciriaco Sforza
(Kaiserslautern). They are among a growing group of young Swiss players
playing in the Bundesliga, which also includes Adrian Knup (VfB Stuttgart)
who averages two goals every three internationals. The team produced
sparkling performances in the qualifying rounds, notably away to Italy where
they led 2-0 with five minutes to go, but with qualification in their grasp
their results worsened and in the end they pipped Portugal by just a point.
The coach, Ray Hodgson, an Englishman, has a settled team but the bulk of
his squad still plays in the Swiss league, where the level of competition is
at best mediocre. The question is whether they will play up to the level of
their best players or down to the level to which they are accustomed.

Only one eastern European club has won the European Cup, Romania's Steaua
Bucharest in 1986, and of that region's three representatives in the World
Cup, Russia, Bulgaria and Romania, the latter is the most likely to make an
impact in America. Romanian footballers are fiery and temperamental but
above all they have a flair and skill that will - make them hard to beat.
Gheorghe Hagi, the Maradona of the Carpathians', is the most skilful
footballer to have come out of the country. He is the creative influence of
the side but has a questionable temperament and can be a destructive
influence on the side.
The 1990 World Cup was a showcase for Romanian footballers in their attempts
to find a way out of the country. Ile Dumitrescu will want to use USA 94 the
same way. He is Steaua's top forward, but the club can no longer hang on to
players of his class.
As the club scene has declined, more attention has been focused on the
national team. Anghel Iordanescu's side has plenty of promise and a strong
backbone of experienced players. In attack, Dumitrescu will be partnered by
Milan's forgotten forward Florin Radiucioiu. In midfield Hagi will be
partnered by his Brescia team mate Ioan Sabau.
The Romanians should have no trouble qualifying from this group and, given
the right draw in the second round, could go further. It all depends on
their attitude. If Hagi is on song it will take a good team to beat them.

The US is the land that soccer forgot. Its players do not have a
professional league. Its fans are supporting other countries and its media
are not sure what is going on but they know they do not like it. With no
league to showcase their talents even the small trickle of US players to
European and Mexican professional clubs in recent years is remarkable.
The bulk of the squad has been doing national service. They have been living
in a soccer-boot camp, at Mission Viejo, California, paid by the US Soccer
Federation to play friendlies. The team's poor record in recent months
against mediocre international opposition has drawn the fire of the US
press, unused to competing in an international team game in which more than
two other countries play.
The reaction of the fans has also been cautious. For most football is an
expression of ethnicity, like playing the bagpipes or holding Oktoberfests.
It is what Italian-Americans or Mexican-Americans do when they are being
Italian or Mexican. This is why tickets for Ireland v Italy in New York were
trading hands for a minimum of Dollars 475 on the black market while tickets
for the first round games involving the host nation remained unsold. The US
team needs a good start to convince its fans that, even though it places a
premium on strong left-wingers, soccer is not an un-American activity.
The coach, Bora Milutinovic, has an enviable World Cup record. In 1986, he
took Mexico to the quarter-finals where it lost on penalties to Germany. In
1990, he coached Costa Rica to wins over Sweden and Scotland and into the
second round. His US-based players resent the well-paid European-based stars
who will waltz into the team at the last moment. But, with the exception of
Thomas Dooley, who won a German Championship with Kaiserslautern, they lack
experience. Certainly the addition of players such as John Harkes (Derby
County), Roy Wegerle (Coventry City), Tab Ramos (Betis, Seville) and Eric
Wynalda (Saarbrucken) immensely improved the team in last summer's US Cup.
Frank Klopas (AEK Athens) has emerged as a goal-scoring threat in recent
friendlies.
The team will be competitive, disciplined and fit. Cobi Jones, one of the
stars of the Barcelona Olympic football tournament, and Cladio Reyna, are
two talented young players who will want to grab and prolong their moment in
the spotlight.
Most of the US soccer team grew up in a football vacuum. The game is not
ingrained in them as it is in boys who grew up watching television in other
countries. what young Americans do learn is how to compete. Do not write
them off.

Disregard what the cynics of international football say. When the new world
champions of the game are crowned in Los Angeles on July 17, the World Cup
will have been a big success.
While it is true that many Americans know little about professional football
 -or soccer, as they call it - they know plenty about putting on a good
show. The 1994 World Cup will be promoted with typical American flair. The
organisation of the tournament will be smooth, the media facilities
second-to-none. The stadiums will be mostly large and modern, and in some
cases spectacular. Most important of all, the big games will be played
before enthusiastic and peaceful crowds.
Yet, if the developed football world of south America and Europe judges the
tournament a triumph, will it matter if the heart of the undeveloped
football world - the host nation itself - finds the event a less than
overwhelming experience?
Will it matter if, after a month of Brazilians and Bolivians, Irish and
Italians, Colombians and Cameroonians, ordinary Americans shrug their
shoulders and turn their attention to the more familiar rhythms of major
league baseball, of the Dodgers and Giants, Yankees and Red Sox?
The conventional wisdom is that the World Cup will matter a great deal, at
least to the development of the professional game in the US. The Federation
of International Football Associations (Fifa), the sport's governing body,
selected the US as host for 1994 because it believed the World Cup would
spur the establishment of a new professional league in the US, the last
great unconquered territory for the world game'. - Fifa remembers only too
well how the only previous attempt to colonise the US ended, when superstars
like Pele and Beckenbauer failed to prevent the high-flying North American
Soccer League (NASL) from crashing to the ground in 1985, burdened by
financial losses and public indifference. This time, it is putting its faith
in the restorative powers of the World Cup.
Yet, if the tournament is to capture the imagination of Americans, it will
have to be done through television. This will be a difficult task, because
football has a poor reputation as a spectator sport among armchair fans in
the US, who are used to being fed a diet of action-packed, high-scoring
games presented on television in short bursts, regularly punctuated by
commercials. Watching football, however, requires concentration and
patience, and if viewers are to be turned on by the games, they will have to
feature plenty of electrifying plays and spectacular goals. - Unfortunately,
international football has become less exciting in recent years, with
defence-minded teams scoring fewer goals. At the last World Cup, the US
media made great play of the negative team tactics and low scores. The image
presented to the US public then - of a boring, often incom-prehensible game
 -lingers today, and it will require a fundamental change in the approach of
the players and coaches for that image to be reversed.
While it is crucial that the World Cup presents exciting football, Fifa and
the US organisers know that it is almost as important that the home team
performs well, or at least well enough to sustain the domestic public's
interest throughout much of the month-long tournament. As Alan Rothenberg,
head of the US World Cup organising committee, said recently: I don't like
to put pressure on our team, but a lot rides on how the US does.'
Although the host country has progressed through to the second round in
previous World Cups, this summer the US will be one of the weakest of the 24
teams playing, and is in a tough group. For the hosts, surviving the first
round of group games will be a considerable achievement.
Ultimately, the World Cup is not only expected to present a great spectacle,
but also generate enough lasting interest in the game to ensure that
football in the US grows beyond its mainly amateur roots into an important
professional sport. The football authorities, ready to cash-in on the World
Cup, are already planning a new league for 1995.
Yet, those who have been closely involved in US football for many years
contend that the World Cup will not decide the fate of their game. Clive
Toye, head of the New York host committee and a former president of the New
York Cosmos of the old NASL, believes football will grow as a sport in the
US with or without the World Cup.
He says there is no need for the home team to do well, or for the World Cup
to win over fans from basketball or baseball fans. In the long run, it
doesn't matter a damn whether the US team goes out in the first round or
wins the World Cup, because the game is progressing up through the
generations in a very handy way .. Soccer is now the second most popular
game for participants in this country. Those are the fans of the future.'
Football is certainly popular with many Americans of both sexes. Today, an
estimated 15m people play football in the US, more than any team sport
except basketball, and at universities there are more soccer' teams than
American football teams. At the professional level, the country has a
well-established if minor league of 72 teams.
Some observers of the US sports scene, however, are not convinced that a
fully-fledged professional football league will succeed in the US just
because millions of people play the game for fun. John Jeansonne, a
journalist who covers international sports for New York Newsday, says:
Soccer in the US is a tremendous participation sport .. but it's just not
something that Americans tend to follow as spectators. I don't believe the
World Cup will change that, any more than a very successful Los Angeles
Olympics changed our passion for athletics, which continues to disappear
from the landscape of spectator sports in the US.'
Yet, to those like Toye, who have helped nurture the sport in the a over the
years, the millions of Americans who play football represent the roots of
the game, roots which will one day bear fruit. If the World Cup acts as a
temporary fertiliser, so much the better, but Toye says the football
community in the US is not relying on the tournament to determine its
future.

FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (1): It's the spectacle that
counts - Barring surprises, the trophy will go to one of a handful of top
teams / Introduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many countries may be satisfied with lesser achievements along the way but
it has been clear from the start that only one of half a dozen countries had
a chance of grasping the World Cup itself.
This is the 15th World Cup competition. Football and the political and
economic environment have changed since 1930. Fifty-eight countries have
appeared in the finals. They include countries whose names no longer appear
on the map - Netherlands Antilles, Yugoslavia, East Germany, unified Korea.
This time the competition sees the debut of Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Russia
and the return of a single Germany.
Thirty-eight countries have at one time or another won a game in the World
Cup finals and 20 have reached a semi-final. But when the ball stops rolling
the same names crop up. Only six countries have won the World Cup. England
won it once. The other five have won it 13 times between them. England are
missing this time, as are Uruguay (population: 3m) which won in 1930 and
1950. The other four - Italy, Brazil, Germany and Argentina - have won a
total of 11. The winners this time could again be drawn from their ranks.
Germany and Argentina contested the last two finals. Germany, as West
Germany, have been in four of the last five finals.
Over the last two decades, even as former amateur nations in Europe and
teams from Africa have become stronger, the gang of four has tightened its
grip on the World Cup final. Apart from them, only the Netherlands have ever
reached any of the last six finals and they lost twice. - Time and again in
the last 24 years talented teams have gone home cursing their bad luck or
bad form in key matches - England, the USSR, the Netherlands, Spain, France
and, for the last five World Cups, Brazil - while Italy or Germany or
Argentina have lifted the trophy.
Argentina and Germany, it has sometimes seemed, could turn up with teams of
bus drivers and still reach the final. Germany have been in three penalty
shoot-outs and won them all. Argentina have won both of theirs. On their way
to their three finals Argentina have won six games by a single goal. They
beat the Dutch 3-1 in extra time. En route to their four recent finals the
Germans won eight times by one goal. Other than Argentina and Italy only
Austria, in 1978, have knocked them out in one of the last six World Cups.
Regardless of how well they play and the strength of the opposition, Germany
and Argentina always seem able to win.
This is not just good fortune. Nor is it a question of national character or
a certain style of playing. Argentina, torn between two footballing
traditions, show that. In 1966, perennial World Cup failures and convinced
that the world was conspiring against them, they defeated themselves in the
quarter final against England. Yet the same rugged, single-minded defensive
tactics, which led Alf Ramsey to dub them smugly as animals', took a
less-gifted but more disciplined Argentinian team to the 1990 final. What
happened in between was that a very different type of Argentinian team,
committed to relentless attacking play, guided by a football romantic C sar
Menotti and drawing strength from the home crowds, ended 40 years of
frustration and won the 1978 World Cup, proving that Argentina was worthy of
victory. That conviction has not yet left them.
In 1982, Italy suddenly discovered themselves in the fifth game of the
competition. After four indifferent matches they found their form against a
marvellous Brazilian team, won 3-2 and went on to win the cup. But that sour
taste of unfulfilled promise has been Brazil's lot in the last five World
Cups. - The supreme self-confidence of a team can disappear rapidly, too.
England went to Mexico in 1970 as holders, certain that they would play
Brazil in the final. That certainty filled their play until the quarter
final in Leon. As West Germany came from two goals behind to win in extra
time they left a scar on the psyche of English football that has yet to
heal. It was visible again four years ago when a succession of haggard
English players trudged forward at the end of the semi-final in Turin to
take the worst penalties of their lives.
And yet Italy was seen as a success for English football beyond the nation's
cowed expectations. Likewise the Irish lost happily in Rome in the quarter
finals having progressed further than they dared hope. In Italy, the
Spaniards, the Yugoslavs and the Romanians all succumbed to vertigo in the
later rounds. Worst of all, the USSR waited until their last group match
before producing a dazzling 4-0 win over Cameroon. Cameroon still advanced
and the USSR went home dreaming of what might have been.
There will be similar tales this summer. There are neurotic teams with
talent - Russia, Brazil, Colombia and Italy. There are less able teams who
know with absolute clarity how to make the best of their resources - Ireland
and Norway. There are teams whose aims are limited.
There are plenty of maybes. Brazil can win if their defence does not fall to
bits. Italy could win if their attack clicks. Nigeria could spring a
surprise if they can add to their undoubted talents the kind of team spirit
for which Cameroon are famous. If Ireland or Belgium can scrape a few goals
they could turn up in the semi-finals. The Irish start brimming with
confidence following their 2-0 away win over Germany. - But only two teams
arrived in the US knowing they can win. They are Germany and Argentina. It
would be nice if someone punctured their confidence. Germany look
vulnerable. They are an ageing team, particularly in attack and the
expectation at home seems to have grown more strident, more demanding. But,
as they showed in 1954 (when they defeated Hungary in the final), 1984 and
1988, they know how to beat superior opposition.
But even the Germans may not overcome another unalterable World Cup
tradition. When the competition is held in the Americas a Latin American
team wins. That means Argentina, as tough as in 1990 but now with an added
secret ingredient: an attack. The playing also tends to be better at World
Cups staged in the Americas. There are more star players than four years
ago. The Argentinians, Brazilians and Colombians have more flair. Even some
of Europe's traditional grinders - Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Romania and
Bulgaria - have acquired extra sparkle. The Nigerians offer the promise of
both captivating football and ruthlessness.
Here there are further grounds for hope. Fifa plans to fight the scourge of
defensive football by rewarding wins in the group stage with three points,
although this will not stop teams playing for penalties in the knock out. It
hopes to fight the cynical take-it-in-turns fouling of creative players that
knee-capped the World Cup in Italy, by instructing referees to be tougher.
Referees habitually respond to such directives by getting their retaliation
in early. They brandish lots of yellow and red cards in early matches then,
after managers and journalists complain, lose their nerve in the knock-out
matches fearing that, if they send off a parade of big-name players, Fifa
will not back them.
Even so, we can still hope that cynicism will be confounded and that if
Diego Maradona, himself winner of Fifa's fair play award in 1986, hoists the
cup over his head, he will be able to echo the timeless sentiment of players
and managers and proclaim: football was the winner'.

FT  17 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early losses reduced in modest
trading volume - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares reacted nervously in London yesterday to a warning on interest rates
from the Governor of the Bank of England and also to renewed losses in bond
markets following sharp rises in oil and commodity prices. But there was
little selling pressure in the stock market, which stood up well to the new
setback in UK government bonds.
Neither the UK chancellor of the exchequer nor the Bank Governor had given
the stock market much encouragement in their respective speeches on the
previous evening at the Mansion House, in the City of London.
But traders said that the day's fall of 15.7 for a final reading on the
FT-SE 100 Index of 3,030.1 appeared 'quite good in the circumstances'.
Equities opened lower as traders digested the chancellor's assurances that
taxes will not be cut until public borrowing levels permit, and the
Governor's warning that UK interest rates will have to rise at some
unspecified moment in the future.
The FT-SE 100 was down just over 20 points within a few minutes of the
official opening of trading, albeit in very thin volume. At first, it
appeared that confidence in the stock market would be severely challenged by
falls in UK gilts as European bonds reacted sharply to the weakness
overnight in US Federal securities.
A crude oil price of nearly Dollars 20 a barrel in the US, together with a
higher gold bullion price, reminded investors that the US Federal Reserve
Board has identified commodity prices as a significant inflation trigger.
Some bond market analysts predicted that the Fed might soon feel obliged to
tighten credit policy again.
Against this negative background, the stock market did well to rally quickly
from the day's low of 3,025.4 on the Footsie and to trade peaceably ahead of
the opening of the new session in New York.
Little response was accorded to news that domestic retail sales patterns
were unchanged in May, or to a rise in May Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement to Pounds 4.34bn.
When the Dow Industrial Average opened modestly firmer, to show a gain of 10
points in UK hours, the London market consolidated and appeared unaffected
by renewed uncertainty in US Federal bonds, or by the absence of recovery in
domestic gilts.
In the wider market, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished 25.5 down at 3,534.2.
Oil shares benefited from higher crude prices, with Lasmo firmer in late
trading in spite of a generally negative view of pros-pects for the
increased terms from Enterprise Oil. The utility sector, however, remained
rattled following the warning on dividend policy from British Gas in the
wake of the Ofgas pricing report.
Although Seaq volume increased to 610.1m shares from the 562.8m registered
in the previous session, traders said that the market was not busy
yesterday. Trading in non-Footsie stocks made up a high 60 per cent of
overall Seaq business. The warning on interest rates, while not presenting
any new factor for the market, encouraged fund managers to back away from
equities while still waiting for the bond market to settle down. Some
analysts said that equities had yesterday shown themselves successfully
freed from bond market influences.
Retail business remained high at Pounds 1.56bn on Wednesday, in spite of the
reduced market attendance prompted by a national rail strike. Many traders
sensed that retail business had fallen away yesterday.

FT  17 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nervous trading following a Bank of England warning on interest rates marked
the last full day of dealings in the current index futures and share options
contracts, writes Joel Kibazo.
In Liffe futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100, which will cease
trading this morning, traded in a tight range of around 10 points for most
of the session. Having opened at 3,015, it touched a low of 3,012 and a high
of 3,034, although most of the day's trading was carried out around the
3,025 level.
Dealers continued to roll positions forward into the September contract,
which assumes the market leader position after today's mid-morning expiry.
The decline in UK gilts was said to have had a less than usual impact on
trading.
The June contract closed at 3,025, down 17 from its previous close and at a
4-point discount to cash. Volume in June was a hefty 21,111 lots, and some
12,516 were dealt in the September contract.
In traded options, which today see the expiry of the June index options,
total volume was 35,783, against 33,182 in the previous day. The FT-SE 100
option traded 15,100 contracts. Argyll was the busiest stock option with
3,260 lots dealt, but the single biggest trade was carried out in
Pilkington, one house selling 2,000 of the November 180 calls at 11 1/2 p.

FT  17 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Smith advances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, CLARE GASCOIGNE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A steep rise in profits from Pounds 38.7m to Pounds 95.2m at Smith New Court
saw the shares advance 4 to 373p. Analysts were impressed by the
stockbroking firm's increasingly international business.
Mr Chris Smith at James Capel called it 'a very well-balanced set of
results; the quality of earnings is going up and it is now more of an
investment than a punt on the market'. He forecast the current year at or
slightly below yesterday's figures, with earnings of between 50p to 60p per
share.
Mr Philip Gibbs at BZW said Smith was likely to extend its product range and
market share in the current year, and he expected to upgrade his 'pretty
conservative estimate' for current year profit of Pounds 90m.
Turnover in Royal Insurance, up 5 at 260p, was higher than average at 3.9m.
The volume was partly due to switching from Sun Alliance, which dropped 12
to 314p on profit-taking after its 12 per cent outperformance in the past
fortnight, but was also due to news that Lloyd's of London had won a US
industrial pollution case. Royal Insurance has one of the largest exposures
to pollution damage claims.
Further consideration of Wednesday's good results from CE Heath boosted the
shares 12 to 352p, but accompanying takeover rumours were described as 'wide
of the mark' by NatWest Securities' Mr Tony Silverman.
Bradstock Group's 5 per cent profits increase left the shares unchanged at
114p.
A profits warning from merchant bank Rea Brothers pushed it down 13 to 62p.
Royal Bank of Scotland bucked the market trend, rising 12 to 422p after a
buy note from Credit Lyonnais Laing. Mr Martin Hughes said the bank offered
excellent prospects not shown by other banks, with growth expected in
business and dividends. Abbey National dipped 5 to 422p, with NatWest
Securities rumoured to be negative but Goldman Sachs rumoured as positive.
Other banks eased back from Wednesday's gains.
The recovery in the crude oil price boosted oil giant BP, offsetting recent
concern that the ban on the export of Alaskan crude may not be lifted
following objections in the US Congress. The shares gained 3 1/2 at 408 1/2
p in trade of 12m.
The firmer oil price also helped Enterprise Oil, the shares advancing 7 to
398p, as talk that its bid for Lasmo would fail continued to circulate.
However, the oils team at Strauss Turnbull believe Lasmo investors should
accept the offer, particularly because 'the revised bid terms confer
benefits on Lasmo shareholders at the expense of Enterprise shareholders'.
The day's turnover in Enterprise of 2.9m was said to have included a block
of 175,000 bought at a 2p premium for the new account, which begins on
Monday. Lasmo eased 2 1/2 to 141p as the bid interest in the stock continued
to fade.
Two-way business in Shell Transport brought volume of 4.6m as the stock
closed unchanged at 714p.
Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank and securities house, changed from a
cautious stance on the brewery sector to one of 'cautiously optimistic'.
Analyst Mr Andrew Holland said recent results and company meetings had
seemed to indicate that the worst of the wholesale price war was now over.
'All the bad news on discounting is now in the share prices,' he said. 'We
could see some modest upturns from here.'
The broker removed Scottish &amp; Newcastle from its sell list. The shares
firmed a penny to 518p.
Hints from the Bank of England that interest rates will have to rise hit
builders and building material groups hard. Among the former, Barratt
Developments fell 10 1/2 to 189 1/2 p, John Laing 9 1/2 to 282 1/2 p,
Persimmon 5 to 237p and Taylor Woodrow 7 to 124p. Materials groups included
Marley, off 9 at 139p, Hepworth, down 14 at 307p, Redland, 20 cheaper at
470p, and RMC, 35 weaker at 813p.
High street retailers were also undermined by the rate rise speculation and
mixed retail sales figures. Kingfisher slid 8 to 502p and Great Universal
Stores 6 to 573p. But Dixons was 3 firmer at 191p as the figures showed
electrical sales stronger.
Fears about the take-up of the shares from its recent rights offer continued
to dog Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel, which fell 14 to 303p. Dealers
reported some confusion in dealing forms for private clients wishing to take
up the issue.
News of the restructuring of the Milk Marketing Board saw gains from
Unigate, up 4 at 391p, and Northern Foods, ahead 2 at 217p.
Figures below market expectations left Alvis 6 cheaper at 66p.
The day's biggest volume was recorded in British Steel as active two-way
business sent turnover up to 16m. The share price closed unchanged at 136
1/2 p.
Allied Leisure slipped 2 to 25p after announcing that it is to take an
exceptional charge in its accounts for the current year.

FT  17 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities in active session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, CLARE GASCOIGNE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water and electricity sectors continued to be buoyed and buffeted in equal
measure by recent results and regulatory moves. South Wales Electricity, the
latest to report figures, saw profits come in at the top end of market
forecasts and its dividend fully meet expectations.
The shares moved forward on the news and sustained the gain through the
session, closing 6 up at 635p. Some of the other 'recs' trailed back with
the market, continuing to nurse a hangover from British Gas, which fell
heavily on Wednesday after reacting negatively to the industry regulator's
latest move on pricing.
Gas shares slid a further 3 to 268 1/2 p. Elsewhere among the recs, East
Midland bounced 13 to 592p, Manweb declined 7 to 683p and Midlands edged up
3 to 582p.
Water stocks were largely dull, with dealers reporting a few large sellers
in the wake of results from Thames on Wed-nesday. The company reported large
provisions for its non-core businesses and it was fear that other water
companies may make similar moves which provoked some selling.
In contrast, analysts pronounced themselves pleased with results from
Southern, which produced a good dividend increase and an upbeat trading
statement. But the sector weakness meant Southern's initial rise was turned
into a 5 deficit at 513p by the close. Thames eased 2 to 468p in another
heavy turnover of 4m.

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: European volumes continue to slip
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European volumes continued to slip back as the summer began to take hold
last month. According to Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, who
compiled the data, turnover in Europe declined by 8.6 per cent in May
compared to April, having already fallen by 12 per cent in April from March.
'Once again, it was the fall in US Treasury bond prices that was the main
bearish influence on European markets, which failed to benefit from an
unexpected cut in German official rates on May 11,' he says.
International investors also lifted their sales, with turnover in European
stocks traded on Seaq International in London, as a proportion of business
in Continental domestic markets, rising to 16.3 per cent in May from 15.8
per cent in April.
France saw the biggest rise in May's activity - in spite of a 6 per cent
fall in the index, turnover was up nearly 21 per cent; but, reports Mr
Cornish, it was still down 13.6 per cent on the average of the previous
three months, 'suggesting a resumption of selling pressure under the threat
of rights issues and the UAP privatisation'.
Italian volumes declined by 6.4 per cent in May after April's record high,
with the market itself dropping 8.5 per cent as profits were taken following
the victory of Mr Berlusconi in the general election.

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan under pressure after
interest rate warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bear market in bonds continued to wreak havoc in European equity
markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN came under renewed pressure as worries about the outlook for the
economy and interest rates further soured the mood. The Comit index, which
had posted losses on each of the previous five sessions, fell another 14.73,
or 2.1 per cent, to 700.69, prompting expectations that it would test
support at the 690-point level before upward momentum could be regained.
Mr Tancredi Bianchi, head of the Italian Banking Association, warned late on
Wednesday that Italian rates could rise by a full percentage point before
the end of the year if there were no change in the international outlook.
This compounded an already nervous mood as the new account began with the
market facing a hefty round of cash calls.
Blue chips bore the brunt of the selling, with Fiat off L212, or 3.3 per
cent, at L6,200, Olivetti down L85, or 3.4 per cent, at L2,405 and Pirelli
losing L119, or 4.5 per cent, at L2,519.
Against the trend, Mondadori, which had been marked sharply lower earlier in
the week, bounced L1,080, or 7.1 per cent, to L16,380 as its L900bn share
offer began.
FRANKFURT was sandbagged again by bond market weakness, said Mr Eckhard
Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, but it was worried, too, about the
weaker dollar, and about technical aspects of the market with DTB contracts
due to expire today, and the Daimler rights issue to begin on Monday.
The Dax index fell 19.79 to 2,054.91 on the session, hit 2,040.89 at the
bottom of the post-bourse and recovered to 2,047.29 at the end of the day on
the hope that there might be some recovery potential on options expiry
today.
Turnover fell from DM7.6bn to DM6.7bn. Veba, the energy, chemicals and oils
group, recovered intraday, moving from DM498.50, down DM8.90 on the session
to DM506 at the end of the afternoon. Merck Finck, Hoare Govett and Goldman
Sachs have all lauded the group's earnings potential.
PARIS maintained its downtrend, although early weakness was softened
slightly by a further easing from the Bank of France in the intervention
rate, something which had largely been discounted by investors.
The CAC-40 index lost 23.58 or 1.2 per cent to 1,942.81, putting in a late
spurt at the end of the day to rise above a session low of 1,931.
Baring Securities said that investors should return to the market during the
third quarter before the publication of first half results in
mid-September/October, likely to show a significant improvement in company
earnings.
St Gobain closed unchanged at FFr629 and said that it might increase its
stake in Essilor, the manufacturer of spectacle lenses.
Schneider went against the trend, up FFr8.10 to FFr356.90, as it announced
that it was to sell FFr700m worth of assets which would bring it a pre-tax
capital gain of FFr350-400m. The group also said that it expected to report
a significant rise in 1994 profits.
AMSTERDAM closed at a new low for the year as the equity market continued to
take its lead from weakness in bonds. The AEX index dipped 5.04 or 1.2 per
cent to 395.74, just above the session low of 395.42.
DSM was dragged down by Fl 3.50 to Fl 124.30 as selling on the options
exchange took hold. There was also reported switching out of the group into
other European chemical groups. Akzo also weakened in line with the day's
trend, finishing off Fl 3.00 at Fl 206.70.
Ahold, which reported first quarter profits of some Fl 110m, eased 60 cents
to Fl 46.50, while Royal Dutch fell by a similar amount to Fl 198.30 as the
oil price hit its highest level for 12 months.
ZURICH failed to sustain an afternoon recovery and the SMI index gave up
35.2 to 2,666.6 in response to the weakness of bonds and the dollar.
Financial shares remained under pressure with UBS bearers losing SFr34 or
2.9 per cent to SFr1,140. CS Holding was SFr15 lower at SFr550 and SBC lost
SFr10 to SFr385.
Among pharmaceuticals, Roche certificates gave up SFr80 to SFr6,600 while
the recently weak Ciba registered lost SFr1 to SFr825 and Sandoz registered
dipped SFr4 to SFr715.
Nestle fell SFr15 to SFr1,145: UBS, which recommends the stock, commented
that the favourable medium-term outlook for the group should help it to
outperform its European peer group.
Swissair lost SFr10 to SFr767 as the market awaited a statement after the
market closed, following a press report that the group planned to take a
near 50 per cent stake in Sabina. In the event, Swissair said it was holding
talks with several airlines.
MADRID lost just over 2 per cent, the general index closing 6.49 lower at
311.31 with turnover up again, to nearly Pta44bn. Construction stocks were
hardest hit with Dragados down Pta100, or 4.4 per cent to Pta2,090 and
Valderrivas Pta480, or 4.1 per cent lower at Pta11,220.
ISTANBUL leapt 7.4 per cent as the supreme court over-ruled an application
to block the government's aim to speed up the privatisation process. The
composite index added 1,320.75 to 19,321.67, after touching a midsession
high of 19,611.
WARSAW rallied nearly 6 per cent but traders said that the outlook remained
mixed. The Wig index rose 452.5 to 8,386.5 and turnover by 34 per cent to
1,200bn zlotys.
Brokers added that the market's rise could signal that the market was
bottoming out from a two-week fall, during which the index hit its lowest
level since last October.

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: S African golds advance 4.5%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold shares closed sharply higher in Johannesburg as domestic investors were
heartened by the bullion price, which broke out of its narrow trading range
to trade just short of the Dollars 388 an ounce resistance level.
The golds index, which jumped more than 3 per cent in the first half-hour of
trade, ended 94, or 4.5 per cent, ahead at 2,185 in spite of some mild
profit-taking near the close.
The rest of the market was mixed in quiet trade after Wednesday's gains,
with a stronger financial rand depressing some prices. The overall index
gained 27 at 5,774 while industrials receded 13 to 6,744. De Beers closed 75
cents off at R115.25 but Anglos added R1 at R242. Among golds, Vaal Reefs
forged ahead R15.50 to R430 and Kloof put on R2.75 at R56.25.

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong dips 1.4%,
Nikkei makes upward move

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices gained ground for the first time in three trading days on
buying by individual investors and dealers, but volume remained low due to
lingering caution, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average was up 84.51 at 21,367.47 after a day's low of
21,273.95 and high of 21,389.98. Foreign investors, who had been leading
buyers during the past few weeks, were absent, as were domestic
institutions.
Volume amounted to 382.8m shares, against 468m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks put on 0.26 at 1,698.53 while the Nikkei 300 rose 0.05 to
308.55. Advances outnumbered falls by 524 to 475, with 184 issues unchanged.
In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 2.05 firmer at 1,394.88.
Traders said that in spite of the day's gains, the correction was likely to
continue next week. However, many believe the downside to be limited. 'Most
corporate and financial investors who wanted to take profits did so when the
Nikkei broke through the 21,500 level,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko
Securities.
Meanwhile, rumours that a US hedge fund had bought put options, expecting
the index to fall below 20,000, kept many domestic investors nervous.
Dealers took their cue from the rises in crude oil and gold prices on
overseas markets, buying up resource-related stocks.
Non-ferrous metals gained ground, including Sumitomo Metal Mining, which
firmed Y2 to Y974, Mitsubishi Materials, advancing Y25 to Y575, and Mitsui
Mining and Smelting, gaining Y10 at Y458.
Oil shares were also higher, with Teikoku Oil up Y6 to Y798 and Kamei, a
petroleum wholesaler, adding Y60 at Y1,490.
Individuals dabbled in speculative favourites. Brother Industries, the
sewing machine maker, surged ahead Y27 to Y783, Yokohama Rubber advanced Y12
to Y736 and Minebea rose Y11 to Y885.
Large-capital blue chips continued to face profit-taking. Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, the most active issue of the day, eased Y1 to Y797 and Nippon
Steel shed Y2 to Y360.
Banks were lower in spite of the absence of arbitrage selling. Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank dipped Y10 to Y1,960 and Bank of Tokyo Y20 to Y1,620.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 15.65 to 23,610.55 in volume of 34.5m
shares.
Roundup
A number of regional markets were under pressure.
HONG KONG fell 1.4 per cent, under selling pressure aimed at property shares
and with overseas investors seen switching their funds into Japan and the
US. The Hang Seng index retreated 126.60 to 9,022.92 in thin turnover of
HK2.84bn.
The property sub-index dropped 2.6 per cent amid worries that the
government's recent measures to cool the overheated residential property
market could hit the profits of major property developers. Fears were also
growing that the government might take action aimed at the commercial
property sector.
SYDNEY continued to be undermined by sharply weaker bond prices and equities
finished at their lowest level for more than a month. The All Ordinaries
index lost 18.4 at 2,056.0. The All Industrials index fell 25.2 to 2,995.6,
near to its 10-month low.
MANILA attempted to put a brake on its near two-week decline before late
profit-taking again left shares slightly easier. The composite index slipped
5.31 to 2,916.56.
COLOMBO was depressed by declines in shares with a high market
capitalisation, and the all-share index fell 19.45 to 928.27 in turnover
that jumped to SLRs117m, from SLRs76m on Wednesday.
SEOUL rebounded from two days of steep losses caused by a dispute over North
Korea's nuclear programme, and the composite index closed 10.16 better at
901.08 in turnover of Won565.3bn.
TAIPEI lost some of its gains after late profit-taking in electronics
stocks, financials still leading as the weighted index ended 34.58 up at
6,149.64.
KARACHI's banks, synthetics and cement stocks attracted investors on the new
account day, and the KSE 100 index rose 22.18 to 2,278.80.
BOMBAY climbed on local and foreign buying after Indian Hotels announced a
one-for-one scrip issue, the BSE 30-share index closing 40.36 higher at
4,164.06. Indian Hotels rose Rs75 to Rs1,350.
SINGAPORE recovered on a late buying push which took the Straits Times
Industrial index from an 18-point loss to a gain of 0.83 at 2,287.34. KUALA
LUMPUR saw reduced activity, volume falling from 338m shares to 236m as the
KLSE composite index ended 3.44 higher at 1,032.39.
BANGKOK's SET index rose 4.91 to 1,364.4, after dipping by more than 11
points in the morning, on bargain hunting, particularly in financials, in
the final hour of trading.

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow boosted by strong
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chips registered solid gains yesterday in a favourable reaction to
strong economic news, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 20.93 ahead at 3,811.34, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.32 better at 461.93. New
York SE volume was 256.4m shares. The secondary markets lagged behind,
however, with the American SE composite dipping 0.49 to 441.78 and the
Nasdaq composite softening 0.87 to 734.97.
While the Dow industrials never completely decoupled from the trend in bonds
yesterday, the benchmark index did assert a measure of independence in the
morning.
The day's economic news was consistent with the view that the economy was on
a sound footing, in spite of the recent rise in interest rates. However,
many investors, particularly in the Nasdaq market, were concerned by the
inflationary implications of the fresh data.
The Commerce Department said that housing starts had climbed 2.6 per cent in
May, confounding expectations of a 0.8 per cent decline. Initial claims for
unemployment benefit showed a marked decline of 11,000 compared with last
week. Thirdly, the monthly survey of business conditions by the Federal
Reserve of Philadelphia was generally upbeat.
All three reports were clearly unfavourable to bonds, and prices dropped
again in early trading. Nevertheless, blue chips opened in positive ground
and remained there.
A subsequent reversal by bonds, thanks to a softer tone in commodity prices,
was a bonus. A final burst of program trading, linked to today's 'triple
witching' expiration of options and futures, brought the Dow to its highest
level of the day at the close. In a switch from the trend early in the week,
Exxon assumed the leadership in the index's modest rally. Most of the other
components moved in a very narrow range.
Exxon, which had reached a 52-week low during the previous session, recouped
Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 58 7/8 as bargain hunters came to the fore. A
commitment by Opec ministers meeting in Vienna to hold current crude oil
production levels helped the issue's cause, although most other energy
stocks were little changed.
Chevron, however, slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 44 1/4 after Mr Eugene
Nowak, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, sharply reduced his estimates of
the group's operating income.
Utility issues were generally weaker and the Dow Jones Utility index fell
1.31 to 184.95.
Entergy, a New Orleans-based gas and electricity supplier, dropped Dollars 2
7/8 to Dollars 26 1/4 after analysts came away from a company briefing with
a pessimistic view of its growth outlook. Both Merrill Lynch and Kidder
Peabody downgraded the issue. Merrill Lynch also lowered its rating on
Wisconsin Energy, the stock weakening Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 24 3/4 .
Several banking shares suffered sharp setbacks. Analysts said the sector was
due for a correction after the heavy demand which followed the recent rise
in short-term interest rates.
Shawmut National fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 21 3/4 after trading was
briefly halted on an order imbalance. NatWest Securities lowered its 1994
earnings estimate for the company. First Chicago shed Dollars 2 1/8 to
Dollars 50 3/4 , NationsBank Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 1/4 and Wells Fargo
Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 155 1/2 .
On the Amex, Hasbro was marked down Dollars 3 to Dollars 28 1/2 after
issuing a profits warning.

Share prices rallied from a weak start to close up on the day after foreign
buyers returned to the market. The Merinvest composite index added 2.1 per
cent at 146.51, with Electricidad de Caracas climbing 9 bolivars to 388.
Brokers attributed the recovery to buying by a couple of foreign
institutions, and added that the banking crisis remained the main focus of
concern. The rise in interest rates at the central bank's weekly auction of
zero-coupon bonds on Wednesday was said to have had less effect than might
have been expected.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Gyrations for US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US currency was bounced around in choppy trading conditions yesterday as
bearish sentiment tested its technical lows against the D-Mark and growing
tensions concerning North Korea helped the dollar off its floors against the
yen, writes Motoko Rich.
A fall in the US bond market dragged the dollar down, but intervention by
the Bank of Japan in support of the US currency and better than expected US
economic data gave the dollar a boost.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.6319 from DM1.6354 and at Y103.335 from
Y102.750. It finished the New York session at DM1.6321 and Y103.335.
The safe haven Swiss franc benefited from war talk about North Korea and
gained from views that the Swiss economy is the healthiest in Europe.
In early sessions, the market tried to break through DM1.6280 to the dollar,
a level seen as significant by technical analysts. The US currency dropped
below DM1.63 for the first time since October.
'The dollar has had a sluggish performance because the factors that have
been hurting it in the long term are still there,' said Mr David Cocker,
economist at Chemical Bank. 'There is uncertainty on the US-Japan trade
front, and the market maintains a very positive outlook on the European
recovery, which has particularly benefited the D-Mark.'
While tough talking from North Korea and a rumour that a US helicopter had
been downed in South Korea buoyed the dollar against the yen, escalating
tensions in the region provoked a fall in the US bond market, which is
having a knock-on effect on the dollar.
'Developments in North Korea have been upsetting commodity prices,
especially oil, and have been interpreted as adding inflationary pressures
to the US,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of
America.
He further commented that concerns about rising inflation in the US have
prompted nervous investors, fearing interest rate increases, to retreat from
US Treasuries, a move reflec-ted in the US currency market.
A decent batch of US statistics pushed the dollar up in afternoon trading.
US May housing starts were well above forecasts, rising 2.6 per cent after a
3.1 per cent decline in April. Analysts had expected the May figure to fall.
Housing permits dropped 1.6 per cent in May, however, indicating a future
slowdown.
Initial jobless claims fell more than expected to 348,000, from 359,000 in
the previous week. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve index rose to 16.1 in
June from 14.8 in May.
While these figures lent support to the US currency, the market remained
gloomy on the dollar. 'The mood in the market is that if it cannot rally
against all the news that has been thrown at it, then it must be going
down,' said Mr Nick Parsons, economist at CIBC.
The Canadian dollar followed the US currency down and plummeted to CDollars
1.393 against the US dollar from CDollars 1.386. 'If the US dollar has a bad
day, then the Canadian dollar has an even worse day,' said Mr Parsons.
It is thought that the Canadian authorities have intervened to stem the tide
against the Canadian dollar.
The Swiss franc fell back from highs against the dollar and the D-Mark but
maintained a strong upward bias as investors flooded towards the Swiss
currency in search of a safe haven in the light of developments in North
Korea.
Some analysts believed North Korea was a small factor in the Swiss franc's
strength. 'I think the view that Swiss interest rates have reached bottom
and that the Swiss economy is slightly better than the German economy has
helped the franc,' said Mr Peter Luxton, economic adviser at Barclays Bank.
He also said the collapse in the European bond market helped the Swiss
franc, but also the D-Mark. Mr Luxton added that the D-Mark was further
strengthened by remarks the Bundesbank made in its June monthly report. 'The
recessionary tendencies in the west German economy appear to have been
overcome,' the central bank said.
The D-Mark finished at FFr3.413 from FFr3.410 and at L981.0 from L973.5.
German call money was quoted in a range of 5.00/10 per cent and the market
was well supplied with liquidity.
Sterling lost overnight gains made after the UK chancellor's Mansion House
speech and comments by Bank of England Governor Mr Eddie George, in which he
signalled a future interest rate rise.
The pound was unaffected by slightly weaker than forecast retail sales
figures and an improved public sector borrowing rate.
Sterling closed in London at DM2.4805 from DM2.4862 and virtually unchanged
at Dollars 1.5201 from Dollars 1.5203. The Bank of England provided
liquidity of Pounds 339m at the established rate after forecasting a
shortage of Pounds 400m. The overnight lending rate traded between 5 3/8 and
2 per cent.
In the futures market, the short sterling contract for December finished at
93.76 from 93.94. The December Euromark contract ended at 94.81 from 94.85.

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Australian wool prices wereagain firm with little change during the week.
The market indicator finished at 625c/kg, just 3c lower than a week ago.
Japan and Western Europe were still said to be active buyers, but an added
influence was China, reported to be among the leading competitors and
encouraging the view that the wool market may resume its rising trend in the
season due to begin next month. For some weeks the balance has been close
between those considering a period of consolidation and perhaps easier
prices in the months ahead, and those convinced that the main rising trend
will persist. If China is more active, and with stockpile sales soon to be
resticted by a fixed disposal schedule, the more bullish approach has gained
a little ground. Good rates of activity in the main wool consuming countries
during recovery from recession is helpful.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures retreat from 7
1/2 -year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures surged to fresh 7 1/2 -year highs at the London Commodity
Exchange before surrendering nearly all the gains.
The September delivery position peaked in the morning at Dollars 2,490 a
tonne, extending the rally following Wednesday morning's shake-out to
Dollars 150. Traders told the Reuters news agency that the early gains were
in response to a report by the Green Coffee Association of New York showing
lower warehouse stocks.
But the trend was not followed up when the New York market opened and London
quickly went into retreat. By the close profit-taking and liquidation had
trimmed the September price to Dollars 2,395 a tonne, up just Dollars 7 on
the day.
'Things have gone quiet,' said one trader. 'The excitement went after New
York failed to follow us up, and then we just followed them down.'
The earlier rise had triggered stop-loss buying and prices had leapt in a
vacuum, other traders said.
It was a similar story in the cocoa market. Wednesday's strong tone was
maintained in early trading and the September price jumped Pounds 14 to
Pounds 1,055 a tonne at one stage. But it ended Pounds 6 down at Pounds
1,035.
'New York failed to live up to expectations, which also hurt sentiment,'
said one trader, who added that there was 'a fair amount of book-squaring
going on'. 'The market is being ruled by the specs (speculators) and
ignoring fundamentals, which are quite bearish,' said another.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Korean fears help drive N Sea
oil price above Dollars 17
</HEADLINE>

   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Oil prices continued to rally yesterday with the benchmark Brent blend
rising above Dollars 17 a barrel for the first time since the end of
September last year. It is now about Dollars 4 higher than its low of just
under Dollars 13 reached last February.
Analysts say concern about a possible military confrontation on the Korean
peninsula triggered off the latest rally, although publication of US
statistics confirming continuing domestic supply bottlenecks added to the
upward momentum.
Another factor underpinning the bullish sentiment included the decision on
Wednesday by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cancel its
September meeting.
The move was seen as confirmation that Opec is determined to stick to its
present production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day until the end of the
year.
Opec yesterday ended its conference in Vienna, with delegates continuing to
express optimism about prices. One Gulf Arab official thought that by the
end of the year prices for Brent could move towards the top of the Dollars
14 - Dollars 21 range of recent years.
But Opec officials also conceded that rising prices could tempt some members
to cheat on their quotas, even though all but three - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates - are producing close to their sustainable
capacity.
One official said a few Opec members might be able to exceed their
sustainable capacity for 'a few weeks'. But he predicted that the impact on
the market would not be that big. 'They would only damage the fields as well
as the price,' he added.
Opec is also considering additional ways to enforce production discipline.
Members are reviewing a scheme under which persistent over-producers could
have their quotas reduced until their average production over a period was
brought back into line. Officials say the unused portion of the original
quota would not be reallocated among other members.
Opec yesterday failed to select a permanent successor to Dr Subroto of
Indonesia, the outgoing secretary general. Mr Abdalla Salem El-Badri, Libyan
oil minister and the new Opec president, will assume the secretary-general's
duties until November, when members will again try to select a permanent
successor.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian government plans rice
export 'thrust' - Efforts to increase the country's 5 per cent share of the
world market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian federal government, assured of comfortable food stocks, has
decided to work hand in hand with the trade to promote the export of rice.
Although India has the largest area under rice and it is the second biggest
producer of the cereal after China, its share in the current year's
projected world trade of 14.5m tonnes of rice will be less than 5 per cent.
According to the All India Rice Exporters Association, however, the
country's export earnings from rice should be up to Rs25bn (Pounds 524m) by
the turn of the century from about Rs12bn in the year to March 1994.
The designation of rice as a 'thrust export commodity' and the series of
measures taken by the government to facilitate export has made the turn of
the century target achievable, say trade sources.
The more important export enabling steps that the government has recently
taken include the removal of the minimum export price (MEP) for basmati rice
(a superfine, extra long aromatic variety), reduction in phases of the MEP
for the non-basmati rice to improve its competitiveness in the world market
and the abolition of the export quota for the non-basmati varieties.
Meanwhile, the commerce ministry has accepted the suggestion of the
exporters' association that an export promotion council for rice should be
set up. Its constitution, according to traders, will give a 'direction to
the growth in Indian rice export. We must know the changing consumer
preferences in the traditional and new markets. One of the main tasks of the
council will be to disseminate market information among the exporters'.
India's rice exports grew to Rs12bn in 1993-94 from Rs3.52bn in 1987-88
without a proper marketing strategy. But until then India had largely relied
upon the export of basmati rice, for which its only significant competitor
is Pakistan. Basmati constitutes less than 10 per cent of the total amount
of rice traded in the world market. Of the total, about 42m hectares under
rice in India (less than 800,000 tonnes) - in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar
Pradesh - are committed to the basmati variety.
Indian production of basmati ranges from 600,000 tonnes to 650,000 tonnes a
year. Last year's exports are estimated at 400,000 tonnes, of which 75 per
cent went to the Middle East.
Mr EA Siddiq, project director of the Indian Directorate of Rice Research,
has sounded a note of caution that in spite of its special attributes,
basmati rice is 'becoming less acceptable in the traditional markets and it
is often rejected in the western market due to the failure to conform to the
quality norms.'
He said that complaints regarding the quality of basmati can be tackled,
provided that this special rice was put into two broad categories based on
the grain length - grade one comprising grains 7mm long and above and grade
two between 6.5mm and 6.9mm.
Traders have said it should be possible to sell larger quantities of basmati
in Europe, the US and Canada, which are now small markets. According to the
exporters' association, there is scope for promoting long grain basmati in
Japan as a 'gourmet food'. The special Indian rice attracted some good
enquiries at the recently held Foodex Japan.
There is a growing consensus, however, that increases in Indian rice exports
will have to come mainly from the non-basmati varieties, which last year
accounted for only about 160,000 tonnes.
According to the exporters' association, the gradual reduction in farm and
export subsidies and the minimum access opportunities for agricultural
products that are envisaged under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
will improve India's rice export prospects.
Besides basmati rice, India produces high quality long grain, medium quality
long grain, short grain and glutinous rice. It is in a position, therefore,
to exploit a number of markets. As for non-basmati rice, the market that
India is targeting specifically, it is in Africa where the demand for broken
rice is growing and the exporters' association considers that continent to
be the 'best bet' for Indian rice exporters.
As part of their effort to achieve a bigger share of the world trade in
rice, Indian exporters have started making 'substantial investment' in rice
mills with state-of-the-art graders, sorters and polishers. Another
encouraging development is the entry of big houses like Hindustan Lever and
ITC, the Indian associate of BAT Industries, in India's rice export sector.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper and aluminium lead base
metals back into bull run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals' bullish bandwagon appeared to be back on course yesterday after
Wednesday's setbacks.
The London Metal Exchange's three months delivery copper price climbed back
above the psychologically significant Dollars 2,400-a-tonne mark while the
aluminium market moved towards its next upside resistance area.
Other LME contracts were also higher, with three months zinc just managing
to regain its toe-hold above Dollars 1,000 a tonne and lead equalling its
recent 20 month high.
'The other metals were looking softer, but when copper and aluminium start
to go higher, people change their views,' one trader told the Reuters news
agency.
Once the three months copper price became re-established above Dollars 2,400
fresh speculative buying emerged to maintain it, and the market's firmness
was underpinned by a narrowing in the discount for cash metal. The
'contango' (as the discount is known in the trade) against three months
metal was reduced from Dollars 18 to Dollars 15.
Aluminium also benefited from a resurgence of speculative buying, which
helped the three months position clear the Dollars 1,440-a-tonne level and
reach a Dollars 38-month high before running into resistance near Dollars
1,450. At the close it stood at Dollars 1,444.50 a tonne, up Dollars 10.75
on the day and Dollars 38.25 on the week so far.
Traders told Reuters that the recent change in sentiment - with voluntary
output cuts generally expected to start wearing down stocks soon - pointed
to upside objectives of about Dollars 1,460 being secured before long.
The tin market continued to match moves in the LME's major metals, with
early losses being negated in the afternoon's general rally. However, there
was not enough enthusiasm behind the buying for prices to break
significantly higher and the three months position closed at Dollars
5,667.50 a tonne, up Dollars 22.50 on the day.
Nickel prices had been pushing higher from the start of trading, with some
fresh buying helping the three months price to break through Dollars 6,400
and reach Dollars 6,500 a tonne at one stage. Chart-based resistance emerged
around that level, however, and the price closed at Dollars 6,482.50 a
tonne. But that still represented a gain of Dollars 39.50.
Traders explained zinc's relatively lacklustre performance - up Dollars 1.50
at Dollars 1,001 a tonne - as a reflection of the heavy stocks burden that
is still overhanging the market.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU warned on cost of eastern
European farm price support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of farm support to help central and eastern European countries join
the European Union could amount to nearly Ecu1bn (Pounds 780m) a year,
according to two independent farm experts, reports Reuters from Brussels.
Provision of low farm support prices and creation of 'land banks' to provide
credit to help private farmers would cost between Ecu500m and Ecu900m a
year, Mr Henri Nallet, former French farm minister told a news conference.
'We hope the eastern Europeans will finance it themselves,' added Mr Adriaan
van Stolk, co-author of a report for the European Commission on EU farm
trade relations with eastern Europe.
The financing of farm support measures is expected to be one of the most
difficult issues in negotiations with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria on their eventual entry into the EU.
Mr Rene Steichen, EU agriculture commissioner, said on Wednesday that the
report reflected only the personal views of the authors.
The European Commission is expected to publish in July a discussion document
on measures to narrow the farm policy gap and assist the eventual membership
of the eastern European countries.
Eastern European farm support would be based on a wheat price of Dollars 85
a tonne, said Mr van Stolk, a Dutch farm business expert. 'The clue is to
lock in a low support price,' he suggested, adding that Dollars 85 would
cover 'hard core' input and labour costs and allow farmers to compete on the
world market.
Mr Nallet said lessons must be learned from the EU's major error 30 years
ago in setting cereals intervention prices 25 per cent above the internal
market price.
Price support would be complemented by a simplified system of fixed levies
and refunds on EU farm imports and exports from eastern Europe.
The creation of 'land banks' would help tackle the huge problem of inflation
and illiquidity in eastern Europe, Mr van Stolk said. 'It would help provide
liquidity in a very illiquid system' while helping private farmers to
establish economically viable farms.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Ontario targets Japanese investors with
Y100bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Province of Ontario achieved a minor feat yesterday, in view of current
market conditions, when its Y100bn offering of seven-year bonds put it well
ahead of its funding programme for the current year.
According to joint lead manager Daiwa, Ontario has now raised CDollars 4bn
of its borrowing requirement of CDollars 7.7bn for 1994, although the
province also expects to pre-borrow a further CDollars 2bn to CDollars 3bn
for next year.
The offering was launched during Tokyo's trading day since the bonds were
targeted mainly at Japanese investors, who were attracted by the 4.40 per
cent coupon.
Syndicate managers said that the pricing of the bonds was aggressive when
compared with other euroyen deals.
For example, Italy's seven-year bonds were trading at a yield spread of
around 35 to 40 basis points over Japanese government bonds.
However, they pointed out that Japanese investors looked at coupon levels
rather than yield spreads when they made investment decisions.
When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was unchanged.
There was talk in the market that most of the orders for Ontario's bonds
went to the joint lead managers - so much so that members of the syndicate
resorted to selling their allocations back to them.
There were also reports that a similar situation had occurred shortly after
the launch of the Kingdom of Belgium's long-awaited Dollars 500m offering of
five-year eurobonds, the other main deal of the day.
The pricing of Belgium's bonds, at 24 basis points over the when-issued
five-year Treasury, was widely regarded as spot on.
When the bonds started to trade, the spread was unchanged despite the
volatility in the underlying Treasury market.
The market is gearing up for Fannie Mae's first global bond offering, which
is scheduled to be launched next Wednesday.
Joint lead managers J. P. Morgan and Merrill Lynch held a conference call
with syndicate members late yesterday afternoon.
The offering is widely expected to raise up to Dollars 1.5bn, have a 10-year
maturity and be priced to yield around 25 basis points over Treasuries.

Pemex, the Mexican state oil company, is to issue Y20bn of samurai bonds
next month to raise money for factory expansion, company officials said,
AP-DJ reports from New York.
The issue, which will be lead-managed by Daiwa Securities, will be Pemex's
first and Latin America's largest samurai bond issue. Pemex made a US
dollar-denominated bond issue earlier this year. The latest funding will be
used to finance equipment to process crude oil and petrochemical products.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Dublin opening for Finex
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Finex, the currency futures arm of the New York Cotton Exchange, today opens
Finex Europe at the new Dublin Exchange Facility in the International
Financial Services Centre.
Finex Europe will trade Finex's existing US dollar index futures. In
addition, both floors today start trading sterling/D-Mark, D-Mark/French
franc, and dollar/D-Mark futures around the clock, in Dublin and New York.
Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will act as marketmakers
in Dublin, while Nationsbank will make a market from London.
So far, Finex has sold 90 permits for trading and broking rights in Dublin
for Dollars 10,000 each. Initially, there will be about 15 floor brokers and
five 'locals' or independent traders in the pit in Dublin.
According to Mr Peter Burton, director of product development at Finex,
D-Mark/Swedish krona, D-Mark/lira and D-Mark/yen futures will be phased in
over the next few weeks, and other products may be added later.
'(Finex Europe) has a lot of potential,' according Ms Mary Fischer, a
foreign exchange trader at Nationsbank CRT. 'The push is towards European
hedge funds.'
Finex's foreign exchange contracts in New York are mainly traded by US hedge
fund and futures fund managers such as Mr Paul Tudor Jones, NYCE chairman,
who will open trading in Dublin at 11.05am. However, some observers are
sceptical about the amount of interest that will be drummed up in Europe,
given the small number of speculative funds relative to the US market. They
fear that the new floor will have to rely on existing US clients.
However, because of the low set-up cost of the Dublin floor, the operation
does not require heavy volume to make money.
'We have been trying to figure out a reasonable projection,' said Mr Burton.
'A thousand contracts a day is break-even, and we hope to achieve that
within a few months.'

FT  17 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Supply fears push European prices to new
lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bears continued to ravage the market yesterday, pushing government bond
prices in several European markets to new lows for this year in volatile
trading.
The overnight fall in US Treasuries got European bonds off to a weak start.
Moreover, supply fears continue to overhang the markets, where sellers and
issuers continue to outnumber buyers.
'At the moment it is all about supply,' says Mr Kirit Shah, international
bond strategist at First Chicago. 'Supply from bulls who didn't sell earlier
on, supply from governments and now from emerging economies and corporates
into the economic recovery.'
Although he says bonds are in for a correction, he expects supply pressures
to cap the upside. 'We could have a bounce, but don't expect any firework
rallies,' he warned.
UK gilts fell sharply at the open, pressured by weakness in the US. The
short end of the yield curve came under further pressure from Wednesday's
statements by Bank of England governor Mr Eddie George, which were seen to
prepare the ground for a pre-emptive interest-rate increase.
The long end of the yield curve outperformed the short end on hopes that
tight monetary policy would curb future inflation, but weakened on the day.
The 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 fell by  27/32 to 102 1/4 .
This dampened expectations that the Bank of England today will announce an
ultra-long-dated gilt auction, a hope which has buzzed around the market in
recent days.
'Today's sell-off makes it less likely they'll fund at the long end,' said
Mr Ifty Islam, fixed income strategist at Merrill Lynch, who says another
floating-rate issue is possible.
German bunds fell to a new low in the futures market, but recouped most of
the losses in late short-covering to end only slightly lower. However, the
mood remains fragile and dealers expect further volatility.
French bonds fell sharply, causing the 10-year French yield spread over
German bonds to jump to 53 basis points, from 43 basis points on Wednesday.
The Bank of France's latest 10 basis point cut in its intervention rate to
5.2 per cent lent little support, having been widely expected. Meanwhile,
although the Treasury's latest auction of two and five-year notes went
relatively smoothly, much of it was seen to have ended on traders' books.
Southern European markets were again badly hit by budget worries in Italy,
political jitters in Spain and a Portuguese bond auction where the average
yield soared by 125 basis points from the previous auction in late May.
The US Treasury bond market, focusing on a weaker tone in commodities,
rebounded yesterday despite mostly unfavourable economic news.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/4 ahead at
86 5/16 , with the yield slipping to 7.365 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was  1/16 better at 100 1/8 , to yield 5.787 per cent.
With the market reeling from a sharp rise in the price of crude oil and
other commodities the previous afternoon, traders were greeted yesterday
morning by fresh signs of economic acceleration.
The Commerce Department reported that housing starts last month had risen
2.6 per cent, a big surprise for a market expecting a 0.8 per cent decline.
The data suggested the recent tightening of monetary policy has so far
failed to constrain the rate-sensitive construction industry.
The impression of robust growth was reinforced by the weekly report on
initial claims for unemployment benefit, which provides the most up to date
snapshot of the economy's overall health. Yesterday, it showed 11,000 fewer
people had made claims last week than during the previous seven days.
While the two reports were not especially important by themselves, they did
nothing to dispel the sense of confusion reigning in the debt markets.
Recent data, taken as a whole, has not painted a convincing picture, either
favourable or unfavourable, to lead bonds out of their current trading
range.
The same was true of the monthly survey of business conditions issued by the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia later in the morning. But the mixed
signals it conveyed were at least enough to trigger a reversal in the
market's decline, especially with analysts looking for even stronger numbers
out of Philadelphia.
By early afternoon, bonds had retraced all of their earlier losses and moved
into positive territory as commodity prices began to drift lower on the
heels of Wednesday's sharp rise.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: An unsentimental view of Hong
Kong's future - Wheelock's Mr Woo has a clear view on the way the colony is
to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man whose personal wealth has fallen in value by almost USDollars 1bn
this year, Mr Peter Woo, chairman of Wheelock, the large Hong-Kong based
conglomerate, is remarkably confident.
'It's all paper stuff,' he says. 'You can't look at the share market and
say: 'this is reality'. It's your businesses, it's your networking, it's
your markets: these can't be simply reflected on any one day in terms of
what the market perceives.'
Mr Woo's insouciance in the face of a near 30 per cent fall in the Hong Kong
stock market since the beginning of this year (and a 22.5 per cent fall in
the price of shares in Wheelock) may be in part due to his ownership of
almost 60 per cent of the company leaving him feeling impervious to hostile
takeovers.
But the language he uses to display his lack of concern underlines an
attitude to business which Asian businessmen such as Mr Woo, moving between
the Chinese and the Anglo-Saxon worlds, are beginning to exemplify.
Sporting a Columbia University MBA, Mr Woo, 49, is as comfortable with the
latest western management concepts and practices as he is with the
observance of traditional Confucian values.
He is a one of the handful of businessmen in Hong Kong whose commitment to
the colony after its reversion to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 is crucial to
its long-term success. His group, which has a combined market value of more
than HKDollars 100bn (USDollars 12.9bn), not only owns some of the enduring
symbols of Hong Kong - such as the Star Ferry, and the Peak Tram - but is a
large developer of residential and commercial property and has sizeable
interests in the colony's infrastructure and container port.
Last month Wheelock made its a first step into the financial services
industry by announcing a USDollars 100m joint venture with National
Westminster Bank of the UK, to form Wheelock NatWest, a merchant bank.
Two months earlier Wheelock teamed-up with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group
to bring Virgin's music stores to Hong Kong and China, swapping its control
of retail shopping space for Virgin's flare in mass marketing music.
Both the NatWest and Virgin tie-ups fit neatly into Mr Woo's strategy for
Wheelock: that it should link up with foreign companies which have expertise
or products it lacks. But both deals look small compared with the main
challenge Mr Woo has set himself - to establish a substantial presence on
the China mainland.
Two years ago Mr Woo caught investors' attention when he sketched an idea of
how to exploit the position of Wuhan, the capital of Hebei province situated
on the Yangtze river.
His idea was to build a big container port on the river, with road and rail
links to Shanghai and Hong Kong, and industrial and commercial parks.
Ever since the late 19th century Wuhan has been touted as the Chicago of
China. Like much of China, then and now, the city was seen to have enormous
potential. But Mr Woo is finding some difficulties with his vision. Although
a number of feasibility studies have been finished, his grand design for
Wuhan has progressed at a slower pace than he would have liked.
'They (China's central government) have resource limitations themselves. In
terms of their own development plans they have their own priorities and
developing Wuhan was not in their five-year plan,' he says.
'If there is no outside party from Hong Kong to kick-start these projects
then they will take much longer to happen,' he says. 'Bureaucratic politics
is extremely intense between cities and provinces, ministries, and across
ministries. It's almost like if the idea is from another bureaucracy it must
be a bad idea to start off with. So they're usually not very receptive to
somebody else's idea, but if it's from the outside then at least you can get
to talk about it.'
Mr Woo says it is the quality of the proposal which determines success or
failure. 'I think one should be clear that legitimate business is done
whereby your deal and proposal stands on its own. I mean, you might have one
or two small deals where people allow you to do things, but you cannot look
at that as a way of business.'
Any conversation with a Hong Kong tycoon invariably leads to the colony's
future and the Sino-British row over its political development. While most
of his peers shy away from comment, Mr Woo does not. His reaction to the row
is practical and undramatic.
'There was an idea about how nice it would be to pass through 1997 without
any changes. Well that's not going to happen, something seems to have gone
wrong. Is this something we can live with, or is it something which suggests
the sky is going to fall in? Well, evidence of the sky falling in is not
very strong. We have a large engagement here and we must look ahead, we must
look through this.'
Mr Woo thinks Britain is wasting its time fighting with China so close to
the change in sovereignty. 'I believe they (the Chinese) are sincere about
civil rights, but they will not allow political rights whereby one political
party can get 31 seats to control Hong Kong's legislature,' he says.
The greater right for Hong Kong's 6m people is not elective democracy but
the freedom to leave the colony when they want. 'Article 31 of the Basic Law
(China's constitution for Hong Kong) says that everyone in Hong Kong has
freedom of movement. That is a very important policy. If you take that
clause away no matter if you have democracy here or not it will not work.'
Mr Woo also has an unsentimental view of Hong Kong's future. For him there
is only one way for colonial Hong Kong to survive. 'We have to make sure
that we enhance our own value and we have to do it in a way that is not very
threatening to anybody who works with us. It is the enhancement of our value
that will put us in a good position to extend the lease for another 50
years.'

<TEXT>
Fokus Eiendom, the property arm of Fokus Bank, Norway's third-largest
commercial bank, is to be investigated following alleged irregularities
connected with property dispos-als.
The transaction has already forced the resignation of Mr Leif Klevan, the
bank's managing director and chairman of Fokus Eiendom. Mr Stein Oeverland,
Fokus Eiendom's chief executive, is expected to shortly step down.
Under Mr Klevan and Mr Oeverland, Fokus carried out 250 property disposals
with an estimated value of NKr1bn (Dollars 138.8m), since January 1992,
including the alleged sale of a stake in a shopping centre.
Norway's banking, insurance and securities commission, the finance industry
watchdog, has launched an investigation into Fokus and its property arm.
Fokus Bank itself plans an internal audit of the property unit. The bank
said the purpose of its investigation was to 'uncover eventual
irregularities of transactions and to evaluate Fokus Eiendom's routines for
the purchase and sale of property'.
The group is to submit its findings on June 27. The final report will be
handed to the board in August.

The Trade Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog, expects to
'look very closely' at the ADollars 500m (USDollars 365m) break-up bid
launched on Wednesday for Foodland Associated, the Perth-based retail and
wholesale group.
The bidder, Rank Commercial, a privately-owned New Zealand company, intends
to divide and sell on Foodland's assets if the offer gains 75 per cent
acceptance.
Its NZ interests would be sold to Whitcoulls, a stationery and bookshop
group, while its Australian assets would pass to Coles Myer, one of
Australia's biggest retailers.
Mr Alan Fels, TPC chairman, said a major area of concern was that Coles
might find it easier to raise prices if it took control of Foodland's
Australian assets. It would move to a very strong position in West
Australian grocery retailing and already has non-controlling interests in
independent wholesalers in other states.
However, the bidding group, which met TPC officials yesterday, said it had
no reason to think the commission would block the bid, which is being
contested by Foodland.
TPC concerns, meanwhile, failed to halt a 76 cent rise in the Foodland share
price, to ADollars 5.51 - well in excess of the ADollars 5.27 a share bid
price.
Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, has filed its
defence documents in the ADollars 4bn environmental lawsuit brought against
it by some 6,000 villagers living around the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua
New Guinea, which BHP manages. It said its defence overall did not vary from
its previous position; that Ok Tedi operates in compliance with PNG law and
with the support of its government.
Foster's Brewing, the Australian brewer, has extended its licensed
production and distribution agreement with Germany's Holsten Breweries to a
national basis. It claimed the arrangements should allow it to become the
top-selling foreign beer in Germany. It is currently in the number two spot.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley banks on new
blood infusion - The firm is pursuing an ambitious hiring plan despite the
downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley, like other big securities firms on Wall Street, is not
having a particularly great 1994, at least when compared with the industry's
record-breaking results of last year.
In the February-to-April reporting period, its profits fell 41 per cent to
Dollars 199m as global financial markets were made suddenly unfavourable by
an unexpected surge in US interest rates early in the year.
Unlike every other firm on Wall Street, however, Morgan Stanley is pursuing
an ambitious hiring strategy, in spite of the disturbing downturn in
business.
Last year, its payroll jumped by 11 per cent to 8,273, and it is expected to
reach 9,300 by the end of this year. A good deal of the hiring has been
concentrated in overseas operations, and in investment banking, where
staffing is due to climb from 800 to 930 before the end of 1994.
The hiring strategy at Morgan Stanley, one of the most aggressive seen on
Wall Street in a long time, is remarkable because it runs counter to
traditional Wall Street thinking, that payrolls should be trimmed, or at
least frozen, when market conditions are unfavourable and profits are
falling.
'We are going to use this difficult period to invest in the business, and
not figure out a way to cut back,' says Mr Dick Fisher, Morgan Stanley
chairman.
The decision to stick with the hiring plan is predicated on two important
assumptions: that the current downturn in market conditions is only
temporary and the best prospects for Wall Street firms lie overseas,
particularly in investment banking.
Although the latter assumption is widely held within the industry, Morgan
Stanley is taking something of a gamble in predicting a recovery in
securities markets. Mr Fisher, admitting that many on Wall Street view the
situation differently, says: 'We think that the current period of correction
is an interruption of a very positive trend, not the end of the cycle.'
While this optimistic view is clearly an important factor behind the hiring
spree, there is another side to the story.
The firm has been bringing in new people to its investment banking division
partly because it needed to fill the holes which opened up when a string of
top bankers followed the former president Mr Robert Greenhill out of the
door last year. He defected to rival securities house Smith Barney Shearson.
The departure of Mr Greenhill - who left Morgan Stanley after 31 years when
he was overtaken by the current president Mr John Mack in the race to
succeed Mr Fisher as chairman when he retires - was a big blow to the firm.
Having made his name during the 1980s as one of the top mergers and
acquisition bankers on Wall Street, Mr Greenhill enjoyed close working
relationships with some of the biggest corporations in the US.
His ties with the entertainment group Viacom, for example, ensured it was
Smith Barney, not Morgan Stanley, which played a pivotal (and highly
lucrative) advisory role in Viacom's Dollars 10bn merger with Paramount
Communications earlier this year.
The impact on the firm of Mr Greenhill's loss last June was exacerbated by
the defection soon after of more than a dozen other Morgan Stanley bankers,
many of whom joined Mr Greenhill at Smith Barney, whose investment banking
unit has begun to gain ground on its rivals.
The defections came at a particularly bad time for Morgan Stanley, because
they fuelled the perception that the firm's investment banking powers, which
have been waning for several years, were in permanent decline.
The firm dominated the rest of Wall Street in the late 1970s and early 1980s
 -consistently ranking first in the industry with a near-20 per cent share
of the US stock and bond underwriting market - but it now sits well back in
the pack, ranking seventh among underwriters last year with a market share
of only 6.4 per cent.
While Mr Fisher insists the loss of Mr Greenhill and others from the
investment banking division was not a serious blow to the firm, he is
unhappy with the steady decline in Morgan Stanley's share of the domestic
underwriting market since the mid-1980s.
'We're not where we want to be and are taking steps to address that,' he
says, steps that have involved reorganising the investment banking
department's top management, and hiring fresh talent in the US and overseas.
The firm's most notable newcomer is the former First Boston and Wasserstein
Perella M&amp;A wizard, Mr Joseph Perella, who arrived at Morgan Stanley last
summer with a fistful of blue-chip corporate clients.
Mr Fisher says the infusion of new investment banking blood has begun to pay
off at home and abroad. 'Five of the six largest equity deals this year have
been lead managed by Morgan Stanley, and we've seen a significant upturn in
European business.'
With people like Mr Perella on board, Mr Fisher is especially bullish about
the firm's M&amp;A business. The current M&amp;A assignment load is, he says, the
heaviest in three-and-a-half years, and he sees great opportunities in
particular sectors, notably healthcare.
'There is absolutely no doubt in our minds that we are in the very early
stages of a major restructuring of healthcare, where you will see very large
transactions.'
Morgan Stanley's chairman, however, is keen to ensure the firm does not
repeat the mistake of the 1980s, when, in its enthusiasm for deal-making, it
neglected the underwriting side of the business.
There is no question that we went through a period from 1986 to 1989 where
we were paying too much attention to strategic work - M&amp;A and that kind of
thing - and not enough attention to (customers') capital needs. We
identified that problem in 1989, and have been correcting it.'
Part of the correction has involved a rapid build-up in derivatives
capabilities, and further expansion into foreign capital markets.
With new offices in Shanghai and Bombay, Mr Fisher says the firm is always
on the lookout for opportunities in emerging markets. 'We are finding,
regularly, locations where we can put in place something more than a
listening post.'
The overseas expansion is paying off: last year just under 50 per cent of
the firm's Dollars 9.2bn in revenues were generated overseas.
If the current rate of growth is continued, with more traders and bankers
hired for non-US operations, it will not be long before more than half of
Morgan Stanley's revenues come from overseas. In an increasingly global
financial world, it appears nothing would please Mr Fisher more.

<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group, has formed an alliance with a group
of leading US software and computer equipment companies to deliver a new
video conferencing network product to business customers.
AT&amp;T said its WorldWorx Solutions product would allow business users
worldwide to see and work with each other on their desktop computers while
sharing files and data.
The group said the companies - IBM, Apple Computer, Lotus Development,
Novell, Xerox, Sun Microsystems, PictureTel and VideoServer - had agreed to
allow WorldWorx users to make conferencing calls on their equipment.
Video conferencing is one of the fastest-growing areas of the
business-to-business telecommunications market, and international companies
are competing to provide users with products that incorporate the latest in
communications and computer technology.
The product is a development of a service launched last year that allowed
video and data calls from one desktop unit to another, but not among people
with equipment from different computer, software and camera vendors.
Mr Alex Mandl, chief executive of AT&amp;T communications services, said
customers liked the original video conferencing product, but wanted to be
able to call more than one person without worrying about compatible
hardware. Explaining how the WorldWorx Solutions works for those using the
video conference network, Mr Mandl said: 'During a conversation, I can call
up a file on my desktop computer, show it to several colleagues, allow them
to edit it if I want to, and then just click on a single button to give them
the file.'

Citibank, part of the US banking group, is the first foreign bank to apply
for a licence to operate as a full-service financial institution in Mexico.
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, ratified last year, US banks
are permitted to carry out a wide range of activities in Mexico under the
auspices of a locally-incorporated holding company.
Citibank said it had applied to create a holding company in Mexico with
minimum capital of 1bn pesos (Dollars 296m), making it the first foreign
bank to take this step. It plans to develop securities broking and leasing
businesses, as well as a banking operation. Bankers Trust of the US became
the latest in a long line of international banks to open representative
offices in Beijing, writes Tony Walker in Beijing.
A bank representative said the new office move represented Bankers Trust's
commitment to China and to Asia.

Clinical trials results for Antril, a US septic shock drug, say it is
effective in many cases, contradicting evidence published last year which
led to a collapse in the share price of its Colorado manufacturer Synergen.
The research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
says Antril helps very ill patients live longer.
The company's market capitalisation fell from Dollars 1.5bn to less than
Dollars 400m on the news early last year.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kavner leaves AT&amp;T for CAA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Kavner, head of multimedia products and services at AT&amp;T, has left
the US telecommunications group to join Creative Artists Agency, Hollywood's
top talent agency.
The hiring of Mr Kavner is a significant coup for CAA and a big loss to
AT&amp;T. A former chief financial officer of the telecommunications group, Mr
Kavner was a key figure in the merger of AT&amp;T's computer operations with the
computer group NCR in 1991-1992, and in the recent forging of several
alliances between AT&amp;T and US multimedia companies.
His knowledge of the computer and telecommunications industries is such that
he was on the shortlist last year to replace Mr John Akers as chairman of
IBM.
After being appointed head of AT&amp;T's multimedia products and services
division last summer, 51-year-old Mr Kavner became one of the group's top
four executives. He had responsibility for employing AT&amp;T's
telecommunications and computer expertise to spearhead a push into the
interactive multimedia business.
CAA said that Mr Kavner would 'lead in the identification and development of
opportunities for the agency's clients in the merging digital, interactive
and networked media'.
Mr Kavner's move to CAA is the latest sign of how the efforts of US
companies to exploit the development of the so-called 'information
super-highway' is blurring the lines between the entertainment,
communications and computer technology industries.
It is also evidence of the growing power of CAA, which, under the leadership
of chairman Mr Michael Ovitz, has been building a presence in other fields
related to the entertainment business.

BlackRock

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PNC, the Pittsburgh-based institution which is already the biggest bank in
the US mutual fund business, is to acquire BlackRock Financial Management in
a deal which brings it Dollars 23bn in assets under management.
The bank has agreed to pay Dollars 240m in cash and notes for BlackRock,
which was launched only six years ago with backing from Blackstone, a
venture capital group.
The firm, which manages fixed income investments, handles more than Dollars
10bn for mutual funds, according to Mr Dick Caldwell, a PNC executive
vice-president.
These mutual funds are underwritten and distributed by other firms, such as
brokers, rather than by BlackRock itself.
The balance of BlackRock's investments are managed for insurance companies,
pension funds and other institutions.
The acquisition will leave PNC with around Dollars 75bn under management,
making it one of the biggest fund managers among US banks, although it will
still be behind big institutional fund managers such as JP Morgan and
Bankers Trust.
Another Pittsburgh bank, Mellon, is in the process of acquiring the Dreyfus
mutual funds group in a deal which would put it head and shoulders above
other banks in this aspect of the investment management business.
Dreyfus has more than Dollars 70bn under management, while PNC currently
manages Dollars 20bn of mutual fund money, virtually all of it in
money-market funds.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Solid gain at Enso-Gutzeit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enso-Gutzeit, the Finnish pulp and paper group, saw profits after financial
items reach FM365m (Dollars 66.4m) in the first four months, a sharp rise
from last time's FM86m.
The group benefited from higher pulp and sawn-goods prices, as well as
foreign exchange gains and lower financial costs.
The upturn would have been stronger, but for a 7 per cent appreciation in
the value of the markka and higher depreciation costs.
Markka prices for fine paper, newsprint and coated magazine paper were also
lower than a year ago.
The group remains optimistic about prospects because of strengthening prices
for most pulp and paper products and rising capacity utilis-ation.
Mr Jukka Harmala, chief executive, said 1994 figures should show a 'clear
improvement' on last year's FM385m profit, 'provided there are no unexpected
turns in external factors'.
The figures are further evidence of a broad recovery in the Nordic pulp and
paper sector.
Sales rose 19 per cent, to FM5.5bn from FM4.6bn, mainly because of last
year's purchase of forestry and board operations from Tampella. However,
operating profits rose only 5.6 per cent, to FM701m from FM664m, due to the
stronger markka, falling prices, and higher depreciation.
Lower interest rates and the healthier markka reduced financial costs to
FM374m from FM508m.
There was also a foreign currency gain of FM38m, after a FM70m loss last
year.
Meanwhile, Enso said it had tightened its grip on Berghuizer Papierfabriek,
its struggling Dutch paper subsidiary, following a public offering for the
outstanding shares in the company. Enso's stake has risen to 77.1 per cent
from 57.8 per cent. The offer will be extended.
Berghuizer specialises in high-quality copying and writing papers, in a
highly-competitive market.
Last year, it suffered a Fl 14.8m loss on sales of Fl 194.8m. Its
performance is not expected to improve this year.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: SKF upgrades profits forecast
for full year

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKF, the world's leading maker of roller bearings, sharply upgraded its 1994
profit forecast yesterday, citing stronger-than-expected growth in volumes
in its main European markets.
The group expects profits of SKr1.5bn (Dollars 190m) this year, compared
with an April forecast of SKr1bn. This would be its best result since 1990,
and follows a SKr1.8bn loss in 1992 and a SKr669m deficit last year.
SKF said a recovery was under way in all its European markets, particularly
in the automotive industry, its most important customer base. 'It is
probable that the favourable market trend will continue during the remainder
of the year,' it said.
Europe accounts for 60 per cent of group sales. 'There is a strong recovery
under way in Scandinavia, the UK and Italy. But we can also see that the
German market is levelling out and starting to improve,' the group said. It
said there was particularly strong growth in demand from truckmakers.
The company is also benefiting from a solid upturn in the US market, where
profits have increased every quarter for the past two years. The US is the
group's largest single market with 25 per cent of sales.
'We are taking market share,' the group said, although it declined to be
specific. Its share of the world market, excluding China and former Comecon
countries, is around 20 per cent, twice its nearest competitor.
SKF made a SKr306m profit in the first quarter of 1994, after losses of
SKr355m in the same 1993 period. Sales climbed 12 per cent to SKr8.05bn. The
recovery has been helped by extensive cost-cutting - which has led to the
loss of 15,000 jobs over four years - and currency factors.
The company's B shares yesterday rose SKr1 to SKr139, against a downward
market trend.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Celsius buys information
technology business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Celsius, the Swedish defence group privatised last year, said yesterday it
was buying the information technology concern, Dialog, for up to SKr480m
(Dollars 60.8m).
The purchase will broaden the group's range of consulting and technical
services and enable it to offer software development and computer operations
expertise to military and civilian customers.
Dialog has 2,000 employees and an annual turnover of SKr1.8bn. This will
lift Celsius's information technology sales to SKr6bn, and bring total group
sales up to SKr15bn.
Mr Ake Plyhm, Celsius president, said Dialog's customer profile, based
around municipal authorities and large companies, fitted well with Celsius's
other IT operations.
Two previous acquisitions, Telub and CelsiusTech, have given the group a
strong position in the military information technology sector. However, it
has also expanded into the civilian sector with Telub's purchase of the
Swedish telecom company, Dotcom, and Celsius's acquisition of the voting
majority in Enator, a firm of IT consultants.
Celsius will initially pay SKr385m for Dialog, and up to SKr95m more under
an earnings-related formula.
It is buying the company from the Swedish Association of Local Authorities.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state-owned French bank, yesterday became the
latest foreign institution to announce plans for expansion in its investment
banking business in the US.
Meanwhile, CS First Boston, the investment banking subsidiary of CS
Holdings, signalled a step in the opposite direction, with a move into
arranging loans for US companies.
Credit Lyonnais' reputation in the US has been damaged by its involvement
with MGM, the film studio it has owned since it foreclosed on a loan to
Giancarlo Parretti.
Mr Robert Cohen, the bank's chief executive in the US, said that business
had been handled through the bank's Dutch operations, rather than its US
bank.
He indicated the US operations had been one of the most profitable parts of
the group, making after-tax profits of Dollars 170m last year, equivalent to
a return on capital of 24 per cent.
Credit Lyonnais has grown to be one of the biggest foreign-owned commercial
banking operations in the US in recent years, with Dollars 10.5bn in
commercial and industrial loans and a staff of 700, up from 400 five years
ago. Mr Cohen indicated that the bank intended to expand its 100-strong
investment banking business at the same rate of about 60 people a year,
mainly on the fixed-income side.
The bank plans to sell European and US government bonds in the US, and to
underwrite debt issues for both European and US companies, he added.
Credit Lyonnais' fast loan growth echoes that of other foreign banks in the
US.
According to a study released last week by the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, foreign banks accounted for around 47 per cent of all
commercial and industrial loans in the third quarter of 1992, double the
level of 10 years before.
CS First Boston said it had hired Mr Robert O'Brien, a former managing
director of Chemical Bank - one of the leaders in the syndi-cated loans
market - to arrange loans for existing customers.
The move, unusual among investment banks, is the reverse of steps taken by
US commercial banks to extend into the bond markets.
Loans originated by CS First Boston will be booked by Credit Suisse, the
banking arm of CS Holdings.

<TEXT>
Lotus Development Corporation, the Massachusetts software company, is buying
Softswitch, a privately-held company based in Pennsylvania, for about 1.3m
Lotus shares. The deal values Softswitch at just over Dollars 70m.
Softswitch supplies electronic mail message switches that create links
between electronic mail systems from different manufacturers. Mr Michael
Zisman, Softswitch president, will become vice-president of a new Lotus
business group, Inter-Enterprise Computing.
The group will bring together Softswitch and a venture involving AT&amp;T called
Network Notes, headed by Mr Larry Moore, vice-president of Lotus
Telecommunications Services.
Lotus, one of the largest US software houses, rose to prominence through the
success of its integrated spreadsheet, 1-2-3.
More recently, it has achieved significant sales for Lotus Notes, a
groupware product which integrates messaging, forms-generation and document
flow in large networked environments.
Among the organisations using Notes is Andersen Consulting, a leading
information technology consultancy. Lotus' marketing alliance with AT&amp;T is
designed to broaden Notes appeal to large companies.
Mr James Cosgrove, head of AT&amp;T's data communications services division,
said recently inter-company networking and data-sharing were two of the
principal trends driving rapid progress in computer net-working.

<TEXT>
VNU, the Dutch publisher, yesterday expressed interest in buying parts of
Ziff Communications, the US-based publishing group put up for sale last
week. However, it ruled out an outright bid.
The Dutch publisher emphasised it was not actively looking at Ziff. 'We have
had no contact with them whatsoever, and they haven't had any with us,' a
spokesman said.
Ziff, which is expected to be sold for between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn,
was too big an acquisition for VNU to contemplate, he said.
Reed-Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group with the resources to make
takeovers on this scale, refused to make any comment on whether it was
considering a bid.
Ziff, the world's largest publisher of computer magazines, was put up for
sale by the Ziff family last week.
There has been speculation on possible bidders among the world's publishing
groups, but no company has yet publicly expressed an interest in buying the
privately-held group.
Like Ziff, VNU is active in computer magazines, particularly in the UK and
continental Europe. It is also active in consumer and trade magazines,
regional newspapers and commercial television.
VNU carried out a share issue earlier this year to finance the acquisition
of BPI Communications of the US, whose titles include the newspaper
Hollywood Reporter and Billboard magazine.

<TEXT>
International Business Machines has formed a division to create services for
the information superhighway. These will include applications ranging from
interactive television to personal communications messaging systems.
Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive, has identified
network-centric applications as one of the most important strategic growth
markets for IBM. The formation of the Networked Application Services
division, reflects IBM's determination to play a leadership role in this
emerging field.
Initially, the new division will develop services that will become available
on Prodigy, a personal computer dial-up information and communications
service jointly owned by IBM and Sears Roebuck, on Advantis, a data
communications network jointly owned with Sears, and on IBM Networks
worldwide.
IBM was making large investments in developing these technologies, it said.
The new division, which IBM viewed as a start-up venture with large growth
potential, would have several hundred employees and operate worldwide.
The market for digital network services for businesses, governments,
individuals and the home would grow as the power of digital communication
wire, wireless and satellite expanded, IBM said.
Networked Application Services would develop software to provide intelligent
communications capabilities on digital networks.
The division draws together several developments under way in different
parts of IBM and partnerships that IBM has formed.
IBM, for example, is providing equipment and software for interactive
television trials with Videotron and Cox Cable.
The creation of software for personal communications services will be one of
the initial focuses of the new division. These services will enable users
to, for example, receive messages in different forms - voice, facsimile or
electronic mail - no matter how they were sent and will prioritise messages
according to the needs of the individual user.
Collaborative computing, in which PC users work together via a network, will
be another important application. Electronic publishing and electronic
commerce are seen as markets with large growth potential.
The mission of the new IBM division was 'to create services that will be the
foundation for a highly interconnected world', the company said.
As well as developing broad service offerings, IBM plans to tailor services
for specific industries and types of businesses.
Networked Application Services will have its headquarters in Thornwood, New
York, with other locations in New York, Florida and California.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Basque co-op changes its culture
 -Mondragon is preparing to tap financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Basque country's co-operative movement, centred on the town of
Mondragon, is preparing to tap the international financial markets, marking
a change to its 40-year-old history of worker-ownership.
'We are talking about a new culture for us,' said Mr Miguel Angel Laspiur,
chief financial officer of Mondragon Corporacion Cooperativa (MCC), the
corporate umbrella of 102 individual co-operatives which has assets of
Pta991bn (Dollars 7.2bn) and posted combined sales of Pta424bn last year.
Mr Laspiur plans to create a financial holding company later this year,
funded principally by foreign institutions, that will invest in some
existing MCC co-operative units, such as Fagor Ederlan, the car component
producer, and provide additional capital for new ventures.
These will be set up as limited companies, as opposed to co-operatives owned
by their employees, and will be controlled by MCC.
'We are not talking big figures (for the holding company) right now and will
only be seeking Pta10bn-Pta15bn but this is just the begining and the
numbers could multiply fast,' said Mr Laspiur.
The development, which bears comparisons with the 1989 conversion and
flotation of the UK's Abbey National building society and with the venture
capital attracted by Australia's Westralian Farmers Co-operative, has
attracted considerable interest.
Mr Javier Salaverri, managing director in Spain of Schroders, the UK
merchant bank, says the offer was 'a very exciting prospect and very
sensible move by MCC which will enable it to compete for capital'.
Mr Santiago Eguidazu, head of corporate finance at the Madrid securities
firm AB Asesores agrees: 'The Mondragon group is a great generator of
industrial initiatives and it has long proved itself to be a high-quality
industrial manager,' he says.
Mr Laspiur concedes that it may be difficult to bring in the funds.
'There is no precedent for an industrial corporation of our size, which is
owned by co-operatives and run from the bottom up, going to the markets and
there could be problems in explaining what Mondragon is all about.'
The most visible aspect of Mondragon is the output of machine tools, car
components and electrical white household goods of its industrial division
which had combined export sales of Pta61.8bn last year, 35 per cent of total
sales and 19 per cent up on the 1992 export figure.
In spite of the recession, MCC posted good results last year with pre-tax
profits of Pta28.9bn, a 28 per cent increase on 1992, and it expects to lift
this year's gross income by a further 15 per cent to 33.5bn on sales of
about Pta500bn.
MCC has benefited from diversification into three broad divisions:
industrial production, distribution and finance and financial services.
The strong export business generated by the corporation's car component
manufacturing units helped to raise the industrial division's earnings and
offset dampened results posted by the co-operatives dedicated to
manufacturing capital goods, machine tools and electronic products.
Increased profits in the financial division meanwhile helped to finance
investments totalling Pta33bn last year in MCC's spreading network of
hypermarkets.
There could be a problem explaining the capital markets to MCC's 25,000
employees who, as owners of the co-operatives, control the corporate
decision making through elected councils and are intensely proud of their
industrial democracy.
The less visible part of Mondragon is the close-knit manner in which the
co-operatives have organised themselves into a cradle-to-grave welfare
society hidden away among the narrow, lushly green and wooded valleys of the
Basque Country.
It was founded by a far-seeing local priest, Fr Jose Mara Arrizmendiarrieta,
in 1956. The Mondragon co-operative movement, as it was originally known,
has grown into a worker-ownership empire that embraces a large technical
school, a highly-regarded applied research centre and a financial division
built around its own savings bank and its healthcare, life insurance and
pensions group.
In a research paper for Bristol University, sociologist Dr Martin Fairclough
noted that Mondragon has been 'like a shrine and a wholly writ' for
co-operative undertakings elsewhere in the world.
The chief executives of MCC, such as Mr Laspiur, who are elected by their
fellow employees, are confident they will win round their colleagues and the
fund managers.
Outside capital will soon be urgently required because the growth of the
corporation, particularly in the distribution sector where it has ambitious
shopping centre projects, can no longer be self-financed in a satisfactory
way.
A degree of degeneration from the worker-owner and industrial democracy
ideal has taken place. MCC has since 1991 been buying local engineering
companies and turning them round into profitability although not into
co-operatives.
In an even more drastic departure from its traditional approach to business,
MCC is planning to open a white electrical goods plant outside Casablanca in
a joint venture with a Moroccan investment group.
'Just like the Swedish multinational Electrolux came south and set up shop
on Spain, we're going south into Morocco,' said Mr Laspiur. One difference
is that MCC's Mr Laspiur, as a member of a co-operative organisation, earns
at best 55 per cent of the salary that the chief finance officer of a rival
multinational might command.
Mr Laspiur and his fellow senior executives want to keep it that way and
they believe that tapping the markets will not change the essential ethos of
the Mondragon group.
However, some international fund managers might be surprised to hear Mr
Laspiur admitting that he and his fellow top worker-owners are 'a bit like
monks'.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Packaging groups to merge health
interests
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CarnaudMetalbox, the Franco-British packaging group, is merging its health
and beauty packaging interests with those of Wheaton, the privately-owned US
packaging concern, to create the largest force in that area of the
international packaging industry.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, chairman of CarnaudMetalbox, said Wheaton International,
the newly-merged company, would be world leader in the profitable health and
beauty packaging business with a 5 per cent market share on annualised sales
of FFr5.1bn (Dollars 895m).
'We'll be the only company in that market with the capacity to launch
products simultaneously all over the world,' he added.
The merger reflects the consolidation among the cosmetic, perfume and
pharmaceutical companies that are the customers of CarnaudMetalbox and
Wheaton's health and beauty packaging interests. These areas of the
packaging market have shown strong growth in recent years thanks partly to
the trend towards more elaborate packaging, particularly in the beauty
sector.
CarnaudMetalbox and Wheaton, which respectively command annualised sales of
FFr2.5bn and FFr2.6bn in the businesses that will be pooled to create
Wheaton International, share some multinational clients such as France's
L'Oreal, Procter &amp; Gamble of the US and the Anglo-Dutch Unilever.
However, Mr Arnaud Fayet, director of CarnaudMetalbox, stressed the two
companies were 'very complementary in terms of regional spread and product
specialisations'. CarnaudMetalbox, he said, was strongest in Europe and in
cosmetics packaging with Wheaton's strength lying in North America and the
pharmaceuticals field.
The ownership of Wheaton International will be evenly split between
CarnaudMetalbox and its US partner.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: CS chief dampens fear over
Creditanstalt bid
</HEADLINE>

   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rainer Gut, the chairman of CS Holdings, yesterday said Creditanstalt
would remain 'a proud and independent Austrian bank with its own identity'
if CS succeeded in winning control of the bank.
Mr Gut said he was well aware of political opposition to the efforts of the
Swiss banking group to take control of Creditanstalt, Austria's banking
flagship. He felt CS had an even chance of winning control against
competition from a rival Austrian-led consortium.
Mr Gut said he would prefer to buy all the government's 49 per cent stake
but would be content with a smaller stake in the short term. He declined to
disclose his offer price.
Based on Creditanstalt's share price, the government stake is worth about
Sch14bn (Dollars 1.2bn). Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the Austrian finance minister,
has said his decision would not be based on price but on national interest
and the interests of Creditanstalt.
Mr Gut was in Vienna to meet Mr Lacina, who wants to privatise Creditanstalt
quickly and encourage public support for his offer.
His earlier announcement that CS was aiming for a 100 per cent control of
Creditanstalt has aroused controversy in Austria. This led to the formation
of the rival bid.

Saint-Gobain, the French glass and building materials group, expects to
achieve a large increase in net profits during the first half of this year,
according to Mr Jean Louis Beffa, chairman.
Mr Beffa, speaking at the group's annual general meeting in Paris, said the
pick-up in activity which started during the final quarter of 1993 had
continued in 1994.
Saint-Gobain last year suffered a sharp fall in interim profits to FFr452m
(Dollars 79.3m) from FFr1.4bn during the same period of the previous year.

FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hasbro hit by revenue warning
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Hasbro lost nearly 10 per cent of their value yesterday after the
world's largest toy maker warned that it may only break even in the second
quarter.
The group, perhaps best known for its Barney, Batman and Jurassic Park
licensed products, told investors that revenues in the three months to the
end of June could fall 15 per cent short of the level reached in the
corresponding period of 1993. The revenue decline 'could all but eliminate'
earnings in the current quarter, it said.
A year ago, Hasbro posted net income of Dollars 27.1m, or 30 cents a share,
on sales of Dollars 515m.
The warning surprised Wall Street. The stock finished down Dollars 3 at
Dollars 28 1/2 on heavy volume of 3.6m shares on the American Stock
Exchange.
The company said the unfavourable year-on-year comparisons were largely a
matter of timing, and did not reflect any fundamental operational
difficulties. The introduction of the popular Barney and Jurassic Park lines
in the 1993 quarter had helped Hasbro achieve a record quarter last year. In
1994, new products were scheduled to be launched later in the year.

<TEXT>
International Business Machines has formed a division to create services for
the information superhighway. These will include applications ranging from
interactive television to personal communications messaging systems.
Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive, has identified
network-centric applications as an important growth market for IBM. The
formation of the Networked Application Services division, reflects IBM's
determination to play a leadership role in this emerging field.
Initially, the new division will develop services that will become available
on Prodigy, a personal computer dial-up information and communications
service jointly owned by IBM and Sears Roebuck, on Advantis, a data
communications network jointly owned with Sears, and on IBM Networks
worldwide.
IBM was making large investments in developing these technologies, it said.
The new division, which IBM viewed as a start-up venture with large growth
potential, would have several hundred employees and operate worldwide.
The market for digital network services for businesses, governments,
individuals and the home would grow as the power of digital communication
wire, wireless and satellite expanded, IBM said.

The division draws together several developments under way in different

IBM, for example, is providing equipment and software for interactive

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Penna Pounds 309,000 in red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Penna, the USM-quoted holding company for the Sanders &amp; Sidney outplacement
consultancy, blamed strong competition in a less active market for a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 309,000 for the year to March 31. This compared with a Pounds
1.94m profit.
Turnover dropped from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 8.02m.
The company also announced its first strategic acquisition outside its core
outplacement activity, with the purchase of GHN, a specialist in career
management for senior executives. Consideration is Pounds 385,000 cash and
656,250 new shares.
At December 1993, GHN's net assets totalled Pounds 267,000 and it reported
annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 102,000.
Mr John Beard, chief executive, said that with the GHN acquisition 'we will
begin to implement our declared strategy of broadening the earnings base of
the group through expansion into related sectors'.
He said that although the loss was 'clearly disappointing', the Sanders &amp;
Sidney business remained a strong cash generator. Cash in the year-end
balance sheet was Pounds 904,000.
Losses per share were 4.8p (26.4p earnings). The recommended final dividend
is 3p, making a total of 4p (10p) for the year.
The shares fell 5p to 103p yesterday.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chloride returns to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chloride Group, which is transforming itself from a batteries business into
an electronics group, returned to the black for the year ended March 31, but
profits were not high enough to restore the dividend.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.21m on total turnover of Pounds 101.4m,
compared with a Pounds 1.58m loss last time on sales of Pounds 100.2m.
After tax and the preference dividend losses per share were reduced from 2p
to 0.5p.
Mr Keith Hodgkinson, chief executive, described the results as a
'significant improvement'. The profit was struck after a loss of Pounds 1.7m
on the disposal of battery businesses in Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana
and Malawi.
Operating profits on continuing operations were Pounds 2.8m on turnover of
Pounds 89.5m, compared with a previous loss of Pounds 1m on turnover of
Pounds 86m. Operating profits, including discontinued operations, were
Pounds 3.39m (Pounds 869,000).
The electronics division made a profit of Pounds 1.69m (Pounds 2.26m loss)
on sales of Pounds 78m (Pounds 74m). The division - comprising
uninterruptible power supplies for computers, emergency lighting, and power
conversion - was the key to the group's future, Mr Hodgkinson said.
The uninterrupted power supply business performed particularly well, helped
by last year's purchase of Ondyne, a European manufacturer specialising in
the office products sector.
Mr Hodgkinson said the world office uninterrupted power supply market was
growing at more than 10 per cent a year. The group was satisfied with its
progress in electronics, but saw plenty of room for improvement in both
sales and margins.
The continuing battery businesses, comprising a subsidiary company in Egypt
and associated companies in Nigeria and South Africa, made profits of Pounds
1.03m on sales of Pounds 11.5m, slightly below the previous Pounds 1.25m on
Pounds 12.1m. The group is continuing to seek buyers for these businesses.
Mr Hodgkinson said the group wanted to return to the dividend list as soon
as possible, but had to be sure that payments could be sustained.
The group ended the year ungeared, with almost Pounds 1m net cash. This left
it in a strong position to make acquisitions to complement its electronics
side, said Mr Hodgkinson.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Swalec achieves 19% improvement to Pounds
104m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swalec, the south Wales electricity utility, aims to maintain a progressive
dividend policy whatever the outcome of the review of the electricity
distribution business by Prof Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator.
The company said yesterday that the review was widely expected to reduce
profits throughout the electricity sector. But Swalec was confident that its
cost-cutting and diversification policy was correct.
The results of the review are due later this summer, and will set controls
over businesses which account for 80 per cent of regional electricity
company profits.
Swalec reported a 19.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 87m
to Pounds 104m on sales of continuing businesses of Pounds 605m (Pounds
586m).
A 15 per cent rise in the final dividend to 18.1p brings the full year
pay-out to 25.6p (22.3p). Earnings were 73.6p (60p).
Mr Andrew Walker, the new chief executive, said one of the main factors
behind the rise was the cost-cutting drive, which brought costs down 8 per
cent in real terms. This drive would continue into a further phase, he said,
though he declined to give specific numbers for job losses.
The group also received its first returns from new generation projects: a
gas-fired power plant on Teesside and a wind farm in Cumbria.
Profit growth came from the distribution business which raised its
contribution by Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 79.3m. The supply business increased
profits by Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 6.6m. Celtic, the contracting arm,
suffered an operating loss of Pounds 2.2m in a difficult market after
reorganisation costs of Pounds 1.4m.
Swalec also has a 40 per cent interest in CSW, a new cable TV and
telecommunications company, for which an investment of Pounds 30m is
foreseen over the next four years.
The result included a Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 9.1m) dividend from the National
Grid.
Mr Walker said Swalec supported the proposed sale of the National Grid, and
took the view that the shares should be handed straight to the shareholders
of the regional electricity companies.
COMMENT
Swalec is putting a brave face on the distribution review because it is
potentially one of the more exposed recs. With high costs due to the widely
dispersed market it serves, Swalec needs higher rates of return, and it is
up to Prof Littlechild to decide whether these are justified. As it is,
Swalec's electricity prices are already among the highest in the country.
The results were well received in the market, where the shares gained 6p to
635p. With further progress on cost-cutting, and problems on the contracting
side under tighter control, analysts felt Swalec should be making solid
progress. Nonetheless, the shares carry the second highest yield in the
sector - 5.7 per cent - due to the regulatory vulnerability.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bloomsbury Publishing, one of the UK's leading independent book
publishers, have been placed at 105p, giving the eight-year-old company a
market capitalisation of Pounds 9m.
A total of 5.26m shares were placed with institutions by Beeson Gregory at
14 times historic earnings. Dealings in the shares, which will have a full
listing, commence on June 23.
The net proceeds of the placing to the company of Pounds 2.7m will be used
to fund the expansion of the new paperback, children's and home reference
books divisions and to acquire the rights to works of leading authors.
The company also intends to repay Pounds 1.15m of loan stock and about
Pounds 250,000 of accrued dividends and loan stock interest.
Bloomsbury made an operating profit of Pounds 856,000 in the year to
December on turnover of Pounds 8.5m, up 41 per cent and 5.6 per cent
respectively on 1992.
On a notional net dividend of 2.94p last year, the gross dividend yield at
the flotation price was 3.5 per cent.
Following the placing, Mr Nigel Newton, founding chairman and managing
director, will own 9.7 per cent of the ordinary share capital, approximately
90 per cent of his original stake in the company. However, two other
founding directors, Ms Liz Calder and Mr Alan Wherry, are selling virtually
all of their shareholdings.
Bloomsbury's original backers, Caledonia Investments and Legal &amp; General,
will own 14.7 per cent and 5.1 per cent respectively, while Baring
Investment Management will hold 8.2 per cent.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tinsley Robor shows advance to Pounds
450,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tinsley Robor, the printing and packaging company, reported pre-tax profits
up from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 450,000 in the year to March 31. Turnover
rose 7.3 per cent to Pounds 29.5m, compared with Pounds 27.5m.
Mr John Rose, chairman, said the company had made steady progress but the
return on assets was still below the minimum acceptable. Earnings per share
were 1.1p (losses 0.4p). The dividend is passed.
He added that the present year had started in line with expectations of
continued steady improvement. 'I expect that the coming year will provide
the results which will enable our return to the dividend list.'
The pre-tax figure was after charging termination costs of Pounds 218,000
and start-up losses for the new Netherlands plant of Pounds 206,000.
Interest costs fell from Pounds 623,000 to Pounds 494,000.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Clinical trials encourage British Bio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Biotechnology has had further promising results from clinical trials
of its cancer drug Batimastat. The last published results, in March,
provided the basis for a Pounds 90m cash raising exercise by the company.
The number of patients taking Batimastat has increased from 15 to 24. Some
are showing a fall in the amount of a substance in their blood called CA
125, a widely used indicator for the progression of ovarian cancer. The fall
indicates that the disease is retreating.
Analysts at James Capel, the stockbroker, have estimated the potential
market for Batimastat at up to Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn). If clinical trials
go well, the drug should be launched in 1997.
British Biotechnology also said that it had begun work on an oral cancer
drug that works with a similar mechanism to Batimastat, which must be
injected. It also said it was creating a subsidiary to research into
treatments for multiple sclerosis.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Porter Chadburn loss at Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Provisions related to its withdrawal from the unprofitable consumer products
division pushed pre-tax losses up sharply at Porter Chadburn in the year to
April 1.
On sales of Pounds 133m (Pounds 138m), including Pounds 78.9m (Pounds 70.5m)
from continuing operations, the packaging and specialist distribution group
reported a deficit of Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 3.62m).
Mr Pat Barrett, chairman, said the withdrawal from the unprofitable division
was complete. The remaining activities were all profitable and generating
cash.
The operating loss was Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 4.34m). Exceptional charges of
Pounds 14.6m included Pounds 8m of goodwill written back to comply with new
accounting standards.
Bank borrowings at the year end were Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 10.9m) and the
company said they had fallen further in the wake of the disposals. However,
shareholders' funds had declined to Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 19.5m) due to the
high losses and repayment of the preference shares in December and also the
provisions.
In the current year Pounds 2.3m is due in connection with deferred
acquisition payments.
Losses per share grew to 17.48p (4.82p) and there is no final dividend. Last
year there was a 0.4p final out of a total of 1.25p.
Mr Barrett said the American label business had started the year well and in
the UK the specialist distribution division had made a satisfactory start.

Robert H Lowe, the clothing, printing and packaging company, is raising
about Pounds 3m net in a placing and open offer.
It is proposed to use the funds to cut borrowings and provide additional
working capital.
There is a firm placing of 3.25m new ordinary shares with Strand Associates,
an investment company, and of 3.25m with the chairman's family trust, both
at 8p per share to raise Pounds 520,000.
Further, there is to be a placing and open offer of three new ordinary for
every 40 held and 21 new ordinary for every four convertible held to raise a
further Pounds 2.7m before expenses.
There will be a consolidation and sub-division of the existing ordinary
shares with conversion of the existing convertible preference shares into
ordinaries on a seven-for-one basis.
At November 5 last, shareholders' funds were Pounds 402,000 and net
borrowings came out at Pounds 4.4m.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Alvis edges ahead to Pounds 2.24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alvis, the defence contractor, reported increased profits of Pounds 2.24m
pre-tax for the six months to March 31, compared to Pounds 2.19m last time.
The upturn was achieved despite a fall in turnover to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds
45.8m) reflecting, according to Mr John Robertshaw, chairman, reduced order
books at the Alvis Coventry subsidiaries, which manufacture armoured
vehicles.
However, Mr Nick Prest, chief executive, said there were good prospects for
further export and domestic orders in the medium term.
Losses per share were 0.5p (earnings of 0.1p). This primarily resulted from
the sale of military optical equipment subsidiaries to 51 per cent-owned
Avimo Singapore in 1993. The sale allowed the group's optical businesses to
co-operate more fully and released cash which Alvis is using for
acquisitions.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.5p.
In the Avimo Singapore group, Helio, the maker of periscopes, turrets and
other equipment for fighting vehicles performed well, as did Arab
International Optronics, an associate. But contract delays hit the
performance of Avimo Alvis Aerospace, which makes vehicle transmissions, and
Avimo Electro-Optics.
Higher interest income, following the sale to Avimo, was more than offset by
higher interest charges at Alvis Vehicles, where borrowings rose as a result
of the unwinding of customer advance payments on manufacturing contracts.
Unipower, the manufacturer of specialist military vehicles acquired in
February, did not make a material contribution to the figures.
However, Mr Robertshaw said that the earnings benefits of the acquisition
were expected to show through in the next financial year when the British
Army BR90 bridge-builder contract comes on stream.
The shares closed down 7p at 65p.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Southern Water buoyant with 7% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Water was in buoyant mood yesterday as it reported a 7 per cent
increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 127.5m, against Pounds 119.2m,
and gave an encouraging report on the capital intensive coastal clean-up
programme.
Mr Martyn Webster, managing director, said Southern had made excellent
progress in its Operation Seaclean project, in spite of several surprising
and uncontrollable variables: seagulls, for example. 'Two seagulls equals
one human, in terms of the polluting effect,' Mr Webster said.
Southern finished the year to March 31 with sales 9 per cent higher at
Pounds 347.7m (Pounds 319.2m), helped by a strong performance from the
non-regulated businesses.
Mr Webster said the engineering, environmental services, and systems
businesses built up since privatisation 'are more than paying for
themselves'.
At the operating level, and after start-up costs, they increased profits by
20 per cent to Pounds 10.1m, representing almost 8 per cent of group
profits.
Interest gains added a further Pounds 2m to profits, on sales up by 14 per
cent to Pounds 88.1m.
The core utility business returned an 11 per cent increase at the operating
level to Pounds 123.5m.
Mr Webster said costs had risen by less than 4 per cent in the water and
sewerage division. When one-off expenses such as rationalisation and last
winter's flooding were excluded, ongoing costs rose by less than 3 per cent.
Unlike most of Southern's colleagues in the water sector, Mr Webster said
the group expected to increase the number of employees in both regulated and
non-regulated business.
The rapidly expanding non-regulated businesses and the complex capital
spending programme would require new types of skills, he said. However,
Southern remained committed to cutting costs where possible.
The dividend is raised 8.5 per cent to 23.1p (21.3p) with a recommended
final of 15.4p with a scrip alternative.
Earnings, held back by previous scrips, rose just 6 per cent to 70.3p
(66.3p) per share.
COMMENT
Southern was the best performing water stock last year, and yesterday
confirmed that support. Net cash of Pounds 10m and small underlying cost
increases reinforce faith in its cash management. This will be vital in the
forthcoming rigorous price regime, when the group will be expected to cope
with capital investment of between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.5bn. In the end,
everything rests on the spending authorised by Ofwat. Southern's track
record may make it attractive relative to the sector, but water stocks in
general are likely to languish until price uncertainty is cleared up.
Forecasts are for between Pounds 135m and Pounds 140m pre-tax, with an 8 per
cent increase in the dividend to 25p.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel gets a sinking feeling - The
rapidly falling share price is causing concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While an investigation continues into the alleged downward manipulation of
Eurotunnel's share price prior to the pricing of its Pounds 858m rights
issue, market forces have now left the shares at the same depressed level.
With four trading days to go before the issue closes, underwriters remained
optimistic of a strong take-up, but the rapidly sliding share price is
causing concern.
Eurotunnel shares closed yesterday at 303p, only  3/4 p above their low
point for the year, and the take-up of rights shares is likely to fall with
any further drop in the share price.
The manipulation investigation by the French stock exchange authorities was
sparked by suspicions that underwriters may have forced the share price down
before the price was fixed, through short selling, in order to limit their
underwriting risk.
'We have no evidence that links the short selling to any of the
underwriters,' said one of the leading underwriters.
But the underlying assumption behind the manipulation scenario that the
share price would reach a higher equilibrium is proving unfounded, and the
genuine level of market demand remains in doubt.
The small French shareholders will be a core factor in the take-up,
accounting for about 43 per cent of the existing shares. French bankers were
yesterday suggesting that those shareholders who had struggled thus far,
would take up the tunnel's second rights issue since the tunnel is now
opening and the revenues will soon start to flow in.
'In France there will be no problem', says Mr Christian Cambier, the French
head of the association for Eurotunnel shareholders. 'Investors would have
sold out already if they were not going to subscribe, and the price they
have to pay to take up their shares is low.'
This view was, unsurprisingly, echoed by Mr Jean-Michel Plou, first vice
president of Banque Indosuez, which led the underwriting in France.
Nevertheless, brokers said there had been strong selling of both nil paid
and ordinary shares in France, and the risk for the underwriters remains.
Given the amount of small shareholders, who traditionally are more likely
not to take up rights, underwriters expected between 5 and 10 per cent of
shareholders not to take up rights. This would leave a rump of up to 32m new
shares.
But once again, news on the progress of the tunnel has not been favourable
in winning over investors concerned about the risks of its profit
projections.
Stock markets have not significantly improved since the May 26 announcement
of the rights issue, and shareholders are being asked to pay up to
substantially increase their exposure.
For those original shareholders, who took up the 1990 rights issue, the
latest cash call represents 73 per cent of their original investment. This
time round, there are no free travel incentives to encourage take-up.
At the current share price, it seems unlikely that underwriters will be left
with more than the expected 10 per cent, and this rump will be placed out to
institutions.
In the circumstances of a fully sub-underwritten offer, pitched at a
reasonable discount to the current share price, this process would be a
formality.
Institutions who sub-underwrote the issue, would be expected to take up
their share of the placement, rather than be forced to take up under-writing
commitments.
In the case of Eurotunnel, this will not be done with any enthusiasm, and if
the share price falls further, so will the demand.
A leading UK fund manager added: 'It all gets back to who wants to buy the
shares, and my sense is that there is just no institutional support.' Mr
Richard Hannah, analyst at UBS Securities, said: 'I would remain cautious
about the genuine appetite for shares in the market. At the moment trading
is in the hundreds of thousands of shares. It will be different if
underwriters are offering many millions of shares.'
One underwriter pointed out that in the 1990 rights issue, the share price
had sunk closer to the rights issue at the same stage of the offer, but had
thence rebounded to gain a 98 per cent take-up. He was optimistic the same
would follow this time.
In 1990, however, confidence was restored by the historic, and very timely,
meeting of the French and English ends of the tunnel just two days before
the issue closed.
This time round, there are no engineering miracles left to rescue
underwriters if the share price sinks further before the close.

Exceptional and non-recurring costs were responsible for raising pre-tax
losses at Ugland International, the ship owner, manager and dry dock
operator, from Pounds 591,000 to Pounds 1.23m in the year to March 31.
The results are the first to be reported by the enlarged group since a new

Repairers, which coincided with a Pounds 19m rights issue, acquisition and
name change.
Costs of Pounds 816,000 were for re-opening and upgrading dry dock
facilities in Swansea and Pounds 171,000 in obtaining a full listing on the
Oslo stock exchange. Non-recurring costs of Pounds 187,000 were mainly for
bridge finance interest.
A maiden final dividend of 0.74p is recommended.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Regalian returns to the black with Pounds
2.75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regalian, the residential property developer, has returned to profitability
after two disastrous years, with Pounds 2.75m before tax for the 12 months
to March 31, compared with a loss of Pounds 83.5m.
It also announced that it had submitted a bid to redevelop the 2.5 acre site
of the Royal Brompton Hospital, London, and was looking for other
development opportunities in what it sees as an increasingly buoyant market.
During the year debt was reduced from Pounds 62m to Pounds 13m - it has
since fallen to Pounds 5m - and the group was able to write back some
provisions which enabled it to return to the black.
Some 239 houses and apartments were sold during the year, helping to
increase turnover from Pounds 57.8m to Pounds 63m.
It has sold 19 out of the 20 apartments in Kensington Palace Gardens,
London, the ambitious luxury development which had led to about Pounds 20m
of provisions the previous year.
Overall, about Pounds 8.7m of previous provisions for property developments
were released, after the company had taken Pounds 52.9m of provisions in
1992-93. Mr Bob Perdeaux, finance director, said further write-backs this
year were unlikely.
Administrative expenses fell from Pounds 4.05m to Pounds 2.76m, reflecting
lower staff levels, but also a cut in directors' salaries. Interest payments
fell to Pounds 2.97m (Pounds 10.8m).
Regalian has reflected the confidence in the residential market recovery by
lining up Pounds 20m of new banking facilities to fund expansion.
Mr David Goldstone, chairman, said the company had in place a development
programme with 'an estimated realisation in excess of Pounds 110m,' over the
next three years.
Planning consent had also been received for a 1.52m sq ft office and
residential development in Bishopsbridge, Paddington.
Mr Goldstone said he was confident that it could be sufficiently pre-let to
enable Regalian to proceed within 'the reasonably near future.'
Regalian is currently unable to pay dividends, due to a deficit on its
profit and loss account. It plans to seek court approval for a
restructuring, which would enable it to pay a final dividend next year.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wates launches Pounds 31m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wates City of London Properties, the only UK property company to hold all
its assets in the City of London, yesterday announced a Pounds 31m rights
issue to allow it to take advantage of the upturn in the City property
market.
Wates said the decision to launch the rights, which will help it to carry
out developments, retain existing buildings and exploit new opportunities,
followed talks with institutional shareholders.
'People take the view that the property cycle is starting again. With these
big buildings, you have to start early rather than later,' said Mr John
Nettleton, joint managing director.
The rights may allow Wates to go ahead with the redevelopment of Winchester
House at 100 Old Broad Street, which is expected to start next year.
The money will allow Wates to refinance Vintners' Place, a joint venture
with Sumitomo Corporation. The 267,000 sq ft building by the River Thames,
which is substantially unlet, is likely to need Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m of
new funds from Wates in 1995.
Wates said that the City rental market has stabilised since the fourth
quarter of last year, although 'it still remains difficult to achieve
substantial lettings on attractive financial terms'.
The 2-for-7 rights issue, which involves the issue of 44m new shares at 73p
apiece, follows a Pounds 24m rights issue last September, which was used to
cut borrowings.
The rights issue, which has been underwritten by Morgan Grenfell, has been
sub-underwritten by Mercury Asset Management, whose clients hold 9.3 per
cent of the company. Brokers to the issue are Cazenove and Warburgs.
The cash call sent Wates' shares down 5p to 75p. It was greeted cautiously
by analysts, some of whom are wary about medium term prospects for large new
City developments. 'The development wheel is already rolling. A lot of stock
already has planning permission. Two years out, we could be heading for
another oversupply situation,' said Mr Marc Gilbard of Goldman Sachs.
Wates said the valuation of one of its buildings at Queen Victoria Street
was 'significantly lower' than thought last December, after a
lower-than-expected rent review.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Siemens buys 51% of BTR offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens, the German engineering group, has acquired a 51 per cent stake in
Dunlop Automotive Composites from BTR as part of its strategy to expand in
the automotive components sector.
The venture was formed in 1989 by BTR and the electrical and fuel handling
division of Ford in order to market composite components for automotive
engines using Dunlop's lost-core moulding process.
It has a workforce of 165 based in Telford, Shropshire, and will operate as
Siemens Automotive Systems.
Siemens said that it expected the business to lift sales from Pounds 8m last
year to about Pounds 35m by 1999, leading to the creation of an additional
150 jobs. It aimed to become a leading international supplier in the growing
market for composite intake manifolds for engines.
The UK subsidiary will operate as part of the Siemens Automotive group's
integrated air fuel systems business based in Ontario, Canada.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Protean rises 32% and expects
further growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Protean, the laboratory equipment and water purification company, lifted
pre-tax profits by 32 per cent from Pounds 4.08m to Pounds 5.39m for the
year ending March 31.
Mr Peter Ryan, chairman, said the company had had a good year in spite of
recession and tough times, not only in the UK, but in other markets. The
return on sales had increased from 12.3 per cent to 13.1 per cent, 'and I
see no reason why we should not continue to grow'.
Turnover rose from Pounds 33.6m to Pounds 42.2m, including Pounds 3.18m from
Techne and LIP, two complementary companies acquired in December. The
acquisitions also contributed Pounds 552,000 to profits. Mr Ryan commented:
'So far every acquisition we have made has been successful.'
The group now comprises 16 companies operating in four countries. Overseas
sales accounted for 51.5 per cent of turnover, up from a previous 48.8 per
cent.
The water purification side accounted for 57 per cent of turnover and 41 per
cent of total operating profits of Pounds 5.53m. The laboratory water
products side did particularly well, gaining market share in spite of market
weakness.
Capital expenditure rose from Pounds 324,000 to Pounds 1.77m, mainly
reflecting the Pounds 1.75m new factory in Derbyshire for making furnaces
and ovens opened last August.
Earnings per share rose from 10.44p to 12.92p.
A final dividend of 3.7p (2.65p) is proposed, taking the total for the year
to 4.75p (3.55p).

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help AAH advance 13% to Pounds
42m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Acquisitions and a buoyant drugs market helped AAH, the pharmaceuticals
distribution group, increase pre-tax profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 42m in
the year to March 31.
The outcome, struck on sales ahead 14 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn, were also
helped by a net Pounds 2m exceptional gain arising from the disposal of the
builders' supplies division. The Pounds 7.1m profit on disposal was reduced
by a Pounds 5m charge for rationalising the wholesale drugs business.
Mr Bill Revell, chief executive, said 1993-94 had been a difficult year in
spite of the 4 per cent increase in the overall prescription market.
The healthcare division had faced tough competition and an increasing
government squeeze on prescription drug prices. Delays in accrediting AAH's
computer systems programme for local doctors had also hit profits.
The group had taken steps to improve the efficiency of wholesaling,
including reducing distribution outlets and upgrading technology. This
programme would be accelerated in the current year, Mr Revell said, and paid
for with the Pounds 5m restructuring charge.
Operating profits were ahead 13 per cent in the UK wholesaling division to
Pounds 24.8m. Net margins improved by 0.2 points to 2.3 per cent.
Cahill May Roberts, the Irish drugs distribution business, contributed
Pounds 3.9m in operating profits, against Pounds 1.7m last time, in its
first full year with AAH.
AAH expanded its retail pharmacy business with the acquisition of 77 outlets
for Pounds 27m. Operating profits were up 30 per cent at Pounds 7.3m on
sales almost doubled from Pounds 58.9m to Pounds 104.6m. Mr Revell said AAH
intended to focus on the growing over-the-counter market, in spite of
competition from supermarkets and drug store chains.
The proposed final dividend was 11.9p for a total 3.5 per cent higher at
17.9p.
Earnings per share were up 6 per cent to 34.8p. After adjusting for the
exceptional items, earning fell by 5 per cent to 31.1p.
COMMENT
This was a year of continuing disappointments for AAH, leading to downward
revisions in profits forecasts as the year progressed. AAH met expectations
in the end, but investors are likely to remain wary until the latest actions
begin to bear fruit. In its favour is the growing demand for drugs and AAH's
market position. Forecasts are for Pounds 45.5m. The shares, which fell 10p
to 449p on the results, are trading on a prospective p/e of about 13 times.
AAH appears to be undervalued, but it is too early to say much more.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Allied Leisure fell 2p to 25p yesterday after the nightclub and
ten-pin bowling group said that an exceptional charge of Pounds 500,000
relating to the year ended July 16 1993 would be included in its results for
the current year.
In June 1993 the company received Pounds 500,000 following a trading
arrangement with a supplier which was treated as income in the accounts.
However, the company said it had subsequently become apparent that the
receipt was a loan and accordingly it was necessary to include it as a
charge in the current year's accounts.
Also, in its interim results statement for the 24 weeks to January 2, when
the company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 16.1m, the company said it was
in breach of its banking covenants. Since then it has entered into a formal
standstill agreement on capital repayments and a continuation of banking
facilities has been agreed until September 19 1994.
Allied said the agreement would enable it to continue its negotiations
regarding possible disposals and on a wider range of strategic options.
In order to aid the negotiations and the financial restructuring the company
is bringing forward its year-end to June 19.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Rea Brothers shares fall on bonds warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Rea Brothers, the private banking group, yesterday fell 13p to 62p
after the company issued a profits warning, indicating substantial interim
losses against the value of its Pounds 7m fixed interest securities
portfolio.
The company said that its core businesses had recorded profits 'in excess of
Pounds 1m'. But given the sharp decline in the price of medium-term bonds,
this would be reduced by up to Pounds 700,000 of unrealised losses from its
bond portfolio.
Kleinwort Benson, the house broker, has reduced its forecast for the year
from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 1.5m, and interim profits of less than Pounds
500,000 (Pounds 802,000) are expected.
Nevertheless, Rea maintains a strong balance sheet, with shareholders funds
of Pounds 23m, and its banking, corporate finance and fund management
businesses continue to show earnings growth.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Materials handling boosts FKI - Hardware
side moves into Europe with Pounds 25.8m castors purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FKI, the electrical engineering and electronic components group, yesterday
announced a 38 per cent rise in profits and the acquisition of Rhombus, a
German castor manufacturer, for Pounds 25.8m.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 38m to Pounds 52.3m. Turnover advanced
5 per cent, from Pounds 756.1m to Pounds 794.5m, including a contribution of
Pounds 46.8m from acquisitions. Mr Bob Beeston, chief executive, said the
group had done everything it had set out to do during the year, raising
margins on steady turnover.
Nevertheless, the share price closed 9 1/2 p down at 163 1/2 p.
Rhombus is being acquired from Albert Schulte Sohne for Pounds 5.4m cash and
the assumption of Pounds 20.4m of debt. Mr Beeston said it would take FKI's
hardware division into Europe for the first time, complementing Faultless
Caster which is the market leader in North America with a 21 per cent share.
The German company has 15 per cent of the European market, with a modern
factory in Wermelskirchen and another in Malaysia. Customers include makers
of shopping trolleys, hospital beds, and home and office furniture.
It is not expected to make a contribution to FKI's profits until next year.
FKI operates through five divisions - hardware, materials handling,
automotive, engineering and process control. Profits increased in all five,
with materials handling the outstanding performer. Profits in the division
rose from Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 17.5m on turnover of Pounds 176.9m (Pounds
173.3m).
Both the materials handling and the automotive divisions benefited from the
improvement in the US automotive sector. The automotive division lifted
profits from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 4.6m on turnover of Pounds 171.7m (Pounds
152.4m).
The hardware division made profits of Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 16.1m) on sales
of Pounds 172.1m (Pounds 132.6m), helped by the Pounds 66.5m acquisition of
Truth, the US manufacturer of hinges, operating and locking mechanisms for
windows and doors, last November.
Engineering profits edged ahead to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 10.5m) on turnover
of Pounds 97.6m (Pounds 100.8m), while process control profits were Pounds
7.3m (Pounds 5.2m) on sales of Pounds 176.2m (Pounds 161.4m).
Mr Eric Bowers, finance director, said that margins had improved from 5.9
per cent to 7.6 per cent, with margins of 8.7 per cent in the second half.
Gearing was 50 per cent at the end of the year, but would reach 60 per cent
with the acquisition of Rhombus.
Earnings per share rose from 6.2p to 8.22p. A final dividend of 2.2p is
proposed, giving a total for the year of 3.7p (3p).
COMMENT
The constant emphasis on margins and the reluctance to push for revenue
growth at any price has certainly paid dividends. It has to be asked whether
the rate of growth can be maintained. However, this year Truth should kick
in strongly, and the following year the latest acquisition will be adding to
the bottom line. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 68m this year give a prospective
multiple of 16. It looks as though high expectations of the current
management have been fully reflected in the share price, and yesterday saw
some profit taking.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hardy to cut back North Sea drilling
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hardy Oil &amp; Gas, the independent explorer, yesterday said it was cutting
back its North Sea drilling programme as it announced an 18 per cent drop in
net profits to Pounds 8.3m following UK tax changes.
Mr Douglas Baker, chairman, said priority would be given to the appraisal of
finds awaiting development. The decision was taken following the
government's decision to eliminate tax shelters for drilling activity at the
end of this year.
Mr Baker said Hardy had returned a creditable performance, in spite of weak
oil prices. Pre-tax profits had jumped by 56 per cent to Pounds 5.2m. North
American gas prices had remained strong. About 67 per cent of Hardy's
production is comprised of gas.
Mr Baker said the current year would be difficult for the whole industry. He
was confident, however, that Hardy would be able to weather the problems
associated with weak oil prices. 'The group has major developments in hand
or in prospect, spread across a number of countries,' he said. North
America, in particular, would show a steady increase in production. Hardy
also enjoyed a strong financial position after last year's Pounds 29m rights
issue and its policy of non-recourse funding for new developments.
Turnover for the year to March 31 rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 60.6m.
Operating profits were 29 per cent higher at Pounds 12.9m. Earnings per
share fell by 28 per cent to 7.8p (10.9p) and the dividend is maintained at
1p.

<TEXT>
It has been a busy and expensive week for Emap. On Monday it announced plans
to make a bid for local radio group Trans World Communications which would
see it pay about Pounds 50m for the 70 per cent it does not already own.
Then yesterday the media and exhibitions group announced it faced a likely
bill of over Pounds 108m after a shopping spree in France's magazine market.
Emap intends to fund the acquisitions with debt, pushing its gearing to a
level that would usually raise City eyebrows.
Although it will take the French magazine titles on to its balance sheet at
cost it is unlikely to do so with Trans World's radio licences, which have a
fixed term. The resulting goodwill write-off would leave it with gearing of
about 100 per cent at the end of March 1995. In August this year, the low
point of its cashflow cycle, the figure will be higher still.
But Mr Neil Blackley, media analyst at Goldman Sachs, said that gearing was
'totally irrelevant' for Emap and pointed to likely interest cover of seven
times this year.
'This should prove a very good long-term deal for Emap although it will be
dilutive this year,' said Mr Blackley who has trimmed his current year
forecast from Pounds 56.5m to Pounds 55m.
The main acquisition, Editions Mondiales, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.4m for 1993 on turnover, after discounts, of about Pounds 111m. Its
accounts were qualified by the auditors but Emap said this related to
goodwill write-offs and unspecified rationalisation costs which were
irrelevant to its valuation of the business.
About 40 per cent of turnover comes from Tele Poche, one of France's top
five TV listings magazines. It is also strong in the women's, outdoor
pursuits and motoring sectors where Emap has similar titles in the UK.
The acquisitions, which together employ some 800 people in Paris, will come
under the control of Mr Kevin Hand, chief executive of Emap's consumer
magazines division.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tax credit and lower minorities aid LMS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Merchant Securities, the property and investment company, suffered a
20 per cent fall in profits at the pre-tax level in the year to March 31
from Pounds 27.8m to Pounds 22.3m.
However, a tax credit of Pounds 569,000 (Pounds 8.53m charge) and a Pounds
500,000 reduction in minority interests to Pounds 2.03m resulted in a net
profit of Pounds 20.8m, up 24 per cent from Pounds 16.8m last time.
Shareholders' funds were 24 per cent higher at Pounds 319.2m (Pounds
258.2m), excluding the Pounds 33m by which the market value of listed
investments exceeded the balance sheet figures.
The company's properties increased in value by 16 per cent to Pounds 379.8m,
adjusted for sales and acquisitions.
Lord Rayne, chairman, said that there was a 'perceptible' increase in tenant
interest. 'Although this fragile recovery appears to be progressing,
creative investment possibilities with significant growth potential remain
rare, but efforts continue to be focused on identifying suitable
opportunities,' he said.
LMS said a number of unusual factors had contributed to the results.
Gains from property disposals and venture capital investments, together with
the release of prior years' provisions for corporation tax, more than offset
the Pounds 2.7m negative effect of ceasing to treat First Leisure
Corporation as an associated undertaking; the non-recurrence of the British
Sky Broadcasting Holdings guarantee fee received in 1993 (Pounds 2.9m); and
the fall in interest income from the group's cash resources of Pounds 2.7m.
The associated undertakings, which last time produced an attributable
pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.43m, had incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
631,000.
The main reason was the change in treatment of First Leisure Corporation
because LMS's holding fell below 15 per cent.
US venture capital investments produced gains of Pounds 4m, despite the
varying fortunes of the individual enterprises.
Net rental income from investment property increased from Pounds 29.5m to
Pounds 30m. LMS made a net gain on property disposals of Pounds 6.2m in
1994, compared with Pounds 2.24m.
Cash and listed securities totalled Pounds 190m on March 31; net borrowings
amounted to Pounds 70.7m, making gearing 22 per cent of shareholders' funds.
Earnings per share increased from 7p to 8.59p. The dividend is increased by
0.2p to 4.2p via a 3.4p final.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Golden Vale warns on profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Golden Vale, the Irish dairy group, said yesterday that pre-tax profits for
the year to December 31, 1994 would be 'significantly below current market
expectations' and would 'show a reduction in the region of one-third from
the published profit before tax for 1993'.
Profits then totalled IPounds 19m, or Pounds 18.5m sterling.
The announcement was made after the London market closed.
The group explained to projected profits shortfall thus: 'This was due to
paying a competitive price for milk which resulted in a misalignment with
product market returns'.
Further, there had been increased competitiveness in the consumer products
area.
Movements in commodity product markets had not yet fully been matched by a
corresponding fall in the price of raw material.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Underwriters braced for Eurotunnel hangover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel's shares closed 14p lower at 303p yesterday, raising the
likelihood that the underwriting syndicate may have to take up a significant
portion of one of the UK's largest ever rights issues. The price of the
UK-listed Eurotunnel units has fallen 18 per cent since June 6.
Underwriters were confident yesterday that small shareholders would take up
their rights in the Pounds 858m share offer, despite the absence of free
travel incentives, but they can ill afford a further fall in the share
price.
The underwriters have a cushion with the rights shares priced at 265p. The
burden will also be eased by fees: Eurotunnel is paying Pounds 42m,
including legal and accountancy costs. The offer closes on Wednesday.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Emap buys clutch of French magazines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap, the UK media and exhibitions group, has agreed to spend a total of
FFr914m (Pounds 108m) on four acquisitions which will make it the third
largest consumer magazine publisher in France.
The main deal is the purchase for FFr710m of Editions Mondiales, a
Paris-based publisher with 8 per cent of the market. Emap is also buying
France's biggest selling motoring magazine, L'Auto Journal, from Mr Robert
Hersant, the press baron who owns Le Figaro newspaper.
Mr David Arculus, Emap managing director, said it had been planning a big
expansion in France after first entering the market in 1990 via a joint
venture with Bayard Presse. 'At one leap this gives us 10 per cent of the
French consumer magazine market with a further 1 per cent in the joint
venture.'
He said the French titles were similar to those it owns in the UK. They were
being acquired at the right point in the economic cycle.
'The prospects for the French economy are now looking as healthy, if not
healthier, than the UK with some signs of advertising starting to pick up.'
French publishing has had a severe recession with advertising and
circulation falling off sharply and new launches intensifying competition,
particularly in the newspaper market.
A number of magazines, including Conde Nast's French Vogue and Le Point, the
political weekly, have cut their cover prices in an attempt to bolster
flagging sales. The pressures have posed serious financial problems for a
number of companies, notably Mr Hersant's huge media group.
Its sale of Auto Journal as part of a disposal programme heightened
speculation about the fate of the group's remaining titles, such as
France-Soir, the loss-making evening paper.
Emap has long had its eyes on Editions Mondiales, a Paris-based publisher
whose 28 titles include Tele Poche, one of the leading TV listings magazines
which sells 1.4m copies a week.
Mr Arculus said that combining the acquisitions with Emap's existing French
operation would result in lower overheads and purchasing benefits.
The acquisitions made total operating profits of Pounds 1m on turnover of
Pounds 138m last year. Emap said the deals would enhance group earnings in
the first full year if, as it intends, they are funded by debt.
Mr Arculus said the slim returns partly reflected the fact that they had
been privately owned and had been run 'with tax rather than profits in
mind'.
Emap's UK consumer magazines made Pounds 24m on turnover of Pounds 169m last
year. Mr Arculus said this indicated the scope for improvement in the French
businesses, though their margins would never quite reach those in the UK due
to higher costs of employment and a less efficient distribution system. This
was reflected in the purchase price being less than annual turnover.
Emap, the second largest magazine publisher in the UK behind Reed Elsevier,
becomes the third biggest in France after Hachette and Prisma Presse.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Diverging views on utilities' identities: Andrew Adonis
finds challenges to the bundling together of differing stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been a dismal week for utilities. British Gas's warning that it
would not raise its dividend this year - because of a new price cap imposed
by the industry regulator - had a knock-on effect on electricity companies
as they too await a pricing review.
Such reverberations through the sector reflect the traditional view of
utility stocks as interchangeable bond surrogates.
A vigorous debate is under way among analysts and brokers as to the
relevance of bundling together electricity, gas, telecommunications and
water companies in one utility sector.
The protagonists divide into two camps: the 'divergers' and the
'convergers'. The former believe the utilities are going their separate
ways. Their regulatory climates vary widely and their financial returns are
diverging. Corporate activity and entry into unregulated sectors will
reinforce these trends, as will the growth of competition in all the
industries except water.
On this view, gas and telecommunications are prime candidates to lose their
utility badges. British Gas and British Telecommunications remain dominant
in their domestic markets, but they face stiff competition.
Both companies are exploiting overseas opportunities with relish. BT, for
instance, will this year invest more in MCI, a US phone company, than in its
UK network. With Mercury, cable companies and other new entrants taking
market share in all telecoms sectors, BT chiefs speculate that the present
regulatory price cap - due to expire in 1997 - will be the last.
Mr Robert Morris, analyst at Goldman Sachs, sees manifold opportunities for
BT if it expands its home market and becomes an international leader in new
services. Yet fears that competition is a one-way street have dragged down
BT's share price, exacerbated by a slow-down in nominal dividend growth.
Real dividend growth is expected to be between 3 and 4 per cent over the
next few years, less than for electricity or water.
Mr Nigel Hawkins, of Hoare Govett, believes the decision to privatise gas
and telecoms as single entities, but to split up water and electricity
distribution, has created a regulatory divide between the two groups of
utilities. 'In practice where there is more than one operator, the regulator
tends to be more generous to the sector as a whole, as we are likely to see
with water and electricity in the reviews of their price caps, making a
significant difference to expectations.' Hence, in part, the better
performance of water and electricity shares of late, although the latter has
suffered in recent days.
However, Mr Hawkins paints a sharp difference even between water and
electricity. With regulatory reviews ongoing in both industries, their
regimes are diverging. While the water companies are set to have a price cap
of, effectively, RPI+1.7 per cent, the Recs are likely to have to make a
one-off cut of between 12 and 15 per cent with a price cap thereafter of
around RPI-2.5 per cent. Furthermore, the lifting next year of the ban on
the Recs being taken over will open up entrepreneurial options.
For water, he expects real dividend growth of around 4 per cent, while for
electricity distribution it will be close to 6 per cent. In short, the water
companies will become 'akin to bonds', while Recs will be less sensitive to
bond movements.
Not all diversifiers go that far. Mr John Wilson at UBS points to underlying
growth in electricity demand of less than 1.5 per cent: 'It is inconceivable
that a company can grow its earnings and dividends greater than its growth
of business in the long term.' He sees gas and electricity, where limited
competition is emerging, as natural bedfellows, with water as a monopoly and
telecoms as a fully competitive business.
The 'convergers' do not claim that the utilities will perform similarly in
the short or medium term. They see the post-privatisation history of all
four industries as a continuum and minimise the significance of competition
and diversification.
Mr Bill Dale, utilities analyst at SG Warburg, says: 'British Gas and BT
are, in effect, more mature utilities than electricity and water, leading to
an inevitable slow-down in their financial returns which will affect the
others in due course.
'The privatised companies find it far easier to grow profits in their early
years, when the cost-cutting - particularly redundancies - is easy and
initial regulation is lighter.' As for competition and diversification, 'The
track record of utilities diversifying is dreadful, and any institutional
investor will initially take a negative view of it.'
In the convergers' view, then, in the long-term all four utilities might be
expected to perform at a fixed discount to bonds, as in the US. Fleming
Securities stresses the 'increasingly close' relationship between the
gilt/equity ratio and the dividend yield of the utilities index relative to
the FT-A All-Share.
'As competition and regulation reduce the scope for unexpectedly large rates
of dividend growth, UK utilities will take on even more of the
characteristic bond-like behaviour of their US counterparts.'
Whether they will become bond substitutes remains problematic. While they
serve as reasonably effective inflation hedges, their capacity to hedge
against interest rates is more limited because in the UK price caps - and
the permitted rates of returns underlying them - are fixed for several years
at a time.
For all that, 'divergers' and 'convergers' agree that no self-respecting
institution would want to do without the four utilities in their portfolio,
given their size. It is all a question of balance.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Swissair looks at Sabena stake

Swissair is discussing a strategic alliance with Sabena which could see it
acquire a large minority stake in the Belgian carrier.
The Swiss airline yesterday confirmed it was holding talks with Sabena and
other European airlines, but declined to comment on a report that it was
considering buying a 49.5 per cent stake in the Belgian carrier.
A report published today in the Zurich financial magazine Cash says Swissair
intends to acquire a 49.5 per cent stake in Sabena by buying Air France's
37.5 per cent holding and a further 12 per cent held by four financial
companies controlled by the Belgian government.
Swissair said the article was based on a paper prepared by McKinsey, the
consultants. 'It is not Swissair policy to comment publicly on any proposals
or recommendations which such documents may contain.'
Sabena confirmed talks with Swissair, but added it was also holding
discussions with American Airlines. Belgian government officials said it
would not object to Swissair taking a minority stake in Sabena as long as
the state maintained majority control.
A significant stake in Sabena would give Swissair an EU base. Swissair's
biggest handicap is its lack of free access to the liberalised EU aviation
market. It seems to have lost hope of solving this problem through an air
transport agreement between the Swiss government and the EU.
The Swiss airline indicated it intended to extend its partnerships after the
collapse last year of the 'Alcazar' plan to merge with KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines.
Any eventual deal between Swissair and Sabena will hinge on Air France's
willingness to shed its stake in the Belgian carrier. Although Sabena has
become unhappy with Air France as a minority shareholder, the financially
troubled French carrier may be reluctant to shed its stake, according to
airline industry officials.
Such a disposal would risk complicating its efforts to win European
Commission approval for a proposed FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) capital injection
from the French government.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Smith New Court profits jump to Pounds 95m
</HEADLINE>

Smith New Court, the equities marketmaker and broker, has reported a surge
in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 95.2m, from Pounds 38.7m, reflecting
gains in almost every area of the firm's business.
The shares closed 4p higher at 373p, bucking the market trend. The dividend
was increased to 10p per share from 6p.
For the year to April, return on capital was 47.8 per cent, more than double
the 20 per cent rate of return the London Stock Exchange calculated the
average UK securities firm earned in 1993. Fully-diluted earnings per share
were 70.2p against 34.3p.
'We are building products our clients want,' said Mr Michael Marks, chief
executive, in explaining the firm's success in its niche markets. Despite
volatile trading conditions in the last quarter, profits in the second half
nearly doubled from the Pounds 31.1m recorded in the first half.
The firm does not provide details of the profitability of each of its
geographic regions. However, international income accounted for 57 per cent
of the total against 43 per cent from UK activities. This was a big shift
from the business mix prevailing at the time of Big Bang in 1986 when
domestic activities accounted for 80 per cent.
Mr Marks said that profits from the firm's US-based Carl Marks and Co
subsidiary, which specialises in selling international shares to US clients,
had benefited from the installation of a new system allowing regional
stockbrokers to obtain share research electronically. 'They pay us for it by
their order flow,' he said. Also, the US division benefited from the general
trend among domestic pension fund investors to increase their exposure to
non-US securities.
Smith New Court said it has cut its dependence on marketmaking as a source
of profitability. Last year marketmaking accounted for 48 per cent of
profits with the remainder coming from commissions and fees. At the time of
Big Bang, almost all income came from marketmaking.
Smith New Court did not provide details of its expenses, which are expected
to show substantial increases in profit-related pay when the annual report
is released later this month. Expenses were also increased by taking on an
extra 100 staff, mostly outside the UK.
The firm has opened offices in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Lima in Peru,
and has applied to open a joint venture in Shenzhen, China, with a domestic
partner.
