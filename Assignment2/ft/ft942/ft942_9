FT  17 JUN 94 / Acclaim greets Schneider chief freed from jail
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'I am very, very happy to be here today,' Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, head
of France's Groupe Schneider, told a packed shareholders' meeting yesterday
in the Automobile Club in Paris's Place de la Concorde.
It is safe to assume he meant what he said. Two weeks ago, the head of the
electrical engineering group found himself in rather different circumstances
 -an inmate in Brussels' Forest prison, facing charges of fraud relating to
two Belgian subsidiaries. Last week, after 12 days in prison, he was
released on bail of FFr2.5m (Pounds 290,000).
However, Mr Valentino Foti, an Italian businessman being investigated on the
same charges as Mr Pineau-Valencienne, is still held after an appeal
yesterday for his release was rejected by Belgian judicial authorities.
If Mr Pineau-Valencienne had been expecting a difficult reception because of
the Belgian investigation, he would have been pleasantly surprised. A round
of applause greeted his arrival on stage, while shareholders expressed
support for their chairman.
The reception was less warm for one Belgian minority shareholder, who was
booed after his complaint about a lack of information concerning offshore
companies in the group.
For his part, Mr Pineau-Valencienne sought to reassure investors that the
group would not be damaged by the affair and sought to rebuff the
allegations of the Belgian prosecution.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne denied that Schneider had acted against the interests
of minority shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, the two financial
subsidiaries at the centre of the investigation.
He also rejected charges that dividends paid by offshore companies had not
been distributed equally among shareholders in the subsidiaries and denied
that funds totalling BFr3bn (Pounds 580m) had been diverted from the two
companies to the benefit of their parent company.
The Schneider chairman told his audience that he was appointing an outside
auditor with a view to clearing himself and the group of the charges.
Mr Pineau-Valencienne said he had travelled voluntarily to Brussels on May
26 to make a statement about the case.
He said the group would press ahead with its strategy of expanding its core
electrical engineering businesses.
The stock market responded positively. Schneider shares, which have lost 16
per cent of their value since the company chairman's unfortunate Belgian
journey, bucked the trend in the depressed Paris bourse and rose 2.3 per
cent to close at FFr356.9.

FT  17 JUN 94 / US signals readiness to resume N Korean talks: Pyongyang
takes softer line in nuclear dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton said last night the US would resume talks with North
Korea if conciliatory signals from Pyongyang meant it was now ready to
freeze its nuclear programme.
The move followed a statement by former US president Jimmy Carter, who is
visiting Pyongyang, that North Korea had agreed to allow inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency to remain at its nuclear installations.
Mr Carter's comments helped ease tension which arose last week when the
Pyongyang said it was withdrawing from the agency, which suspects it of
using its reactor to supply a secret weapons programme.
Mr Clinton said: 'If today's developments mean that North Korea is genuinely
and verifiably prepared to freeze its nuclear programme while talks go on,
and we hope that is the case, then we would be willing to resume high-level
talks.'
However, Mr Clinton said the US was continuing to explore the possibility of
United Nations sanctions to force North Korea to comply with international
inspection of its nuclear facilities.
Mr Clinton said it was important to determine if Pyongyang's gesture
amounted to something new. Mr Carter said that North Korean president Kim
Il-sung had signalled a desire to replace its nuclear programme with a newer
technology that produces less dangerous plutonium.
Earlier, resistance emerged to the US draft resolution for UN sanctions when
Russia joined China in objecting to the move.
Opposition to sanctions by Moscow and Beijing, both permanent members of the
UN Security Council, threatened to dilute attempts to increase pressure on
the North. However, neither country said it would veto plans outlined by Ms
Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN. China has long signalled its
wariness of sanctions. Mr Shen Guofang, foreign ministry spokesman, said:
'China in principle does not subscribe to the involvement of the Security
Council in the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.'
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, caused consternation when he
made clear his lack of sympathy for Washington's move because it had, he
alleged, not consulted Moscow.
He said: 'I think tabling the draft unilaterally will seriously complicate
for Russia consideration of the document. In any case we will not support a
set of sanctions worked out without our co-operation.'
Ms Dee Dee Myers, Mr Clinton's press secretary, said in Washington Ms
Albright had consulted Russia's UN mission on Wednesday as well as those of
China, Britain and France.
The 'carefully calibrated' measures outlined by Ms Albright would start with
a reduction of diplomatic and other links, along with an arms embargo.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Drive to boost stock exchange listings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange plans to launch its first marketing effort aimed
at encouraging non-British corporations to seek a listing in London, said Mr
Michael Lawrence, the exchange's new chief executive.
Mr Lawrence, who took charge in February, was outlining the changes he
intends to put in place at the stock exchange. The exchange's image has
suffered, particularly since the collapse last March of its Taurus project
for paperless share settlement.
'We want to convince major international companies to list in London,' Mr
Lawrence said, noting that the US-based exchanges have used their marketing
skills to attract significant international business.
'We need to make London as attractive as we can and then go out and market
it,' he said. The exchange's marketing move signals a significant cultural
shift as it has never actively sought new business before.
However, it is also likely to anger continental exchanges which believe
London is already attracting business which is rightfully theirs. The
marketing effort would focus on the corporate brokers to leading companies,
but the exchange would arrange direct meetings with companies where
appropriate.
The exchange is also interested in encouraging the listing of more Eurobonds
and convertible bonds. The New York Stock Exchange and the US-based National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System share exchange
have both had extensive marketing operations for years and have been
successful in persuading leading multinational companies to seek listings in
the US.
As part of the plan London is looking at Global Depositary Receipts -
sterling-denominated packages of non-UK shares like the US-dollar
denominated American Depositary Receipts.
GDRs could have looser requirements for listing than ordinary corporate
shares, Mr Lawrence said.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Cut-price car dealers survive Peugeot's court challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The right of independent traders to sell cut-price new cars to customers
across EU borders in competition with franchised dealer networks was upheld
by the European Court of Justice yesterday.
The court rejected an appeal by the PSA Peugeot Citroen group of France
against an earlier European Commission ruling, which stated that new car
sales by independent traders across national borders to specified customers
were legal.
The ruling is likely to pave the way for an increase in the number and
activities of such independent traders.
The court verdict follows a previous Commission order that Peugeot lift its
ban on dealers in Belgium and Luxembourg selling to Ecosystem, a Rouen-based
intermediary that resells in France cars bought at lower prices in Belgium
and Luxembourg.
Under EU rules, it is legal for intermediaries to import cars on behalf of
individual customers. In 1991, Sir Leon Brittan, then competition
commissioner, warned Peugeot that its Belgian and Luxembourg dealers would
forfeit protection from normal competition rules if the ban was not lifted.
The verdict coincided with an attack by the European motor industry on
changes proposed by the Commission's competition directorate to the
so-called 'block exemption', which allows carmakers to contravene EU
competition regulations by restricting new car sales to franchised dealer
networks.
The carmakers have been thrown on to the defensive by the court verdict and
the proposed rule changes, which would give more power to dealers and would
provide more grounds on which the exemption could be withdrawn from a
manufacturer.
The exemption expires in June 1995, and a battle is being waged in the
Commission between the competition and industry directorates on the terms
under which it should be renewed.
Consumer groups want it scrapped, claiming that it restricts competition and
leads to unjustifiably high car prices.
The Peugeot-Ecosystem case has provided one of the key areas of debate about
whether the block exemption should be renewed.

FT  17 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Ziff
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many a media group will run its slide rule over Ziff Communications in
coming weeks. The family-owned US publisher, which was put up for sale last
week, is an attractive property. Ziff is the world's largest publisher of
computer magazines, a fast-growing segment of the print media. It also owns
ZiffNet, an on-line information service about computers, which should appeal
given the current multimedia vogue. Not surprisingly, speculation is rife
over possible bidders. France's Matra-Hachette, K-III of the US and VNU of
the Netherlands have said they are interested. Other names bandied around
include Reed Elsevier, Bertelsmann, News Corporation, Time Warner and Times
Mirror.
Though many may be interested, few could plausibly afford the touted Dollars
2bn-plus price tag. VNU is too small to buy the whole group and the Ziff
family have made clear they would prefer not to sell it in several chunks.
Similarly, the balance sheets of Hachette, K-III, News Corporation and Time
Warner look rather stretched. Reed Elsevier, Bertelsmann and Times Mirror
are more likely contenders. The Anglo-Dutch group, in particular, has
indicated it is keen to make further acquisitions following last year's
Dollars 417m purchase of Official Airline Guides. But though Ziff might fit
the bill, it is not the only fish in the sea.

FT  17 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Dairy sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gillian Shephard's announcement on the liberalisation of the milk market
in England and Wales removes the uncertainty of timing from Northern Foods
and Unigate. How the new regime will affect their margins remains obscure.
But the assumption that higher raw material prices will exacerbate the
squeeze on their margins could prove wide of the mark. In the longer term
European agriculture reform is likely to put downward pressure on milk
prices anyway, whether or not Mrs Shephard succeeds in making production
quotas tradeable.
Milk Marque could not bid up the price of milk too far at the farm gate
without incurring the wrath of the Office of Fair Trading. Liquid milk
retailers will no longer be able to take precedence over processors at times
of shortage, so supermarkets may be prepared to pay up for security of
supply from the large dairies.
Since liquid milk accounts for about 80 per cent of Northern's dairy
business and around two-thirds of that at Unigate, both companies could find
life improves under the new regime. A bigger threat faces processors who may
be squeezed between higher input costs and cheap imports of butter, cheese
and powder. Such a prospect could complicate the flotation of Dairy Crest,
the Milk Marketing Board's processing arm. But Northern and Unigate cannot
afford to be complacent. They still have to cope with the inexorable decline
in high margin doorstep sales and the risk the supermarkets may eventually
seek to drive home their advantage by buying direct from Milk Marque and
packaging the product themselves.

FT  17 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Wates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The second rights issue from Wates City of London inside a year would be
more appealing if the company had been able to sugar the pill with good
news. Instead, one of Wates's large investment properties has fallen in
value since the year-end, while another remains unlet and will soon have to
be refinanced. For all the talk of development opportunities, the shares
fell 6 per cent before settling just above the rights price.
The sight of a prominent City property falling in value as a result of a
disappointing rent review should send a gentle warning to the rest of the
sector. True, the lease in question is unusual in allowing rents to fall.
Wates also feels it was harshly treated by the independent consultant which
settled the claim. Nevertheless the rent review came in lower than expected
when the property was last valued in December. The case underlines that a
further rise in property values will be difficult to achieve while rental
growth remains elusive.
Adjusting for the revaluation, the rights issue is priced close to Wates's
net asset value. Since many companies in the sector are trading at a modest
discount to net assets, that is hardly cheap. It would be some comfort if
Wates could be more forthcoming about how much of the rights money will
eventually be channelled into refinancing its joint venture with Sumitomo.
One can only assume that Mercury Asset Management, which agreed to
sub-underwrite the whole issue if necessary and could have ended up with a
29 per cent stake, has a clearer view of the recovery prospects than the
wider equity market.

FT  17 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Crude expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Crude at Dollars 20 a barrel by the end of the year is starting to look like
a credible scenario. The sharp rise in oil prices this week has already
taken the benchmark Brent price to Dollars 17. In the US, the benchmark West
Texas Intermediate price has risen even faster, touching Dollars 20 and
opening what looks like an unsustainable Dollars 3 spread over Brent.
A firm line at this week's Opec meeting and worries over Korea have clearly
played their part in the price rise. But the decisive factor is new evidence
that oil demand in the US is accelerating. The cartel's decision to cancel
its September meeting, so emphasising its determination not to increase
production, has had such an impact because demand is robust. Given that only
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and possibly Venezuela have substantial excess
capacity, the chances of quota cheating are slim. The market has concluded
that supplies will be stretched next winter and has reacted by attempting to
build up stocks now.
Whether this is as bad for inflation prospects as bond markets have
concluded is less clear. The direct impact of higher oil prices will be
fairly modest. While the Saudis are happy to see crude at Dollars 20, there
is no evidence that they wish to drive it much higher than that. Of greater
concern is the possibility that strong oil demand may indicate that the US
economy is running ahead faster than expected. But this is not the only
interpretation. The more comforting view is that the US has forgotten about
conservation and is back to its old gas-guzzling ways. If that is true,
robust oil demand may reflect the particularly oil-intensive nature of this
US recovery rather than warning of inflation ahead.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Slipping market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the European Commission and EU governments, lack of progress in making
the single market work is becoming a severe embarrassment. Yesterday the
Commission published a list showing that France, Germany, Greece and Ireland
have the worst records in placing single market legislation in national
statute books. EU countries have transposed nearly 90 per cent of laws to
free passage of goods and services. However, only 50 per cent of single
market measures have become legally binding in all 12 countries.
Governments have been particularly slow to open up public procurement,
accounting for 15 per cent of EU economic activity. Even where
liberalisation measures have become law, there are problems in enforcing
them. Many countries appear to be maintaining import barriers through
over-restrictive procedures on technical standards, thus flouting agreements
on mutual recognition.
This poor record - along with the recession - helps explain why, according
to opinion polls, the single market has generated little enthusiasm among
companies and consumers. In January 1993, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the
commissioner responsible for the internal market, unhelpfully suggested
lenient treatment for governments which failed to implement the rules. His
subsequent statements have been scarcely more convincing. At the end of last
year, for example, he promised 'decisive action' to improve implementation.
This week he pledged this would receive 'urgent priority'. So far, however,
he has come up with nothing more muscular than a plan for national civil
servants to report on other governments that do not stick to the rules.
Implementing single market rules does test the EU's doctrine of
subsidiarity. If decision-making is to be carried out 'closest to the
people', enforcement should ideally be left to governments. Experience
suggests, however, that a strong push from Brussels is essential for
achieving compliance. The Commission should not shrink from recommending
fines for proven infringement.
Equally, there should be a bare minimum of centrally agreed Euro-laws laying
down harmonised norms to ensure products can pass through national
frontiers. Where countries persistently misuse national standards, extra
legislation may be needed. In general, however, the Commission is right to
emphasise the quality rather than the quantity of legislation needed to
maintain the momentum of the market.
Setbacks in making the single market operational underline how far the EU
must travel simply to consolidate measures agreed under the 1987 Single
European Act. If the internal market is to be a lasting success, it will
need a decisive champion in Brussels. At present, that person does not
exist. A priority for the successor of Mr Jacques Delors will be to ensure
that a barrier-free Europe for business becomes reality.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Phone alliances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dollars 4.2bn alliance forged this week by France Telecom, Deutsche
Telekom and Sprint, a US long-distance telecoms operator, should not be
allowed to proceed until the French and German governments open their
telecoms markets to full competition.
In the context of the liberalisation of telecoms services, international
alliances are to be welcomed. In time, some four or five international
alliances will compete as 'single source' providers to multinationals. These
alliances are set to offer more competition and better service than now - of
particular benefit to Europe, which suffers from a multiplicity of national
jurisdictions and excessive prices for cross-border calls.
Sprint operates in one of the world's most competitive telecoms markets.
Whether France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom can add sufficient value to
justify their large investments is a matter for them and their state
shareholders. However, other US operators do have legitimate concerns about
the use of monopoly revenues to aid Sprint, while Europe's consumers have a
strong interest in Europe's monopolies being abolished before its
monopolists attack other markets.
France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom claim that their alliance with Sprint
will compete only in sectors - such as calling cards and data communications
 -already open to competition. They also stress that the Sprint deal will be
completed only a year before full domestic liberalisation is achieved to
meet the EU's 1998 deadline.
That is an unconvincing response. It is notoriously difficult to separate
out costs in telecoms companies, particularly in the early years after the
abolition of their monopolies. Even with regulators dedicated to the task,
as in the US and UK, claims of unfair practice abound.
Only last month, Deutsche Telekom was found by Germany's Federal Cartel
Administration to have been channelling large subsidies into its data
division since the liberalisation of data telecoms in 1989. Until its
principal markets are open, international competitors will have
understandable doubts about the fairness of competition, while French and
German consumers continue to be disadvantaged.
The 1998 EU deadline offers only marginal reassurance. It leaves the French
and German voice monopolies intact for another three years. Furthermore, it
does not extend to infrastructure liberalisation, vital to effective
telecoms competition.
The European Commission is expected to recommend that provision of
infrastructure also be liberalised in 1998. It is not, however, feasible for
the EU to bring forward the 1998 deadline, given the careful balancing of
interests it represents. So if the French and German governments support
their companies' desire to invest billions overseas, they should be forced
to allow competition at home.

The normally friendly rivalry between Brazil's two largest cities - Sao

snobbishly looks down on its poorer, but better-known cousin, Rio de
Janeiro, and Sao Paulo's media especially revels in Rio's reputation for
terrifying violence.
But at the weekend 42 people were murdered in separate incidents in Sao
Paulo; 21 were killed in execution-style assassinations believed to be
linked to drug-dealing.
By Wednesday morning, however, Rio had recovered its reputation as the
country's most violent city - in a 24-hour period, 22 people were shot.

financier, going to retire as chairman of Smith New Court, the City
stockbrokers?
He turned 69 in April and he could bow out with pride following yesterday's
sparkling figures from the firm. Sir Michael, who gets into the office
before 8 am and works a full five-day week and sometimes more, has told
Observer that he has no intention of soldiering on till 1997, like his old
chums Lords Hanson and White. Then again, he has no plans for quitting this
year.
Even so, his eventual retirement raises the question of whether Smith New
Court will pick another outsider to be chairman - Sir Michael was the first
 -or return to its old ways of promoting someone from the shop floor. It
will be an interesting test of the firm's maturity.

Ever wonder what happened to those high-speed river buses that once plied
the River Thames in London?
They are resurfacing in Bangkok, ferrying travellers between the airport and
three big hotels along the Chao Phraya river - the Oriental, the Shangri-La
and the Royal Orchid Sheraton.
Siam Development and Holding has bought the whole fleet of eight catamarans
from the administrators of Olympia &amp; York, which ran into such difficulties
with the Canary Wharf development in London. Four of the boats will go into
service on the hotel-airport run from July 1.
The idea is to avoid Bangkok's notorious traffic jams. The journey between
airport and down-town hotels should be reduced to an hour - it can take two
hours on a normal day and more than five hours if the streets are flooded
with rain-water.

Has Sears group chairman Geoffrey Maitland Smith found a new hobby -
furniture-making? Bargain hunters at his group's Selfridges store on Oxford
Street have spotted a new line of tables and chairs carrying the Maitland
Smith moniker.
It is not Geoffrey who is the cabinet-maker, but brother Paul. He founded a
Philippines-based company in the 1970s making copies of classic British
furniture - aimed mainly at the American market - and sold it five years ago
to US conglomerate Masco. It opened a concession in Selfridges in February,
and, says Sears, is trading well - and not just to Americans.

The governor of the Bank of England might have captured the financial
headlines at Wednesday's Mansion House dinner, but it was the governor of
the Bank of Scotland who made the most dashing entrance.
Bruce Pattullo turned up in a kilt for the first time. The tartan? The very
apposite Ancient Bruce - though he is only 56.
Pattullo is not known as a kilt man and theories abound as to why he's now
started sporting a sporran south of the border.
One suggestion is that it helps to emphasise the perception that the Bank of
Scotland is more Scottish than the Royal Bank of Scotland, whose chairman
Lord Younger tends to abide by English evening dress code.
Another is that now that Pattullo is no longer in the running to be governor
of the Bank of England, he can wear what he likes. But the simplest
explanation is the correct one - his wife bought him his kilt for Christmas.

Once upon a time American beer and French wine were modish choices in Tokyo
 -the most expensive city in the world. But now - thanks to the high cost of
Japanese currency - consumers' yen for these one-time luxuries is more
easily satisfied.
Already this year wine imports have doubled and foreign beer imports have
increased fivefold. Most goes to supermarkets and discount outlets which
report a roaring trade. It is easy to see why.
A quick reccy in central Tokyo found a 750ml bottle of Gordon's gin for a
mere Y2,000 (Pounds 12.82) and a range of US beers at between Y180 and Y210
per 350ml can, rather cheaper than the Japanese equivalent at Y220 per can.
But the best things in life are still very expensive in Tokyo. Mitsukoshi,
the Tokyo Harrods, is asking a hefty Y4,300 for a standard bottle of Moet &amp;
Chandon Brut Imperial - two-thirds more than it costs in its home country -
and Y285 for a small bottle of Guinness. So sushi-eating black velvet
drinkers will still have to hunt pretty hard to find a bargain.

FT  17 JUN 94 / What parents are for: Will GE continue to indulge US
investment bank Kidder Peabody
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes, having a rich owner is a securities company's greatest asset.
Shearson Lehman and First Boston, two leading Wall Street firms, learnt that
lesson in 1990 when each was helped out by a powerful parent (respectively
American Express and CS Holding, the Swiss banking group). Kidder Peabody,
errant son of General Electric, the US conglomerate, is the latest to learn
the benefits of an owner with a deep pocket.
Since it disclosed in April that Dollars 350m of previously reported trading
profits over the past three years were fictitious, Kidder has been the
target of rumour and sniping on Wall Street. Questions have been asked about
the value of its securities portfolio. Headhunters have circled the firm,
trying to pick off its best traders.
In fact, Kidder's difficulties are not as dire as most of the firm's rivals
make out - thanks largely to GE. The GE connection has brought some powerful
benefits. Whereas other securities firms - including CS First Boston - raise
money on their own behalf using their single-A credit ratings, Kidder is
funded through its immediate parent, GE Capital, and, ultimately, GE. The
top triple-A rating of these companies enables them to raise money cheaply,
in turn giving Kidder an advantage over rivals. (With a portfolio of
securities valued at Dollars 73bn at the end of last year, shaving even a
fraction of a percentage point from the firm's financing costs has a big
impact on profits.)
This week, GE has been forced to restate its support for Kidder - a company
which, two years ago, it came close to selling. But in the process, it made
little pretence about the difficulties the company faces. Mr Dennis
Dammerman, GE chief financial officer, drew a direct comparison with other
ailing businesses the manufacturing giant has nursed through difficult times
before: its power generation business in the 1980s, and its network
television business in the early 1990s. He implied that the current
environment for the securities industry is equally difficult - an
observation likely to come as a surprise to many Wall Street firms, which,
though not doing as well as in the record year of 1993, are still
experiencing one of their best-ever years.
GE's professed commitment will enable Kidder to ride out the storm that
began in April. The question, though, is how long GE will remain the
indulgent parent.
Two problems are besetting Kidder. First, the phantom profits scheme is
proving a bigger drag than it had hoped. Kidder blamed the scheme on Mr
Joseph Jett, the former head of its government bond trading desk, depicting
itself as the innocent victim of a fraud. Mr Jett, though, has since hit
back, suggesting senior Kidder executives were aware of his trading strategy
and that he is being made a scapegoat.
An investigation of Mr Jett's trading by Mr Gary Lynch, a former head of
enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, is taking longer than
GE had hoped. The length of the investigation is fuelling rumours that Mr
Lynch's review has been broadened to take in the activities of executives
other than Mr Jett and other aspects of Kidder's business.
Adding to the seriousness of the affair, if the Dollars 350m of trading
profits were false, then Kidder's resurgence of the past two years has been
false too. GE said this week that it had injected Dollars 200m of capital
into Kidder to plug the hole left by the phantom profits.
Kidder's second longer-term problem is its reliance on one market -
mortgage-backed bonds - for a large proportion of its (real) profits. Such
bonds are created when household mortgages are packaged and sold to
investors. Kidder's dominance of this Dollars 1,600bn market (it handled
nearly a quarter of all new issues of bonds last year) proved profitable
last year as the volume of new bonds soared. In recent months, however,
mortgage-backed bond issues have been running at only about Dollars 10bn a
month, compared with Dollars 40bn a month at the start of the year.
Kidder has also been affected by being the biggest trader in the market at a
time when prices have been volatile. The attractiveness to investors of
mortgage-backed bonds dropped both when US interest rates fell last year
(many mortgage holders paid their old loans off early to take out new loans
at lower rates, hitting the value of the bonds) and rose this year
(pre-payments stopped, lengthening the bonds' lives and, again, making them
less attractive to investors).
Just how badly Kidder has been hurt is impossible to say. At the end of last
year, Kidder was more highly geared than any other Wall Street house, with
less than Dollars 1bn of capital to support its Dollars 73bn of securities
holdings. That suggests that it would only take a small fall in prices to
consume a large part of Kidder's capital.
Mr Michael Carpenter, the firm's chairman, again insisted this week that
Kidder's bond holdings were hedged against falling prices. He added that the
firm had sold a third of its mortgage-backed bond holdings, thought to have
been worth about Dollars 12bn, improving its liquidity.
Questions remain, though, about the other two-thirds - and about Kidder's
(and GE's) enthusiasm for retaining such a large position in a market which
has proved more volatile than Wall Street had expected.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Outsider in the hot seat: Michael Lawrence, new chief
executive of the London Stock Exchange, outlines his strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not one of us.' That view of the London Stock Exchange's new chief executive
came from a group of UK stockbrokers who recently invited him to speak. It
is also the view heard in many trading rooms and boardrooms, as some in the
City struggle to come to terms with the exchange's new leadership.
The main challenge for Mr Michael Lawrence will be to salvage the exchange's
dented reputation and forge a more coherent identity for an organisation
which has never decided whether it is a club, a commercial operation or a
regulator.
'What he ought to be worried about is whether the exchange has any role at
all,' says one board member. 'The exchange's only function seems to be to
legitimise decisions which favour six big marketmaking firms.' Marketmakers
are the firms which indicate the prices at which they will buy and sell
blocks of equities on the exchange's Seaq computer screens.
Mr Lawrence has assumed his role at a crisis point in the exchange's
history. Not only has its international standing been dented by the collapse
last March of its ill-fated Taurus project for paperless share settlement,
but the character of London as a securities trading centre is changing
radically.
Since the liberalisation of Big Bang in 1986, non-UK investment banks have
increasingly dominated the exchange, employing their capital in innovative
ways such as the use of derivatives and trading on their own account. While
this trend has helped London become Europe's focus for international share
trading, exchange participants are asking whether it can retain that status.
Mr Lawrence's job is to ensure that it consolidates it, and then increases
it. The task will be tough for a man who, when appointed last December, was
greeted with 'Michael who?' by many in the City.
Mr Lawrence's suits and small gold tie-pin announce that he is neither a
public-school-educated patrician, nor a street-wise working-class individual
 -two prevailing City types. He is a product of Wembley County Grammar
School who studied physics at three universities before receiving a PhD in
1965 in mathematical physics from Bristol University. He trained as an
accountant at Price Waterhouse, where he went on to specialise in
resuscitating failing companies.
He has never worked in the securities industry and thus cannot be accused of
representing vested interests. It is this characteristic of being an
outsider which some City observers say may prove his great strength.
Asked whether he isn't 'one of us', Mr Lawrence demurs. The concept of 'us'
in the City is changing rapidly, he says. 'We're going to see a different
sense of community because of the international position of London.
International firms are increasingly important in the marketplace.'
The exchange recognised that it needed a new broom after Mr Peter Rawlins
resigned as chief executive when Taurus collapsed. After a long search, the
exchange turned to Mr Lawrence, then finance director of the Prudential, the
UK's largest insurance company, and chairman of the influential 100 Group of
Finance Directors.
Four months into the job, Mr Lawrence has let the City get a good look at
him, while he has listened to the City. 'He said all the right things to
us,' says one private client stockbroker. 'He said: 'Tell me what you want.'
'
But the jury is still out on the crucial question of whether Mr Lawrence can
translate what he hears into a policy which will ensure the exchange retains
its position as the centre of European equities trading. The task is
complicated because exchange members can have conflicting interests - UK and
US marketmakers are competing for the same customers, for instance - and the
concerns of members occasionally conflict with the exchange's role as a
regulator.
Mr Lawrence says he has already come to some conclusions about what the
exchange must do to repair its fortunes.
First, the exchange must behave like a commercial organisation. 'We have a
tremendous brand here in London,' he says. 'We have to make London as
attractive as we can and then go out and market it.'
To this end, he has restructured the exchange, altering the main committees'
chain of command so that they report to the executive and not to its
21-member board. He says this system resembles that of a typical corporation
and is less like that of a trade association. The reform should give the
executive more control over decision-making and reduce some of the wrangling
among various factions.
However, the change in the committee structure is ringing alarm bells among
some of the exchange's powerful marketmakers. 'That is a warning signal to
me,' says the chief executive at one firm. 'It means that the exchange can
ignore the recommendations of the practitioners.'
One of Mr Lawrence's first initiatives ruffled the feathers of the
marketmakers. He asked the board to approve funds to build an order-matching
capacity into the exchange's new Sequence trading system (which will
eventually replace Seaq, the automated price display mechanism).
Marketmakers fear that their competitors will take advantage of them by
undercutting their prices. Non-marketmakers support the effort partly
because it will blunt the attractions of TradePoint, an emerging dealing
system developed by several exchange defectors, particularly in the trading
of small company shares.
Among other changes, Mr Lawrence has ditched the post of director of policy,
taking on that function himself. Instead, the exchange will have a director
of strategic planning, a board-level post which is expected to be filled
shortly. Most critically, it will have a director of marketing for the first
time.
The ambitions of the marketing department are initially modest. To start, it
will have three or four people seconded from UK and foreign securities firms
whose task will be to encourage greater participation by non-UK corporations
on the exchange. Mr Lawrence concedes that Stock Exchange members might have
felt it unseemly openly to solicit business a few years ago.
But competitive pressures from other European bourses and the emergence of
dealing systems such as TradePoint are forcing marketmakers and stockbrokers
to rethink their position.
Mr Lawrence dismisses the suggestion that London's best way forward is
greater integration with other European exchanges. 'Why we should try to
create a pan-European stock exchange I do not know,' he says. 'It would be
less friendly to smaller companies because it would inevitably cater for the
shares of large multinationals.
'I don't believe the option is either a pan-European exchange or open
warfare,' he says. He argues that international securities houses want
simply to see three international trading centres - Tokyo, New York and
London - in different time zones. They do not want the expense of setting up
offices in every European capital in which they wish to do business and,
therefore, will welcome greater concentration of business in London.
One of the most important guarantees of the exchange's future success, Mr
Lawrence says, is the ability to offer an efficient 'technology platform' to
make securities trading cheap, swift and efficient. Although the exchange
was rebuffed in its bid for a 30 per cent stake in Crest, the successor to
Taurus developed by the Bank of England, Mr Lawrence believes it has a good
chance of being appointed manager of the system.
But technology is only one element of Mr Lawrence's rejuvenation strategy.
He will need to win the confidence and commitment not just of the
stockbrokers and marketmakers who are members of the exchange but of the
corporations which raise capital there and the institutional investors which
provide it. To retain its prominence, the exchange must demonstrate that it
remains the cheapest and most efficient way to raise capital - unless it can
do this, all Mr Lawrence's best intentions will not resurrect its fortunes.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Sanctions and N Korea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That western countries would move towards imposing sanctions upon North
Korea was inevitable following its removal of fuel rods from the Yongbyon
reactor with the apparent intent to make nuclear bombs. Coupled with its
refusal to permit adequate inspections and its withdrawal from the
International Atomic Energy Agency, which carries out the inspections, this
action deserved a response - otherwise the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
would be worthless.
As drafted by the US, the sanctions would be mild, and preceded by a grace
period to give Pyongyang another chance to comply. The avoidance of more
provocative measures is sensible: the world must continue to avoid the
temptation to overreact. Though NPT principles are important, it should be
remembered that India and Pakistan have developed nuclear capabilities with
impunity. It has to be taken into account that North Korea is a small,
isolated country run by an aged maverick who wants more international
respect and has very few cards to play. The decision to draft moderate
sanctions is also useful in that it helps to fend off hotheads in the US who
are calling for precipitate action against Kim Il-sung - including former
senior officials who ought to know better. At the same time, the proposed
measures have a better chance of achieving an international consensus than
would more draconian punishment.
However, it would be pointless to pretend that the action contemplated will
have much actual effect upon North Koreans, who eke out a poor but largely
self-reliant existence. International contacts are so few that their
reduction will barely be noticed. The US has stopped short of proposing a
cut-off of foreign transfers of money because this would probably not be
acceptable to Japan.
Given the absence of real impact, and the possible consequences of imposing
sanctions at all - North Korea promises to wage a 'pitiless war' -
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis without sanctions must be
persevered with until the last possible moment.
Former President Jimmy Carter's current visit to Pyongyang may prove useful.
But China seems to hold the real key - especially as it can veto sanctions
if it believes that their time has not yet arrived. Beijing's efforts to
re-engage Pyongyang over the past week, playing host to officials including
its chief of staff, should be given time to work.
China and Japan, which with South Korea have the most to lose immediately
from failure to resolve the crisis, have traditionally held back from direct
involvement in international disputes. The failure so far of US-led efforts
to bring North Korea round puts an extra onus upon them to use their
influence to do so, to which Beijing and Tokyo appear to be responding. An
Asian diplomatic solution to an Asian problem - backed by the threat of
broader international action if necessary - is the desirable outcome.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Drive into the rising sun: Inroads US cars are making in
Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Making its way down Tokyo's narrow city streets, Chrysler's sturdy Cherokee
Jeep appears as outsized and out-of-place as its name might suggest.
But Yuki and Asami Nagashima are delighted with the US-made vehicle they
bought this year, which offers the kind of spaciousness Japanese families
increasingly crave but few Japanese cars can yet offer.
'At first, we hesitated,' says Mrs Nagashima. 'We thought an American car
would consume a lot of petrol and break down easily. But we liked the
Cherokee's style.'
For the first time in decades, Japanese consumers are taking a serious look
at American cars and are pleased with what they see.
While US and Japanese trade negotiators squabble over ways to break down
trade barriers, US carmakers have lifted sales in Japan to unprecedented
levels. General Motors, the biggest car manufacturer in the US, more than
doubled registrations in Japan last year, to 26,700 units, including its
German-made Opel model. Chrysler, the third biggest American manufacturer,
saw registrations surge last year from some 1,600 to 5,700. Ford also
boosted sales in 1993 by nearly 50 per cent to more than 5,400.
Although the figures are still small in comparison to total Japanese car
sales of more than 4m last year, these successes have fuelled the ambitions
of the Big Three US carmakers in a market once considered impenetrable.
'The Big Three will be able to sell 100,000 cars in the near term. That is
not a dream but a reality,' says Mr Yoshiaki Kanno, head of public relations
at General Motors in Japan.
Chrysler says it expects to double sales this year to 13,000 vehicles. Ford
hopes for a similar growth rate this year and talks optimistically about
selling up to 100,000 imported cars by 2000 (in addition to cars sold with
the Ford marque but manufactured by the Japanese Mazda group). GM is
targeting 100,000 imported units for all GM brands by the turn of the
century.
The Big Three's success in Japan and their confidence about the future, stem
from several important changes in the US car industry, in the carmakers'
approach to the Japanese market and in the Japanese market itself.
First, US cars are perceived in Japan as a much improved product, in sharp
contrast to the perception a decade ago when the Big Three's cars were
notorious for poor quality and high fuel consumption.
'The Big Three have put a lot of effort into raising their quality and there
is little difference between US and Japanese cars,' says Mr Atsushi Horigome
of Tokyo Nissan Auto Sales, a dealer affiliated to the large Japanese
carmaker, which recently began selling Fords.
Such recognition would have been unthinkable a few years ago when the
widespread view in Japan was that American cars fell way behind Japanese
standards. At the time, many Japanese joked that if you heard a noise under
the bonnet of an American car it would be that of a Coke bottle left behind
by the production line workers.
A second factor is the renewed confidence of US manufacturers who believe
their latest models are highly competitive. 'My Lincoln Continental drives
7km a litre. Fuel consumption is much better than Japanese cars of the same
size,' says Mr Konen Suzuki, president of Ford Motor Japan.
The increased attractiveness of US cars has been helped by the growing
number of Japanese travelling and living abroad. 'People no longer see
imported cars as something unfamiliar,' says Mr Shoji Sugimoto, a director
of Yanase, the car importer and dealer which sells GM cars.
But better quality and an improved image alone do not account for the rising
sales. Equally important has been the sharp fall of the dollar against the
yen in recent months, which has made US cars more affordable.
The dollar's weakness has, for instance, led to a fall in the price of the
Cherokee, from Y5.32m two years ago to Y3.7m (Pounds 23,600) today. The
price of Ford's Taurus Wagon has fallen 10 per cent below that of a
comparable Toyota.
US carmakers have also been helped by the uncharacteristic sluggishness of
Japanese competitors' response to changes in market fashions. While US
station wagons have become popular with Japanese families keen for more
spacious vehicles, few Japanese carmakers have responded with a range of
comparable estate cars. 'Japanese station wagons are commercial vehicles,'
says one manager at a US car group scornfully.
This lapse by Japanese carmakers has provided US rivals with an opportunity
to gain a toehold in the local market. At the same time, recession-hit
dealers, desperate to keep their businesses going, are more willing than
ever to sell foreign cars.
'If we can't make money selling Nissan cars, we'll just have to sell Ford
cars,' says Mr Masaru Izumi, chairman of Tokyo Nissan Auto Sales.
Such trends are encouraging US manufacturers to use Japan as a springboard
for boosting sales in the region. 'The Japanese market is the second biggest
after North America. Success here means a big step forward in Asia,' says Mr
Osamu Nagata, marketing manager for Chrysler in Japan.
That explains why the Big Three are strengthening their sales and service
networks in Japan, introducing more right-hand drive cars (the Japanese
drive on the left) and adopting aggressive pricing strategies in an attempt
to secure their foothold in the market.
Ford last month caused a big stir in the industry when it announced a price
of Y2.29m for its 3,800cc 1994 Mustang - cheaper than the nearest
equivalents, the 3,000cc Toyota Supra (Y2.9m) and the cheapest Nissan
Fairlady Z (Y3.5m).
Ford says that while the high yen was a factor behind the low price, there
were broader strategic considerations. 'What Ford is trying to do is
challenge Japanese makers,' says Mr Konen Suzuki, president of Ford Motor
Japan.
US car manufacturers realise that, in spite of their early successes,
further efforts will still be needed to meet the high expectations of
Japanese consumers. Pleased as they are with their Cherokee, the Nagashimas
complain that the car is difficult to drive: 'It's like a truck and the
steering wheel is not in the right position for Japanese drivers,' notes Mrs
Nagashima.
US carmakers also face a race against time. Japanese manufacturers are
beginning to reap the gains of a period of restructuring and the
introduction of new, cheaper models that will be better placed to compete
with American prodcuts. Ford's Mr Suzuki says: 'Japanese carmakers will make
a comeback. So we must win acceptance before that.'

FT  17 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No mood for a shift to United States
of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr BENN STEIL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Presented with a fourth slate of candidates for the Strasbourg
parliament, Europeans were about as excited as they would be by a fourth
plate of lasagne. But the European Union, like an Italian mother, just won't
take 'no' for an answer.
With recent polls revealing growing anti-Maastricht sentiment across Europe,
'citizens of the European Union' were in no mood to ratify further moves
toward the creation of a United States of Europe. Yet, with no outlet for
legitimate desires to keep accountability lodged in national parliaments,
Europeans used the European Parliament elections to deliver a loud, but
garbled, message on the state of the union and domestic politics.
With voter turnout at its lowest since Euro-voting began in 1979,
substantial numbers were effectively endorsing the closest thing to a
pan-European movement; the movement to stop further transfers of sovereign
control to remote supranational institutions. Where well-financed,
anti-Maastricht groupings were on offer, such as in France, voters delivered
stinging rebukes to the main parties. As for the main parties, their
representatives generally vied to woo voters either with nationalist lines
or promises to pick the pork barrel better than the other side.
There are 567 MEPs who are the illegitimate children of this unedifying
affair. They will form a new parliament resembling a Tower of Babel in ways
other than linguistic. Article 138a of the Maastricht treaty emphasises the
importance of European political parties 'as a factor for integration within
the Union'. They contribute, we are told, 'to forming a European awareness
and to expressing the political will of the citizens of Europe'.
With nine contrived and tenuous parliamentary groupings - some including
anti-unionists, and the third largest being the 'non-attached' - anyone with
a 'European awareness' should recognise that they cannot manifest a
'political will'.
Despite the parliament's dubious pedigree, there is a disturbing, almost
religious, aura attached to its status as a 'democratically elected'
institution.
Newly elected MEPs are already crowing about their mission to bring the
Union under 'democratic control and scrutiny', which will largely consist of
exercising their new powers of obstruction under Maastricht provisions. MEPs
of all political hues have united behind gratuitous threats to veto new
commissioners and legislation, all in the service of arrogating more powers
from national governments, and thereby contributing to the construction of
the United States of Europe which Europeans have been saying they don't
want.
'There can be collective European ventures only if the citizens take an
interest and are convinced that the overall direction is the right one'  -
the words of Commission president Jacques Delors. This time, at least, it is
worth taking him seriously.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Broad approach to local government
change is right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sie JOHN BANHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your leader (June 14) you coined a new catch-phrase, the 'Concorde
fallacy' to describe the current review of local government structure in the
English shires now being undertaken by the Local Government Commission -
even though only half of our recommendations are as yet in the public
domain.
As an occasional user of Concorde (although not at the public expense) I am
always impressed with the vision, engineering genius, international
co-operation and quality of service that makes it possible for me to arrive
in New York before I have left London, and fit for work. It would be nice to
think that those now closely involved with local government could match
these characteristics.
The fallacy in your own approach, if I may say so, is shown in your last
paragraph. You acknowledge a case for unitary status for Leicester and
Bristol, and for the abolition of new counties such as Avon and Cleveland.
But there is a substantial number of broadly similar places. If Leicester,
why not Derby and Nottingham? And if not these, why not Plymouth,
Portsmouth, Southampton and a good few others? And Humberside, Cumbria and
Hereford and Worcester?
It must be right to pursue a broad approach to cover all the English shires
and to allow these issues to be aired in front of the commission and local
people so that we may all weigh the evidence for change. It was also right
last year to speed the process up so that local government need not be in
limbo for any longer than is necessary.
In undertaking the review, the commission, often alone among the many
interests concerned, shares most of the concerns to which you now draw
attention. First, the commission has always been clear that the law provides
that it may propose no change in the current structure if that appears to be
what local people want and local circumstances dictate.
Second, the commission has always been concerned to determine, as closely as
can be, the true costs of reorganisation and has put these forward so that
local people can judge whether they wish to pay the price (as in Rutland
where it could be attained for the price of a pint of Ruddles a week for
every household).
Third, we have been very concerned to maintain the strategic capability of
local government. This has been one factor in our decision in many areas to
recommend the retention of the county council and in our wish in nearly
every area to retain the existing structure planning framework. It also
underlines the commission's general preference for any unitary authorities
in rural areas to be larger in pop-ulation terms rather than smaller.
Fourth, the commission is clear that new councils should devolve management
to the local level and provide a bigger role for local councils (an approach
the government espouses in Scotland and Wales but so far seems unwilling to
support in England).
Fifth, the commission is clear that the real stakeholders in local
government, that is local people, should be closely involved in the process
of decision, often to the dismay of local politicians who have their own
interests to promote. That is why the commission is now embarking on an
unprecedented exercise to consult every household on a range of possible
structures, any of which we will be prepared to commend to the secretary of
state.
Far from being an example of the 'Concorde fallacy' the commission's
approach to its task is aimed at testing all the arguments of the proponents
for change thoroughly, including the financial arguments. Then, if change is
to be made, it will be in the light of all the relevant facts. A similar
approach to the development of Concorde would probably have resulted in it
never having been built. What a shame that would have been]
Moreover, it is at least preferable to the 'chattering classes' fallacy: the
notion that officials (and leader writers) in London, often with no di-rect
experience of rural life, know best what is good for the people in places
like Cumberland, the Fens, Huntingdonshire and Rutland. All previous
experience suggests that they do not.

<TEXT>
Sir, In your interesting interview with Tony Blair ('A marketable Danger
Man', June 11/12), it would have been helpful had he outlined his standpoint
on the issue of European Union. John Major has been criticised, rightly or
wrongly, for changing his mind over a two-speed Europe. It has to be
remembered, however, that Mr Blair, together with Margaret Beckett, the
acting Labour leader, and John Prescott, acquiesced in Labour's policy
commitment at the 1983 general election to leave the European Community.

FT  17 JUN 94 / The naked civic servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Tories are in trouble because they are not thinking clearly. Their
curse is not the recession; nor is it inept administration. It is
intellectual. They suffer from what Mr David Willetts, a backbencher with a
brain, calls 'a dangerous uncertainty about the nature of modern
Conservatism'. You and I might have thought that the Tories are no longer
useful because they behave as two parties, in two minds about what they
stand for. Mr Willetts puts it differently. 'The real problem,' he writes in
a pamphlet* out today, 'is that Conservatives have become wary of relying as
heavily on the free market as we appeared to do in the 1980s.' Or, as Mr
Daniel Finkelstein of the Social Market Foundation observes in a foreword,
'the counter-revolution against a rationalist, abstract and universalist
free market triumphalism continues to gather pace'.
Tell us another one. Of course that is what is happening. Capitalism
unfettered is being blamed for all our anxieties. The Thatcherite 1980s
eroded the power of many respected institutions. Lady Thatcher acted on the
advice of, among others, Mr Willetts himself. Much of the medicine was
necessary, but there are these dratted side-effects. In the present decade
we fear an unravelling of our polity, a disconcerting process whose end is
not in sight. Everything is undermined - the civil service, the system of
justice, the monarchy, the professions, the BBC. Mr Willetts defends market
economics against these charges, but he does not exonerate 'neo-Liberals'.
The trouble with them, he says, 'is that they simply think in terms of the
individual economic agent without any understanding of the institutions,
values and ties which are not just good in themselves but are anyway
essential for any real free market to thrive'.
Ah yes, but that is not what the gentleman intimated last night.
'Conservatives have made a useful alliance of convenience with the
free-market neo-Liberals and fought many of the battles of the 1980s with
them,' the ungrateful brute confesses this morning. He didn't say that when
he was enjoying his alliance of convenience. His song now is about enduring
institutions, such as the family and the nation, not to mention important
lasting values, such as honesty, prudence and generosity. These are as much
part of the make-up of a true Conservative as good management practice,
fiscal prudence, voluntary societies, a proper legal framework - and the
free market. 'The challenge facing both our main political parties,' he
writes, 'is to formulate a coherent set of policies which shows that, as
well as for the individual, there must be a role for collective action, but
that collective action does not necessarily mean state action.'
Mr Willetts has produced a robust defence of this currently apposite
proposition. It is closely argued, often thought-provoking. 'Civic
conservatism' could catch on, as a phrase. Alas, the substance of his thesis
is undermined by what he leaves out. He clearly favours local
self-determination, but dodges the issue of local government, which his lot
have all but destroyed. He defends the health and education reforms, but
does not address the dangers of corruption inherent in appointments from the
centre, made by ministers of his party. He warns of the 'damage which
enormous concentrations of economic, political and legislative power in the
hands of government can do', but appears not to understand that over the
past 15 years it is his, Conservative, government that has wielded that
power.
Someone equal to the task should be brought forward to rebut him. Enter Dr
John Gray, a political theorist and, once, a fellow-traveller among
neo-Liberals. Dr Gray's pamphlet**, due next week, is advertised in Mr
Willetts's as 'one of a pair', which could be said of either Punch or Judy.
Punch Gray will argue that the destruction of institutions and values has
now gone so far as to be irreversible. We let the free market rip and now we
must pay the price. There is no turning back to one-nation Toryism. The only
remaining undisputed value in our society is choice, self realisation,
individual advancement. You cannot recreate the traditional family, or a
sense of duty and loyalty. It is too late. As Mr Willetts reminds us, Dr
Gray is apt to quote Wittgenstein's remark that 'trying to repair a broken
tradition is like a man trying to mend a broken spider's web with his bare
hands'.
It could be that a reassembled tradition is offered by Mr David Selbourne's
The Principle of Duty, published this week by Sinclair-Stevenson. This is
one of those essays that most of us know is important but cannot quite
understand. It is described as 'the most comprehensive theory of civic
society in English since Locke', and perhaps that is so. Mr Selbourne
attempts to shift the basis of political theory from talk of rights to an
equation, in which the duties of society to the citizen are matched by the
duties of the citizen to society. As I read him, he challenges 'self
realisation through unimpeded freedom of action' as an overriding goal, but
also rejects the notion that welfare and work are natural rights. His
principle, he tells us, 'remains in essence a principle of moral expectation
 -the expectation that the citizen will respect the civic bond and
voluntarily accept co-responsibility for the civic order - and of
anticipatory moral disapproval if he does not'.
What beats me is how the ethical expectations of any of these three
contemporary political philosophers can be met in a secular society. On the
other side of the Atlantic there is talk of certain values, such as
'fairness' and 'justice', as natural to the human condition. You do not need
a religion to sustain them. They simply arise because, as conscious beings,
we see the utility of them. This may be so, but every night the TV news
suggests otherwise. We can be sure that to declare a belief in minimal
government and the free market is an insufficient response to the need of
most human beings to be part of a stable family in a settled community. Mr
Willetts is right about that; so is Dr Gray. So, for that matter, is today's
Labour party, which is another reason why the Conservatives are in such a
deep hole.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Arts: Peri's 'Euridice' - Baroque opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opera, one of the first musical innovations of the Baroque period, was
represented at this year's Lufthansa Festival of Baroque Music - celebrating
its tenth anniversary - by Jacopo Peri's Euridice, the earliest surviving
opera. But Euridice is not a work best encountered, as on Wednesday at St
James's Church, Piccadilly, in concert form: apart from its novel,
declamatory music the interest lies in the way Peri, the so-called
'inventor' of opera, was exploring the theatrical possibilities of the new
medium.
Euridice (1600) does not require a complicated staging. The action, which
departs from the tragic myth and returns Eurydice to Orpheus - a happy end
was required since the opera was written as a wedding entertainment - is
straightforward; the settings, a forest glade and the underworld, can be
left to the spectator's imagination. In the absence of these, the dramatic
burden falls on the music, and Wednesday's performance was too cool and
reflective.
The 'period' group Combattimento has a fine sense of musical style, but
David Roblou's direction from the keyboards - harpsichord, organ, regal -
was often over-relaxed. Some of the singers treated Euridice as an oratorio,
singing with little inflection of tone, which is fine for the limited
emotions of sacred music but makes for no dramatic spark. Even some who had
to impersonate more than one character seemed limited to a single vocal
colour. There were a few outstanding exceptions, in each case the singers
best able to make something of the Italian text.
Mark Tucker was a poignant tenor Orpheus (a role first taken by the composer
himself), and found emotion in every word of his excellent Italian. Liliana
Mazzarri was a charming Eurydice - though the title role, a small part - and
she, too, had the temperament the music requires. Sarah Connolly's Tragedy
sang the Prologue with poise, and Kym Amps made something of her Nymph and
Venus. Ian Caddy's powerful Pluto outsang them all, and his simple gestures
helped: the Pluto-Orpheus encounter was one of the few episodes all evening
to come to convincing life.
The Lufthansa Festival of Baroque Music continues at St James's, Piccadilly,
and the Wigmore Hall until June 30.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Arts: Hamlet in the Park - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This most excellent canopy the air, look you . . . It makes a difference to
when you can see the firmament Hamlet is talking about, and here is one of
the gains of watching Hamlet in the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park. With
the sky above he counts himself king of infinite space; amid the theatre he
might be bounded in a nutshell.
The three other strengths of Tim Pigott-Smith's staging are its clarity of
utterance, its concision, and its protagonist. Every word registers, even
from actors who a fortnight ago were often inaudible in A Midsummer Night's
Dream. The play has been cut (not only is Hamlet's address to the players
gone, so is the play the players usually speak) so tautly that the
audience's attention never flags. As for young Damian Lewis (just a year out
of drama school) as Hamlet, everything he does has the audience firmly held.
Strikingly equipped with a tide of Tudor red hair, burning blue eyes, heroic
bones and good build, this Hamlet works hard to win his authority over the
play, but win it he does. He speaks the lines 'with good accent and good
discretion', and he has both virility and stillness. He is a Hamlet both
Romantic (frozen in melancholy, vivid in action) and modern (playing at
crude aperies in his 'madness', sardonically rude). He manages both to
relate freshly to everyone else onstage and to suggest that Hamlet's mind is
always at one remove from everyone around him.
Remarkably, he achieves this by working within very narrow confines. His
vocal register is seldom more than a minor third, he makes no particular
play between piano and forte, he employs no great contrasts of speed during
his soliloquies. Yet one attends to him. He has not yet bent the role to his
will, has not relaxed within its rigours so that we trust his command of it,
is still shifting in his way of addressing the audience - and yet one
attends to him.
One attends to his chief colleagues, but with considerable less gratitude.
Ophelia (Rebecca Egan) is a pushy modern miss, Gertrude (Pamela Miles) a
slow and unemotional marshmallow, Claudius (Paul Freeman) a flamboyant
thespian of flashing eyes and rolling Rs, Polonius (David Collings) a tepid
old trouper. Everything the last three actors do tells us, with emphatically
actorish deliberation, that they are actors of the Old School - a school so
old one thought it was dead. Their experience makes its effect, but I cannot
believe in their characterisations for a moment.
The production is set, more or less, in Georgian times: Empire-line dresses,
frock coats, trousers and waistcoats. The way poor Gertrude kept hitching
her skirts around told us only too clearly that the 19th century just wasn't
her time; she only relaxed when put into a nightie for the closet scene. And
why has the designer, Tanya McCallin, allowed Gertrude and Ophelia to wear
hairdos that are so blatantly modern that they clash with their frocks? The
effect is cheap - as if the Open Air Theatre could not afford wigs. But
these irritations are peripheral. Hamlet is alive in Regent's Park, and
Hamlet is more than promising.

<TEXT>
Mountains made of barking says Wim Vandekeybus. An evening made of torment,
say I. A theatre-piece made of modish nonsense. An event made of mindless
aggression, irrational posturing, cheap effects.
Five years ago we saw Vandekeybus' London debut with What the body does not
remember, which told of the new dance-theatre emerging in Belgium. It might
look at moments like Euro-crash - bodies slamming to the floor; danger the
essential in every step - but its emotional force and wild logic, its
skilled disdain for hazard, were hugely effective. I called it 'essential
viewing' in these pages.
Since then Vandekeybus has become popular, much seen on the international
post-modern circuit - one of the less engaging circles of hell - and he has
returned to London with creations in which dance has seemed increasingly
unenterprising, increasingly a slave of an oblique, angry theatre. It is, I
suppose, par for the course in our dislocated age, and one must accept the
work of Vandekeybus and his fellow choreographers as symptomatic of a time
when new dance-theatre makes much of anxiety and frustration, and little of
movement invention.
But I find Vandekeybus' latest piece - seen at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on
Tuesday and Wednesday - self-indulgent and unworthy. The illogicalities of
nightmare, a trip to film in North Africa, the presence of a blind Moroccan
actor in his troupe, seem part of the paraphernalia of this 90 minute trial.
Other ingredient include Vandekeybus' favoured slam-dancing procedures
(which look very old-fashioned nowadays); din (the thump of drums
reverberating in one's chest-bone); kamikaze relationships between men and
women; a German chap haranguing us; Vandekeybus' home-movies of 'My trip to
Morocco' to bore us; something nasty happening to a chicken on film; male
nudity and public washing (completed by a shower of sand - and grit in the
underpants); a tea-party; a girl having her ears cleaned; chatter; furry
masks; a palanquin made of brooms. (What a list]) It is a sequence of
demonic energy and diabolical racket, and is as muddled and pointless as
someone else's nightmare - when you bite back the words: 'See an analyst.'
As an exercise in re-heated surrealism - lacking, alas, the elegance of
means that earlier games with the psyche had - it is an unmitigated vexation
to the spirit. I do not find that Vandekeybus thinks at any moment as a
choreographer in Mountains made of barking. Dance for him is a blunt
instrument with which to hammer home brute theatrical points. He has an eye
for quick and predictable design effects and for the coarsest stage tricks.
The result has the unfocussed vehemence of a mob, and is about as enjoyable
to watch.
On Monday in my piece on Lost Ballerinas, I was misinformed about the cost
of putting a student through the ENB school, which should have read Pounds
14,700.

Pity television's poor old sports departments, they hardly know where to
send the outside broadcast units next, what with soccer in Chicago, cricket
at Lord's, golf in Oakmont, racing at Ascot, and tennis in Eastbourne. As
usual the cricket begins in the morning on Radio 4 long wave and on BBC1.
From 1.50 this afternoon there is two hours of cricket and racing on BBC1,
and at 2.20 BBC2 joins in with a combination of Test cricket, racing and
tennis. Then at 7.00 comes the opening ceremony of the 1994 World Cup in
'Grandstand' on BBC1, followed by the first half of the first game between
Germany and Bolivia. The second half is on BBC2 at 9.00, and at 11.10 ITV
shows the game between Spain and South Korea in World Cup Football. At 11.15
BBC2 begins 55 minutes of Golf: US Open, and highlights from Cricket: Second
Test start on BBC1 at 12.15. If you loathe sport Radio 3 offers Where Are
They Now? devoted to composer Cyril Rootham, who claimed that he would be
remembered as greater than Edward Elgar (9.20). BBC2 shows the five
semi-finalists in the graphics section of the BBC Design Awards (10.00).

FT  17 JUN 94 / Arts: Scott Inquiry takes centre stage / Review of 'Half the
Picture' at the Tricycle Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The best tribute to Richard Norton-Taylor's dramatised version of the Scott
Inquiry into British arms sales to Iraq is the discussion it provokes at the
end. This takes place in the theatre with a formal chairman, a panel of
lawyers, journalists, politicians and, as with Question Time on television,
the audience is encouraged to join in.
On the first night Paul Henderson, managing director of Matrix Churchill,
the company that supplied the weapons material, was a member of the panel.
He said that the stage version, including its portrayal of him as a man who
spied for his country then was shopped by his own government, was broadly
accurate.
For the rest, there was a split among the audience. Some believed that
practically any kind of arms sales is immoral. Others recognised that the
central point is the government was prepared to let people who had helped it
go to prison and sought to conceal the evidence that would have protected
them.
In between, on which there was little disagreement, there was a great deal
about excessive government secrecy.
That is the trouble with Scott Inquiry. What precisely is it about? We shall
not know the full answer until we have the Scott report towards the end of
the year, by which time many of the ministers involved may be out of office.
Some of them, like Alan Clark, already are.
So it is not surprising that it is also the problem with Norton-Taylor's
piece. Half the Picture takes its name from a statement by Sir Robin Butler,
the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, on answering questions
in Parliament: 'You should not try to mislead . . . You give some
information that you safely can . . . Half the picture can be true'.
Norton-Taylor is a journalist on the Guardian who has long campaigned for
greater freedom of information. There are no particular distortions, except
perhaps in tone of voice, in Half The Picture.
Almost every word is taken from written or spoken evidence to the Scott
Inquiry.
How far you appreciate it may depend on how well you know the subject, and
we would all know the subject even better if the inquiry had been televised
in the first place. The word is that Sir Richard Scott turned down the
request because he regarded television as a medium mainly for entertainment.
Scott was wrong: his hearings would have made riveting television by any
standards, both entertaining and informative.
If you can televise Parliament, including Select Committees, surely there is
a compelling case for televising a public inquiry into the working of
government.
Norton-Taylor does well with the material on stage. All the characters are
there. Sylvia Syms is a severe Lady Thatcher and avoids falling too far into
parody. Jan Chappell is a precocious pushy Presiley Baxendale QC, the woman
who asks most of the questions. Michael Stroud plays Scott.
Arguably the piece is too kind to Alan Clark who has become a cult figure
even with a predominantly left wing audience in Kilburn. Played by Jeremy
Clyde he is almost cheered for his outrageous nonchalance. Norton-Taylor,
too, plainly has a soft spot for Michael Heseltine (David Robb) who is the
nearest to a hero on the government side.
Directed by Nicolas Kent, Half The Picture remains a documentary rather than
a play, but it is an outstanding example of the theatre as a place for
public discussion.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Management: Learn the lessons of history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlike their counterparts in politics, the armed forces and the legal
profession, many business leaders would agree with Henry Ford that 'history
is bunk'. They see little use for it. The loss is theirs - and that of their
employees and shareholders.
If Kenneth Olsen, founder and former head of Digital Equipment, had had a
better grasp of America's 19th century industrial history, his company might
not have plunged into the deep trouble in which it is now struggling. The
same is true of IBM, Kodak and a string of other leading companies on both
sides of the Atlantic that are having to go through fire to replace obsolete
technologies.
They are suffering from a phenomenon that has plagued successful large
enterprises at least since industrialisation began: the tendency to react
inappropriately to a technology or other kind of radical innovation that
threatens their core business.
Some companies fail to notice an innovation until it is too late. Others
reject it, re-investing desperately but usually ineffectively in their
existing technology or business. Still others embrace it, but only
half-heartedly.
Whatever their reaction, the net result is what James Utterback, a professor
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calls the disturbing
regularity with which leading companies 'follow their core technologies into
obsolescence and obscurity'.
In different ways, Digital and IBM both mishandled the emergence of personal
computers, under-rating vastly the impact that PCs would have on their mini
and mainframe businesses.
Digital then compounded the problem by its schizophrenia towards new Risc
(reduced instruction set computing) architecture for computer workstations.
It was slow to move into it and, torn by its long commitment to its old VAX
technology, continued to make parallel investments in the latter for far too
long. As a result it was torn by indecision and turf warfare. By contrast,
its smaller arch-rival Sun Microsystems broke single-mindedly with its old
workstation technology and prospered.
Digital was probably more at fault than most companies. For, as Utterback
shows in a fascinating and very readable new historical study* of how
companies can seize the initiative in the face of technological change, one
of the most instructive past examples occurred in Digital's own
Massachusetts backyard.
Over the four decades to 1860, the New England ice-cutting industry built a
formidable delivery business across large swathes of America. The New
Englanders invested steadily in so-called 'incremental' innovation,
improving their processes and productivity sharply.
But then a threatening 'radical' innovation arrived: mechanical ice-making
machines from France, which allowed the product to be made near its markets.
Over the next 30 years machine-made ice took over from the natural variety,
even though the cutters ploughed more resources than ever into process
improvements. But they steadfastly refused to embrace the new. None even
experimented with carrying their ice south in refrigerated ships.
Utterback's book is full of such examples. They include the self-defeating
ways in which companies and their famous leaders - even the redoubtable
Thomas Edison - reacted to successive 19th-century innovations; how
Remington came to dominate the new typewriter industry only to cede
leadership to IBM 80 years later when the electric age arrived; and the
near-lethal resistance of Goodyear and Firestone to Michelin's radial tyre
technology in the 1970s.
Only in what Utterback calls non-assembled products, such as tyres, glass,
and other continuous processes, do incumbents such as Michelin have a good
track record in either pioneering the new, or switching to it when under
threat.
Utterback's analysis offers many other lessons for the hard-pressed modern
manager. They include:
Radical innovation is uncomfortable, but vital. If a company does only
short-term, incremental innovation, it is failing to prepare for the future.
It is hastening the inevitable decline of its business.
Most radical innovations are less surprising than they seem. They exist in
embryo for many years before they become commercially significant, and are
based on well-known technical information or components - which defending
companies sometimes possess themselves.
Yet in many industries radical innovations almost always come from outside
the industry. So 'benchmarking' and the collection of competitive
intelligence should not be limited to industries resembling one's own.
Instead, new company activity in other fields should also be monitored.
It is hard enough for a company to follow a 'dual strategy' of defending its
old technology and developing the new. Doing so in the same part of the
organisation is a recipe for conflict and suppression of the new. Part of
the solution is to establish a separate and very independent unit.
The trouble is that most such units have always suffered an unfortunate
fate, which Utterback does not discuss. The moment they have shown signs of
success, they have tended to be wrapped back into the main organisation, and
their innovative drive stifled rather than spread.
IBM might not be in quite such a mess today if, instead of following this
predictable pattern, it had given its originally independent PC unit longer
life, and cloned the same approach for other innovations. But, like Olsen,
IBM's recent leaders never bothered to learn such lessons from history.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Management: Put on your thinking caps - Edward de Bono tells
Lucy Kellaway about the benefits of his new Six Hats approach to meetings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edward de Bono can barely keep the scorn from his voice as he dismisses the
teachings of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. The Gang of Three, as he calls
them, have locked western societies into rigid patterns of thought that have
sapped our energy and creativity, leaving us ill-prepared for a world that
is changing rapidly.
Luckily there is a saviour in sight - in the shape of de Bono himself. The
man who introduced the world to lateral thinking has come up with a new
process, the Six Thinking Hats, with which he feels he has trumped the
classical philosophers once and for all.
Sitting over a glass of water at the Criterion Restaurant in London he fires
off a description of the Six Hats, impatiently shrugging off questions,
especially the sceptical ones. These hats promise to make every manager -
nay, every human being - more effective, he says.
By making all participants think in parallel the system can cut meeting
times in half. For the average manager, who spends 40 per cent of each day
in meetings, the savings could mean the equivalent of an extra day a week.
The six hats are already well established in the US. IBM, Du Pont and
Federal Express wear them. So does the Mormon Church. In Japan NTT has been
converted to six-hatted thinking, as has Marzotto in Italy.
But in the UK they are still pretty obscure, hence the thinker's flying
visit. On Tuesday night he packed the Institute of Directors to explain the
principles to business leaders and a few politicians. 'The Six Hats are a
fundamental change in the basis of western thought,' he explains. 'The
standard way of discussion is to discover the truth by naming an untruth.
This is very limited. My method gets away from that to parallel thinking.'
The method may be revolutionary and universal, but what exactly is it? De
Bono explains that each hat has a colour and stands for a particular thought
process.
The white one is for gathering information. The red is for feelings and
emotions. The black hat is for caution, criticism and assessing risks.
(British people are particularly fond of this one, he says, and warns that
it should not be over-used.) The yellow one is for looking at benefits and
for studying feasibility. The green hat is for new ideas and possibilities.
And the blue one is the 'meta' hat which manages the whole thinking process.
At any one time everyone in a meeting wears the same colour hat, and
together they work through the colours to consider the issue from every
angle.
De Bono is unimpressed by any suggestion that his hats are just a gimmicky
way of describing what we do anyway. 'I did an experiment of 250 executives
in Canada. I divided them into two groups, and asked one to judge a subject,
and the other to judge it wearing the Yellow Hat for two minutes and the
Black Hat for two minutes.'
The group that used the hats performed three times as well as the other
group, which looked at the pros and cons in an undisciplined way. 'The
chemical setting in the brain is different when thinking positively and
negatively. If you try to do both at the same time you do not do either
properly,' he explains.
But might not some people find it irritating to be told what sort of hat to
wear? Not a bit of it, he says, the hats help people think better, and as as
soon as they realise the advantage there is no stopping them.
Apparently at the Prudential in Canada the hats have been woven into the
carpet. At Marzotto in Italy there are hat posters plastered over the walls.
By getting all participants to think in parallel, the discussion becomes
faster, the final decision clearer. Everyone uses their full intellectual
horsepower, as each person is forced to be positive, negative, creative and
so on. The hats also do away with egos and politics, as there is no scope
for people to block ideas by wearing the black hat throughout.
Asking people to wear different coloured hats may bring out thoughts that
would otherwise have been suppressed. At a meeting of US senior executives
from Rothmans, the tobacco multinational, de Bono asked whether the company
should set up clinics to help people stop smoking. With red hats on, two
thirds said it was a good idea. 'That would never have emerged in an
ordinary discussion. They may not want to set up a clinic now, but may keep
it for next time they are really under pressure,' he says.
He claims his system translates into all cultures: in Japan it allows
subordinates to express their feelings or to point out a danger, in a way
that would otherwise be unthinkable. At The Sowetan, a South African
newspaper, it has been used as a way of discussing complicated emotional
issues without becoming too bogged down.
De Bono thinks the Six Hats may gain an even greater hold than his earlier
work because it is both simple and universally applicable. Indeed, it is so
big that he feels he cannot carry it alone. 'If it just depends on me, then
I am restricted on the time I am available and on price.' He has decided to
franchise his ideas, and has already licensed 200 trainers in the US to
spread the gospel. This week he announced that Svend Holst, a training
consultant based in Buckinghamshire, will be his UK disciple.
De Bono thinks the system goes far beyond meetings between managers;
politicians and families could wear the hats to advantage. 'I'd like to see
Parliament using it,' he says, giving his only smile of the interview. This
is meant to acknowledge that he cannot see it happening. I'm not so sure: I
can just hear Betty Boothroyd, the speaker of the House, saying: 'Will Right
Honourable members now put on their Green Hats.'

FT  17 JUN 94 / Technology (R&amp;D Scoreboard): Collaborate to innovate and
survive - Alan Cane examines why electronics companies are joining forces to
share costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electronics companies that were once bitter enemies are forming
unprecedented alliances aimed at cutting research and development costs and
improving effectiveness. Collaboration has become the name of the game at an
international level, as companies find themselves squeezed between
spiralling research costs and revenues forced down by recession and price
competition.
For example, Unisys, one of the largest US computer manufacturers, has
abandoned its own semiconductor operations, saving itself Dollars 100m
(Pounds 67m) a year. The advanced chips for its new large machines will be
made by International Business Machines, the world's largest computer
company and still a fierce competitor. Unisys, marginally profitable after
several troubled years, spent Pounds 348m on R&amp;D last year, well down on the
Pounds 505m spent in 1990 but still equivalent to 6.65 per cent of sales.
Many large companies in the electrical and electronics sector have found it
necessary to cut R&amp;D spending in line with reduced revenues. Siemens of
Germany took premier place in the sector last year with spending of almost
Pounds 3bn, a decline of 8 per cent on the year before. IBM, formerly the
world's R&amp;D powerhouse, was a whisker behind, but cut its spending by 13 per
cent.
Bill O'Riordan of Imperial College, London, who is also head of research and
advanced technology for ICL, the UK-based computer company owned by Fujitsu
of Japan, says there are two reasons why collaboration has taken on a new
importance.
First, no single company can afford the costs of building and managing
systems of today's complexity without help. ICL benefited greatly throughout
the 1980s from an alliance with Fujitsu which gave it privileged access to
the Japanese company's semiconductor technology.
It was an appreciation, however, of the funding level necessary to stay at
the forefront of innovation that led the company to takeover by Fujitsu.
Today, ICL, at Pounds 208m a year, spends substantially more than any other
non-listed UK company; ICL's R&amp;D represents 7.96 per cent of its Pounds
2.6bn sales.
Second, unless companies collaborate, their ability to respond quickly to
change deteriorates. The value of the experience built up by their
scientists and engineers withers in a rapidly changing environment unless
they are exposed to fresh stimuli. O'Riordan says: 'When you collaborate,
you innovate; when you don't, you invent.'
For many companies, collaboration has become an essential feature of
corporate restructuring. Amdahl, a US company which pioneered
plug-compatible mainframe computers, functionally identical to IBM's, seemed
in trouble a year ago. Sales were stagnant as customers turned away from
mainframes towards apparently more cost-effective networked computer
systems. R&amp;D spending was, at Pounds 226m, 19.9 per cent of sales, the
second highest in the global ranking.
Amdahl's business plan called for the company to move down from sales of
Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 1.5bn. R&amp;D spending had to be brought in line. The
solution was a technology collaboration with Fujitsu, owner of a minority
stake in the company.
Amdahl abandoned ECL (emitter-coupled logic) circuitry, which is fast but
pricey, in favour of Fujitsu's cheaper CMOS (complementary metal oxide
silicon) alternative. Fujitsu now designs and builds the computer; Amdahl
builds in the features which enable the machines to compete directly with
IBM.
The leading semiconductor companies, Intel and Motorola of the US, have
pushed up R&amp;D spending by 24 per cent and 16 per cent respectively as they
battle to maintain their chip designs as industry standards. Even they are
finding collaboration with other companies essential.
Motorola, Apple and IBM are working together on a design called 'Power PC'.
Last week, Intel and Hewlett-Packard announced they were working together on
a new generation of microprocessor chips which could dictate the direction
of computer technology into the next century.
Software companies are, for the moment, an exception to the trend. SAP of
Germany spends 25 per cent of its Pounds 428m revenues in developing R3, a
highly successful accounting package. Quality Software Products of the UK
has spent Pounds 16m over the past few years in developing a competitive
product. Bigger software companies often buy smaller ones to add an
attractive software product to their catalogue without incurring R&amp;D costs.
The pressure to spend on R&amp;D has in no way diminished. In the future most
companies will be able to survive and advance only by sharing costs.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Technology (R&amp;D Scoreboard): Anomalies in the reporting
system - Andrew Jack describes why UK financial disclosure methods need
updating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sipping Frascati does not normally bring accountancy to mind, but it has
proved a heady legacy for those struggling with current UK financial
reporting standards on research and development.
Existing requirements are based on the work of a paper prepared by the
Frascati committee of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development in the 1960s for its own data collection.
SSAP 13, the accounting standard that deals with R&amp;D, was introduced in 1977
and last revised in 1989. It still uses these same OECD guidelines for the
recognition of R&amp;D.
But David Tonkin, head of Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monitor of
accounts that compiled the R&amp;D Scoreboard for the Department of Trade and
Industry, says: 'There's a problem of definition.'
He says the OECD concentrates on an outdated science-based definition, split
between pure and applied research and development. It misses out areas of
spending such as intellectual property, including computer software
development.
He also highlights a number of other limitations to reporting requirements
on the topic in the UK. For example, foreign-owned companies with British
operations do not have to disclose their spending in the local accounts if
it is funded from abroad.
To add to the confusion, there are differences between the accounting
standard in the UK and elsewhere, such as in the US where all such
expenditure must be taken against the profit and loss account and not
capitalised, says Ken Wild, accounting technical partner at Touche Ross.
An issue for UK standards setters is whether companies should similarly be
allowed to allocate R&amp;D between the profit and loss account and the balance
sheet.
Deferral is currently allowed for expenditure on projects if their technical
feasibility and commercial viability can be assessed with reasonable
certainty.
'It is very subjective,' says Tonkin, who opposes making the guidelines more
restrictive. 'In my view this is precisely what we want out of disclosure:
for directors to make judgments and to put their reputations on the line.'
The result of all these anomalies is that companies can in good faith find
themselves struggling to represent fairly all their R&amp;D expenditure because
of the guidelines' limitations.
There is nothing to stop them providing additional voluntary disclosures
outside the scope of the standard, to reveal what they consider to be a
fairer view. They now also have scope in the Operating and Financial Review,
the new set of voluntary guidelines circulated last year by the Accounting
Standards Board.
Few do so, however. There is considerable evidence that many companies are
failing to even disclose the minimal amounts required by SSAP 13, with all
its current faults: something to which regulators need to pay greater heed.
An analysis of R&amp;D undertaken for the Financial Times by Company Reporting
for 521 companies with year-ends up to the end of May 1994 shows that 213
provide some indication of research and development activity. This is
normally in the form of commentary in the chairman's statement, or an
accounting policy note.
In three-quarters of these companies, the value is disclosed and charged to
income. In a smaller number of cases, companies disclose spending in the
directors' report rather than - as the law requires - the accounts.
However, in 22 per cent of cases there is no disclosure of the income effect
provided anywhere in the financial statements. Examples include Asda, BAA,
Bass, Cable &amp; Wireless and Guinness.
In response, some companies argue that the amount concerned is not material.
Others that it would make them vulnerable to competitive disadvantage if
they disclosed the amount to their rivals.
Tonkin disagrees. 'Companies should be debarred from making disclosures
about items that are not material,' he says. 'It is misleading. Otherwise
the chairman is going on about something that doesn't exist.'
Meanwhile, the OECD is in discussions over a revised version of its own R&amp;D
definitions. Readers of accounts can only hope that its members do not get
too carried away drinking Frascati before they finish their drafting.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Technology (R&amp;D Scoreboard): A killing through contracts -
Independent R&amp;D sources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL KENWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As companies emerge from recession, their thirst for R&amp;D could increase. One
way to satisfy this without piling on the overheads is to contract out R&amp;D,
or acquire technology from other sources.
'I see R&amp;D as one of the corporate activities that the larger corporations
will seek to outsource,' says Peter Watson, who has just left British Rail,
where he was board member for engineering, to become chief executive of AEA
Technology.
The company, based at Harwell in Oxfordshire and a product of Britain's
nuclear power programme, is the country's largest technical services
organisation. With a turnover of about Pounds 150m, AEA Technology is
destined for privatisation. It is, says Watson, one of a number of
independent R&amp;D organisations that are 'coming much more aggressively to the
private sector' to sell their services.
Much of the activity of AEA Technology falls into the area of technical
services rather than straight R&amp;D. For instance, it optimises plant
performance and helps companies to meet new safety and environmental
regulations - activities with a high technical content which might not be
central to a company's own business.
Faced with a diversity of technical topics, 'you cannot rely purely on your
own resources', says Watson. 'You cannot cover all of the emerging
technologies. You have to find a way to fill the gap.' He naturally sees
contract R&amp;D and technical support as an area destined for rapid growth.
Paul Auton also sees a bright future for contract research. Auton is the
chairman of the Association of Independent Research &amp; Technology
Organisations and managing director of Cambridge Consultants, which had a
turnover of Pounds 14m last year. AIRTO's members employ 7,000 people and
have an annual turnover in excess of Pounds 320m. This may seem like small
beer alongside the overall spending on R&amp;D by corporate Britain, but the
larger AIRTO members would appear well up the R&amp;D Scoreboard. Pera
International, for example, has a turnover in excess of Pounds 31m.
Pera's work shows the spread of activities that companies buy in. As well as
contract R&amp;D, Pera also operates a membership scheme that gives companies
access to consultancy services and information through a large number of
databases at no cost on top of the annual fee. Ron Armstrong, chief
executive of Pera, points to a sudden increase in membership as another
indicator of growing interest in contracting out.
The customers of the contract research organisations want more than just
R&amp;D, however. Both Pera and CCL have seen an increasing demand for help in
technology management.
'Companies join Pera because we offer a range of business and technology
services,' says Armstrong. These include management and marketing as well as
advice on such issues as patent protection and technical aspects of European
legislation.
Auton says that other services are also in increasing demand from contract
research organisations, including project management and advising companies
on how to exploit their technology portfolios. Auton estimates that this
kind of consultancy work accounts for around 20 per cent of CCL's business.
Another new phenomenon in contract research is that of the corporate
laboratory operating as a stand-alone R&amp;D unit for third-party customers as
well as its own parent. The Central Research Laboratory of Thorn EMI, which
had a turnover of Pounds 8.6m last year, now derives as much income from
external clients - 37 per cent of the total - as it does from Thorn EMI.
As well as contract R&amp;D, product development and its own production
activities, CRL also earns 27 per cent of its income through technology
licensing.
Contract research is by no means new to corporate researchers. Companies
have increasingly taken a customer/contractor approach in their internal
R&amp;D. Research centres work on a contract and project basis for operating
divisions.
Contract research will not hit the headlines in the same way as in-house
R&amp;D. 'What companies buy from people like us is competitive advantage and
they don't want their rivals to know they are buying it,' says Keith Jones,
who was recently recruited from Cambridge Consultants to become commercial
manager at CRL.
Jones says companies may want to keep the technology hidden from their
competitors or might be reluctant to admit that they buy in technology.
Jones finds this puzzling. 'You could argue that it should be the other way
round,' he explains. After all, a willingness to adopt ideas, or technology,
from elsewhere is 'a true sign that you are a progressive and innovative
company'.
Companies are happier to talk about their links with the academic research
community. The web of relationships between industry and academia is wide
but accounts for a small fraction of the corporate R&amp;D budgets, or of the
universities' income.
Industry spent Pounds 122m in UK universities in 1992-93, a little over 10
per cent of their income from grants and contracts and about half as much as
the universities received from research charities such as the Wellcome
Trust.
The universities' income from industry may be less than that of contract
research organisations but it is no less valuable or productive. Companies
turn to universities for ideas that will have an impact in the longer term
rather than for new products.
Research costs less than development and can deliver more new ideas per
pound invested.
Universities cannot carry out market-oriented product research, says Peter
Seraga, director of Philips's UK research laboratory at Redhill in Surrey.
The Dutch electronics company is expanding its contract research with
universities, Seraga explains, but he fears that universities are getting
pulled into shorter term research.
Philips likes working with universities because they give the laboratory's
250 or so staff access to the frontiers of research. The laboratory is a
leading player in Philips's work on multimedia technologies.
Its university links include projects with the Royal College of Art and
Imperial College, bringing together artists and engineers to develop
software for the production of multimedia titles on CD-Rom, optical disks
that can store images and sound.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Technology (R&amp;D Scoreboard): Focusing on the breakthrough -
Competition in the drugs sector is increasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Drugs companies may be suffering from lower profit margins as a result of
healthcare reforms in many countries, but they remain among the most
enthusiastic investors in the creation of new products.
The International Scoreboard shows pharmaceutical R&amp;D spending 11 per cent
higher in 1993 than in 1992, with some companies boosting spending by more
than 25 per cent.
But behind the bare figures lies a structural change in the way that drugs
companies manage their R&amp;D budgets.
The impetus for the change is that sales growth has stalled in many areas.
Those who ultimately pay for drugs - insurance companies and their policy
holders in the US, and governments elsewhere - have decided to drive hard
bargains with pharmaceutical companies in an effort to control the cost of
healthcare.
Many drug makers have responded to falling profit margins by cutting staff
and reducing the number of manufacturing sites. But price competition has,
if anything, increased the need for effective R&amp;D.
R&amp;D directors have adjusted their strategies to try to maximise the chances
of discovering a breakthrough product. The first moves were to drop the
development of drugs that provided little advance over existing treatments.
They then gave more emphasis to research into areas such as cancer,
Alzheimer's and arthritis.
With that, however, has come the realisation that no company has the
resources to research every promising field. 'The industry recognises that
technological self-sufficiency is no longer attainable,' says George Poste,
head of R&amp;D at SmithKline Beecham. 'It must be strengthened by alliances.'
As a further incentive to external R&amp;D spending, the companies with which
alliances are usually cemented - biotechnology companies - are
entrepreneurial and hard working and can offer huge rewards for success
through share options. This means that much of the best work is being
conducted there, says Jan Leschly, chief executive at SmithKline Beecham.
'Biotechnology companies can attract the geniuses,' he says.
Across the pharmaceutical industry, between 15 per cent and 25 per cent of
R&amp;D spending is already external, says Switzerland's Roche. 'This has been
rising recently and will continue to rise,' it says.
The importance of the change is probably understated in the official R&amp;D
figures. Many pharmaceutical companies have taken equity stakes in
biotechnology companies as a means of gaining access to expertise. Such
stakes are classed as investments rather than R&amp;D spending.
If drugs industry executives needed further convincing of the wisdom of
spreading the R&amp;D risk, they need only look at how some manufacturers
conspicuously fail to benefit from even very high levels of in-house
spending.
Syntex of the US ranked number one in 1993 among large pharmaceuticals
companies for R&amp;D spending as a proportion of total sales. Yet it failed to
invent a replacement for its big-selling anti-inflammatory drug Naprosyn
which lost patent protection in the US last year. In April, Syntex was taken
over by Roche.
The genuine breakthrough that Syntex needed is by its nature more elusive
than a drug adapted from an existing product. Perhaps it is more likely to
be found by highly motivated geniuses working for small companies. Drugs
companies are prepared to pay a lot of money to find out.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Technology (R&amp;D Scoreboard): Spending up as drugs dominate /
A look at an international comparison of R&amp;D investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The fourth annual R&amp;D Scoreboard sponsored by the Department of Trade and
Industry gives the most encouragement so far to those who believe that UK
industry must spend more on research and development if it is to compete
more effectively in world markets.
The scoreboard, published today, shows that listed British companies raised
their R&amp;D spending by 9 per cent to Pounds 7.1bn in 1993 - a rate of
increase that comfortably outpaced both inflation and the UK's main
international competitors. The world's top 200 companies spent just 2 per
cent more on R&amp;D last year.
Cynics may point out that British industry's increase in R&amp;D spending does
no more than match its 9 per cent rise in sales. But the robust sales
performance was achieved largely overseas (and resulted mainly from the
depreciation of sterling against other currencies) whereas UK companies
carry out most of their R&amp;D at home. Therefore the figures do show a real
improvement in the country's industrial R&amp;D performance.
And, for the first time since the scoreboard started four years ago,
companies expanded R&amp;D spending by more than they increased dividend
pay-outs to shareholders. Although the difference was only slight -
dividends grew by 8 per cent - it was a step in the right direction for
those who believe that UK industry is putting its long-term competitiveness
at risk in order to keep short-term investors happy.
The UK has far to go, however, before it even comes close to matching other
countries in its spending on R&amp;D in relation to sales, profits or dividends.
The international top 200 companies as a whole devoted an average 4.85 per
cent of 1993 turnover to R&amp;D, compared with 2.29 per cent for the 13 British
companies in the group. The most impressive national performances came from
Sweden (7.26 per cent of sales), Germany (6.80 per cent), Switzerland (6.78
per cent) and Japan (5.90 per cent).
The gap between the UK and other countries becomes wider still when R&amp;D is
related to profits and dividends. R&amp;D spending by the international top 200
averaged 101 per cent of pre-tax profits and 283 per cent of dividends;
equivalent figures for the UK companies were 29 per cent of profits and 72
per cent of dividends.
But Rob Margetts, research and technology director of Imperial Chemical
Industries, says international comparisons based on spending may
underestimate Britain's real R&amp;D effort, because scientists and engineers in
the UK work as well as their counterparts in other industrialised countries,
despite being on lower salaries. 'We're fortunate that a high proportion of
our R&amp;D is performed in relatively low cost countries.'
ICI carries out half its R&amp;D in the UK although only 22 per cent of turnover
is in its home country. Costs per researcher are about Pounds 50,000 in the
UK, Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 80,000 in the rest of Europe and Pounds 100,000
in Japan.
When the scoreboard is broken down according to industrial sector, the
overwhelming importance of pharmaceuticals for the UK becomes clear. Four of
the top six UK spenders on R&amp;D are drugs companies (Glaxo, SmithKline
Beecham, Zeneca and Wellcome) and the pharmaceutical sector carries out 31.8
per cent of all industrial R&amp;D in Britain. Among the top 200 international
companies, the sector accounts for only 8.8 per cent of all R&amp;D spending.
And the dominance of the drugs companies is growing, as they boost R&amp;D
faster than other sectors. Last year the UK pharmaceutical sector in-creased
R&amp;D by 19 per cent, led by Glaxo, the British R&amp;D champion, with a 24 per
cent increase to Pounds 739m.
The UK performance in other areas is mixed:
Engineering companies spent 10 per cent more, led by Rolls-Royce and British
Aerospace.
Electronic and electric companies fell by 1 per cent. Cuts by the sector's
two biggest companies, GEC (down 5 per cent) and Racal (down 8 per cent),
outweighed substantial increases by some of the smaller electronics
companies.
Oil companies fell by 5 per cent. A cut of 25 per cent by BP undermined
Shell's 6 per cent increase.
The diversified industrial sector presents a revealing contrast between the
two giant UK conglomerates, BTR and Hanson, which coincidentally both had a
turnover of Pounds 9.8bn in 1993. BTR's R&amp;D spending was Pounds 101m - up by
9 per cent last year and by 71 per cent since 1990. Hanson's R&amp;D spending
was Pounds 20m - down by 23 per cent last year and by 41 per cent since
1990.
Hanson's corporate development director, Christopher Collins, denies that
the group has an anti-R&amp;D attitude. 'Hanson's portfolio consists partly of
industrial companies, with a focus on basic industries, and partly of
resources companies - and there's no R&amp;D involved in digging out more coal,'
he says. 'What doesn't show up in the R&amp;D figures is our constant drive to
improve manufacturing techniques and operating efficiencies.'
Collins says the ups and downs of Hanson's R&amp;D spending are determined more
than anything by its sale and acquisition of companies. Last year's
take-over of Quantum, the US chemical company, will boost this year's R&amp;D
figure.
But at least Hanson features on the scoreboard. Forty-two of the FT-SE 100
companies are missing because they declare no figure for R&amp;D spending. Most
are financial, retailing and other services groups, which probably do no
significant R&amp;D (though J Sainsbury sets an example for other supermarket
groups by declaring an R&amp;D figure of Pounds 4.8m).
There are some glaring exceptions, however - companies apparently
contravening accounting standards by failing to disclose R&amp;D activities.
Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecommunications group, is the outstanding absentee.
'The statement in our report and accounts two years ago that there was no
R&amp;D in C&amp;W was a great error,' concedes Sidney O'Hara, a former BT research
executive who recently became C&amp;W technology adviser.
O'Hara estimates that C&amp;W devotes between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent of its Pounds
5bn turnover to R&amp;D, in line with other telecoms service companies. That
would give a figure in the region of Pounds 100m and put C&amp;W comfortably
into the UK top 20. O'Hara promises that a figure will be published in next
year's annual report.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Technology (R&amp;D Scoreboard): Heseltine hails advances - The
trade and industry secretary talks to Clive Cookson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Heseltine, secretary of state at the UK's Department of Trade and
Industry, and chief sponsor of the R&amp;D Scoreboard, is delighted with the
spending increase it shows this year.
'It is very encouraging that an area which has been a matter of some
controversy and much concern is being addressed by the management of
Britain's leading companies, despite very difficult trading conditions,' he
says. 'But there is still some way to go to catch up with the world's best
standards.'
Heseltine believes the Scoreboard's R&amp;D comparisons around the world 'are
valuable because they focus management's attention on the ingredients of
international competitiveness. They are a broad indicator of what is
possible, what the best are doing,' he says.
The managers of most British companies are taking seriously the message that
R&amp;D is important, according to Heseltine. 'That doesn't mean that all
management is taking it seriously. This is indicative of what the best are
doing. We should never let the people at the low end of performance off the
hook,' he says.
However, Heseltine refuses to discuss the performance of individual
companies or condemn them for spending too little on R&amp;D. 'I would not seek
to put my judgment as a politician - as a minister away from the hurly-burly
of the capitalist world - into the minds of individual boards of directors.
'I don't believe in ministers laying down formulae for industrial success.
There are too many exceptions. Just imagine the effect of a politician
saying all companies should be spending X per cent of turnover on R&amp;D, and
the consequence was that a significant proportion of companies upped their
expenditure, went into loss and were taken over. Who would thank you?'
Hanson may stand out for its low and declining R&amp;D spending but, Heseltine
points out, 'it also stands out as a company with a quite remarkable success
record'.
At first sight, Heseltine's own department is not setting a good example in
raising R&amp;D spending. According to the 1994 Forward Look at
Government-funded Science and Technology, the DTI's net expenditure on
science and technology is set to fall steadily from Pounds 500m in 1992-93
to Pounds 350m in 1996-97.
Heseltine rejects that as 'facile criticism'. He says the fall results
mainly from a reduction in nuclear research, coupled with increasing
receipts from past expenditure on aerospace R&amp;D and changing arrangements
for small business consultancy.
At the same time, the DTI is shifting the balance of its innovation support
away from generating new technology 'on which industry and government
already spend billions', to concentrate more on 'influencing the broad
environment which allows innovative firms to flourish'. That means cutting
collaborative research projects and spending more on technology transfer and
spreading the word about best practice.
The R&amp;D Scoreboard itself is a small example of such activity. Of course,
R&amp;D is only one ingredient in the overall process of innovation  - defined
by the DTI as 'the successful exploitation of new ideas'.
The DTI Innovation Unit is now tackling the greater challenge of drawing up
an 'innovation index' which would take account not only of funds that
companies put into R&amp;D but also the outcome.
Measures might include patents, new products, even stock market valuations.
Defining and quantifying these - and combining them into an index that would
be acceptable to industry and useful for managers - pose formidable
mathematical and econometric problems.
Even so, two groups - Stoy Hayward consultants with Warwick University, and
Imperial College - have drawn up practical proposals for an innovation
index. DTI officials are now considering which approach to develop further,
in consultation with industry.
There is a reasonable chance that the innovation index will be ready for
launch next year. Barring a corporate upheaval, Glaxo is certain to emerge
as the leader of the 1995 UK R&amp;D Scoreboard. A more interesting subject for
speculation is which company will emerge as the most innovative.

FT  17 JUN 94 / People: Hamish Grossart takes third chair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hamish Grossart is to become chairman of Hicking Pentecost, the quoted
Cardiff-based textile and industrial products group. It is a non-executive
job which he will do alongside the task he took on in January of chairing
and sorting out Ashley Group, the window blind company which had hit trouble
with a Spanish acquisition, as well as being chairman of EFT, the
Glasgow-based asset finance company he helped found.
The 37-year-old Glaswegian corporate finance specialist has long been intent
on pursuing a career outside the orbit of his better known uncle Angus
Grossart, chairman of the merchant bank Noble Grossart and a man with his
finger in many Scottish pies.
Hamish worked at Noble Grossart for a time before creating EFT in 1987. He
had intended to make it a mini financial conglomerate, eventually spreading
from Scotland to London. But the corporate finance arm withered in the
recession and closed in 1992, and the fund management subsidiary was sold,
leaving asset finance. Grossart moved up to become non-executive chairman
and sought other outlets.
Until last month he was chairman of Quality Care Homes, the nursing homes
group which he took public in 1992. He has been involved with Hicking
Pentecost since 1991 and organised its recent Pounds 9m acquisition of
Barbour Campbell, a former Hanson offshoot. 'It's virtually Wales's only
successful quoted company,' he says, and points out that its market
capitalisation has risen tenfold since 1990.
Grossart sees his speciality as helping companies with 'financing, City
relations, management structure and problems of growth and development, but
not deciding how many cans of beans go out each day'. He is also on the
boards of Scottish Radio (formerly Radio Clyde) and British Thornton, the
quoted furniture and drawing equipment company.

FT  17 JUN 94 / People: Provincial continues family tradition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Provincial Group, the family-controlled financial services group founded by
Sir James Scott in 1903, has appointed its latest chairman from the Scott
family. It disclosed yesterday that 34-year-old Alex Scott has taken the
post.
Scott succeeds Tim Shakerley, another family member, at the head of
Provincial, which owns Provincial Insurance, one of the largest
privately-owned UK insurers, as well as Exeter Bank, which makes loans to
small businesses.
He was appointed a director in 1989, and has been deputy chairman since
1991. He has also worked at Thames Water as investor relations manager, and
Jardine Fleming Holdings in Hong Kong in charge of corporate communications.
Scott, great grandson of Sir James and son of the president and former
chairman Sir Peter Scott, also becomes chairman of Provincial Insurance. Tim
Shakerley retires after 17 years in the post.
Scott says his role as chairman is partly a traditional one of overseeing
management strategy, and partly as a representative of family shareholders.
The Scott family controls more than 80 per cent of Provincial equity.
'I don't think we have had problems in being family-owned, although there is
always a potential for tension between the company's owners and its
managers. As long as we recognise that, I think it is perfectly manageable,'
he says.
Scott, who studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Exeter College,
Oxford, says he 'would not claim to be an expert on insurance' but has
learned management skills from working with senior directors of large
companies.
He says it is 'difficult to say exactly whether my role is executive or
non-executive' but he will spend the first few months trying to learn how
best to combine the family's twin responsibilities as shareholders and
senior managers.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Property: BT's big sell-off - The UK group's property
disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The root-and-branch overhaul of BT's property portfolio promises to be one
of the most thorough ever attempted in the UK.
BT, which owns three-quarters of the 75m square feet of space it occupies,
has the third largest corporate property portfolio in the UK. But by 2010,
it wants to dispose of virtually all its property which is, or will have
become, obsolescent.
'In the UK we have too much of the wrong quality of space located in the
wrong location costing too much to run,' said Mr Alan White, BT's group
property director.
BT's running costs for its properties total Pounds 1.1bn a year, its third
largest expense after salaries and depreciation. 'It was not until the end
of the 1980s that there was a realisation that property cost what it did. It
came as quite a shock,' said Mr White.
The telecoms group believes it now has the opportunity to slash its property
costs. It has embarked on a big rationalisation programme which will reduce
its workforce from 240,000 in 1987 to about 110,000 by 1998. Moreover, BT
believes it will be able to reduce its operational sites - such as telephone
exchanges - from 6,000 to 500 within the next 10 years.
A smaller workforce will cut BT's property requirements. The company plans
to reduce its property portfolio from 75m sq ft to 15m sq ft by 2010,
slashing annual running costs from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 200m. Over the
past two years the company has shed some 5m sq ft of space; it will continue
to sell between 3.5m sq ft and 4m sq ft a year for the next 10 years.
Virtually all of BT's buildings are up for sale - the most marketable, as
well as those which are known to be surplus. 'We are prepared to be
flexible,' said Mr White. Disposing of such a large amount of space is a
daunting task, particularly where obsolete buildings are concerned. 'It is
not as if we have something that people want,' he added.
BT has made its priority the examination of those properties that pose 'the
greatest threat and opportunities' in terms of runnings costs, according to
Mr White. It first concentrated on high-cost units and, in particular,
looked at properties with long leases, where leases were ending, where there
was a notice to break a lease and where there was a sub-leased property.
The company is also looking for quick routes out of leases. It is taking
advantage of opportunities to sell leases to adjoining owners wanting more
space, to developers and to freehold owners seeking to gain possession in
order to redevelop or to release for higher returns.
On its leased buildings, for example, BT will sometimes seek to persuade
landlords to cancel leases for a one-off payment of advance rent, although,
as Mr White said, 'it is not an easy process to persuade people to give up a
triple A covenant'.
More radical proposals are also being studied. BT has examined the
possibility of disposing of a mixed package of properties to investors or,
even, spinning off the entire portfolio to BT shareholders under separate
management. 'There is no doubt that at this current stage of the UK real
estate investment cycle such a route for corporations with large portfolios
looks attractive,' said Mr White.
The disposal of large quantities of property also presents organisational
problems. As jobs are shed there is a continual need to re-arrange staff
within and between offices.
The disruption caused by these office moves is tempered by BT's attempts to
upgrade offices before it transfers staff. 'I think our popularity (with
staff) is improving,' said Mr White. 'We are moving people to a better
office environment. We are persuading them by a carrot rather than a stick.'
Senior managers of business units within BT are encouraged to co-operate
with the property division, particularly as their business plans contain
rigorous targets for reducing property costs.
According to Mr White, a measure of the importance with which the group
treats property is that BT's chief executive reviews portfolio performance
quarterly, while the chief financial officer reviews the portfolio at least
monthly.
As well as cutting property costs, BT believes its property portfolio
overhaul should change the company's culture and improve productivity. It
believes that by transferring people from old-fashioned to more modern
offices 'people can jettison out-moded ways of working and bring in new
practices and procedures'.
BT is keen to introduce new working arrangements such as flexible working,
desk-sharing, working from home and video conferencing, which it believes
will save above 1m sq ft of office space over the next decade. 'For many
people, being tied to one office, five days a week, could become a thing of
the past,' said BT.
The company is also keen to bring its staff together in functional groups,
according to their specialist skills rather than their business units.
These ideas - known collectively at BT as 'Workstyle 2000' - are due to be
tested at the company's prototype office at Apsley, Hertfordshire, in
southern England, where 1,300 marketing and sales staff will be relocated in
the autumn.
The Apsley premises feature open-plan offices around an atrium, large
multi-purpose areas for communal activities, a restaurant and conference and
video-conferencing room.
If Apsley is a success, BT plans to move 10,000 people out of central London
to similar offices around the M25 orbital road over the next 25 years.
Although there is little difference in rents between inner and outer London
premises, BT believes that moving out-of-town could drastically cut service
charges.
BT's plan to move out of London is a measure of its belief that new
technology will change the way that people work. 'Historically, we have
always had a strong presence in the capital, but today that is no longer
necessary,' said BT. 'Our communications technology has given us greater
freedom to site many of our offices wherever we choose,' it added.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Growth in retail sales levels off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in retail sales levelled off in May compared with April, though the
underlying trend points to a steady if subdued rate of recovery.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday the retail sales volume in May
was up by a seasonally adjusted 3.9 per cent on the previous May.
This was slightly lower than April's year-on-year figure, which was revised
down yesterday to 4.1 per cent from the 4.4 per cent published last month.
But the index showed that the volume of sales was unchanged month-on-month,
after growing by 0.5 per cent in February and March.
The British Retail Consortium, the main industry body, yesterday made light
of this flattening off and pointed out that the underlying trend remained
positive.
Mr James May, director-general of the consortium, said: 'This shows that
consumers are still willing to spend in spite of the tax increases.'
Measured on a three-month basis - an indicator economists believe is a
better guide to the trend - retail sales grew by 0.9 per cent in the three
months to May compared with the previous three months, and were up 3.9 per
cent on the same period last year. This rise was spread fairly evenly across
the sectors, with all the non-food sectors reporting rises of about 0.8 per
cent in the three months to May, compared with the previous three months.
Food retailers reported a slightly better rise of 1.3 per cent during this
period.
Within the last month, footwear and clothing was the most sluggish sector,
with sales volumes falling by 1.7 per cent in May, after surging in April.
Economists said this dip was partly due to poor weather at the start of the
month.
Household goods, by contrast, grew by 1.7 per cent last month, after falling
back in April.
In spite of this surge, the consortium said the furniture and carpets sector
continued to be adversely affected by the uncertainty in the housing market.
This was also undermining sales of DIY and electrical and electronic goods,
the consortium added. Sales of televisions and hi-fi goods were up compared
with last year, while white goods sold at the same level.
Retailers continued to face intense cost competition, with consumers
remaining very price-sensitive, the consortium added.
This trend was most sharply indicated in the monthly household goods data,
where the total value of sales fell by 3 per cent in spite of the growth in
volumes.
The figures were greeted with some relief in the City, where some analysts
had feared sales might dip slightly after a Confederation of British
Industry survey earlier this week reported retailers had become more
pessimistic.
Mr Ian Sheperdson, UK economist with Midland Global Markets, suggested that
one reason for the discrepancy between the CBI survey and the CSO might be
that the CBI survey gave more weight to smaller retailers.
Since large retailers were performing better than small ones, according to
the CBI, this might explain why the tone of the CBI survey was less
optimistic, he said.
However, Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist with Salomon Brothers, suggested
that another reason might be the divergence between value and volumes.
Heavy high-street discounting might be leaving retailers gloomy in spite of
an overall rise in volumes, he said.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Blair secures wide support in leadership race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the biggest test so far of his leadership ambitions, and Mr Tony
Blair passed with flying colours.
Last night's list of nominations for the Labour leadership shows that Mr
Blair, the shadow home secretary and leading moderniser, won support from
most of the party's ideological factions and regional groupings.
His tally of 154 nominations amounted to 57 per cent of the 269 MPs eligible
to vote. Unless some MPs change their mind, he is already guaranteed 15.5
per cent of the total votes in Labour's electoral college.
Unlike his rivals, Mr Blair was so confident of achieving the 34 nominations
to enter the race that he did not nominate himself. But 13 of Mr Blair's 18
fellow elected members of the shadow cabinet backed him, demonstrating his
ability to mobilise support from all sections of the party.
They were: Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, Mr David Clark (defence), Mr
Tom Clark (development), Mr Robin Cook (trade and industry), Mr Jack
Cunningham (foreign), Mr Donald Dewar (social security), Mr Frank Dobson
(transport), Ms Harriet Harman (Treasury), Ms Mo Mowlam (national heritage),
Mr George Robertson (Scotland), Mr Chris Smith (environmental protection),
Mr Jack Straw (environment) and Mrs Ann Taylor (education).
Mr Blair also won support from Mr Derek Foster, the chief whip; Mr Neil
Kinnock, former leader; Mr Roy Hattersley, former deputy leader, and Ms
Hilary Armstrong, the late John Smith's parliamentary private secretary.
Backbench supporters included rightwingers such as Mr John Speller, mining
MPs such as Mr Kevin Barron and leftwingers like Mr Clive Betts.
Mr Prescott, the traditionalist shadow employment secretary, won 46
nominations, including three shadow ministers in addition to himself. They
were Mr Ron Davies (Wales), Ms Joan Lestor (children) and Mr Michael Meacher
(Citizens' charter). However, Mr Davies said he had nominated Mr Prescott
only to secure a contest, and would vote for Mr Blair.
Mr Prescott's backbench backing came mainly from traditional leftwingers and
trade-union stalwarts.
Mrs Beckett, who won 42 nominations with no shadow ministers, was backed by
most of the left wing, including Mr Ken Livingstone and Mr Jeremy Corbyn,
and many women MPs. She was also supported by a number of more mainstream
MPs. However, at least one voted for her only to secure an open contest.
The contest for the deputy leadership appeared equally divided. Both
candidates secured the support of a wide spread of MPs.
Mrs Beckett won 106 nominations with the support of eight elected shadow
ministers, including herself. Mr Prescott won 101 nominations, including
five shadow ministers in addition to himself.
The leader and deputy leader will be elected by an electoral college in
which a third of the votes are wielded by 269 eligible Labour MPs and 62
MEPs, giving each MP and MEP 0.101 per cent of the total vote. One Labour
MP, Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, takes no part in party matters. The
remaining votes are divided equally between 250,000 constituency party
members and 4.3m trade-union supporters.

Complaints from water customers failed to show an increase last year for the
first time since the industry's privatisation five years ago, Ofwat, the
regulator, said yesterday.
However Ofwat's annual report showed that a third of complaints continue to
be about water bills. Since privatisation, bills have risen much faster than
inflation to pay for modernisation and compliance with new environmental
rules.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Fossil-fuel levy produces Pounds 1.23bn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity consumers paid Pounds 1.23bn through the fossil-fuel levy last
year, Offer, the office of electricity regulation, said yesterday. The levy
 -which amounts to 10 per cent of electricity bills - is used to promote
sources of energy other than oil, gas and coal.
The great majority of last year's levy - 97 per cent - went to nuclear
power, with the rest going to renewable energy sources such as wind and
fuel-from-waste.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Euro-poll 'was a peace mandate'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew yesterday claimed that last week's European elections had
given London a democratic mandate for pressing ahead with efforts to forge a
lasting political settlement for Northern Ireland.
Speaking on the eve of today's intergovernmental conference between British
and Irish ministers in Dublin, the Northern Ireland secretary told MPs that
more Ulster voters had voted for candidates 'supportive of or acquiescent
in' the Downing Street declaration than for candidates who opposed it.
Last week's poll was topped by the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline
Democratic Unionist party, who chose to run his campaign as a referendum on
the joint declaration.
But his majority over Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party, was much reduced.
Mr Paisley nevertheless claimed earlier this week that he had achieved what
he set out to do.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Growth projection likely to be raised
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury will publish an updated forecast for the economy on June 28 in
which it is expected to revise upwards its projection of economic growth
this year from 2.5 per cent forecast in its November Budget.
The government will thus meet the requirements of the industry act, which
specifies that it should publish economic forecasts twice a year. Until this
year, it published forecasts with its Budget in March and in the autumn. The
late-June forecast is in response to the decision to scrap the spring
revenue-raising Budget and have a unified Budget in November.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Public sector deficit declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The public sector deficit in the first two months of the financial year fell
to Pounds 8.5bn from Pounds 9.4bn in April and May of 1993, the government
reported yesterday, Peter Norman writes.
In a joint statement, the Treasury and the Central Statistical Office
reported that the public sector borrowing requirement increased to Pounds
4.34bn in May from Pounds 4.17bn in April. The May figure was slightly
higher than market expectations of a Pounds 4.1bn deficit last month, while
the April deficit was revised downwards from Pounds 4.3bn.
Central government cash receipts were Pounds 33.6bn in the first two months
of the 1994-95 financial year, up 2.5 per cent from Pounds 32.8bn in the
same months of last year. Cash outlays grew more slowly, by 1 per cent to
Pounds 41.8bn in April and May from Pounds 41.4bn in the same period of
1993-94.
The government revised upwards its total for the deficit in the past
financial year to Pounds 46bn from Pounds 45.8bn. Economists said it was too
early to tell whether the UK was on track to meet the government's November
Budget forecast of Pounds 37.9bn for the deficit in 1994-95.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Small companies to be offered interest-free loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest-free loans for up to 13 months are to be offered by banks to small
companies to upgrade the skills of their workforce in a government-backed
initiative, Lisa Wood writes.
The loans were launched yesterday by the Department of Employment in
association with three banks - Barclays, the Clydesdale and the
Co-operative.
Government surveys show that while 88 per cent of companies with more than
500 employees have training plans, the figure drops to just 17 per cent for
companies employing less than 25 people.
The initiative - which will offer loans of up to Pounds 125,000 - mirrors a
government and bank-backed scheme which offers 'career development loans' to
individuals.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Battle of a 'persistent commoner'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last occasion on which the courts overturned the outcome of a
parliamentary election was in July 1961 when Mr Tony Benn was barred from
the Commons, Ivor Owen writes.
After a long campaign to avoid succession to a hereditary peerage, Mr Benn
was forced to give up his Commons seat as MP for Bristol South East on
inheriting the title of Lord Stansgate in 1960. In a gesture of defiance
which won widespread support, he fought the ensuing by-election as the
official Labour candidate, topping the poll with a majority double that he
had achieved in the 1959 general election.
The courts ruled that, as a peer, Lord Stansgate could not be elected to the
Commons, and the seat was claimed by Mr Malcolm St Clair, the Conservative
candidate, who came second in the poll.
A government defeat in the House of Lords resulted in the 1963 act enabling
the disclaiming of peerages to take immediate effect - it was originally
intended that it should not become law before the end of the 1959-64
parliament. Mr St Clair immediately vacated the seat and Mr Benn, the
'persistent commoner' as he described himself, was returned to Westminster
in a by-election in August 1963.

FT  17 JUN 94 / UK car production falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK car production fell 1.4 per cent in May to 128,538 from 130,415 in the
same month a year ago, according to figures released by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders, Kevin Done writes.
In the first five months, car output was virtually unchanged at 606,794, a
fall of 0.2 per cent from 608,237 in the corresponding period a year ago.
Higher output by Rover, together with the rapid build-up of production by
Toyota and Honda has helped to offset declines at Ford and Vauxhall and a
sharp fall year-on-year in production at Nissan.
Production for export markets rose strongly in May, with an increase of 22
per cent to 53,564, helping to offset a 13.3 per cent fall in output for the
home market to 74,974.
Mr Ernie Thompson, SMMT chief executive, said the figures showed the UK's
'all-important European export markets are now recovering from their serious
state of recession'.

Work on the development of the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal
should start by the end of the year, after yesterday's decision by the
environment department not to hold a public inquiry, Paul Cheeseright
writes.
Daventry District Council has already said it is prepared to grant planning
permission for a rail port with 2.3m sq ft of manufacturing and distribution
space. The site is south of the M6-M1 interchange and next to the west coast
line.
Abbcott Estates, the developer, in which Severn Trent Water has a majority
stake, said the finished scheme would have a value of Pounds 140m. It will
compete for Channel tunnel traffic with Hams Hall, east of Birmingham, which
is being developed by Trafalgar House and PowerGen.

FT  17 JUN 94 / DTI cool on need for tidal barrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction of a tidal energy barrage across the Duddon Estuary in Cumbria
would be technically feasible but not currently viable as a private sector
electricity generating scheme, according to a study sponsored by the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The study is the latest of a series of DTI reports into tidal barrage
proposals for estuaries in England and Wales. All were judged uncommercial.
They have also aroused environmental concern.
The proposed Duddon barrage, costing about Pounds 258m, would generate more
than 200m kWh a year of electricity.
Cumbria county council is engaging consultants to produce a preliminary
feasibility study into barrage or bridge crossings of Morecambe Bay, the
Duddon estuary and the Solway Firth to improve coastal communications and
aid economic regeneration.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Rover to axe more than 150 small dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 150 small Rover dealers are expected to lose their franchises
under a network restructuring planned by the BMW-owned car company.
Rover intends to replace its two-tier system of main dealers and smaller
'retail' dealers with a single-tier system by the middle of 1997. The
restructured network will be based largely on the main dealers, which will
be required to set up 'satellite' sub-dealerships in areas previously
occupied by small independent retail outlets.
Under the two-tier system, Rover's 286 retail dealers receive supplies not
from Rover but from the 382 main dealers, which act as regional
distributors.
Some small dealers will be encouraged to expand and upgrade to main dealer
status.
A letter setting out the plans has been sent to all dealers by Mr Sandy
Mathieson, commercial director.
Rover began last week to select the dealers it wants to retain. The group
said yesterday: 'Every dealer should know its future by the end of July.'
The letter also makes clear that those remaining in the network must make
substantial new investment to upgrade premises and customer service.
Rover wants a national network of about 500 dealers. Last year it sold
238,000 cars in the UK, a market share of 13.38 per cent. This compares with
381,000 sold by market leader Ford (21.46 per cent) through a network of
nearly 1,000 dealers.
Those smaller Rover dealers which face the axe will be given two-year
termination contracts.
The planned system of satellite dealerships is aimed at avoiding a repeat of
the mistake the group made in its earlier incarnation as British Leyland
more than a decade ago. At that time it withdrew the franchise of hundreds
of small country garages. Many of these took on Japanese and other
franchises and, to British Leyland's dismay, customers turned out to be more
loyal to the local garage than the make of car it happened to be selling.
The plans have met with a broad measure of agreement, according to Rover's
dealers' association.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Lamont fires rightwing shot on EU presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont, the former Conservative chancellor, warned yesterday that
the appointment of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as president of the European
Commission would give fresh impetus to the federalist cause.
He called on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to maintain the government's
support for Sir Leon Brittan, Britain's 'excellent candidate', who had a
brilliant negotiating track record. His comments were seen as a warning from
the Tory right that acceptance of the Belgian candidate could spark a
backbench rebellion at Westminster.
Earlier this week Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, hinted that the
government was not prepared to veto Mr Dehaene's appointment if Sir Leon did
not gain enough support among other European Union states.
Mr Lamont described Mr Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, as a 'federalist
of a very old-fashioned kind' and insisted that no Belgian candidate would
resist the ever-increasing demands of the Brussels democracy.
Mr Major reaffirmed the government's 'very strong' backing for Sir Leon, and
added that at the moment the only other candidate was Mr Ruud Lubbers, the
Dutch prime minister. Both were highly respected in the EU.
Mr Major said Sir Leon would have his support at the European summit in
Corfu and added: 'I am not at this stage going to declare a position on any
other candidates, or possible candidates.'

FT  17 JUN 94 / Multinational accepts works councils principle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The GMB general union said yesterday that United Biscuits, the biscuits and
snacks manufacturer, had become the first UK multinational to accept in
principle that UK employees will be included in the operation of a European
works council for consulting employees.
The 60 UK-based British multinationals that are likely to be covered by the
European directive on works councils - likely to be passed later this year -
do not have to include their UK employees in the arrangements as a result of
Britain's opt-out from some European employment legislation.
However, unions such as the GMB have been claiming that few companies will
in practice exclude their British workers. Mr David Williams, national
secretary of the GMB, said: 'Works councils are coming to the UK whether the
CBI likes it or not.'
United Biscuits will be covered by the directive for its continental
European operations because it has more than 1,000 workers and at least 100
workers in more than one country.
The TGWU general union is asking European chemical workers to back a boycott
of Shell products because the company has de-recognised British unions. Most
non-quoted companies with employee share ownership plans believe they
improve competitiveness and the motivation of their workers, a survey of
schemes said yesterday. More than four out of five managers say the schemes
make their employees more productive.

FT  17 JUN 94 / CrossRail project thrown out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The CrossRail project to create an underground link between east and west
London may have been thrown out by a parliamentary committee - but work is
continuing on the design of the Pounds 2bn rail line, Charles Batchelor
writes.
A full-scale mock-up of the train which would be used on the link went on
display in central London yesterday to demonstrate the styling, seating
lay-out and driver's cab. The coach and cab unit, designed by DCA Design
Consultants of Warwick, has been modified to meet the needs of passengers
with limited mobility.
The demonstration of the CrossRail rolling stock coincides with attempts to
revive the project. MPs have been urged to back a motion to send the bill
back to the committee which earlier rejected it.
Mr David Lidington MP, promoter of the original CrossRail bill, is leading
the rescue effort. The project was turned down because of revised traffic
forecasts and fears it would not attract private sector finance.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Eurotunnel takes slow train to derail terrorists: The
operator's security efforts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A terrorist bomb attack on the Channel tunnel has so far occurred only in
fiction - in a Graham Greene essay five years ago. But the threat is taken
very seriously by Eurotunnel, the operator.
The company faces financial and competitive pressures to run a full service
as speedily as possible - but it is a commercial imperative to be seen to
have insured against accident or terrorist attack.
Mr Richard Morris, safety director, said: 'Safety is uppermost in our minds.
If we have a major accident we are dead as a company.'
At the weekend, hundreds of volunteer passengers took part in a successful
evacuation rehearsal, only to be delayed below ground by a power failure
affecting the test of a Eurostar train.
The sensitivity surrounding the Channel tunnel's record was brought into
focus by the two recent temporary suspensions of Eurotunnel's freight
service, when drivers halted trains after warning lights signalled
non-existent faults.
Eurotunnel argues that overzealous, as opposed to lax, safety requirements
were to blame, but the incident worried some potential customers.
Had Eurotunnel been running a full freight and passenger service, and
hundreds of civilians been trapped, there could have been panic, said Mr
Sydney Balgarnie of the Road Haulage Association. At best, some would have
decided to switch back to the ferries.
Over the past year, Eurotunnel has set a strict regime of tests for
equipment and operations, which have to be approved by a Franco-British
safety commission before the company can run a full service.
Mr John Henes, Department of Transport official on the commission, insists
that there is no question of safety certificates being steamrollered to save
Eurotunnel in the short term. 'It doesn't matter to us how soon the tunnel
opens. Our obligation is to ensure that it is safe,' he said.
Tests are continuing on signalling equipment and fire alarms. The commission
is also supervising a series of mock evacuations of tourist passengers.
Security officials have concentrated on ensuring that adequate equipment,
staff and operational back-up is in place to counter the threat of
explosives being smuggled into the tunnel.
Detective Superintendent Cliff Grieve, UK head of ports and tunnelling
policy, said: 'We are clearly aware that the tunnel could be an IRA target
and we are using the latest technology and the best advice to reduce that
threat. But there is no 100 per cent secure transport system.'
Security is having teething problems, in spite of countless meetings
involving police and intelligence officials on both sides of the Channel.
Senior officials from the Home Office and the French ministry of the
interior have failed to agree on powers of armed French police stationed at
Cherrington, where the tunnel emerges in Britain. The issue may delay the
start of a full passenger service. One senior French police officer said
this week: 'The gun is part of our uniform. It is a symbol of the authority
of the state.'
The ministry of agriculture has invoked rabies to resolve another issue of
sovereignty - French customs officials have agreed not to bring sniffer dogs
on trains bound for London.
British Customs officials responsible for building up intelligence on
potential smugglers have privately complained that they have yet to get as
much information about passengers from Eurotunnel as they are offered by
ferry companies. Nonetheless, the overall sense from security chiefs on both
sides of the Channel is of considerable co-ordination, cultural differences
notwithstanding.
No one is underestimating the challenges that lie ahead. As one senior
security adviser put it: 'British Airways lost Pounds 10m because of some
IRA mortars that caused no physical damage.' If a similar incident
threatened the tunnel, the dislocation to operations could be massive.
In an FT survey on the Channel tunnel published on May 6, the name of
Eurotunnel's safety director was incorrectly given.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Lib Dems try to overturn Euro result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, WALES and WEST CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats are launching legal action to have the result of last
week's European parliamentary election in Devon and Plymouth East declared
void.
The seat was held by the Conservatives with nearly 75,000 votes - a majority
of 700 over Liberal Democrat candidate Mr Adrian Sanders. But a candidate
calling himself a Literal Democrat polled more than 10,000 votes. The
Liberal Democrats believe the 'lookalike' confusion deprived them of what
would have been their third European seat.
Mr Graham Elson, the party's general secretary, said yesterday that 'several
hundred' people had already complained that they had been misled into voting
for the Literal Democrat, Mr Richard Huggett.
'All of us are staggered by the overwhelming sense of outrage,' said Mr
Elson. 'Many people in the constituency feel cheated - that they had their
votes stolen from them by Mr Huggett and were therefore disenfranchised.'
The Liberal Democrats, after advice from counsel, are to issue an election
petition against Mr Frank Palmer, the returning officer, and against the
winning candidate, Mr Giles Chichester. A hearing by the electoral court -
presided over by two High Court judges - might take place within weeks. If
the petition is successful, the court could order the election to be rerun.
Mr Piers Coleman, solicitor for the Liberal Democrats, described an
electoral petition as an 'extremely rare phenomenon which is treated by the
courts with the utmost priority'.
Mr Palmer, chief executive of South Hams District Council and a returning
officer for nine years, said yesterday: 'I felt the nomination was validly
submitted and I did not have the power to invalidate it.'
Advice to returning officers was that the candidate's description must not
be more than six words nor obscene, but there was no copyright over party
names. 'It is a very grey area which could well do with clarification,' he
said.
He added: 'He was a determined candidate and knew what he was doing.' Before
the election, a High Court challenge by the Liberal Democrats to Mr
Huggett's nomination was unsuccessful.
Mr Huggett, a former head teacher who lives in a manor house near Dartmoor,
is on holiday in France. He had previously told the Western Morning News:
'If I am confusing anyone, then that's an indictment of our education
system.' He says he has never belonged to any political party.
Mr Chichester made no comment yesterday.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Ashdown plans frontbench reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown is planning a shake-up of the Liberal Democrat frontbench
team as part of a strategy to maintain the party's profile after its
disappointing performance in the European elections.
The aim is to sharpen the presentation of policies to counter concerns that
the party's distinctive identity is threatened by Labour's expected choice
of the moderate Mr Tony Blair as leader.
In particular, Mr Ashdown is keen to develop a more distinctive economic
policy, emphasising the Liberal Democrats' commitment to enterprise and free
markets.
Under the reshuffle, Mr Alan Beith is likely to move from economics to
another portfolio. Alternatively, Mr Ashdown might split the portfolio and
appoint another spokesman alongside Mr Beith.
Mr Menzies Campbell is seen by friends as the strongest candidate for a
higher-profile post.
Among others expected to be given a more important role are Mr Charles
Kennedy, who stands down this year as president of the party, and Mr Matthew
Taylor, the campaigns co-ordinator.
Mr Ashdown has rejected suggestions that the European elections - in which
the party won its first two seats in the Strasbourg assembly but saw its
share of the vote fall to 16 per cent - marked the beginning of a shift to
Labour of the anti-Tory vote.
But he has told colleagues that the party must now respond to the threat
posed by Mr Blair's promise to drive forward the modernisation of the Labour
party by refining its own message to the voters.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Spurs directors back appeal against FA punishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, last night got board backing
for his appeal against the Football Association's penalties for financial
irregularities at the club.
He has decided to appeal against the Pounds 600,000 fine, points deduction
and FA Cup expulsion - even though it opens up the possibility of a more
severe penalty from the FA.
Yesterday's moves came after the FA found that Spurs had contravened
association rules in making interest-free loans - allegedly totalling more
than Pounds 400,000 - to players between 1985 and 1989.
Mr Sugar said yesterday: 'I have been shocked by the manner in which this
club has been dealt with for what I consider to be coming clean.'
If the club's appeal against the FA punishment fails, Spurs will seek an
independently chaired arbitration hearing, as permitted by FA rules.
But Mr Sugar ruled out the possibility of subsequent court action on the
issue. 'At that point we will have to accept the outcome,' he said.
However, Mr Sugar said he would consider suing the FA if it failed to
investigate loans and ex gratia payments made to players by other Premier
League clubs.
He said he knew of two clubs that had recently settled claims with the
Inland Revenue, one for about Pounds 1m, and two others that were in the
process of being investigated.
'I have been told by the Football Association that we are on a level playing
field,' Mr Sugar said. 'I will not be fobbed off.'
The FA inquiry centred on loans made to players before Mr Sugar took over
the club in 1991. However Mr Sugar admitted yesterday that after being told
of the loans he delayed two years before notifying the FA in September 1993.
The Spurs board last night asked lawyers to examine the possibility of suing
former directors and employees responsible for loans to players.
Mr Sugar said there was no evidence to suggest that Spurs directors Mr Tony
Berry and Mr Douglas Alexiou - both on the board while loans and ex gratia
payments were made to players - were 'aware of the manner in which the loans
were made'.
He blames the severity of the FA's punishment on the organisation's strong
dislike for him and for Spurs.
'I believe that the FA have a vendetta against the club, if not me
personally,' he said yesterday. 'It is a vendetta which really says: 'Mr
Sugar, we have been told that you are a big bully and you bang your hands on
the table and shout your mouth off. We haven't seen any evidence of it but
we've been told this and now we're showing you that you don't bully us and
don't push us around.' '
However the Football Association rejected Mr Sugar's claims over its
handling of the inquiry on Tuesday.
'No suggestion was ever made of 'archaic or barbaric methods' being employed
on the day - or during the investigation that had taken place,' it said. 'No
suggestion of unfairness was even hinted at.'

FT  17 JUN 94 / Further talks held in railway signals dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exploratory talks were held yesterday to try to settle the railway
signalling dispute and avert a second 24-hour stoppage planned for
Wednesday.
Railtrack said it had given the RMT rail union a package of proposals
designed to settle the pay problem of the signalling staff. Mr David
Armstrong, human-resources director, said: 'We await a response from the
union now.'
Negotiators from RMT and Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible for
running the railway infrastructure, have met officials of Acas, the
conciliation service. The RMT said later that its meeting with Acas had been
'helpful'. Further talks at Acas can be expected over the next few days.
Both sides in the dispute appeared to be in a conciliatory mood yesterday.
Mr Armstrong has written to Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, saying
that Railtrack 'recognised the need to address the specific difficulty
surrounding the pay and conditions of the signalling grades'.
He said: 'I know we both accept a restructuring package is necessary. From
the outset we have made it clear that the content of this package is for
joint development and we have confirmed we would welcome your input in
shaping the final arrangements.'
But Mr Armstrong also conceded yesterday that there was a large gap between
Railtrack and the union over the signalling staff dispute. The company
insists it is not prepared to make an interim pay award for past
productivity improvements.
However, he said talks on future pay and job restructuring would lead to
many signalling staff rises of 'not less than 11 per cent'.
The company made clear there would be no extra money in its Pounds 85m
annual pay budget to fund any negotiated changes, which had to be
self-financing.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Lords defeat for crime bill measure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to switch compensation for crime victims to fixed-tariff
payments were rejected by the Lords last night. Peers voted by 131 to 113 to
remove the provisions from the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill.
The government immediately announced its intention to reverse the defeat
when the bill is returned to the Commons. The Home Office estimates the
defeat could result in the doubling of the cost of compensation to Pounds
500m a year by the year 2000.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Major urged to speed up reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister was yesterday put under pressure to speed up his planned
cabinet reshuffle after Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman,
announced his intention to resign, Roland Rudd writes.
Sir Norman said he would step down when Mr John Major announced his
successor along with the cabinet reshuffle.
Tory backbenchers urged the prime minister to end the speculation by
bringing the reshuffle forward. A senior member of the 1922 committee said:
'Sir Norman's decision to go underlines the urgency to end this period of
uncertainty by announcing the changes to cabinet as soon as possible.'
Sir Norman indicated that in some ways he could be of more use as a
backbencher than as party chairman. 'When I was party chairman I could not
always speak as frankly as I wanted to,' he said. 'I will not hesitate to
weigh into the prime minister's critics from the back benches.'
Mr Major faced renewed calls from friends to persuade Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, to be party chairman, although Mr Heseltine
has privately said he has no wish to take the job. Mr David Hunt, employment
secretary, remains the favourite because of his strong campaigning skills.
Sir Norman denied being under pressure 'to fall on his sword' because of
disappointing local, by-election and European election results. He said the
European elections had shown that the party could fight an election united.
But he suggested the party would not win the next general election if it did
not remain united for the next two to three years.
He reiterated his belief that there was no mood among the grass routes for a
Conservative leadership election.

Scottish Equitable, the life assurance and pension fund group, has put its
Pounds 250m commercial property portfolio on the market following a decision
to withdraw from property investment.
'We have taken a strategic decision to . . . invest in equities,' said Mr
Roy Patrick, Scottish Equitable company secretary.
The company believes property has underperformed equities over a period of
10 to 15 years.
Scottish Equitable has allowed the percentage of property in its portfolio
to drift down from 16 per cent in 1980 to its present 4 per cent.
It said it was in no hurry to dispose of the property.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Shake-up of Pounds 3.3bn milk market goes ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday gave the go-ahead for the biggest shake-up in the
dairy industry for 60 years by approving plans to liberalise the Pounds
3.3bn milk market.
The announcement ends six years of uncertainty over plans for the sector in
England and Wales after the future of the Milk Marketing Board was first
questioned in 1988.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, approved a scheme by the milk
board to set itself up as a voluntary farmers' co-operative called Milk
Marque. This leaves dairy companies free to buy their milk directly from
farmers from November 1.
But dairies still held reservations about Milk Marque's plans for sales
under the new market rules, fearing the co-operative would retain too
dominant a position. The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents dairy
companies, has threatened legal action.
Mrs Shephard recognised purchasers' concerns that Milk Marque might abuse
its dominant position, 'but the competition authorities will be monitoring
them very closely from the start of operations and there is no reason for
Milk Marque to act unreasonably,' she said.
Farmers who have signed up with Milk Marque have two weeks to reconsider,
but most dairies expect the new co-operative to gain control over at least
two-thirds of supply.
Mrs Shephard said consumers should not expect to pay a higher price for milk
under the new rules even though farmers were expecting price increases. She
said producers might well be rewarded by the removal of some of the
'absurdities and inefficiencies,' in the present statutory purchasing
scheme.
Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, agreed that there would be
slight increases in prices to farmers. However, he said that British farmers
received below-average European Union prices.
Supply continues to be constrained by EU quotas which will tend to push
prices higher even in a more competitive market. Mr Dare said imports would
be drawn in from mainland Europe if prices rose too high.
The next four weeks will see a scramble in the dairy industry to secure milk
supplies. Mrs Shephard urged farmers to sign up by mid-July to enable
preparations for freeing the market to go ahead in time for the November
deadline. The market liberalisation has been delayed for six months by
government doubts over Milk Marque's plans.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Call for new breed of transport entrepreneur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new breed of entrepreneur able to master a wide variety of business skills
will be required if the private sector is to be brought into transport
projects, according to Mr Pen Kent, the Bank of England member of the
government's private finance panel.
It was unreasonable to expect a single group to have all the skills to
design, build, finance and operate transport projects such as road bridges
or railway lines, he told a Financial Times conference on transport in
Europe.
The government had come a long way in its approach to the involvement of
private finance, Mr Kent said. But further changes were needed if private
funding was to be found for the more than 100 projects, which covered
health, education and prisons as well as transport. The panel's role is to
encourage private and public sectors to work together.
Treasury guidance on the private finance initiative issued earlier this year
had still not fully sunk in in the public sector, he said. So many companies
were being asked to tender for some projects that their combined costs of
preparing bids were higher than the value of the contract.
Detailed specifications must also be provided to win the commitment of the
private sector. 'Evaluation sometimes costs not just thousands but
millions,' said Mr Kent. 'When there is no contract at the end it leads to
cynicism and a mind set which makes subsequent joint ventures harder to
negotiate.'
But the private sector should not forget that civil servants were taking
risks in agreeing contracts which they might have to defend before the
public accounts committee. In the present untried market, early deals might
later appear to be uncommercial or 'soft'. Civil servants were taking a risk
with no opportunity to share in the upside of projects, he said.
The government needed to take a portfolio approach to the private finance
initiative.
Sometimes public accounting conventions, including the government's
insistence on not committing funds for more than one year, posed a real
difficulty for the private finance initiative. 'We need somehow to find an
equality in planning horizons for both sides, especially for the very large
lumpy projects typical of the transport sector,' Mr Kent said.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Book exports faceend of price pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The net book agreement, a pricing pact by publishers which prevents most
books being sold at a discount, should not be allowed to continue, the
advocate-general of the European Court in Luxembourg advised yesterday.
The opinion applies only to the trade in books between European Union member
states, and not to book sales within the UK. It could particularly affect
books exported from the UK to Ireland.
The view of Mr Carl Lenz, the advocate-general, is not binding on the
European Court but the court's decisions are usually in line with its
advisers' recommendations.
The recommendation to the court followed an appeal by the Publishers
Association in the UK against a 1988 European Commission ruling that the net
book agreement was anti-competitive, a decision that was upheld in 1992 by
the European Court of First Instance. The advocate-general recommended
yesterday that the appeal be dismissed.
It was also recommended that the Pentos group of bookshops, which has been
working with the European Commission to oppose the net book agreement,
should pay its own costs because it had 'improperly attempted to use the
present proceedings to call into question the lawfulness of the application
of the net book agreement in the UK'.
The Office of Fair Trading is reviewing the agreement in the UK to see
whether it operates in the public interest.
The Publishers Association said last night that far from restricting
competition, the agreement actually stimulated it.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Progress reported on Commons reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government business managers say they are making progress with initiatives
to reform House of Commons procedures, following a call from the prime
minister this week for some of parliament's antiquated practices to be
overhauled.
Senior Conservative officials said yesterday they hoped to reach agreement
with their opposition counterparts on a reduction in the number of
late-night sittings.
They have also taken the first concrete steps in reforming prime minister's
question time after calls from Mr John Major for the twice-weekly session to
be changed.
It was announced yesterday that the Commons procedure committee had summoned
leading politicians and Commons officials to give evidence on how the format
could be altered.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, and Mr Nick Brown, his Labour
opposite number, were due to hold a second meeting on the reform of Commons
hours last night.
The government proposes to finish more debates at 10pm and to have an early
conclusion of business on Thursday evenings to allow MPs to get to their
constituencies. Ministers will implement these changes only if Labour
permits more bills to be subject to timetables.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Minister firm on college contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, will today step up the
government's intervention in the dispute between college principals and
lecturers over new contracts and conditions.
He will tell the Colleges' Employers' Forum that any college signing
contracts approved by the National Association of Teachers in Further and
Higher Education, which include guarantees on teaching hours, would be
severely disadvantaged. This could mean forfeiting funds.
Under rules announced in the Budget by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
the government can withhold up to 2 per cent of a further education
college's budget if it maintains 'restrictive practices' in lecturers'
contracts. Education ministers will decide whether contracts are
restrictive.
Mr Boswell will today list several such practices under the present national
contract. These include 14 weeks holiday a year, a limit of 21 hours a week
spent in class and a limit of 30 duty hours.
The association has urged colleges to match the contract it signed with the
Manchester College of Art and Technology. This placed a limit of 756 hours
on each lecturer's teaching time a year - even less than the level Mr
Boswell considers restrictive - and gave contractual safeguards on the
length of the working week.
Strikes have been held at more than 70 further education colleges this week
in protest at the more flexible contracts. The association yesterday urged
the employers' forum to re-open national talks.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Red-hot success for Indian foods: The small Wigan company
that has beaten the multinationals with 92% product growth last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Pukka People Pick a Pot of Patak's,' runs the television advertising for
Patak's Indian foods, which range from pickles and pastes to ready-to-eat
mini-pappadums.
So many pots of Patak's are now picked from supermarket shelves that the
small Wigan-based family business was the UK's fastest-growing consumer
goods brand last year. It achieved a red-hot 92 per cent growth in retail
sales, the market intelligence company Nielsen found.
The annual biggest brands survey published in Marketing, the trade magazine,
says: 'So used are we to seeing the Procter &amp; Gambles and Unilevers
dominating biggest brands that it comes as something of a shock to discover
that our fastest-growing brand this year is owned not by a multinational
with an advertising budget to match but by a family-owned foods company with
a TV presence you'd need tracker dogs to find.'
Procter had to be content with second place on the list of fastest-growing
brands, with 77 per cent growth for Always, its sanitary towels with
'wings'. Third, with 45 per cent growth, was Eternity, the Calvin Klein
fragrance for men.
Compared with the big boys, Patak's sales are tiny: trade estimates put the
company's annual turnover at between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m, with about a
third in overseas business. This compares with the number one retail brand,
Coca-Cola, which had sales of more than Pounds 411m in the UK last year and
an estimated Pounds 9.1m advertising spend, compared with Patak's Pounds
500,000.
While some of the largest food brand names strive to inject a homemade,
family feel into their mass-produced products, Patak's can justly claim to
be the real thing. The company was founded in the 1950s by the father of the
present chairman, Mr Kirit Pathak, and is still entirely family-owned.
Mr LG Pathak began by selling samosas from home to raise money to buy his
first shop and the business expanded to take orders for pickles and
chutneys. Although it has now risen to the number two Indian foods brand and
has about 200 employees - Sharwood's, owned by conglomerate Tomkins, is the
leader - Kirit Pathak's wife, Meena, still directs the development of all
recipes.
The company estimates it supplies about 90 per cent of the UK's Indian
restaurants with its products, as well as becoming an increasingly familiar
name on the shelves of the largest retailers.
Patak's surge in growth came a year or so after the company took on its
first non-family director, Mr David Page, in 1991. Mr Page, who formerly ran
Campbell's grocery products in the UK, met Mr Kirit Pathak at a dinner party
and ended up as managing director. Deciding initially to spend money on TV
advertising was, Mr Page said, 'the big pill for us to swallow in terms of
costs'. But it gave the company the boost it needed.
In the future Mr Page is planning more helpings of the same. He said: 'We're
big believers in 'if it ain't broke don't fix it'. We intend to continue
with exactly the same strategy.'

FT  17 JUN 94 / Striking Severn workers sacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 700 construction workers on the second Severn crossing were
dismissed yesterday as they staged a 24-hour strike over pay. Work on the
Pounds 300m bridge between England and Wales is expected to be at a
standstill today.
The privately financed bridge is being built by Severn River Crossing - a
UK/French consortium with John Laing-GTM Entrepose as main contractor.
Laing-GTM said last night that letters had been posted to everyone who took
part in the strike, telling them that they were being dismissed for
breaching their terms and conditions of employment.
The workers - members of the Ucatt construction union and the TGWU and GMB
general unions - voted in favour of limited industrial action at the start
of this month. They intend to stage a second 24-hour strike next week. Most
of those dismissed were working on the English side of the bridge, and about
100 on the Welsh side.
Mr Roger Berry, a local Labour MP, said that to sack people for a 24-hour
strike was 'frankly outrageous'. He accused the management of 'behaving
appallingly'.
Laing-GTM claimed the unions were seeking a guaranteed bonus payment of
Pounds 5 an hour. It said the dispute had gone through a five-stage
grievance procedure and the industry's conciliation board had decided the
company was complying with its agreements.
'We've rigorously adhered to those terms and conditions,' Laing-GTM said.
The company would not disclose the basic pay rates but claimed that existing
bonuses were 'compatible with, if not better than, those elsewhere in the
industry'.
Work on the bridge, one of the largest construction projects in the UK,
started in 1992. The crossing is due to open in spring 1996. Construction
has reached its peak stage and about 1,000 people are employed in total.
Laing-GTM said construction was 'roughly on schedule'.

<TEXT>
Toyota of Japan plans to increase its purchases of US-built parts by nearly
40 per cent in the next three years, AP-DJ reports from Detroit.
Nearly all the increases will be in parts used by Toyota's US manufacturing
plants. The carmaker spent Dollars 4.65bn (Pounds 3.1bn) on US-built parts
in the year ending in March 1994. Toyota projects that the total will reach
Dollars 6.45bn for the year to March 1997.
'Growth will continue as long as American suppliers continue working to
shorten their lead times, to raise their quality and to lower their costs,'
the company's international purchasing manager, Mr Koichiro Noguchi, said
yesterday. He said there was considerable room for improvement. US suppliers
met their deadlines for developing part prototypes only 47 per cent of the
time in work on the new Toyota Avalon, which begins production in September.

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Trade ratification 'a priority'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The outstanding priority', argued Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in London last night, is 'to
ratify the Marrakesh trade agreements so that they can enter into force on
the agreed target date of January 1 1995.'
Giving the third annual Hayek memorial lecture at the Institute of Economic
Affairs, the free-market think tank, Mr Sutherland said international
economic relations would then depend on achieving further cuts in trade
barriers and the willingness of members of the prospective World Trade
Organisation to abide by the letter and spirit of the new rules.
Mr Sutherland pointed out that in industrial countries there would still be
tariff peaks in sensitive categories; that average tariffs would remain much
higher in developing countries than in industrial ones; that most
agricultural tariffs would be significantly greater than on industrial
products; and that much negotiation remained to be done in services,
starting with financial services.
One reason for the spread of illegal obstacles since the late 1960s was the
absence of third party complaints against bilateral accords. But, stressed
Mr Sutherland, a more fundamental threat to countries' willingness to abide
by the rules and disciplines of the new WTO is concerns about implications
for national sovereignty.
Arguing against this view, he indicated that the WTO did not have the power
to impose new trade policy obligations. Amendments of the WTO Agreement that
alter the rights and obligations of members are effective only for those
countries that have accepted them. Also 'some countries have interpreted the
right to refuse panel findings as the prerogative of a sovereign nation. But
what this amounts to is a country choosing to be above the law whenever it
is inconvenient to observe the law.'
More fundamentally, insisted Mr Sutherland, 'if sovereignty is equated with
the ability of a government to carry out its legitimate functions, the
acceptance of the new WTO rules and procedures by governments around the
world will increase the sovereignty of each and every one of them.'
Meanwhile, an important challenge would be developing coherence between the
Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and International Monetary Fund)
and the WTO.
Another priority is expansion of the system, which now has 123 contracting
parties, with 19 more - including China, Russia and Ukraine - now
negotiating accession or resumption of membership.

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Trade News: All Nippon, Delta agree to co-operate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
All Nippon Airways, the Japanese airline, and Delta Air Lines of the US have
agreed to co-operate in marketing and other services in the first such
extensive link between a US and Japanese carrier.
The agreement, which comes amid fierce competition over trans-Pacific air
traffic, 'will possibly lead to a definitive marketing and business
relationship in the US and Japan,' ANA said yesterday.
The Japanese carrier will co-operate with Delta through schedule
co-ordination to facilitate connections between the two carriers, sharing of
facilities and passenger handling and mutual participation in frequent flyer
programmes.
The two companies will also explore opportunities for code-sharing and
blocked-space arrangements in the US and the Asia-Pacific region centred in
Japan.
Such arrangements would enable ANA to attract trans-Pacific travellers
flying to US destinations to which ANA does not fly, by publicising easy
transfer to Delta flights.
Delta would have similar benefits in attracting travellers from the US to
Japan. It would also benefit from being able to use ANA's facilities,
including reservation facilities, throughout the carrier's extensive network
in Japan and Asia.
The deal highlights the increasingly competitive environment, particularly
in trans-Pacific travel, where low-cost US carriers have taken market share
from the leading Japanese carriers. Japan's airlines have seen their profits
eroded in the country's economic recession and as competition from
lower-cost carriers has increased.
'There is a limit to competing on your own,' an ANA representative said.
'There is a need to pull strengths together.'
The agreement follows a history of friction between the US and Japan over
their bilateral aviation accord, which Japan claims unfairly benefits US
carriers at the expense of Japanese airlines.
Also at issue has been access in and out of Tokyo's busy Narita airport and
Japanese flight frequencies to the US.
The agreement also reflects the growing interest US airlines have in
expanding their operations in the Asia-pacific region, which is expected to
be the most promising growth market for air travel in the near term.
Japan Air Lines, the country's largest airline, said that it could also
strengthen its competitive position through a similar tie-up and confirmed
that it is in talks with other airlines about such arrangements.
Recently JAL announced that it would be sharing flights with Air France from
Paris to Osaka, when the new Kansai International Airport opens later this
year.
All Nippon Airways is also understood to be discussing commercial links with
British Airways.

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Keeping politics out of the canal -
Stephen Fidler on concern about its management by the Panama government in
1999
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When some Panamanians look at what has happened to the railway that crosses
their country, they despair of the prospects for the canal their government
is due to take over at the end of the decade.
The railway, which connects Panama City on the Pacific Ocean with Colon on
the Atlantic side, was handed over to the Panamanian government after
ratification of the 1977 canal treaties between the US and Panama.
Handed over as a thriving concern, the railway is now virtually moribund.
There is a nagging worry that the canal, in its 80th year of operation, may
go the same way.
From the Panama Canal administration building at Balboa Heights, the
inactivity of the railway can be clearly seen. According to Mr Gilberto
Guardia, the canal's administrator and the first Panamanian to hold the
post, the railroad serves as a useful reminder about what could happen if
the management of the canal falls victim to political infighting.
'There is a legitimate concern over the deterioration of the railroad,' he
says. 'Evidently it's an agency that had its share of mismanagement that was
a result of its becoming politicised. From the point of the view of the
canal, it's a great thing that that happened.'
Mr Ricaurte Vasquez, a former budget and planning minister, says the new
government of Mr Ernesto Perez Balladares, which will take office in
September, 'will have to send the world a signal that the canal will not be
run as government has run things in the past.'
Moves are already under way to do just that. Measures are before the
Panamanian congress designed to ensure that the canal is isolated from
Panamanian politics and run as an independent business after it is handed
over at midday on December 31 1999.
To encourage this, the US administration is expected to ask the US congress
to approve changes to the Panama Canal Commission. These changes would
convert the commission to a government corporation, allow the greater use of
independent external advisers from countries other than the US and Panama,
and allow the canal board the final authority to set toll rates. President
Bill Clinton said the aim of the proposals would be to 'facilitate and
encourage the operation of the canal through an autonomous entity under the
government of Panama after the transfer of the waterway.'
Whatever happens once the canal is transferred, it is not going to affect
the way the canal is managed in the meantime, says Mr Guardia. 'We are
managing it as if it were not going to be transferred,' he says. The canal's
maintenance plan is continuing - it is programmed until the year 2005 - and
a plan is going ahead to widen the canal at its narrowest point, the
Gaillard Cut.
Work started in January 1992 on this Dollars 200m (Pounds 132m) project  -
which will allow two-way traffic 24 hours a day for the largest 'Panamax'
ships which can now, for safety reasons, only travel one way through the
eight-mile channel during darkness.
Meanwhile, the canal is seeing the benefit of the revival of the economy in
the US, officials say. Some 13 per cent of US trade still passes through the
canal - despite the growth in container traffic across the US rail network -
and the US remains the largest user of the canal. Revenues rose to more than
Dollars 400m in the last financial year ending September 30 for the first
time, despite a fall in tonnage through the canal, thanks to higher tolls.
Canal officials say that higher tolls have not been responsible for the
fall-off in traffic since 1991 and assert that even if tolls were eliminated
completely most container traffic now using the US rail network would still
use the route. The highest tonnage ever went through the canal in 1982 - the
year a new oil pipeline opened across the isthmus.
But no toll increase is planned for this year after the 10 per cent rise
that took effect in October 1992. 'We don't envisage a toll rate increase
next year either,' says the administrator. 'There is a possibility that we
may go through 1996 (without an increase) but it's early to say.'

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Concentrate effort, UK groups told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British companies as well as government aid should concentrate on a few
centres of economic growth in China in order to maximise their impact and
build strong relationships, Mr Richard Needham, the British trade minister,
said yesterday.
Speaking at a London seminar on the city of Suzhou, he said: 'I do not
believe that a scattergun approach to China works. You may hit the target
but you are far more likely to miss it.' He urged UK businessmen to consider
Suzhou as one area in which they could establish a presence.
Mr Needham last year signed a memorandum of understanding with the mayor
under which British companies are to be offered preferential terms for
investment in Suzhou, which is 60 miles west of Shanghai, in return for
co-operation on the city's development plans.
He expected UK companies to be involved in a full range of activities,
particularly infrastructural projects such as power stations,
telecommunications, and a clean-up of the canal city's water, as well in
manufacturing investment and services.
The British presence would, in part, be a partnership with Singapore, which
is building an industrial township to the east of the old city.
Mr Alan Barlow, a director of accountants Coopers and Lybrand, which has
produced a report on the Suzhou plans, said: 'We're piggy-backing on what
the Singaporeans are doing.'
Mr Needham said this triangular approach would also be appropriate in other
parts of China, such as in Wuhan in central China, where Hong Kong companies
are heavily involved, and in the eastern city of Fuzhou, where Taiwanese
companies might be involved. He said there were similar opportunities in
Bangalore, India, where Singapore is building another industrial park.
Mr Needham said Britain must make clear its long-term commitment to
involvement in China's development, in order to counter suspicions about
London's intentions after sovereignty over Hong Kong passed to China in
1997.
Failure to build on British investment in Hong Kong - which he estimated at
Pounds 50bn - would be a devastating loss and put Britain's role a world
power in question, he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China will give preference to foreign automobile manufacturers who
demonstrate their commitment by launching vehicle component projects to
satisfy the country's huge demand for components and spare parts.
Mr Ye Qing, vice-director of the State Planning Commission, yesterday
outlined conditions for the entry of foreign carmakers after a freeze
expires on new manufacturers at the end of next year.
'All things being equal priority will be given to foreign partners who have
shown good co-operation in the spare and component parts fields,' Mr Ye told
reporters.
China has not yet officially unveiled its new Industrial Policy for the
Automobile Industry (IPAI), but companies such as Toyota and Mitsubishi,
Ford and General Motors have been informed they have been excluded from
establishing assembly plants until 1996 at the earliest.
Beijing has made it clear that it wants investment in its components sector
which is backward, fragmented and inadequate for the demands of a modern
automotive industry.
The car giants, who have been slow to take advantage of opportunities in
China, are being told effectively they have to prove themselves by going
into the components business.
Most of the big car makers are presently investigating possibilities,
including seeking joint venture partners in components manufacturing.
Foreign manufacturers who established an early presence in China such as
Volkswagen have been accorded a significant windfall under the present
freeze on entrants to the ranks of international companies involved in
assembly.
Mr Ye confirmed reports in the Chinese press that Beijing would establish
three automotive conglomerates based on the Ist Auto Works in Changchun in
north China where the the Audi and Jetta cars are being assembled; Shanghai
where the VW Santana is being produced; and the 2nd Auto Works near Wuhan in
Hubei province where the Citroen ZX small car is being assembled.
China produced some 300,000 passenger vehicles last year and imported
another 100,000.
The country plans to be producing some 1.5m vehicles by the end of the
decade.

IBM is to concentrate its south-east Asian computer processing operations in
Australia, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The US company said that following a
review of its requirements for the Asian region, it had decided to
consolidate operations in two countries, Japan and Australia, instead of
handling the work in each individual country.
A new centre, possibly in Sydney, will administer all IBM's business
processing for the south-east Asian nations, ranging from customer ordering
to maintainance.
Government ministers declared that the decision could lead IBM to boost
investment in Australia by more than ADollars 300m (Pounds 144.2m) during
the next five years and create up to 375 additional jobs.

Sales of the big three US carmakers in Japan have surged recently with the

Nakamoto in Tokyo. Japanese sales of GM, Ford and Chrysler from January to
May doubled from the same period last year to 16,531 units, according to the
Japan Auto Importers Association.
While the yen's sharp appreciation has made US cars more affordable, the
rise in sales was also helped by the greater awareness among Japanese
consumers of US cars.
Ford has launched prime-time advertising on Japanese TV and is putting the
Ford name on dealers previously known as Autorama, which it owns through a

Spanish cigarette brands will be made in Poland from this autumn under an
agreement between the Tabacalera tobacco group and Polish state company ZPT
Radom, writes David White in Madrid.
The accord marks the first foreign manufacturing investment by the
partly-privatised Spanish company. It is the latest in a series of
agreements between Polish cigarette manufacturers and international groups.
Tabacalera said it would spend about Pta750m (Pounds 3.64m) on the Polish
project. Apart from licensed production of Tabacalera's Fortuna and Winns
brands, the two companies plan to introduce a new brand through a joint
venture 51 per cent controlled by the Spanish partner.
Tabacalera will supply packaging equipment and raw materials and will take
charge of promotion, with the Polish company responsible for production and
distribution. The Spanish said Poland ranked eighth among world markets for
tobacco products, and had one of the highest per capita consumption rates,
of 7.28 cigarettes per day, compared with 5.6 in Spain.
Further deals are under discussion in Europe and other foreign markets in an
effort by Tabacalera to offset a gradual decline in domestic sales of
tobacco products.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of 19 Latin American countries and Spain and Portugal have
endorsed Mexican President Carlos Salinas to head the new World Trade
Organisation, the Mexican embassy in Washington said yesterday.
The embassy said that leaders reached a consensus on the Salinas candidacy
at the fourth meeting of the Ibero-American summit in Cartagena, Colombia.
The decision will give momentum to the campaign on behalf of Mr Salinas.
Brazilian diplomats in London, however, cautioned that it was premature to
suggest that Mr Salinas had unanimous support from the region, and
underlined that Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's minister of the economy and a
former ambassador to Gatt, was the only candidate from Latin America yet to
have been formally declared.
Mr Salinas is not expected to campaign for the new post, created by the
Uruguay Round, until after the Mexican elections in August. However, his
supporters both in and outside Mexico wanted to move quickly to head off the
candidacy of 57-year-old Mr Ricupero.
Among Latin American officials in Washington it has been expected that the
region would unite behind one candidate. 'Mr Salinas has the larger
international stature,' said one official. 'He is a very strong candidate.'
Mexico acted swiftly and deliberately in the week before the European Union
was to rally around its own candidate - Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian
trade minister. Mr Ruggiero is expected to win the formal endorsement of the
EU, probably at the Corfu summit next week.
In the US there is wide support for Mr Salinas, who is seen as energetic and
ambitious. However, it is thought that Mr Salinas first must be the
candidate of the developing countries before the US announces its backing.
Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's finance minister, was recently quoted as saying
that Mr Salinas was a 'suitable candidate', and that were he to be appointed
head of the organisation 'we could not be in better hands'.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Austere budget for Kenya as debts rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Musalia Mudavadi, Kenya's finance minister, yesterday announced an
austere 1994/95 budget with little scope for investment in the country's
dilapidated social services or transport infrastructure, against the
backdrop of a stagnant economy and escalating debt servicing costs.
Nevertheless, Mr Mudavadi forecast an economic turnaround this year and
promised to reduce inflation to less than 10 per cent by the end of 1994
from about 40 per cent at present.
A better harvest was expected to boost Kenya's economic growth rate to 3 per
cent in 1994, he said, still barely ahead of population growth but better
than the dismal 0.1 per cent registered in 1993 - the country's worst
economic performance since independence 30 years ago.
Few conjurers would envy the trick Mr Mudavadi must perform this year. Under
the watchful gaze of the International Monetary Fund, he has been ordered to
cut the budget deficit while servicing a growing public debt.
Reducing from 7 per cent of GDP this year will be difficult in the face of
the government's ballooning domestic debt - the product of financial
profligacy in the run-up to the December 1992 elections and subsequent
banking frauds that cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars.
The KPounds 2.57bn (Pounds 31m) domestic debt servicing bill consumed almost
half the government's revenue last year. 'It dominated the entire outcome of
the budget,' Mr Mudavadi admitted. 'It blew the deficit beyond acceptable
limits.'
As a result, Mr Mudavadi was forced to curtail public investment sharply
last year. Gross investment, he noted, fell by 16.4 per cent last year, with
the government responsible for four-fifths of that drop.
There will be no respite this year. Mr Mudavadi warned government ministries
that they would be issued with monthly expenditure ceilings.
Their cash balances will henceforth be monitored daily by the central bank
via a recently set-up computer network.
He is also planning to cut direct and indirect subsidies to the parastatal
sector, which totalled 5.5 per cent of GDP last year. Legislation is planned
to encourage private sector investment in the electricity sector,
telecommunications, and port and railway services.
On the revenue side, Mr Mudavadi has introduced private inspection companies
inside customs to cut down on the evasion of import duties, an estimated
one-third of which are never paid.
Mr Mudavadi said foreign aid flows would cover 23 per cent of government
expenditure next year, but deplored that fact that most aid was 'tied' to
specific projects.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Zimbabwe civil servants receive large pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Zimbabwe's public servants, police and soldiers are to get an interim pay
rise ranging from 10 to 23 per cent next month, at a cost of ZDollars 1.74bn
(Pounds 146.6m).
In a country, where individuals are overtaxed, according to finance minister
Dr Bernard Chidzero, the government has introduced a battery of tax-free
allowances for public servants covering housing and transport.
The chairman of the Public Service Commission said the increases, announced
late on Wednesday night, were an interim measure designed to help civil
servants cope with inflation of 24 per cent over then past year.
He said private sector salaries were - on average - 172 per cent higher than
those in the public service while parastatal employees were paid 84 per cent
more than civil servants.
The government was committed to redressing this situation once it had
considered the report of a British consultant. Further reviews of allowances
for the police and the defence forces were under way, he added.
Ironically, the announcement follows increasingly shrill warnings about
inflationary pressures in the economy from the Reserve (central) Bank of
Zimbabwe.
The ZDollars 1.7bn pay award represents a rise of nearly 12 per cent in
public spending in the 1994/5 fiscal year starting on July 1.
With the government likely to miss its budget deficit target of 5.4 per cent
of GDP by a substantial margin - most estimates suggest a deficit in the
current year to June 30 of around 9 per cent - the increase will not go down
well with the donor community.
But with real wages having fall by a third in the last four years to a
20-year low, substantial pay increases, next year as well as this, were
inevitable, the more so ahead of next February's general elections.
With inflation forecast to average at least 24 per cent this year, thispay
award is not going to reverse the long-run downward trend in real take-home
pay.

FT  17 JUN 94 / No peace yet in troubled Kashmir: Kidnappings highlight
unrest in spite of fragile gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The kidnapping of two British tourists by separatist militants in the
northern Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir highlights how far this troubled
region still is from peace.
Over the last 12 months, the Indian authorities have tried to create the
impression that the violence which has hit Kashmir in the past four years is
being brought under control. They were so successful that tourists started
coming back this year: owners of hotels, houseboats and handicraft shops
thought their trade could at last see a revival.
The kidnapping has put in jeopardy this fragile gain in confidence. It is
now 11 days since Mr David Mackie, aged 36, and 16-year-old Kim Housego, son
of Mr David Housego, a former Financial Times staff correspondent, were
captured while on trekking holidays with their families.
The incident has exposed the fact that despite considerable advances in
suppressing militants in the capital city of Srinagar and the surrounding
valley, the Indian security forces are far from crushing the separatist
fighters.
Even the government's own figures show violence remains widespread. In the
five months to the end of May, the death toll was broadly the same as for
the same months last year - 501 militants, 85 members of the security
forces, and 420 civilians (killed in militant attacks or in crossfire.) A
further 139 people were kidnapped. Altogether nearly 10,000 have died since
the fighting broke out in 1990, according to official statistics. The
militants put the total at more than 20,000.
This is not to say the authorities have made no progress in the past year.
The security forces have killed or captured several top militant leaders and
disrupted lines linking militants with their sources of supply in
neighbouring Pakistan.
Delhi scored a considerable coup last November by bringing to a peaceful end
a month-long siege of the Hazratbal mosque, the holiest Moslem shrine in
Kashmir.
'In Srinagar at least the improvement is palpable,' says a senior official
of the Jammu and Kashmir state government.
But even in Srinagar, life is far from normal. The paramilitary Border
Security Force patrols the streets and maintains sand-bagged bunkers. 'If
Srinagar seems quiet it is because we have adjusted to life under
occupation, not that we have accepted it,' says Mr Abdul Ghani, a
representative of the All Party Freedom Conference, an umbrella organisation
of Kashmiri political groups, some of which demand independence and others
union with Pakistan.
Moreover, while violence has declined in the Moslem heartland of Srinagar
and the surrounding valley it has increased elsewhere - notably in the
southern districts with mixed Moslem/Hindu populations, including the hilly
Doda area, where militants recently assassinated two local leaders of the
right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party.
There is also a shift in the balance of power among the militants, with
groups linked to the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, the
pro-independence political organisation, losing ground to radical
pro-Pakistan Islamic groups.
They see the battle against India as a jihad - a holy war. Supplied with
arms from within Pakistan and strengthened by the presence of small numbers
of Afghan and other battle-hardened Moslem fighters, these groups have
challenged the traditional dominance of the JKLF. Among these radicals
organisations is Harkat-ul-Ansar, which captured the two Britons.
The JKLF seems unsure how to react. Some leaders want no compromises, others
appear to be putting out feelers to the Indian government, among them Mr
Yasin Malik, who was released from prison a month ago and promptly appealed
publicly for talks.
It is hard to see how the government can respond if the JKLF sticks to
demands for independence. But if it does nothing, it could miss a valuable
opportunity to create a point of contact with the militant movement. There
may not be much time - pro-Pakistan militants tried to shoot Mr Malik
earlier this month and could try again.
Delhi is aware that the longer the fighting goes on, the more the
pro-Pakistan Islamic groups are likely to gain ground, notably
Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, the biggest and most active organisation. Mr Rajesh
Pilot, the minister responsible for Kashmir, has said repeatedly that he
wants to start a 'political process', meaning talks with Kashmiri groups,
followed by state-level elections and possibly an increase in autonomy from
Delhi.
'I feel there is more chance of the political process starting now than at
any time in the past two years,' he says.
But for most Kashmiri activists, hints of increased autonomy are worthless.
Mr Ghani says: 'If we don't leave India, all this violence will have been
for nothing.'
Yesterday Mr Housego returned to Pahalgam, the area of the kidnapping, with
a group of journalists, in a move to encourage the kidnappers, who are
apparently nervous about the presence of Indian security forces, to release
their captives. If he succeeds it will at least remove one point of tension
in the troubled state.

South Yemen will ask for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to
discuss Yemen's seven-week civil war, it said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Dubai.
Southern foreign minister Abdullah al-Asnaj said in Saudi Arabia that he
would fly to New York today with Prime Minister Haider Abu Bakr al-Attas to
ask the Council to convene.
Mr al-Asnaj said at least 47 civilians had been killed in Aden yesterday in
repeated northern rocket attacks on the besieged city of 400,000
inhabitants. The fresh barrage followed assurances by northern President Ali
Abdullah Saleh to the United Arab Emirates that he accepted an immediate
ceasefire.
Leaders of the breakaway southern state were due to meet the UN peace envoy,
Lakhdar Brahimi in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to discuss the north's latest
conditions for a truce.
Mr Brahimi, shuttling between the two sides in several locations, met
northern leaders in their capital Sanaa on Wednesday after talks with
secessionist leader Ali Salem al-Baidh in the ancient southern city of
Mukalla.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Egypt resists IMF pressure to devalue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Monetary Fund is pressing for a devaluation of the
Egyptian pound as part of the country's reform programme, but the government
is resisting for fear of harming investor confidence, a senior minister has
admitted.
The disagreement is holding up IMF approval of Egypt's economic reform
programme which, once secured, would trigger the relief of between Dollars
4bn and Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.6bn-Pounds 3.3bn) of external debt under a
deal reached in 1991 with the country's Paris Club creditors.
The government conceded this week it had abandoned hopes of gaining such
approval by next month, as originally hoped. Ministers are now looking
towards the year's end.
Mr Atef Obeid, public sector minister, vowed Egypt would 'never devalue',
saying that continued currency stability was essential to sustain and
improve flows of capital into the economy.
Egypt's central bank has pegged the pound at around Pounds E3.3 to the
dollar for the past three years, aided by high interest rates which have
attracted substantial financial flows. Over that period, it has been buying
dollars to prevent the pound from appreciating, accumulating reserves which
now stand at Dollars 16.6bn (Pounds 11bn) and cover 16 months of imports.
The IMF has argued that Egypt cannot indefinitely hold the pound at
artificially high levels without harming export competitiveness, a view
supported by many local businessmen and bankers, who believe a level of
between Pounds E3.8-Pounds E4 to the dollar is more realistic.
The Fund also argues that a devaluation would then permit accelerated cuts
in Egypt's high interest rates, which the IMF sees as an additional
constraint on its already modest economic growth.
The government has trimmed rates in the past two years, but many bankers
believe the interest rate structure to be misaligned and rates too high.
Prime lending rates to multinationals, for instance, stand at 12 per cent,
three-month treasury bills at 12.2 per cent, and the discount rate at 15.4
per cent.
Mr Obeid resisted the argument that Egypt must devalue to boost non-oil
export earnings from Dollars 2bn a year at present to the government's
target of Dollars 10bn by 1999. 'There is no reason for the pound to fall,
exports are already increasing,' he said, citing a 16 per cent rise in
exports last year over 1992.
The government also fears a devaluation might prompt swift and hefty
transfers out of pounds back into dollars, reversing the successful
'de-dollarisation' of the economy over the past three years, while placing
pressure on reserves.
'We made it very clear we disagree,' Mr Obeid said. 'We will do what is
right for the Egyptian economy.'

FT  17 JUN 94 / Trade surplus shows sharp drop in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first clear-cut evidence that Japan's huge current account surplus has
peaked came yesterday with figures showing a sharp drop in the trade surplus
for May.
The Ministry of Finance reported that the customs-cleared merchandise trade
surplus fell by 15.9 per cent from the same month a year earlier, to Dollars
6.54bn (Pounds 4.3bn), the first double-digit year-on-year decline since
December 1991.
Imports rose by 12.3 per cent to Dollars 21.5bn while exports grew by just
4.2 per cent to Dollars 28.1bn on a year earlier. The more reliable
three-month trend, which irons out monthly fluctuations, showed a fall in
the seasonally-adjusted trade surplus of 7 per cent in the three months to
the end of May.
The sharp fall in the dollar-denominated surplus reflects the decline in yen
terms under way for several months. The sharp rise of the Japanese currency
against the dollar in the last year had led to a rise in the
dollar-denominated surplus, despite a fall in the surplus in volume terms.
But yesterday's figures suggest the volume of imports is now growing so fast
as to outweigh the effects of the stronger yen. Import volumes rose rose as
much as 16.1 per cent on a year ago, the fifth consecutive monthly increase,
while export volumes fell 2.6 per cent, the fourth straight fall.
The sharp rise in import volumes appears to reflect a slight strengthening
in domestic demand, but some analysts attribute it to the growth in Japanese
companies' offshore production. To offset the yen's high value, many
manufacturers have stepped up overseas production.
Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, said:
'The Japanese economy is now sucking in imports, as Japanese companies
increase the foreign out-sourcing of many of their operations.'
Most analysts agreed that the figures marked a turning point. 'The strong
yen is at last being reflected in a smaller dollar trade surplus,' said Mr
Dick Beason, senior economist at James Capel Pacific. 'We can now expect to
see some spectacular falls in the surplus in the second half of the year.'
But the figures are unlikely to have an immediate effect on the trade
tension between the US and Japan. The bilateral trade surplus rose 7.5 per
cent from a year ago to Dollars 3.05bn, reflecting the strength of US demand
for imports.
The dollar was little affected, remaining under pressure against the
Japanese currency, at Y102.65 to the dollar at the close of Tokyo trading.
Ministers greeted the figures with caution.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hong Kong government yesterday put its improving relations with China to
the test when it said it would seek the local legislature's approval for
more than HKDollars 15bn (Pounds 1.2bn) of finance for the colony's
multi-billion dollar airport project.
Britain and China have yet to agree overall terms for the financing of the
project, Asia's largest integrated transport plan. The two are discussing
the Hong Kong government's fourth financial plan for the project; hopes have
been raised that an agreement is within sight.
China yesterday confirmed that Mr Alastair Goodlad, a British foreign office
minister, will visit Beijing next month. A Chinese government spokesman said
Beijing was keen that disputes about Hong Kong should not sour China's wider
relations with Britain.
The request for further funding from the Legislative Council (LegCo) is by
far the government's biggest gamble in its 'step-by-step' approach to
building the airport. China has acquiesced in the past to LegCo voting funds
for the project, but its continued indulgence cannot be taken for granted.
Mr Lu Ping, a senior Beijing official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, said
recently that the government should refrain from further funding requests,
pending an overall agreement with China. At the same time, Mr Lu said he
thought the issue of finance could be settled shortly.
A Hong Kong government official said yesterday that more funds were needed
by the Provisional Airport Authority so that companies tendering for work
could be certain the authority had the money. Tenders for work have to be
let between July and September if a mid-1997 completion date for the airport
is to be achieved.
The official noted that China had been informed about a month ago of the
need for more funds and had been told the details of yesterday's funding
request some days ago.
The government is asking LegCo for HKDollars 8.9bn to build the airport
passenger terminal, HKDollars 4.93bn for the airport's first runway and
other essential civil engineering, Dollars HK1.08bn for baggage handling
facilities, and HKDollars 227m for the airport authority's head office
expenses.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Clinton has few trump cards up his sleeve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea's apparent willingness to allow international inspectors to
continue their monitoring provided some welcome news yesterday for a US
administration faced with few attractive options in its dealings with the
unpredictable Pyongyang regime.
President Bill Clinton and his advisers would like nothing better than to be
able to resolve the crisis over North Korea's nuclear programme through
diplomacy, but the US has little leverage to bring to the bargaining table
against a government which is already in most respects an international
outcast.
The administration has been grappling, ever since it took office a year and
a half ago, with the problem of what Mr Anthony Lake, White House national
security adviser, calls 'backlash states'. Besides North Korea, Mr Lake
numbers Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Libya in his list of such 'recalcitrant and
outlaw states that not only choose to remain outside the family but also
assault its basic values'.
Of the five, North Korea is apparently most advanced in its development of
weapons of mass destruction.
The US response has been a strategy of containment, backed by a willingness,
as yet untested, to respond with military force to any aggressive act. While
not ruling out any option, Washington officials have expressed no readiness
for pre-emptive military action.
That leaves only diplomacy, a path hindered by the difficulty of penetrating
the mind of President Kim Il-sung and the North Korean regime, as well as by
the paucity of levers available to the US.
The administration has tried to keep some carrots in the deal presented to
North Korea. These come in the shape of a promised improvement in diplomatic
relations and economic ties.
The danger is that it will be trapped into conferring these privileges over
and over, in exchange for minimal North Korean concessions.
Few sticks, however, come to hand. The problem is not just persuading China
not to veto a United Nations sanctions resolution. It is that only China and
a handful of other countries have any significant economic relationships
with North Korea through which economic pressure can be applied.
The arms embargo proposed in the first phase of the US's draft resolution
seems unlikely to have much effect, since the main countries that trade arms
with North Korea are the same 'backlash states' least likely to comply with
UN sanctions.
The advantage of the phased approach contained in the US draft, however, is
that the next step along the road is not a renewed Korean War. Some in
Washington argue that the US does not have the luxury of waiting to see if
Pyongyang will have a change of heart.
Mr Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser under President George Bush,
and Mr Arnold Kanter, under-secretary for political affairs in the Bush
State Department, argued in the Washington Post that more immediate action
was needed to deal with the possibility that North Korea might, by 1995,
have reprocessed enough plutonium to make another four to six nuclear
warheads: 'We should tell North Korea that either it must permit continuous,
unfettered International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring to confirm that no
further reprocessing is taking place, or we will remove its capacity to
reprocess.'
Mr Scowcroft does not believe a limited attack to destroy North Korea's
nuclear reprocessing facility would in fact lead the North to military
retaliation.
The State Department says this argument 'had not been overlooked,' but Mr
Scowcroft and Mr Kanter understate the risk of all-out war between North and
South Korea.
That warning was reinforced yesterday when a Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman confirmed Beijing stood by its mutual defence agreement with North
Korea.
Nor is there great support for such a military gamble in the US Congress,
even among Mr Scowcroft's friends in the Republican party.
'I think on our side there is a 'Be cautious, be firm, but don't rush into
anything right this minute' kind of mood,' said Congressman Newt Gingrich,
number two in the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Powder keg that could reignite: Price demanded by North
Korea for nuclear inspections could be steep
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Korean peninsula is a political powder keg that has caused three
regional wars since 1894 when China and Japan clashed over the country. The
question is whether the North Korean nuclear dispute will cause a fourth
conflict.
Whether the crisis can be resolved peacefully depends largely on North
Korea's intentions in refusing international inspections of its nuclear
facilties. The most optimistic interpretation has been that it was seeking
concessions from the US in return for allowing full inspections .
Yesterday, former US President Jimmy Carter said the North Koreans had
agreed to allow inspectors to remain at its nuclear plant, a statement
welcomed cautiously by Washington. A deal, perhaps brokered by Mr Carter,
could head off confrontation but the price demanded is likely to be steep.
Pyongyang wants US diplomatic recognition, economic aid including the supply
of safer light-water nuclear reactors, and the eventual withdrawal of the
37,000 US troops from South Korea. The latter would be linked to a peace
treaty between North Korea and US that would formally end the Korean war of
1950-53. In return for diplomatic normalisation, the US is also likely to
demand conditions that North Korea may find unacceptable, including
improvements in human rights and ending its exports of long-range missiles.
Another thorny issue is whether the US would permit North Korea to retain
the two nuclear weapons it is already suspected of possessing, as long as
nuclear safeguards would prevent it from making any more. That issue could
be solved if full inspections disclose that the North has not yet succeeded
in constructing atomic bombs.
There are other obstacles to a diplomatic solution. Negotiations could
easily founder due to mutual distrust. Any negotiations would also be
lengthy. This presents a political problem for President Bill Clinton,
already criticised by domestic conservative opponents for being too patient.
Granting diplomatic recognition to North Korea would also open Mr Clinton to
charges that he has bowed to nuclear blackmail, although he has established
a precedent by giving economic aid to Ukraine in return for dismantling its
nuclear forces.
US concessions to North Korea would also be likely to anger South Korea and
provoke doubts about a US commitment to its defence. This could force Seoul
to quit the US nuclear umbrella and try to acquire its own nuclear weapons
capability.
North Korea has engaged in diplomatic brinkmanship since the nuclear dispute
erupted in March 1993 when it threatened to withdraw from the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty.
There is a growing belief in Washington and Seoul that North Korea is just
playing for time as it pushes ahead to build more nuclear weapons.
The worst-case scenario is that North Korea plans to sell both weapons-grade
plutonium and missiles to other anti-western nations, such as Iran and
Libya, in return for hard currency and oil supplies. keep its struggling
economy afloat.
Although US economic aid might remove the need for weapons sales, Pyongyang
would prefer not to become economically dependent on the US, according to
this analysis.
If, despite yesterday's encouraging signals, North Korea does not appear
willing to compromise within the next few weeks the UN Security Council
would begin introducing phased sanctions. These would start with mild
measures, such as ending UN economic aid, and gradually escalating to an oil
embargo and cut-off of cash remittances from Korean-Japanese. But China may
try to block sanctions.
Even if Beijing allows the passage through the United Nations of phased
sanctions, it may try to cushion their effect on North Korea by turning a
blind eye to continued supplies of oil and grain, which are vital to
Pyongyang. China has a vested interest in preventing North Korea from
collapsing, since it wants to avoid millions of refugees streaming across
its borders.
There is little doubt that UN sanctions would cause North Korea to withdraw
from the NPT, which would deepen the dispute. Pyongyang has said it would
consider sanctions an act of war, implying it would launch an attack
against, possibly, South Korea or Japan.
Officials in Seoul believe the threat is a bluff to intimidate South Korea
and Japan from supporting sanctions, and that North Korea realises it would
lose any war. But terrorist activity is not ruled out.
If economic sanctions are introduced, the US and its Japanese and South
Korean allies might then adopt a wait-and-see attitude, hoping the economic
measures would lead to North Korea's eventual collapse.
Another possibility is that the Chinese-influenced North Korean military
might stage a coup against the country's next leader, Mr Kim Jong-il, once
his father, the 82-year-old President Kim Il-sung, dies. There is believed
to be considerable military opposition to Kim junior.
But there are certain time constraints to waiting. North Korea is on the
brink of rapidly expanding its nuclear capability. While it now operates
only a 5MW reactor, it is expected to complete building a 50MW reactor in
1995 and a 200MW one in 1998 that could produce amounts of plutonium.
The US might, consequently, consider conducting a pre-emptive military air
strike to knock out the two bigger reactors before they are finished.
But this action carries grave risks. It would be likely to trigger a
desperate military invasion of South Korea by the North. Pyongyang might
also launch Scud missiles against the South's 12 commercial nuclear reactors
in retaliation, which would spread radioactivity clouds throughout the
region.
For this reason, the US is unlikely to find much support for a military
solution from South Korea and Japan.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Mayhew says poll was peace mandate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew yesterday claimed that last week's European elections had
given London a democratic mandate for pressing ahead with efforts to forge a
lasting political settlement for Northern Ireland.
Speaking on the eve of today's intergovernmental conference between British
and Irish ministers in Dublin, the Northern Ireland secretary told MPs that
more Ulster voters had voted for candidates 'supportive of or acquiescent
in' the Downing Street declaration than for candidates who opposed it.
Last week's poll was topped by the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline
Democratic Unionist party, who chose to run his campaign as a referendum on
the joint declaration.
But his majority over Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly Catholic Social
Democratic and Labour party, was much reduced.
Mr Paisley nevertheless claimed earlier this week that he had achieved what
he set out to do and said he had requested an urgent meeting with Mr John
Major, the prime minister.
Today's conference, which will be attended by both Sir Patrick and Mr
Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland minister, is expected seek progress on a
framework agreement which it is hoped will be complete by mid-July.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Marketing must develop a 'local feel'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growing differences in the performance of local economies should be
reflected in the marketing strategies of businesses, the Henley Centre says.
There remain opportunities to achieve economies of scale for businesses
through 'pan-national' production, distribution and marketing. But the
Henley Centre warns that important local differences in consumer behaviour
have implications for companies marketing many types of goods and services.
Some southern localities have high proportions of 'empty-nesters' - people
with no dependants and little or no mortgage to pay. Many have large
disposable incomes and are sitting on high levels of equity in their homes,
and will be targets for the financial services industry.
Areas with high levels of negative equity will be much less attractive
markets for many businesses, such as credit-related companies that wish to
minimise debt problems.
Businesses locating retail outlets and leisure services need to identify the
most promising areas if they are to maximise the return on their investment,
the report says.
The Henley Centre says that media products, retailing and leisure services
are businesses that need a 'local feel' in marketing strategies. For
financial services and retailers dependent on the housing market, successful
marketing may require different product design and pricing approaches.
Monitoring local performance can also help companies identify successful
products and anticipate their decline. Areas of the fastest growth are
usually first to buy new products and also the first markets to decline as
products reach the end of their life-cycle.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Labour plans individual 'accounts' for training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A radical plan to provide individuals with an entitlement to a training
account, which could be linked to their National Insurance contributions, is
being investigated by Labour Commission on Social Justice.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, spoke of the idea at a conference in
London yesterday where the main agenda was his party's ideas for what he has
called 'the university for industry'.
The 'university', working in partnership with public and private bodies,
would commission and disseminate work-based training via electronic
networks. It would seek to complement the Open University.
The idea of empowering individuals to take more responsibility for their own
training is also attractive to the government. Mr David Hunt, the employment
secretary, is looking at the issue of individuals' commitment to lifetime
learning - but recommendations about to be made by a working party will be
voluntary.
Mr Brown's remarks yesterday on an individual having an entitlement to
training complemented remarks on the same platform by Sir Geoffrey Holland,
vice-chancellor at Exeter University and formerly permanent secretary at the
departments of education and employment.
Sir Geoffrey, making one of his first major public appearances since he left
the civil service, urged Labour to back existing reforms, including National
Vocational Qualifications and the Training and Enterprise Councils, which
administer government training schemes in England and Wales.
The missing piece of the jigsaw, or 'the drive for the machine' was to raise
individuals' expectations, said Sir Geoffrey.
Individual employees would be entitled by law to ask their employer to open
an individual account in their name.
Both would pay equal amounts into the accounts at regular intervals.
Mr Brown said the commission was looking at the principle of linking
national insurance contributions to the provision of training as part of a
personal development account.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Council workers reject deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions representing Britain's 1.5m local government workers yesterday
rejected a 19-month 3.2 per cent staged pay offer.
Mr Keith Sonnet, head of the unions' negotiating team, said: 'The offer is
below the level of settlements and does nothing to address the problem of
low pay. We rejected it immediately.'
Mr Charles Nolda, the employers' chief negotiator, said the offer was
'radical'. He added: 'It balances the effect on staff of inflation and
taxation against our desire to minimise the necessity for cuts in services
and jobs.
'The offer also moves us closer to abolishing the outdated white collar/blue
collar mentality which is a barrier to employers making the best use of
their staff.'
The next meeting between local authority employers and the unions is planned
for July 6, when the unions' negotiators expect an improved offer. Both
sides would like to finalise a national agreement then.
Any basic pay offer that might satisfy the union could involve job losses in
local government. Most local authorities have had to budget for pay rises of
between only 1 per cent and 2 per cent. Their total pay bill amounts to
Pounds 14bn for the current financial year.
The employers acknowledge there is a wide gap between what they can afford
without cutting jobs and services and what the unions would like to see.
The deal presented yesterday by the Labour-dominated local authorities
offered white and blue-collar workers identical staged increases of 3 per
cent plus Pounds 225 a year - 1 per cent plus Pounds 75 a year on July 1,
the same again on September 1 and on August 1 next year.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Central England economy forecast to grow fastest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fastest economic growth in the UK over the rest of the decade will be
experienced in central England, according to a report published today by the
Henley Centre, the forecasting organisation.
Central England contains most districts with the combination of factors the
report identifies as drivers of economic growth in the 1990s - a highly
skilled workforce, strong entrepreneurial base and good infrastructure links
with the rest of Europe.
The report, which analyses the economic prospects of every local-authority
district, says these factors will create two 'arcs of prosperity'. One will
be in and around Cambridge, the other stretching from the south-west of
Birmingham, through Stratford-upon-Avon, and into Northamptonshire and
Leicestershire.
Factors such as unemployment and the negative equity of householders whose
homes are worth less than their mortgages have hit former boom areas in the
south such as Essex and southern Hampshire, the report says.
But in other parts of the south, concentrations of home ownership and high
property prices have created an area that contains most of the UK's
wealthiest districts. The area lies along the M25 from north-west to
south-west, taking in much of Surrey, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and
Hertfordshire.
But this prosperous belt is close to areas where high levels of negative
equity will dampen growth by constraining consumer spending and the ability
of people to borrow to finance their own business.
'Though there will continue to be gaps in prosperity between the regions, it
will be more important to focus on local divides within regions,' the report
says.
The Henley Centre forecasts that low inflation will hit younger people -
many suffering from negative equity - with large mortgages that will not be
eroded by inflation.
Future winners and losers among European regions will be decided less by
their geographical location and more on the basis of the health of the
businesses they have succeeded in attracting. Strong growth is forecast in
retailing, media services, telecommunications and financial services.
Transport links and good communications infrastructure will become more
important as a result, the report says. It forecasts that areas that have
been cabled to provide access to the 'information super-highway' will become
as important as good road and rail links.
Among the UK's cities, London, Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds
will do well because of their industrial structure, access to regeneration
funds, and infrastructure.
But cities will be increasingly polarised between the haves and the
have-nots. In London, the local economies in the west and north of the city
will grow fastest in the 1990s.
The more affluent parts will attract professional and managerial employees
in growth companies that need to be in cities. Unskilled workers who can no
longer find manufacturing employment in cities will be unable to find jobs
in these new businesses.
The centre says that businesses should adapt their marketing strategies to
reflect growing differences in the performance of local economies.
There remain opportunities to achieve economies of scale for businesses
through 'pan-national' production, distribution and marketing. But the
centre warns that important local differences in consumer behaviour have
implications for companies marketing many types of goods and services.
Some southern localities have high proportions of 'empty-nesters' - people
with no dependants and little or no mortgage to pay. Many have large
disposable incomes and are sitting on high levels of equity in their homes,
and will be targets for the financial services industry.
Areas with high levels of negative equity will be much less attractive
markets for many businesses, such as credit-related companies.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Outpost shows what N Korea could gain: Tony Walker sees
possibilities for far Fangchuan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the remote lookout of Fangchuan where China, Russia and North Korea
meet, the visitor views the Sea of Japan to the east and in the foreground,
the Russian wetlands that are one of the world's most prized bird
sanctuaries.
Below the lookout flows the Tumen River, muddy and shallow, delineating the
boundary where over the years, tension has risen and fallen according to
power games being played out in capitals hundreds, if not thousands, of
kilometres away. But Fangchuan provides a perspective on what might be
commercially possible if the row is eventually defused.
The Tumen River area in China's Jilin Province and the nearby ports of
Zarubino in Russia and Rajin in North Korea form the nucleus of an ambitious
scheme to draw China, Russia, Mongolia, Japan, and South and North Korea
into a partnership to develop this remote area.
Failure to resolve the North Korean issue would vastly complicate efforts by
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to encourage economic
development in a region long forgotten.
The parties to the project are due next month to initial agreements for
establishing the Tumen River Area Development Commission and Committee which
would be responsible for implementing the project: a Dollars 30bn (Pounds
20bn) gleam in the eyes of UN officials who hope to attract vast amounts of
international capital.
But even without a UN framework for development, China has quietly been
getting on with the job. North Korea is reportedly co-operating.
Hunchun, the main Chinese town in the area, has undergone a remarkable
transformation in the past year. Some 80,000 people, mostly construction
workers, have poured in, doubling its population.
Local officials are confident that in spite of regional tensions and
difficulties of co-ordination among the various players, the Tumen area will
be developed with or without the UN's grand plan.
Mr Jin Tie, vice-director of the Tumen River Development Office, says China,
Russia and North Korea see no future in maintaining the Tumen's isolation.
'The cold war atmosphere has loosened,' he said, 'the ice has melted.'
International business has begun to get involved, even at this moment of
increasing tensions between North and South over the nuclear issue.
Hong Kong and Singapore investors last month signed agreements for a 50 per
cent stake in the China North-East Asia Railway and Port Group, whose
shareholders include the local Jilin provincial government.
The company plans to build a railway bridge over the Tumen to connect with a
North Korean rail link to Rajin port would be upgraded with the construction
of grain and container terminals.
Similar work will be carried out at the Russian port of Zarubino. Hunchun
itself has established a 2 1/2 sq km economic development zone which has
attracted some 44 companies in textiles and other light manufacturing.
If there is a cloud over Hunchun these days, it has less to do with the
North Korean problem than with a slowdown in Sino-Russian border trade.
Business with North Korea is also down. Local officials of Yanbian
Prefecture, which includes Hunchun, were not able to provide figures, but
said the decline from last year's exports of Dollars 140m was steep. This
was not due to political tensions, they said, but was caused by the
continued deterioration of North Korea's economy.
While it may not be business as usual on China's north-east frontier, this
almost certainly has less to do with politics than with economics.
In the end, North Korea's failing economy may be the imperative that drives
it to seek an accommodation with the international community.
The Tumen River project shows that the North Koreans are not beyond
co-operating, when they believe it is in their interests.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Investors nervous of rising tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE, PHILIP COGGAN, MOTOKO RICH and RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yields on dollar-denominated bonds issued by South Korean borrowers have
widened out by between 25 and 30 basis points over the last week, reflecting
investor fears of a further heightening of tensions on the Korean peninsula.
Last week, Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency,
revised the outlook on its A-plus implied long-term rating on the Republic
of Korea, to negative from positive. The agency said the revision was
prompted by North Korea's refusal to comply with demands for inspection of
its nuclear facilities.
The yield spread on the benchmark Dollars 1.35bn offering of 10-year global
bonds from Korea Electric Power Company, South Korea's partially privatised
power utility, stood at 160 basis points over 10-year Treasuries yesterday,
which compares with a spread of 90 basis points when the bonds were launched
last November.
However, dealers reported some bargain-hunting which they said could lead to
a stabilisation in the bonds.
Share prices in Seoul rallied yesterday after two days of losses. The
composite stock index ended 10.16 points up at 901.08, off the day's high of
906.94, as institutions bought blue chips.
The US dollar is often perceived as a 'safe haven' in times of international
crisis and might have been expected to gain from the growing tension in
Korea.
However, the dollar has been weak for much of the last few weeks, and has
generally gained little from the Korea effect.
The markets have taken the view that US economic growth is slowing, implying
that there is less pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates.
Indeed, by putting upward pressure on commodity prices, the Korean crisis
may be upsetting the US bond market, which fears a resurgence in inflation.
A sell-off in the Treasury bond market would probably adversely affect
sentiment towards the dollar.
Deepening concern about North Korea's intentions has helped to lift oil and
gold prices.
The North Korean factor yesterday helped lift the North Sea Brent crude
price above Dollars 17 a barrel for the first time in 7 1/2 months.
Gold, seen as a haven for funds in times of trouble, is traditionally
sensitive to international security worries. Yesterday morning its price
touched a two-week high of Dollars 387.10 a troy ounce at the London bullion
market fixing. By the close it had retreated to Dollars 386.30, but that was
still up Dollars 2.80 on the week so far.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Spotlight falls on reactor technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton last night singled out as 'a promising development'
North Korea's apparent desire to convert its nuclear programme to a light
water technology that creates less bomb-grade fissile material and poses
less of a threat of nuclear proliferation.
North Korea and the US discussed this idea a year ago, but Mr Clinton's
comments raised it to a new level as a possible element in a settlement of
the impasse.
In its pursuit of nuclear technology, North Korea has had to rely largely on
its own resources. Since it possesses abundant graphite, it has adopted a
gas-graphite reactor system that is primarily fuelled with natural uranium,
rather than the low enriched uranium more commonly used in western reactors.
This natural uranium contains a higher proportion of the Uranium 238 isotope
which is converted in the nuclear reaction into Plutonium 239, a highly
dangerous isotope that can readily be converted for use in a bomb.
North Korea has indicated that as part of an overall package settlement with
the international community it would be willing to freeze construction of a
200MW gas graphite reactor scheduled for completion in 1996. This would
produce 80kg a year of bomb-grade plutonium, far more than is produced the
5MW experimental reactor Pyongyang now operates.
In exchange, however, it would like the west to supply the technology and
financing for a modern light water reactor which it has neither the know-how
nor the money to build on its own.
A light water reactor would also produce spent fuel in a form that would not
require reprocessing. North Korea has offered as part of the package to
dismantle its reprocessing plant, which is the facility in which spent fuel
could be converted to weapons uses.
This deal would be hard to implement. Exporting the necessary technology to
North Korea would breach a long list of US export control laws and would be
hard to explain to Congress.
Nor would the Dollars 2bn to Dollars 3bn financing be easy to arrange for a
country with little prospect of repaying it.
Nevertheless, some nuclear proliferation experts welcomed the idea.
'I believe their offer is serious and specific and offers a realistic way to
prevent a further accumulation of plutonium with a potential military
application,' said Mr Selig Harrison, who runs a programme on arms control
in East Asia at the Carnegie Institute, a Washington think-tank. Mr Harrison
met North Korean President Kim Il-sung earlier this month.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Arms imports by developing world increasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The volume of the international arms trade, in decline for the past seven
years, is now stabilising, with arms imports by the developing world
increasing, the annual survey of the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute says.
Sipri's analysis of world trade in conventional weapons shows total volume
declined only marginally last year, to Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.6bn) from
Dollars 22.8bn in 1992, having peaked at Dollars 45.9bn in 1987. Arms
imports by the developing world showed their first increase in six years,
with a 1993 total of Dollars 12.4bn, up from Dollars 11.7bn in 1992 but
still down on a high of Dollars 31.0bn in 1987.
Some of the fastest growth in purchases came in the Middle East, where the
conservative Gulf states and Egypt have been re-arming after the Iraq
conflict. Middle Eastern countries bought armaments worth Dollars 5.5bn last
year, up from Dollars 4.8bn in 1992 and Dollars 4.6bn in 1991. In the Nato
countries, military budgets have been falling; the share devoted to arms
procurement has been tumbling even faster.
Comparing last year with 1989, the year when communism collapsed in eastern
Europe, the institute reported a decline in Nato's manpower from 5.9m to
5.1m, a drop in general military spending (at constant prices) from Dollars
370bn to Dollars 322bn, and a plunge in procurement from Dollars 83bn to
Dollars 60bn.
Falling demand from their home markets has forced the west's top arms
companies to concentrate harder on export, particularly to the Gulf,
south-east Asia, and Latin America. Among the world's top recipients of
conventional weapons, Turkey moved from second to first place last year,
with imports of Dollars 2.5bn, ahead of India (Dollars 2.2bn), Egypt
(Dollars 1.48bn) and Saudi Arabia (Dollars 1.32bn).
In 1992, the top recipients were Greece, Turkey, China and Japan. But
measuring the value of arms for Greece and Turkey is complicated since they
receive huge volumes of second-hand equipment.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Buenos Aires port sale hit by row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bitter dispute between a consortium led by a subsidiary of UK-owned P&amp;O
and Argentina's Murchison-Roman port services company is blocking the
privatisation of the port of Buenos Aires.
The consortium, led by P&amp;O Australia, originally won bidding to operate two
of the port's busiest terminals as a 25-year concession.
But last week Mr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, rejected P&amp;O's offer
after second-placed Murchison-Roman claimed one of its rival's local
partners, OL Fasce, had not complied with bidding terms.
Mr Cavallo said he regretted P&amp;O had lost the concession, but said he
cancelled the transfer because Fasce had failed to prove it had a minimum
net worth of Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) - one of the conditions of the
privatisation.
However, P&amp;O had previously challenged Murchison-Roman's objections in
court, insisting Fasce could prove its net worth. On Wednesday it applied
for a injunction halting the transfer.
Mr Luis Dotras, a Murchison-Roman director, said P&amp;O made 'a totally
speculative offer that would be impossible to comply with.' He alleged the
P&amp;O consortium would not be able to generate sufficient cashflow to pay the
government the Dollars 13.5m (Pounds 8.88m) annual fee it had offered.
Murchison-Roman offered a Dollars 9.7m annual fee.
P&amp;O in turn alleges Murchison-Roman used lobbying strength to overturn its
bid. Mr Horacio Duranona, a lawyer acting for the P&amp;O consortium, said: 'P&amp;O
made the biggest offer. Murchison pressured Congress. The economy ministry
did not review all the documents proving sufficient net worth.'

FT  17 JUN 94 / Venezuela banking pay-out raises fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The eight financial institutions closed down by Venezuela's government this
week will re-open on Monday to begin re-paying depositors, the Finance
Ministry has announced.
Economists warn that the multi-billion-dollar financial assistance provided
by the government to ailing banks this year could drive inflation to record
levels.
The government of President Rafael Caldera has not revealed its detailed
plans for the seven commercial banks and one finance company it closed.
However, barring recapitalisation by former owners or offers by other
investors to buy out the institutions, they are likely to be liquidated.
The first payments scheduled for depositors next week will probably go to
individuals with small accounts. The tens of thousands of businesses
nationwide therefore have no idea when the government will free up larger
deposits at the banks and their subsidiaries, or if other normal banking
operations will be resumed.
Under current legislation, each individual or company holding accounts at
the institutions is entitled to a payment of up to about 4m bolivars (Pounds
15,000) from the government's bank deposit guarantee fund (Fogade),
regardless of the number of accounts they hold. This will cost the
government around Dollars 1.7bn, which may have to be funded through new
bond issues.
Officials are considering raising the total payment to individual depositors
to a maximum 10m bolivars, the same amount paid after the failure - and
recapitalisation - of Banco Latino earlier this year. The failure of Latino,
the country's second largest bank, sparked the banking crisis.
This would more than double the cost to the government, which has already
supplied around Dollars 6bn in aid to the eight banks and Banco Latino since
this year, creating a government deficit equal to around 10 per cent of GDP.
Mr Julio Sosa, the finance minister, said recently that the government
expected inflation of 50 to 60 per cent this year, up from 46 per cent in
1993. Some economic analysts are project predict price increases as high as
80 to 100 per cent. Taming inflation was one of the central goals of the
Caldera government, which took office on February 2.
It remains to be seen if the government's action will stabilise the
Venezuelan financial system, in the grip of the second year of a recession,
or if other banks that built up large loan portfolios in recent years will
face problems later on.

FT  17 JUN 94 / House starts in US up 22% in 12 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US housing starts rose 2.6 per cent last month and by 22 per cent in the
year to May, indicating residential construction remains fairly resilient
despite the rise in long-term interest rates since February.
Housing starts last month were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.51m, below the peak of 1.61m hit last December. During the first five
months of this year, the average level of starts was 21 per cent higher than
in the same period last year.
A sharp recent fall in applications for mortgages, however, has raised
doubts about future demand for new homes.
However Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury Secretary, said he was 'encouraged' by
the increase in starts. He said 30-year mortgage rates were still
favourable, which should continue to help the industry.
In a separate report yesterday the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said
its index of manufacturing activity rose modestly this month to 16.1 against
14.8 in May, but remained below first-quarter levels. The index indicates
the direction of change in manufacturing production, rather than its
magnitude.
An index for new orders declined from May indicating the pace of growth may
be slowing.
Claims for state unemployment insurance fell to 348,000 in the week ended
June 8, the lowest level in two months and a further sign that demand for
labour remains strong.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Menem warns over economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Menem has warned governors of Argentina's 23 provinces
against inserting clauses into the country's new constitution that could
destabilise his economic policies.
Most of the provinces are controlled by Mr Menem's Peronist party and are in
serious financial trouble. They intend to insert a clause in the
constitution ordering the federal government to transfer half its tax
revenues to the provinces.
But Mr Menem told them in a radio interview on Wednesday 'to be quiet and
try to contribute to reforming the constitution without introducing
destabilising elements.'
A constituent assembly is rewriting Argentina's 1853 constitution to allow
Mr Menem to run for re-election to a second four-year term next year, in
addition to strengthening the legislature and the judiciary. The assembly is
also considering additional reforms, including the relationship between
local and federal governments.
Mr Menem warned that interfering in current tax-sharing mechanisms would
undermine federal finances and destabilise the economy, as has happened in
Brazil under its 1988 constitution.
Under the current system, the provinces receive 56 per cent of selected
taxes, such as value added tax. But they do not have a right to other taxes,
notably customs revenues. In May, the provinces got an estimated Dollars
424m (Pounds 279m) in federal transfers, while the federal government's
total tax revenues were Dollars 1.86bn. However, many provinces have signed
agreements with Buenos Aires entitling them to larger, fixed transfers in
exchange for economic reforms at local level.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Changing the guard on Europe: A State Department shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man who had been eased out his job only 24 hours before, Stephen Oxman
was surprisingly devoid of rancour, only gently suggesting that some reports
of his removal were 'overplayed'.
Indeed he could easily have cancelled the interview, arranged before it was
announced that he was to be replaced as US assistant secretary of state for
European and Canadian affairs by Mr Richard Holbrooke, currently ambassador
in Bonn.
The contrast between the two could not be more stark. Mr Oxman is a low-key
former investment banker, Rhodes Scholar and friend of the president and
secretary of state. 'A really nice man,' one European ambassador said, 'but
I never thought he understood us and he was never very assertive.'
Mr Holbrooke is a gregarious Washington insider, never short of an opinion
and well connected to the younger foreign policy turks such as Mr Strobe
Talbott and Mr Sandy Berger, the number twos at the State Department and
National Security Council. His expertise is Asian and he has only been in
Bonn for eight months.
But his move, combined with an equivalent change at the NSC, indicates an
awareness of the need to strengthen the upper echelons of foreign policy
making. In spite of many rumours, this probably makes more secure, for this
year at least, the positions of Mr Warren Christopher as secretary of state,
whose retention is considered vital to the Middle East peace process, and Mr
Tony Lake as head of the NSC.
Mr Oxman says his own departure was the result of 'the realignment of some
of the principal European policy players to advance policy goals even more
effectively'. He argued that these goals were well on the way to being met.
Nato's Partnership for Peace with the members of the former Warsaw Pact was
now, he said, 'a working reality'. The setting up of combined joint task
forces gave European security a clearer definition, with 'separable but not
separate capabilities' for the Western European Union as a Nato pillar.
Co-operation with Russia, inside and outside PFP, was genuinely productive.
It mattered, too, that the US was leading the way in 'outreach' to the
countries of east Europe, for example, by encouraging capital inflows.
The Dollars 11.5bn of investment capital generated over the last five years,
nearly half to Hungary alone, is 'but a fraction' of what a region of 135m
well educated people could attract and needs. Getting the Visegrad Four
(Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia) into the OECD could also
be of practical assistance.
But the US had no 'prescribed or set vision for the EU's future'.
Association agreements already signed with eastern Europe were 'very
substantive' and the question of when the EU acquired more members was up to
the Union. The main US policy thrust was simply to avoid creating new blocs
defined on security or economic lines.
Mr Oxman concedes that relations with the leading governments in Europe were
bad in May last year over Bosnia and 'scratchy' in the run-up to the Uruguay
Round trade agreement. Yet in January Europe had virtually 'implored' the US
to take a leadership role over Bosnia, which it had, resulting in the
lifting of the siege of Sarajevo and the formation of the Bosnian-Croat
federation.
There had been setbacks (Gorazde) but also much progress on the diplomatic
front. The US effort has been led by Mr Charles Redman, but he is likely to
be reassigned to another senior ambassadorship as a result of the State
Department re-shuffle.
Still, Mr Oxman said, the evolution of Nato and the Bosnian crisis 'has
sobered people to the fact that though economics will be very important in
the transatlantic relationship it is far too soon to put security
considerations into the background.' Still he trots out figures showing the
depth of the economic relationship with Europe still exceeds Asia.
If Mr Oxman has anything close to a public complaint, it is that his bureau
is having to get by on less. It operates 90 posts in Europe, a net 16 more
than four years ago, and has 5,500 staff, over 200 in Washington. President
Bill Clinton will be making 13 'country visits' to Europe this year and the
secretary of state an estimated 23. 'We're carrying a lot of water in the
European bureau,' he adds ruefully.
But plans are already under way, as required by the president, to cut the
departmental budget by 9 per cent over the next four years. Already two of
the bureau's five deputy assistant secretaryships have gone.
That other regional bureaus are in the same boat is no consolation. 'The
fact is we are going to have to do less with less', eliminating any number
of functions normally conducted by embassies. Which is where, probably in
Europe, Mr Oxman is headed - keeping any discontent to himself.

FT  17 JUN 94 / US to cut military facilities in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US will end or reduce operations at 27 more military facilities in
Europe, most in Germany, the Defence Department said yesterday. The latest
defence cuts come after the end of the Cold War and bring to 895 the total
number of overseas military installations closed, reduced or put on stand-by
since 1990.
The new step will affect 5,655 personnel including 3,226 US troops, 506 US
civilians and 1,923 local civilians. Some 21 facilities, including Neureut
Barracks and Rhein Ordnance Barracks, are in Germany and the other six are
in Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands or Britain.
The US has cut its presence around the world by some 174,000 troops in the
past three years. In Europe it is set to shrink to a maximum of 100,000
troops by the end of next year.

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Cup: America braced for the big kick-off - How the
hosts are preparing for the feast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sneakily, a bit like a sliding tackle on a wet pitch, the World Cup of
soccer is catching up on America. Scrub that metaphor. In all nine cities
where the first round of the tournament is being played, the temperature
this week has exceeded 90'F, often with humidity to match.
So let us say that, sneakily, like a cold beer in Death Valley, soccer is
seeking to refresh America for the first time. Starting today in Soldier
Field in Chicago and the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, 24 national teams will play
52 matches over a span of exactly one month, culminating on July 17 in the
Rose Bowl in Los Angeles.
An estimated 3.6m tickets will be sold for those actually going to games,
and the small ads offering them now run to several columns a day. The global
television audience may amount to a cumulative 30bn plus, with perhaps 2bn
watching the final, rather more than the 135m who caught last year's
American football Super Bowl on the box.
Every game will be televised in the US by either ABC, one of the established
networks, or ESPN, the sports channel, without commercial interruption while
the action flows on the field, but with half-time reserved more for the
pitchmen than the players.
It will be big business - not surprising given that the profit that
organiser Peter Ueberroth made for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics has served
as such an example to Alan Rothenberg, chairman of the World Cup Organising
Committee.
Foreign visitors may spend more than Dollars 4bn of foreign currency;
commercial sponsors are paying up to Dollars 20m each for the rights to use
the World Cup logo in their marketing and promotion. The approved credit
card is MasterCard, the candy Snickers, the film Fuji, the cereal Wheaties,
and so on.
So much for the prospective numbers. So much, too, for global interest in
the World Cup, which can be taken for granted. The big question, as yet
unanswerable, is how the tournament plays in its host country, where,
according to one poll last week, two-thirds do not know that the tournament
is being played here at all (and that is an improvement on two months ago).
There are objective circumstances working in soccer's favour. It is already
entrenched in suburbia and among immigrant communities. When the US team
played Mexico recently in Los Angeles, more than 90,000 turned up, most
cheering for the Mexicans; a recent appearance by the Greek side drew over
50,000. The Italy-Ireland match tomorrow at Giants Stadium, just across the
Hudson River, is already being portrayed in terms of New York's great old
ethnic rivalry.
Second, America is a naturally hospitable and curious country always on the
look-out for something new. You can get big audiences here for the Japanese
tea ceremony or beach volleyball. The national presumption will be that
soccer, understood to be the world's most popular game, must have something
to offer, only to be disabused if this year's World Cup is as cynically
played and tactically sterile as that four years ago (sorry, Ireland).
Third, the competing American sports are approaching a mid-summer lull. Ice
hockey's Stanley Cup was settled on Tuesday night, with the New York Rangers
taking the championship for the first time since the 13th century.
Basketball's season will come to an end within a week, with either Patrick
Ewing's New York Knicks or Hakeem Olajuwon's Houston Rockets on top.
Baseball is in its mid-season passage, eternally fascinating but not yet at
a decisive stage. It may never reach that stage, since its season is now
threatened by yet another dispute between owners and players. Golf, in the
shape of the US Open, will be over and done with this weekend. Exhibition
football, American-style, does not start until August. Soccer has the
sporting coast remarkably clear to strut its stuff.
Nor has the media been negligent in trying to explain to its readers and
viewers what soccer is all about. Every self-respecting newspaper and
magazine has produced special sections stuffed with illustrations about the
game's basics - how to kick, head and trap a ball - its terminology and its
rules.
Profiles of teams and stars, all largely unfamiliar to Americans, have been
extensive. It is now no mystery that Italy's Roberto Baggio sports a
ponytail and that, even in his dotage, Roger Milla of Cameroon can still
swivel his hips on scoring.
The only soccer player even halfway towards a household word is, of course,
Pele of Brazil, and memories have been dutifully jogged by film of his great
goals (and of Gordon Banks's immortal save from him) in the 1970 World Cup.
Not all the explanatory efforts have been accurate, but the effort has been
conspicuous. Only lacking so far has been much interest on the part of the
heavyweight sporting columnists and TV and radio pundits.
One who did chip in was George Vecsey in last Sunday's special 16-page
section in The New York Times, and he had reservations. 'I have come to the
conclusion that this fervent nationalism is what makes Americans
uncomfortable with soccer. Americans are not really put off by the business
of not using the hands or by the business of low scores . . but are by the
business of language, the business of old national ties, the business of
passion.'
Good points, but debatable nonetheless. For example, this World Cup has a
new Adidas ball with a glossy surface enabling it to travel farther and
faster. It would not have been introduced if fear of scoreless draws was not
palpable, nor would referees have been instructed to interpret more
leniently the offside rule.
It is also hard to argue against the proposition that American interest will
rise or fall according to the performance of the US team. The risk is that
it becomes the first host country to fall at the first-round hurdle. The
potential is that it is in a less tough group (Romania, Colombia and
Switzerland).
There is no doubt that Bora Milutinovic, the peripatetic Serbian-born coach
who has played in five countries and managed in four, is in the process of
producing a better US side. It knocked off England 2-0 last summer, Mexico
1-0 just last month and only lost 4-3 to Germany in another summer
exhibition.
But its record against other World Cup finalists is a modest two wins, two
draws and seven defeats, and it has been handicapped by the difficulty of
fielding its widely scattered best players together at one time.
The US soccer stake extends beyond the World Cup itself. There are plans
afoot for a new professional league to replace the one effectively killed by
Pele's retirement 15 years ago from the New York Cosmos. To succeed, it will
need the participation of young American stars like Claudio Reyna and Alexi
Lalas, who will otherwise be drawn inexorably to European competition.
Ultimately, it is up to soccer to sell its finest wares to America. For
those from northern climes, that will not be so easy in this sort of heat.
Worse, beer sales have been banned at stadiums after half-time.

FT  17 JUN 94 / New currency details start to take shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's financial authorities have started to finalise details for the July
1 introduction of the country's new currency, the real, which is designed to
tackle chronic inflation.
According to Finance Ministry officials, the real will be secured by two
'anchors', designed to keep inflation out of the new currency, which will be
backed by the country's foreign exchange reserves of about Dollars 40bn.
First, the real will be linked at parity to the US dollar for an
'indeterminate period'. Second, release of the currency will be partly tied
to pre-set money supply targets.
These anchors are designed to give the government slightly more policy
flexibility than previous economic stabilisation plans in the region, such
as Argentina's. Argentina's so-called convertibility plan tied the Argentine
currency explicitly to parity with the dollar, and forbade the central bank
to issue local currency unless backed by dollar reserves. Changing the
exchange rate requires legislation. Brazil is more complicated, officials
say, because it faces presidential elections later this year.
The present administration is trying to build into the plan policy
alternatives for whichever of the two main candidates wins the elections.
Brazil's economy is also more reliant on industrial exports, which would
soon become uncompetitive if the currency became overvalued.
According to private sector analysts, the link with the US dollar is likely
to be kept in place until the end of the year. If the current election front
runner, the left-wing leader Mr Lus Inacio Lula da Silva, retains his lead
in the opinion polls and worried investors start to take capital out of the
country, central bank officials say there are sufficient reserves to spend
Dollars 1bn a month defending the currency for at least two years.
Many details, including the money supply targets themselves, will be decided
over the coming weeks. According to some estimates, the monetary base of
about Dollars 3bn will treble.

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Cup: Odds-on for a betting record
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even though England, Wales and Scotland failed to qualify, the World Cup
finals may break all records for soccer betting in Britain. The Coral
bookmaking firm reckoned yesterday that betting on the month-long
competition could top Pounds 30m.
Ireland have been well supported - down from 50-1 to 28-1 - and so have
outsiders Nigeria, sliding from 150-1 to 33-1 in recent days.
Coral lists Brazil as 3-1 favourites, followed by Germany (7-2), the
Netherlands and Italy (6-1), Colombia (9-1) and Argentina (10-1).

FT  17 JUN 94 / World Cup: Germany seeks re-run of opening game victory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Coach Berti Vogts wants World Cup champions Germany to start the way they
did four years ago: with an eye-catching victory. In today's opening game,
Germany play Bolivia in Chicago.
Until 1990, the Germans usually struggled in their opening World Cup
matches, before asserting themselves. But four years ago in Italy they
kicked-off with a fear-instilling 4-1 win against Yugoslavia, and stayed
unbeaten.
'We want to gain that momentum in the opening game that will take us through
the rest of the tournament,' said Vogts.
A world television audience of about 1bn, plus a sell-out crowd of 63,117 at
Soldier Field, will hope that new rules make the Germany-Bolivia game
exciting. In recent World Cups, the opening games were often dull and
cautious.
Hoping to galvanise the tournament after a lowest-ever average of 2.21 goals
per game in 1990, Fifa, soccer's governing body, decided that this time a
victory in the first round - involving round-robin group play - would be
worth three points.
Germany's other Group C rivals are Spain and South Korea, who clash later
tonight in Dallas.
The Germans hope to become the first team to win four World Cups.
Bolivia are making their first appearance in World Cup finals since 1950.
They are not well-regarded. However, Vogts is cautious: 'It will be tough to
score a goal against Bolivia. They have a good defence. They beat Brazil
(and) they knocked out Uruguay, a great soccer nation.'
Bolivia's main doubt concerned star forward Marco Etcheverry, who has not
played a game since breaking his left leg. Coach Xavier Azkargorta says he
will make a late decision on whether to field his most influential player.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Land inequality ignites Brazil politics: Left-wing Workers
party hopes rural policy will help win it votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three miles off the road to Caruaru, an agricultural town in Brazil's
north-eastern state of Pernambuco, is a settlement of rickety huts made of
bamboo frames and black polythene bags. About 20 families have been living
in the clearing for a year, wondering when their dream will come true.
Although they have water, there is little food and the children lack basic
health or education facilities. A band of patrolling gunmen, employed by the
local landlord to intimidate the families and deter visitors, keeps a
nervous watch over the settlement.
The families are part of Brazil's Movimento Sem Terra, or Movement of the
Landless, which claims that 5m Brazilians need land. It wants a far-reaching
redistribution of land to the poor and uses occupations of private property,
such as that under way near Caruaru, to pressure the government to act. 'I
just want a little piece of land as a means to work and to survive,' says
Mrs Cicera Monteiro.
The battle for land and rural reform has claimed more than 500 lives in the
last 10 years. This seems perverse in Brazil, one of the largest countries
in the world, with areas of low population density. But it also has one of
the most unequal land distributions in Latin America. Nearly 80 per cent of
the land is owned by 10 per cent of the farmers. Among the poor, most have
plots of less than 25 acres, sometimes only enough for subsistence.
This disparity continues to force people off the land, usually through
bankruptcy after bad harvests, and into the already overburdened cities.
Rural reform is a key pledge which Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, leader of
the left-wing Workers party (PT), hopes will help win him the presidential
election in October.
Land inequality dates from colonial days but has been compounded until
recently by government assistance to large-scale farmers, such as tax breaks
and infrastructure projects. During the 25 years to 1987, mainly under
military governments, 25m acres of land were transferred - by sale or
donation - to just 45 companies.
To redress this balance, Brazil's 1988 constitution established rules for
the appropriation of land that was not being used productively. But some of
the legislation has still not been passed. Successive government promises to
accelerate land transfer schemes have been frustrated by budget problems, a
slow bureaucracy and a judicial system which tends to back property owners.
In Pernambuco, where matters are critical because of the decline in its
sugar cane industry, about 90,000 acres have been transfered, enough to
settle nearly 3,000 families. But Mr Jaime Amorim of the Sem Terra claims
there are 350,000 families still needing land in the state and that about
7.4m acres are required to settle them.
The Sem Terra's claim that nationwide 5m people want land is impossible to
verify, but probably exaggerated. Even if they have doubled their estimates
for greater impact, this still suggests there are as many as 1m rural
families who need land, and a further 1m in the cities who would return to
the land if it became available.
These are roughly the estimates with which the PT is working. The party
believes a proper rural reform programme would take 15 years and would
involve land reallocation as well as education and reform of rural credit
and insurance systems which discriminate against smaller farmers.
'It also needs proper training and preparation of people too, otherwise they
will fail and simply desert the land again,' says Mr Jose Graziano da Silva,
a PT agricultural adviser.
Such a programme would be expensive. It usually costs the equivalent of
between Dollars 5,000 (Pounds 3,300) and Dollars 9,000 to settle each
family. The total reform bill could therefore exceed Dollars 10bn, more than
the annual health budget. The PT argues that urban jobs cost much more to
generate, while migrants to the cities are forced to live in slums.
Given the size and costs of rural reform, analysts question whether an
incoming PT government would be able to meet its likely target of settling
between 350,000 and 400,000 families in four years. The plans are also
criticised as idealistic. Brazil's rural population has fallen from 75 per
cent to 25 per cent of the total since the second world war, reflecting the
attraction of urban services as much as rural problems.
The Sem Terra, which is closely linked to the PT, is also an electoral
liability. Brazil's mainly right-of-centre media say the movement's
invasions are examples of left-wing radicalism and contempt for the law.
For the poor victims of Brazil's economic mismanagement, rational arguments
about the feasibility of the PT's pledges make little sense. In Sao Paulo
state, a large occupation near the town of Getulina was recently broken up
by the police under court order. The group, which earlier this year numbered
some 2,300 families, is camped alongside a road hoping the courts will rule
in their favour.
Francisco, a father of three, joined the group when no longer able to pay
rent on the family's room in the city of Sao Paulo. 'I hope the court
decides soon, but we'll stay, whatever happens,' he said. 'There's nothing
else to do.'

Unemployment in the Netherlands fell to an average 483,000 people in
March-May, the second successive decline since the jobless total peaked at
520,000 in January-March. The central statistical office said the figures
indicated the rise in joblessness had stabilised or been reversed. Although
the number of registered unemployed rose by 96,000 in March-May from a year
ago, this is still a slowdown compared with year-on-year figures published
so far in 1994. The latest figures are unadjusted for seasonal factors but,
even so, the drop was steeper than would normally be expected. Ronald van de
Krol, Amsterdam.
The number of unemployed in Poland fell in May for the third consecutive
month - by 47,100 to 2.8m people or 15.5 per cent of the country's
workforce. Christopher Bobinski, Warsaw

FT  17 JUN 94 / Flagging spirits test new union supremo: Germany's trade
union federation badly needs a confidence boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dieter Schulte, the steel industry union boss who has just been elected
to lead the German Trade Union Federation (DGB), inherits an organisation
badly in need of a boost to its confidence.
On the face of it this seems odd. At its congress this week in Berlin the
entire political establishment, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, came to
pay homage to the principle of social partnership and the important role of
organised labour in national political life.
Just how integrated it is into that political life was evident on Wednesday
night. In one hall Mr Rudolf Sharping, leader of the Social Democrats, gave
an address to the majority of delegates, while elsewhere a group of
Christian Democratic trade unionists was addressed by several ministers from
Bonn. Even the Greens threw a little party.
But the DGB is not only a political force. Its 16 industry-based unions
still have more than 10m members, representing a higher proportion of the
workforce than in almost any other large industrial country. And only a few
months ago the unions were being widely praised for their restraint in this
year's pay round.
So why does the 54-year-old Mr Schulte inherit such an anxious organisation?
German unions are still central to the political and industrial life of the
country - as this year's wage round underlined - but they fear they are
beginning to lose their critical mass.
Membership, although still high, has fallen by 1.5m over the past two years.
That is mainly because of job losses, especially in east Germany, but the
unions are not recruiting many new members in the growing service sector and
remain unattractive to women and young people.
The trends have contributed to the rapid decline of unions elsewhere in
Europe and Mr Schulte and his colleagues know that unless they take action
it could be them next. In his address to the congress he talked of the
dangers of becoming 'dinosaurs' and of the need to 'abandon dreams of a lost
utopia'.
Mr Ulf Fink, a Christian Democrat DGB official, even warned congress of the
French example, where union membership has fallen to 8 per cent of the
workforce.
After his speech Mr Schulte said the 'French option' would be avoided in
Germany and added that there were some special factors behind the recent
decline in union standing, 'including the disappointment that many of our
new members in east Germany felt when we could not prevent their jobs being
lost'.
The other key challenge to the unions is the growing interest of the
government in labour market deregulation as an aid to creating more jobs,
and the emergence of a two-tier labour market with an increasingly large
group of workers not covered by centralised collective bargaining.
The unions are happy to accept some aspects of the new flexibility. They are
keen to reduce non-wage labour costs and are not opposed to an expansion in
part-time work, although they do want to improve the social protection of
part-timers.
Mr Schulte stressed the unions' favoured means of job-creation: reducing
working time, with some corresponding reduction in pay without undermining
existing hourly pay rates. 'Ten years ago it would have been unthinkable to
talk in this way', he said. That may be true, but so far only a handful of
companies have followed the lead of Volkswagen, the car group, in cutting
hours and pay to create or retain jobs.
The more insidious threat to the unions' centralised collective agreements
comes from the growing number of companies leaving the industry associations
which enforce them, or are drawing up special deals with their own company
works councils to undermine the national unions.
Mrs Ursula Engelen-Kefer, Mr Schulte's deputy, says the flight from
collective agreements seems to have been stopped by the moderate wage deal
earlier this year. But Mr Charly Schubel, an official of the engineering
union I G Metall in Schweinfurt, says an increasing number of small metal
industry companies in his area are paying skilled workers only DM8 or DM9
(Pounds 3.60) an hour - about half the national rate.
Given the continuing solidity of most German labour market regulations it is
tempting to ask whether the decline of the unions will make much difference.
'It would make a big difference,' says Mrs Engelen-Kefer, 'We are part of
the political and social structure but our arguments are only listened to
because of our strength on the ground'.

that he hoped a Bosnian map would be ready within 10 days. Foreign Staff

A stand-off between the Romanian government and unions appeared to be easing

government offices. Earlier, scuffles broke out when several hundred riot
police attempted to remove about 1,000 demonstrators from central Victory
Square where unions were protesting over low pay and slow reform. Tension
had increased because there were at times more troops than demonstrators,
the Alfa Cartel trade union, organisers of the rally, said.

Economic turbulence has forced Turkey to shift its privatisation efforts
from international share offers to direct equity sales to industry,
according to a senior government official. Economic uncertainty - with a
halving in the lira's value against the US dollar since the start of the
year - would make it difficult to attract institutional buyers, Mr Tezcan
Yaramanci, chairman of the privatisation administration, said. But he
predicted the government would return to the market once the current IMF
programme took effect. Mr Yaramanci confirmed bids would be invited next
week for a 51 per cent stake in the Erdemir steel company. He added that
buyers would be sought for strategic stakes in Petrol Ofisi, the oil
products retail concern, Tupras, the oil refinery company, and for a
minority share in Turk Hava Yollari, the national airline.

<TEXT>
Senior Russian and western economists yesterday warned of economic and
political turmoil in Russia later this year as the country's monetary and
credit policies become 'unsustainable'. A conference at the Stockholm
Institute of East European Economics produced a sobering agreement that
fragile improvements in Russian finances, which have seen a monthly
inflation rate of 6.8 per cent in May, are now in danger. Lack of real
institutional reform and pressing demands from military, industrial and
agricultural lobbies threaten to bring back high inflation and with it a
nationalist resurgence. Figures produced for the conference on the budget,
which is under discussion in the Russian parliament, show that tax income
for the first quarter of the present year is below the target level by more
than 10 per cent of gross national product, while expenditure has also been
slashed by a similar figure. This has meant deep cuts in programmes and long
delays in wage payments, contributing to increasing unrest in the military.

<TEXT>
Germany's Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, yesterday sought to
introduce more competition by scrapping a 1933 law preventing retailers from
reducing prices by more than 3 per cent outside the summer and winter sales.
But its efforts are likely to be defeated when the draft law goes to the
Bundesrat, or upper house. Attempts to retain the law, passionately defended
by small retailers on the grounds that they would be forced out of business,
and even by some large chains because it would mean increased competition,
were defeated by 314 to 262, with 26 abstentions. In theory retailers can
now set their own reductions, which might mean that the German consumer will
be given a choice on prices outside sale periods. But in practice,
yesterday's vote was a pyrrhic victory for Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics
minister, who spearheaded the campaign for a reform of the law, as the
Social Democrat-dominated Bundesrat is likely to reject it.

Banks should 'play along' with money-launderers, in co-operation with
police, to maximise the chances of catching them and seizing their assets,
officials of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said
yesterday. The officials were commenting on the latest annual report by the
OECD's Financial Action Task Force on money laundering, the practice of
legitimising ill-gotten gains from drug-trafficking and other forms of crime
by investing them in legitimate assets or businesses. The FATF's chairman,
Mr John Gieve, a senior UK Treasury official, said some progress had been
made in the past year in the fight against money-laundering. A key
recommendation of the task force is that banks report suspicions, either to
the police or to specialist bodies in some countries, such as the Tracfin
unit in the French Finance Ministry.

Russia's biggest banking lobby yesterday appealed to western banks to
refrain in their 'own interests' from seeking to enter the Russian market.
In an open letter to the international banking community, the Association of
Russian Banks asked western banks for a self-imposed 18-month 'moratorium'
on opening new subsidiaries in Russia. It said this was necessary to give
domestic banks more time to develop, as well as to pre-empt a possible
political backlash against economic reforms.
The association, whose opinions are not shared by all Russian bankers, was
responding to President Boris Yeltsin's decree last Friday which lifted a
retroactive ban on deposit taking from Russian customers by western banks
which had already obtained full Russian banking licences. The decree also
said that in future the Russian central bank would only give licences to
banks from countries which gave equal treatment to Russian banks seeking to
open offices and subsidiaries abroad.
But Citibank and Chase Manhattan of the US, and Turkey's Yapi ve Kredi and
Ziraat, both of which plan joint ventures with Russian banks, will still be
affected by the earlier ban. This is because the decree only lifted the ban
for banks from countries with bilateral treaties encouraging investment ties
with Russia, and the US and Turkish treaties have yet to be ratified by the
Russian parliament. The restrictions - confining western banking
subsidiaries to an 'offshore' status - were imposed in response to
protectionist pressure from Russian banks.

FT  17 JUN 94 / 'Play along' with money laundering, OECD says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks should 'play along' with money-launderers, in co-operation with
police, to maximise the chances of catching them and seizing their assets,
officials of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said
yesterday.
The officials were commenting on the latest annual report by the OECD's
Financial Action Task Force on money laundering. This is the practice of
legitimising ill-gotten gains from drug-trafficking and other forms of crime
by investing them in legitimate assets or businesses, and concealing the
money's origin by shifting it through several institutions.
The FATF's chairman, Mr John Gieve, a senior UK Treasury official, said some
progress had been made in the past year in the fight against
money-laundering.
A key recommendation of the task force is that banks report suspicions,
either to the police or to specialist bodies in some countries, such as the
Tracfin unit in the French Finance Ministry.
'We obviously can't force a financial institution to accept a transaction
that involves suspect money,' said an official of the FATF. 'But law
enforcement authorities now realise the benefits of letting money-launderers
deposit their money and tracking them and it.
'The problem with turning the money away is that this alerts the
money-launderers that they have been detected, and they are capable of
learning from their mistakes.'
At a separate conference organised yesterday by the Paris Criminology
Institute, Mr Andre Levy-Lang, president of the Paribas investment bank said
his bank had co-operated with Tracfin 'in several cases'.
'When we alert Tracfin, they sometimes tell us to accept the money and then
help us run the case,' Mr Levy-Lang said. Banque Nationale de Paris said
that it had recently co-operated with authorities on 'sting' operations.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Brussels shelves pension deregulation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday shelved ambitious proposals to deregulate
the management of pension funds after member states could not agree on how
far national governments should be allowed to dictate the terms of
investment.
EU members could now face Brussels sanctions if domestic rules governing
pension funds are found to break treaty rules on free movement of capital
and services.
The decision to withdraw the proposal was taken at a meeting of EU ministers
in Luxembourg. The directive had aimed to allow the free flow of pension
fund investment across the European Union, together with freedom of
operation for pension fund managers.
Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, single market commissioner, said there was no
point pursuing a directive that neither satisfied the Commission nor
commanded the support of a qualified majority of states.
The three-year deadlock stems from fears that the Commission proposal is too
liberal. Most EU countries argued that they should be able to insist that a
large part of a fund's assets be invested in local currency - the so called
currency matching rules.
Only Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands - which impose few restrictions on
their pension funds and consequently dominate the overseas investment market
 -backed the plan to open up the European market, currently valued at
Ecu1,000bn (Pounds 770bn).
Opponents said they wanted a directive that would only allow 20 per cent of
a pension fund's assets to be invested in foreign currencies. The Commission
insisted on a maximum threshold of 40 per cent, supported somewhat
reluctantly by the British, Dutch and Irish.
Earlier, Mr d'Archirafi urged members to renew efforts to get European
legislation on to statute books. He produced detailed tables of areas with
the most glaring holes.
A proposal aimed at giving the Commission a clearer idea of how often
countries blocked goods on sale in another member state, on the grounds that
they did not meet national standards, made little headway. The French and
Germans argued that the proposed system - requesting authorities to notify
the Commission whenever they rejected goods or services - would be
ineffective.
But Mr Neil Hamilton, UK minister for corporate affairs, said: 'The
Commission needs a crowbar to prise open markets from which our goods are
excluded on spurious grounds of safety, quality and so on. Too often, small
businesses just give up the unequal struggle as complaints procedures are
too legalistic, bureaucratic and time consuming.'
Ministers agreed to re-examine the scope of the proposal. The Commission
hopes it will be adopted at the next internal market council meeting in
October.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Faster French growth forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French economic growth should accelerate in the second quarter of this year
and long-term interest rates, which have risen sharply over recent weeks,
should stabilise, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said
yesterday.
His remarks coincided with a further easing in France's key short-term
intervention rate, which the central bank reduced by one tenth of a
percentage point to 5.2 per cent. The reduction is in line with the bank's
strategy of gradually easing monetary policy to support economic recovery.
Further evidence of an upturn was provided by a rise in gross domestic
product. Insee, the national statistics institute, reported that GDP grew by
0.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1994, compared with the last three
months of 1993.
The Economy Ministry said that the first quarter growth, which followed a
flat final quarter last year, showed the recovery from recession was firmly
under way.
'We expect economic growth to continue to strengthen,' said one economic
official, citing surveys of business sentiment among industrialists.
According to Insee, the GDP rise was achieved despite a decline in energy
consumption, due to mild weather, which is expected to reverse in the second
quarter. Growth was supported, however, by specific stimulatory measures,
such as those aimed at reviving the car market.
Private economists agreed that the French economy has moved into a recovery
phase, but expressed caution about the rate of growth. 'Mr Alphandery's
projection of an acceleration from 0.5 per cent in the first quarter may be
a bit optimistic,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Bros
in London.
The first-quarter figures, he said, were boosted by a sharp reduction in
stocks, which declined by FFr5.4bn in the period, but there was still little
evidence of a substantial pick-up in investment.
Some economist also expressed caution about the rise in long-term interest
rates, which have climbed to about 7 per cent from some 5 per cent at the
beginning of the year.
Mr Alphandery played down the risks to economic growth, however, saying that
inflation remained under control and that interest rates would stabilise.
'I am optimistic', he said, 'I think these movements (in long term interest
rates) will automatically calm down.'

FT  17 JUN 94 / Kohl cautious in welcome for Berlusconi
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday gave Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian
prime minister, a cautious initial welcome to the inner circle of European
heads of government.
On the Italian's first official foreign visit since emerging victorious from
national and European elections, Mr Berlusconi was accorded full military
honours, and promises of continuing close co-operation.
But he apparently failed to persuade the chancellor to back his conservative
Forza Italia movement in a move to join the European People's party - the
Christian Democrat group - in the new European parliament. Instead, he said
his party would form its own independent movement for the time being.
On the other hand, there was no word of criticism about the presence of
members of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) in Mr Berlusconi's
government, and Mr Kohl was anxious to express his desire for continuity in
their close relations.
The two men discussed both the forthcoming summit of the European Union on
Corfu, and the Group of Seven world economic summit in Naples.
They failed to agree on a common candidate to be the next president of the
European Commission, the Italian prime minister indicated later.
The official visit gave Mr Berlusconi his first big opportunity to launch a
public relations defence of his new government before an inter-national
audience, and he roundly denounced any suggestion that 'fascists' were
members of it. 'I cannot allow anyone to make a statement so far removed
from the truth,' he said. There was 'absolutely nothing undemocratic' about
any of his ministers.
Yet it is the presence of those MSI members of the National Alliance in the
government which has clearly caused concern in Mr Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union, as well as the opposition Social Democratic party.
The chancellor insists that the question of Forza Italia joining the
Christian Democrats in the European parliament does not arise, because they
have not applied to do so. There is little secret, however, that a majority
of the party would like to, although a minority favours the alternative
liberal group.
In a joint statement issued after the talks, the two government leaders
pledged their determination to continue the 'traditional close co-operation'
between their governments, and in particular 'intensively' during the coming
German EU presidency.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Rocard seeks to steal a march on his would-be challengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Out of the depths of his Euro-election misery, Mr Michel Rocard has played a
bold card.
He has asked the French Socialist party's national council for a vote of
confidence on Sunday, just when his leadership is under great criticism for
gaining the party only 14.5 per cent of the Euro-vote but before any serious
rival can mobilise against him. Only Mr Jack Lang, former education and
culture minister, has expressed open interest in wresting the party's
leadership and presidential candidacy from him.
But his continued leadership now rests more on sufferance than enthusiasm.
According to a party official cited by Liberation newspaper yesterday, Mr
Rocard's likely role is to continue 'as sexton of the elephants' graveyard'
to give way as herd leader to Mr Jacques Delors when the latter finally
quits the European Commission in December.
The Euro-election result confounded predictions that the fall in the
Socialist party's fortunes had finally bottomed out with its respectable 22
per cent share of the local government election vote in March. It was clear
that the proportional system used for Euro-elections would not favour a
so-called mainstream party like the Socialists; but the governing
conservative coalition was hurt by dissident rival lists in exactly the same
way.
However, traditional in-fighting between the Socialist party's clans to get
on the list of Euro-candidates was compounded by the number of ex-deputies
seeking employment after losing their national seats in 1993 and by the
decision to fill half the slots with women. After this squabbling start, the
campaign got no better, with Mr Rocard seeming to pay more court to the
Paris intellectuals who ran on an 'arms for Bosnia' platform than to youth
and workers whose support was scooped up by Mr Bernard Tapie.
The latter's power base is built on the Mouvement des Radicaux de Gauche
(MRG), which has traditionally followed the Socialists almost blindly. But
buoyed by their 12 per cent in the Euro-poll and 13 seats in Strasbourg, the
MRG threatens to be less obedient than in the past, while negotiations with
it are made problematic for the Socialists by all the business controversies
surrounding Mr Tapie.
Casting, as ever, a shadow over Mr Rocard is the enigmatic President
Francois Mitterrand. The latter has denied any conspiracy to undermine Mr
Rocard by promoting Mr Mr Tapie. But, during the campaign, he praised the
'dynamism' of Mr Tapie, briefly urban affairs minister in one of his
governments. And other close Mitterrand associates loudly criticised Mr
Rocard for his policy shifts on Bosnia.
All this comes against the background of the long and well-documented
antipathy between Mr Mitterrand and Mr Rocard. They have separate political
roots - Mr Rocard once led the separate Parti Socialist Unifie party that
the Socialist party absorbed in 1974 - and different ideological leanings.
Mr Rocard earned Mr Mitterrand's ire for criticising as 'archaic' the
latter's joint programme with the Communists and, then later, the extent of
his nationalisations, though the president eventually gave him three years
as prime minister .
Whenever it really mattered, however, Mr Rocard was loyal to Mr Mitterrand.
Indeed it is the example of the president's achievement in pulling himself
up from poor poll standings to win the Elysee in 1981 that still gives Mr
Rocard some hope for 1995. The difference is that this time the loyalty may
not be reciprocated.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Green light for Sweden-Denmark link: Stockholm environment
minister resigns over Dollars 3bn bridge and tunnel project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's centre-right government yesterday gave a final go-ahead for the
construction of a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) bridge and tunnel link across the
Oresund between Sweden and Denmark, one of the biggest infrastructure
projects in Europe.
But the long-delayed decision prompted the resignation of Mr Olof Johansson,
the environment minister and leader of the Centre party, shaking the
hitherto stable foundations of Prime Minister Carl Bildt's four-party
coalition three months before a general election.
A row over the environmental impact of the 17km road and rail link between
the southern Swedish city of Malmo and Copenhagen had held up the project
for months, threatening to split Mr Bildt's government and straining
relations with Denmark, which is anxious to proceed.
Mr Bildt was confident yesterday he had avoided the break-up of the
government, as Mr Johansson agreed his three party colleagues in the
coalition would stay on as ministers despite their objections to the Oresund
link. But their decision is likely to be questioned at a Centre party
national conference this weekend.
Mr Johansson's resignation was also the first split in the cabinet since the
government took power in late 1991, and is an unwelcome blow for Mr Bildt,
as the coalition is trailing far behind the opposition Social Democratic
party in the polls ahead of the election in mid-September.
But the green light for the link, which will be Sweden's first fixed link to
its main markets in Europe, was warmly welcomed in Copenhagen and by
business leaders in both countries. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish
prime minister, said: 'I am pleased by this decision, which means Denmark
can now go ahead with the land-side construction work which was suspended
while the Swedes arrived at a decision.'
The joint Swedish-Danish consortium set up to build the link said the tender
process would begin within weeks, with the selection of prequalified
companies. A total of 20 international consortia, involving some 50
companies from around the world, have expressed interest in the project.
Full tender details will not be available until late autumn, as
environmental specifications are not yet ready. First contracts for the
tunnel section are expected to be signed early next year.
The project, originally agreed between Stockholm and Copenhagen in 1991, is
already about a year behind schedule because of the Swedish delays.
Estimated at 1990 prices to cost DKr20bn (Pounds 2bn), including all the
mainland construction on both sides, the link is now unlikely to open before
the year 2000.
Together with the Storebaelt link between the Danish islands of Zeeland and
Funen already under construction, the Oresund bridge and tunnel will give
the Copenhagen and Malmo regions swift access to the rest of continental
Europe. Their total population of 2.3m makes them Europe's eighth largest in
terms of purchasing power.
But the Oresund project has faced strong opposition from environmentalists
from the start. Their main concern has been that the bridge section will
impede vital salt water flows into the already heavily-polluted Baltic Sea.
Mr Bildt said yesterday the environmental conditions being set for the
constructors would ensure a 'zero solution' under which salt water flows
would not be reduced. 'This is the greenest bridge you can build,' he said.

A European Commission proposal to crack down on the sale of counterfeit
goods from non-EU countries was approved by ministers in Luxembourg
yesterday. It will increase the power of customs authorities to stop fake
goods entering the EU, writes Emma Tucker.
Under customs procedures introduced in the Union four years ago, a trademark
owner can obtain a temporary 'freeze' on the import of a consignment of
counterfeit goods and can then take legal action. The new proposal will
allow customs authorities themselves to decide whether an application from a
trademark holder is valid. It also extends the scope of the legislation to
cover pirated goods and design rights.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'I am very, very happy to be here,' Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, head of
France's Groupe Schneider electrical engineering group, told a packed
shareholders' meeting yesterday in the Automobile Club in Paris.
Two weeks ago, he was in rather different circumstances - an inmate in
Brussels' Forest prison, facing charges of fraud relating to two Belgian
subsidiaries. Last week, after 12 days in prison, he was released on bail of
FFr2.5m (Pounds 290,000).
However, Mr Valentino Foti, an Italian businessman being investigated on the
same charges, is still held after his appeal yesterday was rejected.
A round of applause greeted Mr Pineau-Valencienne's arrival on stage, and
shareholders expressed support for their chairman. The reception was less
warm for one Belgian minority shareholder, who was booed after his complaint
about a lack of information concerning offshore companies in the group. For
his part, Mr Pineau-Valencienne sought to reassure investors that the group
would not be damaged by the affair and sought to rebuff the Belgian
allegations.
He denied that Schneider had acted against the interests of minority
shareholders in Cofibel and Cofimines, two financial subsidiaries at the
centre of the investigation. He also rejected charges that dividends paid by
offshore companies had not been distributed equally among shareholders in
the subsidiaries and denied that funds totalling BFr3bn (Pounds 580m) had
been diverted from the two companies to the benefit of their parent company.
He said he was appointing an outside auditor with a view to clearing himself
and the group of the charges.
The stock market responded positively. Schneider shares, which have lost 16
per cent of their value since the chairman was detained, bucked the trend in
the depressed Paris bourse and rose 2.3 per cent to close at FFr356.9.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Balsam's big derivative deals revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Balsam, the German sports-flooring manufacturer which has filed for
protection from creditors following the arrest of its entire board on fraud
charges last week, has entered into currency options contracts worth
DM10bn-DM14bn (Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5.6bn), it emerged yesterday.
The sheer scale of transactions dwarfs Balsam's modest turnover of DM460m,
highlighting the risks associated with trading in derivatives at a time of
intense international debate over how such financial instruments should be
regulated. Swaps, options and other more complicated products are known as
derivatives because their value is 'derived' from more conventional assets.
Bankers insisted yesterday that the losses they faced as a result of 'open
positions' with Balsam were limited to a maximum of DM400m, a fraction of
the gross value. But this comes on top of the DM1.60bn banks stand to lose
as a result of the collapse of Balsam and of Procedo, Germany's largest
factoring company, which has emerged as the biggest victim of the alleged
fraud.
The revelations raise the question of whether bankers should have become
suspicious about the volume of derivatives business long before the company
filed for protection.
'Banks have been remiss in assessing the relationship between the volume of
derivatives business undertaken and the real needs of what was a relatively
small company,' commented a banker at the Frankfurt arm of a US institution
yesterday. 'They should have put a stop to it earlier on.'
Separately, Citicorp, the largest foreign bank in Germany, confirmed
yesterday that it stopped conducting options business with Balsam in the
final three months of last year because the company 'no longer fitted our
customer profile'.
The case draws parallels with problems at Metallgesellschaft, one of
Germany's largest companies which came to the brink of bankruptcy earlier
this year after running up Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 933m) of losses in the oil
derivatives business.
But bankers pointed out yesterday that, unlike Metallgesellschaft, Balsam
was in general successful in its trading in derivatives - the state
prosecutor in Bielefeld said last week that the profits from this area of
business had for several years disguised losses in the company's mainstream
sports-flooring activities.
The directors of Balsam are accused of forging documentation to support
applications for factoring agreements with Procedo, under which Procedo
would advance cash to Balsam and assume responsibility for collecting the
outstanding receivables. The cash advanced by Procedo to Balsam was used to
finance the latter's currency options business. It is also alleged that the
value of the receivables was fraudulently inflated.
'The case illustrates how little transparency there is in the case of
over-the counter derivative products (products tailor-made for individual
corporate clients),' said Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist at the
Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt. 'It is a jungle out there.'
The Bundesbank, which is be watching the development of the derivatives
markets in Germany with a critical eye, refused to comment on the case
yesterday. But Balsam's experience is likely to add weight to calls from the
Bundesbank for a new listing of the risk facing banks which enter
derivatives agreements with corporate customers.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Russia joins China to fight sanctions against N Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US proposal to impose phased sanctions against North Korea in an effort to
persuade it to allow international inspection of its nuclear facilities ran
into trouble yesterday when Russia joined China in objecting to the move.
However, tension on the Korean peninsula eased slightly when former US
president Jimmy Carter, visiting Pyongyang in an attempt to find a solution
to the crisis, said North Korea had agreed to allow inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency to remain at its nuclear installation.
Last week North Korea said it was withdrawing from the agency, which
suspects the north of using its reactor to supply a secret weapons
programme.
The resistance to sanctions by Moscow and Beijing, both among the five
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, threatens to
dilute attempts to increase pressure on Pyongyang. However, neither country
said it would veto the sanctions plans outlined by Ms Madeleine Albright, US
ambassador to the UN.
China, a traditional ally of North Korea, had long signalled its wariness of
sanctions. Mr Shen Guofang, foreign ministry spokesman, said: 'China in
principle does not subscribe to the involvement of the Security Council in
the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula or the resort to sanctions to
solve it.'
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, caused consternation when he
made clear his lack of sympathy for Washington's move because it had, he
alleged, not consulted Moscow.
He said: 'I think tabling the draft unilaterally will seriously complicate
for Russia consideration of the document. In any case we will not support a
set of sanctions worked out without our co-operation.'
He said Moscow and Washington had agreed to work out a joint stance this
week.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, Mr Clinton's press secretary, said in Washington Ms
Albright had consulted Russia's UN mission on Wednesday as well as those of
China, Britain and France.
In addition, President Bill Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin on Monday
'discussed what was going to be in' the US draft resolution, Ms Myers added.
The 'carefully calibrated' measures outlined by Ms Albright - not yet
available in detail yesterday - would start with a reduction of diplomatic
and other links, along with an arms embargo. Financial sanctions would come
later if Pyongyang had still not restored full co-operation with the IAEA.
After meeting Mr Kim Il-Sung, North Korea's 82-year-old leader, Mr Carter
told CNN: 'President Kim has committed himself to maintain the inspectors on
site.'

FT  17 JUN 94 / Germany's economy heads out of recession: Bundesbank report
praises Bonn finance policy but warns on borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government's finance policy is on the right path and there are
increasing signs that the recession is over, a confident Bundesbank reported
yesterday.
The bank's rare praise for Bonn's policies was accompanied, however, by
strict instructions to reduce spending and borrowing. 'The growth rate in
public spending should be kept substantially below the nominal rate of
growth in gross national product for an extended period,' it said.
The warning came as the Bundesbank acknowledged that the economy had moved
out of recession. 'The recessionary tendencies in the west German economy
appear to have been overcome,' it says in its monthly report, adding a
strong hint that further interest rate cuts are unlikely in the short term.
The comments helped the D-Mark to rise against the US dollar, Japanese yen
and British pound yesterday.
Further evidence of German economic recovery came from Mr Karl Heinrich
Oppenlander, president of the Munich-based Ifo economics institute. At his
institute's annual meeting yesterday, he said the west German economy had
finally turned the corner, and growth was was accelerating in the east. He
said the institute now expected pan-German growth this year to be 1.5-2 per
cent, and higher in 1995.
In a review of recent developments, the Bundesbank report says state
borrowing is still driving M3 growth, while growth in consumer credit has
slowed to an annual rate of 5 per cent. Significantly, though, lending to
companies is lower, but borrowing by manufacturing industry has increased
for the first time for a year.
Capacity utilisation has also risen, further supporting the view that the
recession has been overcome. The Bundesbank report, repeating a recent
statement by its president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, noted that the 'rather
strong' cut in the discount rate in mid May (a 0.5 point reduction to 4.5
per cent) has cleared the interest rate horizon for some time.
The bank now has to wait to see how investors react to the new interest rate
environment. Fears about the course of long-term European rates have been
blamed for the recent turbulence in international bond markets.
The Bundesbank also said that economic growth and rising tax revenues next
year might help to cut the public-sector deficit by up to DM60bn (Pounds
24bn) - equivalent to 2 per cent of gross domestic product.
For this year, the deficit is expected to be unchanged from 1993, a result
only a little above the key Maastricht economic convergence criterion.
The government was reminded that its aim should be to reduce
'extraordinarily high' taxes and welfare contributions, which will equal 45
per cent of GDP in 1995. The so-called solidarity tax surcharge, to be
reintroduced next year, will yield an estimated DM26bn.
In spite of the stick-and-carrot tone, the bank was markedly more optimistic
than in the past year on most fiscal, economic and financial prospects,
except for short-term interest rates. Its rate policy is in a 'particularly
strained' situation, the report says.
According to the bank, it is important that funds now parked in short-term
instruments, which is seen as distorting money supply data, should be
invested in long-term deposits, outside the scope of the M3 supply measure,
which is the bank's main indicator of potential inflation.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Bonn to impose levies on all motorway trucks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN, RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German parliament yesterday voted to impose levies on all domestic and
foreign trucks using the country's motorways from next year, although
domestic hauliers will be partially compensated by a cut in vehicle
registration fees.
The decision, which follows a decade of debate over whether charges aimed at
foreign truckers are discriminatory, comes as several other European
governments are also planning to introduce levies to contribute to the
upkeep of road networks.
In Germany, only 10 of the 600 parliamentary deputies voted against the bill
in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, which proposes an annual
DM1,500 (Pounds 600) charge for a three-axle truck and a DM2,500 charge for
four and five-axle trucks.
The UK Road Haulage Association said the introduction of the motorway
charges would create 'yet another expense for the British haulier'. The
Netherlands is also aiming to introduce truck levies from January 1,
although the necessary legislation has yet to pass through the Dutch
parliament.
Mr Matthias Wissman, the German transport minister, said the levies would
raise around DM609m (Pounds 243m) a year, excluding the costs of managing
the system, estimated at DM91m. The German upper house has yet to vote on
the proposal, but its passage is taken for granted by the government.
Germany is the destination for 23 per cent of international journeys by UK
hauliers but it is crossed by many trucks en route to other destinations.
The UK Freight Transport Association had argued for a clearing house system
between European governments to reimburse countries whose roads suffered
wear by foreign based hauliers.
Dutch road hauliers, who handle around 25 per cent of all cross-border road
freight shipments in Europe, are expected to seek compensation for the extra
costs. One possibility is a reduction in vehicle tax, in line with Germany's
policy for its road haulage companies.
Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark also intend to introduce charges in their
countries from January 1.
Germany's original plan was to charge only foreign trucks for the use of
German motorways while exempting domestic hauliers, though this was blocked
by European authorities on the legal grounds that it was discriminatory.
Mr Wissman said the tolls would put Germany on a level with other countries.

FT  17 JUN 94 / Blair wins strong backbench support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's leading moderniser, was yesterday nominated by 154
of the 269 MPs entitled to vote in the party's leadership contest, giving
him an overwhelming lead in the race to succeed the late John Smith.
The strong support among MPs for Mr Blair guarantees him 15.5 per cent of
the votes in the party's leadership electoral college, and puts him well on
the way to victory in the contest against Mrs Margaret Beckett and Mr John
Prescott.
However, last night the leftwing leadership of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, the biggest union affiliated to Labour, decided by a
substantial majority to recommend Mrs Beckett for the leadership.
The decision, made after all three contenders addressed a meeting organised
by the union, raised the prospect of a much closer battle for the votes of
4.3m union supporters.
Mr Blair was backed by 13 of the 19 elected members of the shadow cabinet,
including Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade
and industry secretary, and Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary.
Mr Prescott, the traditionalist employment spokesman, was nominated by 46
MPs, including three shadow ministers. Mrs Beckett, the interim leader, won
42 nominations, but no shadow cabinet support. Mr Denzil Davies, a former
Treasury minister running on a platform opposing European economic
integration, drops out of the race after winning only seven nominations - 27
fewer than the threshold required to contest the election.
Mrs Beckett won 106 nominations for the deputy leadership and Mr Prescott
101, suggesting that both will have to campaign intensively during the four
weeks before voting ends on July 21. Both Mr Prescott and Mrs Beckett
appeared to have had difficulty in crossing the threshold of 34 nominations
required to contest the leadership.
Mr Straw dismissed claims that Mr Blair's preference for the deputy
leadership had been signalled by Mr Brown, a close ally, who nominated Mrs
Beckett.
Neither Mr Blair nor Mr Straw nominated a candidate for deputy, in an effort
to maintain friendly relations with both candidates. Other friends of Mr
Blair nominated Mr Prescott. The shadow employment spokesman said he was
'delighted' to have crossed the nominations threshold.
Mrs Beckett said the nominations process had ensured 'a real choice' for the
party.
In the debate organised by the TGWU, Mr Blair indicated his growing
self-confidence by rejecting the idea that all union legislation passed by
the Tories since 1979 should be scrapped by a future Labour government. 'I
don't believe it would be sensible to say we would repeal all the Tory trade
union legislation,' he said. 'We want a positive framework of law. It allows
us to go forward, not back.'
But Mrs Beckett and Mr Prescott both pledged to work for the repeal of large
sections of the Tory legislation.
Earlier, the executive of the GMB general union decided not to nominate or
recommend any of the candidates for the Labour party leadership.

FT  17 JUN 94 / R&amp;D spending in UK rises faster than competitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies' spending on research and development is growing faster than
that of their main international competitors and, for the first time in at
least four years, faster than dividend payments to shareholders.
UK R&amp;D spending rose 9 per cent to Pounds 7.1bn, according to the Department
of Trade and Industry's R&amp;D scoreboard, published today. However, it also
shows that the UK has a long way to go before it catches other countries in
terms of R&amp;D spending as a proportion of sales, profits or dividends.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the figures were
'very encouraging' although 'there is still some way to go to catch up with
the world's best standards'.
The scorecard measures R&amp;D spending anywhere in the world by companies based
in the UK.
The international top 200 companies devoted an average 4.85 per cent of 1993
sales to R&amp;D, compared with 2.29 per cent for the 13 British companies in
the group.
But the rise in the total R&amp;D spend last year of the top 200 international
companies was just 2 per cent, less than one quarter of the increase of the
top 100 in the UK.
General Motors of the US was the world's biggest R&amp;D spender with a budget
of more than Dollars 4bn. (Pounds 2.60bn) It is followed by German
engineering group Daimler-Benz, Ford Motor of the US and Japan's Hitachi.
Those three nations dominate the world's top 20, which contains just one
representative each from France and the Netherlands, as well as the
Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri. The biggest UK spender, drug company Glaxo,
is ranked 42nd.
However, the UK's pharmaceuticals industry stands out as central to the
country's R&amp;D effort. Four of the top six UK spenders on R&amp;D are drugs
companies - Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham, Zeneca and Wellcome. The
pharmaceutical sector carries out 31.8 per cent of all industrial R&amp;D in
Britain.
Among the top 200 international companies, the sector accounts for only 8.8
per cent of all R&amp;D spending.
The UK performance in other areas is mixed. Engineering companies spent 10
per cent more than in 1992, led by Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace.
But electronic and electrical companies' spending on R&amp;D fell by 1 per cent.
Cuts by the sector's two biggest companies, GEC (down 5 per cent) and Racal
(down 8 per cent), outweighed increases elsewhere.
And spending by oil companies fell by 5 per cent. BP cut its budget by one
quarter.
Mr Heseltine refused to criticise particular companies for spending too
little. 'I would not seek to put my judgment as a politician into the minds
of individual boards of directors.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: US authorities clear BT and MCI alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US regulatory authorities yesterday cleared the Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds
3.53bn) alliance between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second
largest long-distance carrier, after a year-long investigation.
The two companies immediately launched their Washington-based joint venture,
named Concert, which aims to take a leading stake in the market for
'one-stop' telecoms services for multinational companies.
The launch of Concert came the day after the announcement of a Dollars 4.2bn
alliance between Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance carrier, and the
state telecoms companies of France and Germany.
The Sprint-Franco-German alliance faces a significant regulatory barrier in
the US, where AT&amp;T, the largest operator, will oppose it strenuously.
AT&amp;T last year launched itself into the market for multinationals with its
Worldsource venture. AT&amp;T has secured partners in the Asia-Pacific region,
but has yet to forge a European alliance. It is in talks with Unisource, a
joint venture between the state operators of Switzer-land, Sweden and the
Netherlands.
Mr Michael Hepher, BT managing director, said Concert had gained a
'significant head start' over its rivals. 'We are looking to build up large
revenues while we have a clear run.'
Conditions imposed by the US Department of Justice will oblige BT to publish
the terms on which it sells its services to Concert, to prevent
cross-subsidies. It is also prohibited from engaging in international simple
re-sale - a form of competition using leased lines - until AT&amp;T's
application for a UK licence is approved by the UK government.
Mr Hepher said that Concert would be the first company able to provide a
'broad range of single-source telecoms services to multinationals across the
world'. In addition to 'one-stop' international private voice networks,
Concert is offering data telecoms, messaging, electronic data interchange
and video conferencing services.
The alliance between BT and MCI gives MCI prime responsibility for marketing
services in the US, and BT responsibility for the rest of the world.
However, the companies have pledged to respect existing agreements with
other international operators.
BT said it expected to pay most of the Dollars 4.3bn agreed for a 20 per
cent stake in MCI later this year.
Its gearing will rise sharply if it is unable to sell its 17 per cent stake
 -worth about Dollars 2bn - in McCaw Cellular, whose sale to AT&amp;T has been
held up by US regulators. But at end-March, BT's gearing stood at only 9 per
cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's industrial output fell in April more sharply than previously
reported, according to figures published by the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry yesterday. Output dropped by 1.9 per cent, against last
month's estimate of a 1.4 per cent fall.
Monthly figures have been subject to erratic fluctuations in the past year,
and the more reliable three-month-on-three-month trend shows industrial
output rising from its trough at the end of last year. In the three months
to April, output was 1.9 per cent higher than in the previous three months.
That sharp rise in industrial production since the start of the year will be
reflected in the figures for gross domestic product for the first quarter of
1994, expected to be published next week. Yesterday, officials at the
government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) hinted that the statistics were
likely to show the country's total output of goods and services rose in the
first quarter of the year by between 0.5 and 1 per cent, an annualised rate
of 2-3 per cent.
The EPA has been markedly more bearish about the economy than other
government institutions recently. But, according to officials at the EPA,
the publication of the GDP figures will be accompanied by a more upbeat
assessment of the country's economic prospects.
Independent economists are likely to be more cautious. The country has
experienced strong growth in the first quarter of each of the past three
years, only to see output fall back again later in the year.

<TEXT>
Fisker &amp; Nielsen, a subsidiary of NKT Holding, the electro-technical and
engineering group listed in Copenhagen, is to acquire Advanced Machine
Company of Minnesota, one of its main US rivals, for DKr650m (Dollars 100m).
The purchase will make the Danish company the world's largest manufacturer
of vacuum clearers, carpet cleaners and floor treatment machinery for
professional use.
The new company, which will take the name Nilfisk, after the brand name of
Fisker &amp; Nielsen's cleaners, will form a group with a turnover of about
DKr2bn and about 2,500 employees.
Fisker &amp; Nielsen is market leader in Europe for industrial and institutional
vacuum cleaners. Advance claims second place in the US market.
Advance will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fisker &amp; Nielsen. Through
an exchange of shares, the deal will give Advance's 11 private shareholders
a 16 per cent stake in Fisker &amp; Nielsen, and an option to acquire another
7.5 per cent. The remaining shares will be held by NKT.
A stock exchange listing for the new group within three to five years will
be considered, said NKT.
Fisker &amp; Nielsen made a pre-tax profit of DKr94m on turnover of DKr1.14bn in
1993. Advance made a pre-tax loss of DKr45m on sales of DKr610m.
As a consequence of bringing in new shareholders, Fisker &amp; Nielsen will make
an extraordinary dividend payment of DKr700m to NKT, the group said.

Movenpick, the Swiss restaurants and hotels group, is restoring its
dividends as its recovery from a loss and management crisis in 1991
continues to gather pace.
Mr Ulrich Geissmann, chief executive, said sales had fallen 3.6 per cent in
the first five months of the year, but profits continued to recover due to
cost cutting.
Mr Geissmann said that in the full year 'a further considerable rise' in net
income could be expected from last year's 32 per cent rise to SFr8.6m
(Dollars 6.05m). The directors were recommending dividends of 8 per cent on
the shares and participation certificates. Dividends were last paid in
respect of 1990.
Rosenbauer International, the Austrian family-owned maker of fire-fighting
vehicles for many of the world's airports, is planning an initial public
offering of new shares in September.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Meridien Hotels decision faces
delay beyond board meeting
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A decision on the Meridien Hotels chain, owned by Air France and courted by
Forte, the UK hotels group, and Accor, the French travel group, is likely to
be delayed beyond today's board meeting of the French state-owned airline,
officials indicated yesterday.
A June 30 deadline has been set for the bidding process, but the sensitivity
of the sale has resulted in a series of delays.
A decision was first expected on April 28, but the rival bids were referred
instead to France's privatisation commission, an independent body which
advises the French gov ernment.
Today's board meeting had been set as another date for the announcement of
the decision. But sources close to the sale said that no decision has yet
been reached on the two bids.
Forte's is the higher bid, valuing the Meridien chain at FFr1.8bn (Dollars
305m) compared with FFr1.6bn offered by Accor and its partner, Prince
Al-Waleed Bin Talal of Saudi Arabia. Meridien management has said it prefers
the Forte offer, but political pressure has been brought to bear to keep the
luxury hotels chain under French control.
Air France, which suffered losses of FFr8.48bn last year, needs to raise as
much cash as possible to reduce its debts.
The European Commission, which is examining a FFr20bn capital injection for
the ailing airline, will pay close attention to the financial terms of the
deal.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Prices of food rise sharply in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese consumers have been rocked by a series of steep price increases for
staple foods such as grain, prompting widespread grumbling at a time of
worker and peasant unrest.
The authorities last week increased the price of premium quality flour by 37
per cent and rice by nearly 17 per cent. This comes on top of steep price
rises for most basic commodities in the past 12 months.
A Beijing municipal official confirmed yesterday the price rises had come
into force on June 10, but he said the Chinese media had been instructed not
to report details to avoid inflaming opinion.
The price increase coincides with simmering unhappiness over price increases
in urban and rural areas. Agitation among industrial workers has become
commonplace. Cost of living increases are running at more than 20 per cent
in China's cities.
China's press, warning of the dangers to the economy of spiralling price
increases, has demanded action. The official Business Weekly said at the
weekend the 'side-effects of the pricing reform and the rocketing cost of
production materials have combined to form the Achilles heel of the
economy.'
In March, China reintroduced price controls on 20 items, including services
and food. It authorised local governments to implement measures to ease the
inflationary burden on consumers.
Business Weekly reported that some local authorities have begun subsidising
grain shops and restricting consumers' purchases by once again issuing
ration coupons.
The government's bold gesture in raising prices, partly in order to improve
payments to farmers whose commitment to producing grain had been lagging,
risks fuelling unrest in the cities where unemployment rates are climbing.
A State Statistical Bureau survey warned the lifting last year of price
controls on grain and other consumer products had 'created imponderable
effects on the economy that are now being felt.'
'Analysts do not expect the inflationary pressures to abate because of the
persistent adverse factors that took place in 1993,' the paper said.
The State Statistical Bureau yesterday forecast reduced economic growth this
year to between 9 and 10 per cent compared with 13 per cent in 1993. It
reported that growth slowed to about 12 per cent in the first half of this
year. This would 'make it easier' to achieve the targeted growth rate of
9-10 per cent.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Futures exchanges face clampdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday clamped down on the country's futures exchanges as part of
continuing efforts to toughen regulation of chaotic financial markets. The
Securities Commission, a regulatory arm of the State Council, China's
cabinet, is expected to limit severely the number of exchanges after
reviewing their licences.
Some 40 futures exchanges dealing in commodities and currencies had
mushroommed in China's cities since last year and were in effect operating
beyond the control of the hard-pressed regulatory authorities in Beijing.
The People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, reported at the weekend
that speculation on international futures markets through local brokerages
had led to huge foreign exchange losses.
The China Securities News published State Council directives calling for a
'strict halt to the blind development of the futures markets'. These
directives placed a ban on dealing on overseas markets and also required
that existing positions be unwound.
In an editorial, the Securities News said hundreds of millions of dollars
had flowed out of China through futures trading.
Many of China's so-called futures markets will, after the Securities
Commission review of their activities, be designated wholesale markets and
stopped from futures dealing.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Iata presses Russia on air safety: Aviation body calls for
tighter procedures in airline licensing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The International Air Transport Association (Iata) is urging Russia to
enforce more stringent licensing procedures for new airlines and improve
flight safety standards in the face of an alarming increase in the country's
air accident rate.
Iata is also worried by flight safety standards in the rapidly growing
Chinese market.
Mr Pierre Jeanniot, Iata's director-general, yesterday said he had written
to the Russian authorities recommending them to be 'more cautious' in
granting licences for airlines being established following the break-up of
Aeroflot.
Iata officials said civil aviation figures from the former Soviet Union
showed 'a considerable decrease' in safety last year and so far this year.
Although the volume of air traffic has been falling because of high fares
and poor service standards, the number of deaths caused by air accidents
increased last year to 348 people compared with 250 in 1992.
This year, the figure is likely to be even worse following the Aeroflot
Airbus A310 crash and another fatal accident involving a Russian-built
Tupolev Tu-154 airliner.
But on China, Mr Jeanniot said he was encouraged by the Beijing government's
decision to limit the number of new licences it is issuing for new domestic
airline operations. 'China realised they were getting a bit thin to ensure
safety standards and decided to curb growth a little to ensure better
safety,' he said.
He suggested Russia should adopt such a policy at a time when applications
to start airlines continued to flood in. Since the split-up of Aeroflot,
there have been requests for licences to establish more than 300 airlines in
the former Soviet Union.
Iata senior officials will also be visiting China next week to discuss how
the organisation, grouping more than 220 airlines, could assist in improving
and modernising China's air transport industry.
The crash in China last month of a Russian-built aircraft killing 160
passengers, has highlighted safety problems facing Chinese civil aviation,
which is suffering a severe lack of infrastructure at a time when the market
is growing by around 20 to 30 per cent a year.
'The growth of aviation in China is spectacular but they have to learn to
cope with that growth,' Mr Jeanniot said.
It is understood the UK Foreign Office may warn travellers to avoid if
possible using internal Chinese flights. It has issued a similar warning to
avoid domestic flights in Russia. The US Air Transport Users' Asociation has
warned travellers not to use domestic carriers in Russia.

FT  16 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Thames weak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, CLARE GASCOIGNE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A further raft of provisions moves by Thames Water sent analysts scurrying
to downgrade the utility company yesterday, amid fears of worse to come. The
shares slid 10 1/2 to 470p with a hefty 3.6m traded.
Thames said it was taking a further Pounds 11.5m charge with its final
results for its non-core businesses, adding to the adjusted Pounds 23.5m
taken at the interims. The charges helped to push international operations
and process contracting into an operating loss of Pounds 43m, against a
profit of Pounds 1.4m, although Thames said it was hoping to break even on
its non-regulated businesses this year.
The losses meant the rise in Thames' dividend was lower than expected at a
disappointing 7 per cent. Mr Kevin Lapwood at Smith New Court said: 'Thames,
which is supposed to be the flagship of the sector, is now on one of the
lowest ratings. And the potential for more skeletons to come out of the
cupboard on the non-regulatory businesses is huge. The shares have more
downside.'
Recent comment from banks that bad debts were falling faster than
anticipated prompted a reconsideration of selected banking stocks from two
leading broking houses.
Hoare Govett upgraded its current year profits forecasts for Barclays from
Pounds 1.4bn to Pounds 1.6bn, largely on the back of the improved position
on bad debts. With property values stabilising, there would no longer be the
need to increase bad debt provisions. Barclays closed 10 up at 560p.
Mr Mark Eady at NatWest Securities, which recently lifted his profits
forecasts for National Westminster from Pounds 1.33bn to Pounds 1.465bn,
said the strength was not in the sector as a whole, but in particular
stocks. Lloyds, for example, lost 6 to 560p on fears about its proposed
Pounds 1.8bn acquisition of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, while
Abbey National was also weak in sympathy, slipping 3 to 427p. NatWest added
10 at 474p and HSBC bounced 14 to 715p.
The regional electricity companies fell sharply after the British Gas story
broke, amid fears of a tougher regulatory environment. However, dealers said
the falls were more likely to have been caused by the sector's recent strong
performance and investors looking to take profits. Among the fallers, East
Midland dropped 20 to 579p, Northern 18 to 670p and Manweb 20 to 690p.
Figures in line with expectations from London were little protection against
the bearish mood and the shares tumbled 16 to 571p.
News that BT's alliance with MCI had been approved by the US authorities
came late in the session and had little effect on the shares. They ended a
half-penny firmer at 372p.
The dubious honour of the day's worst performer among FT-SE 100 constituents
was claimed by freight group NFC, which reported interim figures below
market expectations. The shares plunged 21 to 198p in heavy trade of 6.1m.
Worries that investors may not take up a large part of Eurotunnel's recent
rights issue continued to hurt the shares and they closed 11 down at 317p.
Bid speculation for Gestetner continued to boost the shares and they gained
another 7 to 175p. Inchcape, 4 lighter at 464p, which has a stake in the
office equipment group, is still thought to be the most likely predator.
Regional brewer Marston Thompson and Evershed was steady at 270p after
announcing results in line with expectations. NatWest Securities,
reiterating its positive stance, raised its 1994-95 profits forecast by 4
per cent to Pounds 26.1m.
Premier league football club Tottenham Hotspur tumbled 17 to 63p at the
opening of trading on news of the heavy fines imposed by the Football
Association. However, the shares rallied to close unchanged as the club
announced that it was considering an appeal and pursuing legal action
against former directors.

FT  16 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: British Gas hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, CLARE GASCOIGNE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in British Gas tumbled 17 to 272p as volume soared to 27m, making the
stock the day's most active issue, after the chief executive warned that
tough new proposals from industry watchdog Ofgas could hit profits and force
the company to peg its dividend next year. British Gas also suggested that
the new proposals could force cuts in its investment programme.
The report from Ofgas was 'a little tougher' than many market watchers had
anticipated, but it was the strong negative reaction to the report from
British Gas that took the market by surprise and brought the setback in the
share price.
Analysts swiftly downgraded current year dividend forecasts, with the
consensus moving from 15p to 14.5p. Strauss Turnbull, one of many to reduce
its dividend forecast, maintained its bottom of the range current year
profits estimate at Pounds 885m, but shaved the following year's figure by
Pounds 85m to Pounds 900m.
Mr John Toalster at the broker said: 'The best prospect for the dividend is
that it will be frozen at 1993 levels for the next two years, and a
reduction of a third to 10p cannot be ruled out.'
Another analyst seeking to explain the stock's retreat said simply: 'The
share price reaction is about politics rather than fundamentals. I would
have been surprised if British Gas reacted any other way.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hopes of change at Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, CLARE GASCOIGNE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The retirement announcement from Glaxo chairman Sir Paul Girolami brought a
flurry of excitement to pharmaceutical stocks, with speculation that his
departure meant the company was about to announce a major acquisition,
following the path taken by SmithKline Beecham with its recent Dollars 2.3bn
purchase of pharmacy benefit manager DPS.
Sir Paul's retirement was described as 'the end of an era' by Mr James
Culverwell at Hoare Govett, who added that Sir Paul epitomised an older
style of drugs company, which concentrated on organic rather than
acquisition-led growth.
However, Mr Culverwell was sceptical about the probability of an early
purchase. 'Glaxo's route is more likely to be with alliances and
relationships with other drug companies, particularly in therapeutic areas,'
he said. Glaxo closed 22 higher at 585p following heavy turnover of 11m.
Other drugs companies were equally strong on the back of US buying, with
Wellcome adding 24 at 618p, Zeneca climbing 19 to 727p and SmithKline
Beecham rising 13 1/2 to 419 1/2 p.

FT  16 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Earnings data spur further advance in
shares - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Favourable news on domestic wage levels encouraged the UK stock market
yesterday to retest the top of its latest trading range as both shares and
bonds extended the gains of the previous session. Trading volume, and market
attendance, was curbed by the effects of the national rail strike in the UK,
and shares slipped back from their best levels as business died away towards
the end of the day.
The FT-SE 100 Index edged above 3,050 in early trading as government bonds
led the market's firm response to the announcement that UK average earnings
growth had slipped to 3.75 per cent in April, while inflation, as measured
by the retail price index, had remained steady. By the close the gain on the
FT-SE 100 had been cut to a net 6.2 for a final reading of 3,045.8.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, still suffering from the aftermath of expiries of
over-the-counter contracts, fell a further 19 points to 3,559.7, the second
successive underperformance against the Footsie.
The stock market was restrained by adverse developments in the utility
sectors, which have been the mainstays of the big investment funds during
the period of bond market weakness.
British Gas fell heavily after the chief executive responded negatively to
the Ofgas ruling on gas pricing. He warned that the ruling could force
British Gas to 'peg' its dividend next year, a prospect which hit the shares
and also other utility stocks which have been sought out for their dividend
paying capacity. The sector took fresh pressure when Thames Water disclosed
that it was making new provisions against some recent acquisitions.
However, these adverse pressures on market indices were counter-balanced by
strength in Glaxo shares as news of the impending retirement of the chairman
brought suggestions that Glaxo might now follow some of its European rivals
in seeking a major acquisition in the US.
After its prolonged period of watching the European bond markets, London
refocused yesterday on the host of domestic economic data, and on prospects
for tonight's speech in the City of London by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK
chancellor of the exchequer. Little heed was paid to the modest reduction in
money market repo rates in Germany, or to the dull response from European
bond markets.
Although equity trading picked up following announcement of the average
earnings data, the final total of Seaq reported business, at 562.8m shares,
compared with 709.8m registered on Tuesday.
Some City professionals had arranged to work from home because of the
national rail strike, and many others left their offices early yesterday
afternoon. On Tuesday, retail business in equities jumped to a healthy
Pounds 1.56bn.
Strategists commented that the City's fears of renewed inflation pressures
have to some extent been calmed this week by the flow of economic data on
both sides of the Atlantic. The expectedly poor showing of the UK
Conservative party candidates in both national by-elections and the
elections for the European parliament has fed hopes that the British
government may cut taxes in order to restore its standing with voters.
At the same time, the sudden wave of nervousness over Federal Reserve
policies was also seen to subside a little following favourable news this
week on US retail sales and consumer prices.

FT  16 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures closed below the day's best after dealers focused on the
poor shape of early trading on Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index ended at 3,042, up 3 from its
previous finish but at a 3-point discount to cash.
Earlier, a tentative start to trading at 3,032 was quickly followed by a
bout of selling from independent, or local, traders, which saw June fall to
3,025, the low of the day.
However, favourable UK average earnings data boosted UK gilts and helped to
bring about a recovery in June, and dealers reported the return of some of
the very big institutions to the market which had remained on the sidelines
in the previous two sessions of the week.
June continued in positive territory over the next few hours, reaching a
high of 3,050 before it was undermined by the poor opening in New York.
Total volume at the close stood at 17,906, with 6,977 lots traded in the
September contract as 'roll over' activity continued ahead of tomorrow's
expiry.
In traded options, which will also see the expiry of the index options,
turnover rose to 33,182 contracts, of which 13,692 was in the FT-SE 100
option and 4,584 in the Euro FT-SE option. Glaxo, also busy in the equities,
was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,438 lots dealt.

FT  16 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slides in reaction to
surge in oil futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks lurched downwards yesterday afternoon after crude oil
futures surged to their highest level of the year, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.42 off at 3,790.41, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 1.76 to 460.61. New York SE volume amounted to
270m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite eased 0.38
to 442.27 and the Nasdaq composite edged 0.14 lower to 735.84.
The afternoon sell-off was triggered by a chain reaction in the financial
markets. Spot crude futures jumped during the afternoon amid growing concern
over the North Korean crisis. In turn, bonds went into a tailspin and share
prices soon followed.
As the session opened, investors were inclined to extend the previous
session's 32-point Dow rally. The day's economic news presented no obvious
obstacles to that ambition - the Federal Reserve reported that industrial
production last month had risen 0.2 per cent, while capacity utilisation
dipped to 83.5 per cent, from 83.6 per cent in April.
The figures, although a shade stronger than economists had forecast, were
consistent with the view that the economy had returned to moderate,
non-inflationary growth.
Still, stocks were moderately down by the afternoon, as profit-takers came
to the fore. Later, when the oil market soured, the blue chips retreated by
about 30 points before recovering somewhat by the close.
Cyclical issues, which led the previous session's advance, dragged the index
down yesterday. Alcoa retreated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 74 1/2 and United
Technologies lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 66 1/2 .
Exxon remained one of the weakest components. The stock, hard hit by an
unfavourable court ruling on the Exxon Valdez oil spill, shed a further
Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 57, a new 52-week low.
In the beverage industry, the misgivings among investors which hurt PepsiCo
and Coca-Cola last week finally caught up with Cott, the aggressive
Canadian-based bottler. Its share price plunged Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 14
1/2 on a downgrading by Lehman Brothers, which said escalating competitive
pressures could backfire on the company. Meanwhile, PepsiCo added Dollars
3/8 at Dollars 32 1/8 and Coca-Cola held steady at Dollars 39 7/8 .
Scott Paper advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 52 7/8 the day after a company
briefing that was described by analysts as 'upbeat and positive'. The issue
gained extra support from reports that its chairman had boosted his stake in
the company.
Geon, a leading producer of vinyl resins, climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars
28 1/4 in unusually active trading of 1.3m shares. The upturn reflected an
improving pricing environment for the company's products.
International Game Technology was marked down Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 19
3/8 after it warned that its 1994 earnings would come at the low end of
forecasts.
Fruit of the Loom, an apparel maker, fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 26 3/4 . The
company advised analysts to 'take a more conservative approach' in
estimating its second-quarter earnings.
Canada
Toronto stocks continued to weaken, closing lower on political uncertainty
over Quebec amid predictions that the market will soon test thresholds.
An analyst said there is downward pressure on bonds, upward pressure on
yields, and we still have a long horizon before the situation is resolved.
The TSE 300 composite index fell 32.3 to 4,166.3 and declines outpaced
advances by 482 to 264 after volume of 55m shares valued at CDollars 699m.
All but two of the 14 stock groups ended in negative territory, with banking
posting the largest decline of 1.90 per cent. Consumer products and
industrial products fell 1.42 and 1.26 per cent respectively. Mining was off
moderately, energy issues were flat, and golds gained 1.30 per cent.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo slipped from early highs to end 1.74 per cent up after
lacklustre trade, and dealers predicted more of the same tomorrow in the
absence of hard news to give the market direction. The Bovespa index gained
525 at 30,698 in volume of Cr347bn.

FT  16 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Industrial sector is highlight in
Johannesburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial shares provided one of the main features of the day in a thinly
traded session, the index climbing 33 to 6,757. The overall index receded 16
to 5,746 and the golds index shed 31 to 2,090.
De Beers retreated R2.25 to R116, while Anglos lost R6 at R241. Gencor eased
30 cents to R11.70 and, in golds, Kloof declined R1.25 to R64.50. Argus
Newspapers saw its first trade since its listing on Monday and jumped R4 to
R15.
The Johannesburg stock exchange, which faces a threat from the Merchant
Bankers Association to form a rival exchange in South Africa, said yesterday
that it had embarked on proposals for a so-called 'evolutionary' change in
its practices. Critics of this approach had called for full deregulation.

FT  16 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: Venezuela
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela's banking crisis reached a new level on Tuesday as the government
closed eight financial institutions which it had been supporting since the
beginning of the year. The equity market reacted immediately with a 3 per
cent fall, but regained most of the ground yesterday, rising 2 per cent.
Analysts commented that the news was actually positive since it showed that
the Caldera administration was now determined to tackle the country's
economic problems with resolution.
Ms Janet Krengel of Kleinwort Benson Securities in London noted that
emergency aid to the banks, which had been crippled by the collapse of Banco
Latino in January, had cost Dollars 3bn. Taken together with a pledge by the
finance minister to raise domestic fuel prices, the new policies signalled
that the government had been forced by events to seriously address
Venezuela's economic difficulties.
'The seizure by regulators of the eight languishing banks is but a sign of
things to come,' Ms Krengel said. 'Investors should expect a series of
potentially destab-ilising arrests of prominent members of the financial
sector and judiciary in what promises to be a rocky road to recovery.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei easier in mixed
regional sentiment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lacking support from overseas investors, the Nikkei 225 average closed
marginally lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost 71.01 at 21,282.96 after a day's high of 21,496.60 in the
morning and a low of 21,234.65 just before the close. Bargain hunting in the
morning session from domestic institutions lifted prices, but a fall in the
futures market in the afternoon prompted index-linked selling.
Volume remained flat at 470m shares. The Topix index of all first section
stocks dipped 4.53 to 1,698.27 and the Nikkei 300 eased 1.16 to 308.50, but
rises led falls by 527 to 476, with 179 issues unchanged. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.71 at 1,396.02.
Large-capital steels and shipbuilders lost ground on profit-taking. The
high-liquidity shares had led the market's recent advance due to their
accessibility and low prices, but the sudden rise in share prices, and
sluggish profit prospects, had begun to make them look unattractive on a
valuation basis. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the day's most active issue,
fell Y14 to Y798 and Nippon Steel declined Y4 to Y362.
Toyota Motor, the vehicle manufacturer, rose Y20 to Y2,170 on improved sales
and profits prospects. Other companies within Toyota's keiretsu, or
corporate grouping, also gained ground, with Toyoda Automatic Loom Works up
Y40 to Y1,830 and Aisin Seiki ahead Y20 at Y1,370. Other car makers were
hurt by profit-taking: Honda Motor shed Y30 to Y1,900 and Nissan Motor Y12
to Y871.
Arbitrage selling hurt bank stocks, Industrial Bank of Japan easing Y10 to
Y3,220 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y20 to Y1,970. Electronics makers were also
softer, Hitachi losing Y10 to Y1,080.
Textile issues, favourites among short term speculators, were actively
traded. Unitika, the day's second most active issue, rose Y18 to Y390, but
Kurabo Industries lost an initial gain to end Y4 off at Y500.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 42.36 to 23,626.20 in volume of 47.5m
shares. Profit-taking depressed electronics and pharmaceuticals, Ono
Pharmaceutical falling Y100 to Y4,900.
Roundup
Overnight gains in US equity and bond markets had a limited effect on
sentiment in the Pacific Basin.
KUALA LUMPUR finished higher as corporate developments gave retail investors
an incentive to buy, the KLSE composite index gaining 15.46, or 1.5 per
cent, at 1,028.95. Volume jumped from 184m to 338m shares.
Idris, which received Finance Ministry approval to negotiate the acquisition
of a majority stake in Bank of Nova Scotia's Malaysian operations, rose 5
cents to MDollars 5.20. Time moved ahead 20 cents to MDollars 6.70 after
being awarded a licence to operate a domestic telecommunications service.
KARACHI rose 1.1 per cent, the KSE 100 closing 24.12 stronger at 2,254.95,
but declines outscored advances by 167 to 154. Dealers said investors were
taking positions, now that confusion about new taxes in the June 9 budget
was being removed.
SINGAPORE made a late comeback, the Straits Times Industrial index ending
8.21 up at 2,286.51 after dipping to 2,270.76. Creative Technology closed at
SDollars 29.50, against an offer price of SDollars 25.80.
WELLINGTON recouped some of Tuesday's losses to finish with the NZSE-40
index 24.32 higher at 2,100.87 in turnover of NZDollars 34.4m, helped by the
overnight advance on Wall Street and in US bond markets.
TAIPEI majored in electronics exporters and financials as the weighted index
moved forward 16.12 points to end at 6,115.06 in turnover down from TDollars
75.7bn to TDollars 57.4bn. Strong bargain buying in electronics issues,
reflecting the weak Taiwanese dollar, took United Microelectronics and Acer
up by TDollars 4 and TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 133 and TDollars 78.50
respectively.
Financials saw buying from brokerages and other major investors. China Trust
rose TDollars 3.50 to TDollars 67 on expectations of improved profits this
year.
HONG KONG, back from two days' holiday, saw late demand from overseas
investors for banks and large conglomerates and closed 38.36 higher at
9,149.52.
The utilities sector rose 101.92 to 10,876.30, boosted by recent buy
recommendations on potential gains in the China market. HK Telecom firmed 10
cents to HKDollars 15.10.
SYDNEY rose at first on the Dow, but the All Ordinaries index closed 2.2
down at 2,074.4 after a high of 2,084.1.
SEOUL dropped 1.4 per cent on the lingering North Korean nuclear issue, the
composite index ending 12.80 lower at 890.92. COLOMBO's all-share index fell
18.50, or 1.9 per cent, to 944.30 on general uncertainty and profit-taking.

FT  16 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Thyssen up as Mannesmann falls
again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses turned from flat to mildly bearish in the afternoon as the US bond
market slid off its highs, writes Our Markets Staff, and professional
opinion was divided on prospects.
European cyclicals were overvalued, said Mr Joe Rooney of Lehman Brothers,
underweighting Germany and Sweden. Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, expected
Germany to outperform on faster earnings growth, fuelled by cost-cutting and
rising exports.
Other strategists focused on bond yield differentials, and came up with
different conclusions. On a shorter term view, the Smith New Court team said
that UK equities should outperform their German counterparts on a narrowing
of the yield differential between UK and German bonds.
However, Mr David Roche's Independent Strategy expected German bunds to
strengthen considerably in the next three to six months, that German
equities would outperform and that the French market - with more limited
room for upward movement in bond prices - would be an underperformer.
FRANKFURT, not surprisingly, went nowhere on the day, the DAX index standing
still on the session at 2,074.70 and easing just slightly to 2,073.21 in the
post-bourse.
The main excitement of the day was provided by Mannesmann and Thyssen, once
stolid steel and engineering companies but recently enlivened by their
diversification into mobile telephone networks.
Mannesmann dropped DM14.30 to DM412, and another DM4.50 to DM407.50 in the
London afternoon, down DM38.50 this week and DM81, or over 16 per cent below
its high for the year. Thyssen, on the other hand, climbed DM10.30, or 3.8
per cent to DM283.30.
Thyssen impressed German analysts at a meeting this week and while their
earnings estimates diverge - DM11 a share, and DM20 are both respectable
forecasts for the 1994-95 year beginning next October - most of them are
buyers on the prospect of steel price increases, and accelerating earnings
growth thereafter.
In Mannesmann's case, public prosecutors in Dusseldrof said yesterday that
there was no evidence linking the company's chairman, Mr Werner Dieter, to
improprieties as alleged by Der Spiegel in an article over the weekend.
PARIS turned lower once more as Tuesday's rise proved to be unsustainable.
In a market that is currently unable to attract buyers, the CAC-40 index
shed 25.60 to 1,966.39, to bring the loss on the week so far to 2.7 per
cent.
Turnover was FFr3.7bn.
In a technical analysis of the French market, James Capel suggested that in
the short-term the downside might find support at the 1,800 level, even
though economic fundamentals were sound. 'Getting back through 2,100 will be
a struggle,' it added, 'having been a level of strong support on the way
down'.
Elf Aquitaine, off FFr1.90 at FFr398.70, attracted negative comment from
Hoare Govett, which maintained its sell recommendation. The broker said that
the group had suffered due to over-expansion in recent years while, under
its new management, it had been pulling back in order to prevent a further
rise in the debt burden. 'Cost cutting will be the next phase, but Elf
starts three to four years later than most of the other companies in the
sector,' it added. 'What is more, a large scale restructuring might still
not be easy to realise in France's troubled labour market.'
AMSTERDAM was easier with the AEX down 0.54 at 400.85, after a high of
402.31.
Philips and Begemann, the industrial group, both went against the trend on
news of investments outside Holland. The consumer products group, up 10
cents at Fl 52.40, is to invest Fl 75m in its Brazilian unit which
manufactures television tubes. The group said that this would help meet the
growing demand for television sets in Latin America.
Begemann advanced 20 cents to Fl 45.10 on news that it was to purchase a 75
per cent stake in Deutsche Waggonbau, a maker of railway rolling stock, from
the east German Treuhand privatisation agency.
MILAN fell on the last day of the account as investors positioned themselves
ahead of capital increases and equity offerings. The Comit index eased 2.53
to 715.42.
Mondadori tumbled L3,200 to L15,300 following the announcement late on
Tuesday that its issue price had been set at the top end of expectations.
However, analysts do not expect there to be a problem in getting the issue
away.
ZURICH had a nervous afternoon as a weak dollar and foreign selling added to
negative sentiment. The SMI index fell 35.4 to 2,704.6.
MADRID combined the fall of the dollar with weak bonds and political
uncertainty, emerging with the general index 4.58, or 1.4 per cent lower at
317.80; the fall was the more worrying as it was sustained in high turnover
of Pta40.5bn.
ISTANBUL finished 3.5 per cent higher in spite of late profit-taking. The
composite index rose 609.49 to 18,000.92 but caution remained ahead of a
constitutional court decision on the government's privatisation programme.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Markets Report: UK data buoy futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The short sterling futures contract for December rose more than 20 basis
points yesterday as better than expected UK economic data prompted the
markets to revise interest rates slightly downwards, writes Motoko Rich.
A below forecast underlying rate of UK average earnings in April also drove
up gilt prices, but failed to help the pound break out of its narrow trading
margins in the aftermath of the European and by-elections.
The December short sterling contract closed at 93.94 from 93.72, discounting
a short-term interest rate of 6.06 per cent. Sterling finished in London at
DM2.4862 from Tuesday's DM2.4951, and against the dollar at Dollars 1.5203
from Dollars 1.5175.
The market's bearish attitude towards the dollar was confirmed by weaker
economic data from the US and it fell close to SFr1.38, its lowest level
against the Swiss franc since September last year.
A raft of UK statistics gave further evidence of a gradual economic recovery
with subdued inflationary pressures. The markets welcomed a smaller than
expected 3.75 per cent rise in the underlying rate of UK average earnings in
April. The annual rate had been expected to increase to 4.25 per cent after
March's 4.00 per cent.
In the three months to April, the UK's unit wage costs were 1.9 per cent
higher than in the same period of 1993, compared with annual growth of 2.2
per cent in the three months to March.
The retail price index, the economy's key inflation measure, rose a
year-on-year 2.6 per cent in May, the same as in April, but the underlying
rate rose to 2.5 per cent. Analysts attributed this increase to one-off
seasonal factors which the markets did not take seriously. Unemployment fell
to 9.4 per cent in May, down from 9.5 per cent in April.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said short
sterling futures contracts reacted positively to the news. 'The markets drew
the conclusion that the probability of an early base rate increase has
receded,' he said.
Sterling itself did not show any dramatic reactions to the data. 'The
absence of an interest rate increase obviously takes away some support for
the pound,' added Mr MacKinnon. He said the markets were waiting for more
clues on interest rates from last night's Mansion House speech by the
chancellor.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England provided late assistance of
Pounds 245m. Earlier it had provided Pounds 13m after forecasting a shortage
of Pounds 500m. The overnight lending rate traded between 6 and 4 5/8 per
cent.
Weak US data, combined with a change in sentiment regarding the Federal
Reserve's plans to raise interest rates this summer, forced the dollar to
breach its limit against the Swiss franc and to test its downside against
the D-Mark. Analysts described the US currency's drop against the Swiss
franc as a technical fall, which was also reflected in the dollar's
performance against the D-Mark.
The US currency closed in London at DM1.6354 from DM1.6443 and at Y102.750
from Y102.665. In New York it ended at DM1.6365 and Y102.70.
Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said the dollar was
now expressing its own weakness rather than the strength of the D-Mark
earlier this week. 'The weakness of the dollar is in contrast to the pattern
of the last few days, where the stability of the US Treasury market had
allowed the dollar to hold up,' he said.
US industrial output rose 0.2 per cent in May, against forecasts of
remaining unchanged from April, while the capacity utilisation rate declined
to 83.5 per cent, in line with market expectations, from April's 83.6 per
cent. Business inventories rose 0.2 per cent, after falling a revised 0.1
per cent in March, and business sales fell 0.8 per cent after a revised
increase of 1.4 per cent in March.
Mr Anthony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN/AMRO, said investors are
wary of breaching certain limits against key currencies such as the D-Mark
or sterling; 'but the Swiss franc tends to be a free animal'.
He said the markets were driving the dollar down in an attempt to search out
the central banks. Although the Bank of Japan intervened earlier this week
to shore up the dollar, at present there is no sign that the Bundesbank will
do the same. Mr Norfield added: 'If we saw another drop to DM1.625, then I
think that would rouse the central banks to prevent a dollar collapse.'
Elsewhere in Europe, as expected, the Bundesbank announced a five
basis-point fall in the repo rate to 5.05 per cent. The D-Mark remained
fairly stable against other European currencies. Against the French franc it
ended at FFr3.410 from FFr3.412, and against the Danish krone it closed at
DKr3.911, almost unchanged from DKr3.912.
A five basis-point cut to 5.05 per cent in the key central rate by the
Belgian National Bank and a fall in the overnight interest rate to 6.55 per
cent failed to move the Belgian currency. The D-Mark finished at BFr20.57,
against BFr20.58 previously.

losses - Market Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures recovered from an early reaction
against recent strong gains to finish the day only marginally lower. Traders
saw the morning's Dollars 56 fall to Dollars 2,340 a tonne for September
delivery as a correction in a continuing bull run. The price closed at
Dollars 2,388, down Dollars 8 on balance.
Coffee's later strength helped COCOA, although it had not emulated the
initial fall.
At the LME ALUMINIUM prices belatedly followed COPPER'S retreat.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Green light expected for milk
board reincarnation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government is expected to announce plans today to open up the
Pounds 3.3bn milk market to competition by November. Mrs Gillian Shephard,
the agriculture minister, is likely to give the go-ahead for the Milk
Marketing Board's scheme to re-organise itself into a voluntary farmers'
co-operative called Milk Marque.
The liberalisation of milk sales will mean that dairy companies can buy
their supplies directly from farmers for the first time in 60 years.
But the plans to open up the market have been surrounded in controversy with
many dairies claiming that Milk Marque would be left with too dominant a
position and be able to force up prices.
Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, the large UK dairy group, said
yesterday that unless the government had forced Milk Marque to change
transportation arrangements originally proposed, he might complain to the
Office of Fair Trading.
Mrs Shephard rejected initial plans by the milk board for its reincarnation
as Milk Marque, saying she was not happy with its aim of transferring the
bulk of the board's assets to the new co-operative. This delayed the
liberalisation of the market which was initially set for April this year.
But doubts remain among the dairy companies about Milk Marque's proposed
sales system and arrangements for collecting milk from farms. The Dairy
Trade Federation, which represents the dairy companies, has complained that
the sales system remains too monopolistic.
In remarks to a food industry conference, Mr Haskins said that continual
confrontation between the federation and the milk board in the past had been
'totally sterile and unconstructive. That's what we're trying to do: get rid
of all this garbage.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead output begins to fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Production of refined lead is falling, according to the International Lead
and Zinc Study Group.
Latest data from the ILSZG shows that mine production during the first four
months of 1994 was 7.2 per cent down on the same 1993 period while refined
output was 1 per cent lower.
Consumption was 4.2 per cent above the January-April 1993, mainly reflecting
strong demand growth in the US.
In April, producer stocks of lead fell 13,000 tonnes to 200,000, but stocks
in London Metal Exchange warehouses continued to rise.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec cancels meeting to bolster
confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last night agreed to
cancel a planned September meeting in a move that should reinforce market
confidence that it intends to stick to its present production ceiling until
the end of the year.
The idea of cancelling the September meeting was first put forward by Saudi
Arabia, the cartel's largest producer. Cancellation of the informal session
means that the earliest opportunity for Opec to review its quotas will not
be until November 16, well into the fourth quarter when demand for its
members' oil is usually approaching its seasonal peak. Opec officials said
there was no opposition to the decision, which should send a positive signal
to the market, according to analysts.
The organisation also agreed yesterday to form a new sub-committee to
monitor adherence to the 24.52m barrel a day ceiling. Recent production has
been running above that figure, with May output reported as 24.992m b/d.
The committee will be chaired by Venezuela. it includes representatives of
Nigeria and Kuwait as well as the organisation's secretary general.
The question of who will replace Dr Subroto as secretary general was put off
until today, when the meeting is expected to end.
The buoyant mood of most of the delegates yesterday was in sharp contrast to
their last meeting in Vienna last November.
That conference, in which delegates failed to agree on widely demanded
production cuts, ended with oil ministers scuttling out of Vienna in a
rainstorm as oil prices crashed around them.
Yesterday they returned to an Austrian capital bathed with late spring
sunshine, basking in the knowledge that oil prices had recovered sharply in
recent months.
A warning by Mr Abdullah Al Attiyah, the Opec president, that the present
improvement in demand 'may be limited,' did little to dent in their
optimism.
One Gulf Arab official thought there was scope for prices to rise by
'another Dollars 3 or Dollars 4 by the end of the year'. That, if it came to
pass, would take the price of the benchmark Brent Blend to about Dollars 20
a barrel, compared with a five-year low of around Dollars 13 reached last
February. Mr Al-Attiyah noted that the Opec basket price (an average price
of seven crude oils) has recovered to around Dollars 16 from its five-year
low of Dollars 12.87 in February.
But Opec oil revenues, which '. . . dropped by about 8 per cent in 1993. . .
may fall further by two decimal points in 1994', he said.
Ministers appeared determined, nevertheless, to savour a rare opportunity to
meet in a relatively relaxed atmosphere.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway and Iceland spoiling for
arctic cod war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A bitter dispute between Norway and Iceland over fishing rights in arctic
waters scaled new heights this week and threatens to become a full-blown cod
war, reminiscent of that between Britain and Iceland in the 1970s.
Yesterday, Mr Bjoern Tore Godal, Norway's foreign minister warned Iceland
that Norway was prepared to take whatever measures were needed to deter
Icelandic trawlers from fishing in a so-called fisheries protection zone,
200km around the arctic archipelago of Svalbard, where Norway has
sovereignty under a 1920 treaty.
The warning was issued to the Icelandic ambassador after the Norwegian coast
guard on Tuesday night had fired warning shots and cut the wires holding the
nets of the Icelandic trawlers fishing in the disputed area. It was the
first time the Norwegians had resorted to such measures.
Earlier this month Norwegian shipyards in the northern part of the country
refused to repair Icelandic trawlers.
Mr David Oddsson, Iceland's prime minister, said yesterday in a radio
interview that the warning shots had been an illegal act by Norway and
threatened to take the case to the international court in The Hague if
Norway did not find a diplomatic solution.
Norway said it did not plan any meetings with Iceland but expected it to
respect the zone, where it, Russia and some EU countries have historical
fishing rights, and would also seek to maintain a dialogue with Iceland on
the issue.
Iceland has no cod quotas in the region and no historical fishing rights.
Fish accounts for about 80 per cent of Iceland's export earnings.
'No one really wants a conflict but we also are aware of the differences in
opinion between Norway and Iceland over the zone,' a Norwegian foreign
ministry spokesman said yesterday.
Last year the two countries became embroiled in a similar dispute over the
'loophole', a 62,400 sq km protected zone in the Barents Sea jointly managed
by Norway and Russia, where arctic cod spawn and where Icelandic trawlers
had refused to withdraw from cod fishing. They were also in dispute last
year over the fisheries protection zone.
The Icelandic government subsequently ordered its fisherman to withdraw from
the fisheries protection zone and the ambassador to Iceland told the
Norwegian foreign minister yesterday that this declaration was still in
force.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shephard launches Pounds 10m
scheme to help improve farm marketing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, yesterday launched a scheme
worth Pounds 10m over the next three years to help farmers and small food
companies improve their marketing skills.
'Primary producers are masterly at planning production, but their marketing
skills are undeveloped, particularly when they are producing an
undifferentiated product,' Mrs Shephard told an Adas food industry
conference.
The aid scheme will give grants of up to 50 per cent to help producers,
processors and others in the industry 'sharpen up management and adopt
better marketing practice', she said.
The purpose of the scheme is to enable producers to forge closer links with
the market place, an aim that has consistently eluded the majority of
British farmers. Mrs Shephard said the grants could help with market
research and feasibility studies as well as contributing to the salaries of
important staff.
The National Farmers' Union said it would conduct a feasibility study into
ways of developing marketing opportunities for its farmers. It hoped to be
able to give farmers advice on how to take advantage of the government's
scheme.
Mr Chris Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, stressed the importance of
working together with farmers when he said that the only way he could add
value and increase his profits was through 'alliances with suppliers and
consumers'.
However, Mr Haskins and Mr Terry Leahy, marketing director for Tesco, the UK
retailing group, conceded that it was much harder for farmers to work
closely with food companies and retailers when they were producing commodity
products that were in oversupply.
Mr Leahy said that, nevertheless, better marketing would enable farmers to
get more information from the market place on what type of products were
wanted, how much and when.

Guyana's gold production in the first quarter of this year rose 20 per cent

from the country's largest miner.
Omai Gold Mines, which produced 67,670 ounces in the quarter, 4,672 above
projection, is owned by Cambior Incorporated and Golden Star Resources of
Canada and the Guyana government. It started production in January 1993 with

FT  16 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber traders see pressure on
prices as Thais scale down official purchases
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thai officials buying rubber on behalf of the government have been told to
cool down their purchasing this week so as not to compete with private
traders, according to an official of the central rubber market, reports
Reuters from Bangkok.
'Our buyers, some 30 of them from the state Rubber Estate Organisation, will
from now on not compete with the private sector for supplies,' Mr Chakarn
Saengruksawong, director of the Rubber Research Institute said. In recent
months Thai rubber prices have surged to around Bt24-25 (63p-65p) a kilogram
in response to tightness of supplies and big government supply contracts,
notably a contract with China that still has some 100,000 tonnes
outstanding.
'Officials are negotiating with the Chinese to postpone deliveries for two
to three months when rubber supplies are expected to get back to normal,' Mr
Chakarn said.
He explained that the government did not want to see traders going out of
business because of losses sustained from honouring contracts that were
concluded when prices were about Bt19 earlier in the year.
Singapore rubber traders said the Thai news could send the market lower.
'This means that the government is not going to chase the market,' one
senior broker said. 'The current upsurge in Tokyo and Singapore is mainly
due to the Thai government competing with the locals for supplies.'
With the latest Thai government's move, Singapore traders said they were not
sure how the government could now meet its contracted rubber shipments.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slide as N Korea fears drive up
oil price
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds plunged yesterday afternoon in reaction to a sharp rise in
oil prices.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 3/16 lower
at 86 3/32 , with the yield climbing to 7.415 per cent. At the short end,
the two-year note was down  5/32 at 100, to yield 5.856 per cent.
After an uneventful morning, traders became alarmed by an unforeseen jump in
crude prices. With the international crisis over North Korea's nuclear
policies intensifying, oil climbed over the Dollars 19-a-barrel mark and the
Treasury market took fright.
Earlier on, bonds posted modest gains as the market followed through
half-heartedly on the previous session's favourable news on May consumer
price inflation.
Tuesday's economic data had encouraged the view that the Fed would hold off
on its next money tightening until the end of the summer. That scenario was
buttressed yesterday by Mr Lawrence Lindsey, a central bank governor, who
told the Market News wire service that monetary policy was now 'within the
neutral range'.
The morning's economic news did nothing to alter the perception that the
economy had slowed sufficiently to allow the Fed to give bonds some
breathing room. The central bank reported that industrial production had
risen 0.2 per cent, while capacity-utilisation, a key indicator of future
inflation, slipped to 83.5 per cent, from 83.6 per cent.
However, if Mr Lindsey's remarks were intended to reassure the market, their
effect was short-lived. His Fed colleague, Mr John LaWare, warned that the
economy had reached 'full employment', a point at which wage pressures are
likely mount.
Bonds then reversed direction and slipped into negative territory. However,
the damage was limited until the market became aware of the upward movement
in oil prices.
European government bonds were once again whipped around in volatile trading
conditions, ending mostly lower as investors continued their 'buyers'
strike'.
The market has become dominated by short-term traders, with most long-term
investors lying low. 'The real investors are sidelined; they're very
nervous, and aren't sure what represents value,' said a London trader.
Data showing steady economic growth with low inflation brought an improved
tone to the gilts market, helping it outperform most other European markets.
However, gilts shed much of their early gains in later trading due to
weakness in the US.
UK average earnings rose at an annual rate of 3.75 per cent in April, down
from 4 per cent in March. Investors had feared they might rise to 4.25 per
cent in April.
Short-dated bonds in particular benefited from the news, outperforming
medium and long-dated gilts. Traders reported the first buying in the cash
market for some time, as well as demand from overseas investors and
switching into gilts from German bonds.
However, analysts said further rises in gilts were limited ahead of Friday's
Bank of England announcement on the details of its next gilt auction.
Gilts fell sharply in early trading due to weakness in the German market.
The long gilt future was up  1/16 point at 100 17/32 in late trading.
German government bonds ended a choppy session down about  1/2 point. The
Bundesbank's widely-expected cut of five basis points in the securities
repurchase rate did little to lift sentiment, and bunds were pushed sharply
lower early in the day by a large sell order of September bund futures.
There was talk of a big US house selling 15,000 contracts for a US customer.
The September bund contract ended around 91.74, down 0.53 point and only
slightly above its 91.59 intra-day low.
France slightly outperformed Germany, although its upside was limited by the
prospect of new supply today, with the Treasury due to issue FFr18bn -
FFr20bn of two- and five-year notes, or Btans. While traders have reported
recent demand for shorter-dated paper, the paper is expected to weigh on
prices.
Moreover, some large French investment funds, or Sicavs, have been seen
liquidating holdings in the French market as their clients pull out, seeking
to prevent further losses.
The September notional French bond futures contract on Matif closed at
115.40, down 0.16 point on the day.
Italian bonds fell by more than a point on continuing concerns about the
budget deficit, exacerbated by a recent constitutional court ruling
requiring the government to repay pension benefits.
The government's auction of L1,000bn of 10-year bonds didn't help sentiment,
yielding an average gross 10.40 per cent, well above the 9.99 per cent yield
of the last auction in May. The September BTP futures contract on Liffe fell
by 1.79 points to 104.16.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Bonds: Republic of Austria launches Dollars
600m two-year deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Austria's Dollars 600m offering of two-year eurobonds
yesterday tested retail demand for short-dated dollar paper, after a spate
of recent offerings.
For Swiss retail investors and fund managers, short-dated dollar paper
appears a safer bet than more volatile longer maturities, while the yield
pick-up over bank deposit rates of about 1 1/2 points makes a slight
extension of maturity, for a relatively small increase in risk, attractive.
The 6 per cent coupon - even though it meant setting the re-offer price at a
slight premium to the par value of the bonds - was necessary to attract
retail investors, according to lead manager Goldman Sachs.
However, there has already been a heavy flow of two-year issues, and some
dealers said there was a finite pocket of demand for such paper. 'The paper
will take some time to place, but Austria is one of the supreme retail names
for Swiss investors,' said one dealer at a Swiss bank.
For the Republic of Austria, the financing replaced a Sch10bn auction of
five-year notes in the domestic market, cancelled on Tuesday due to the
Federal Financing Agency's dissatisfaction with the level of bids received
from Austrian banks. The agency had already changed from a two-year to a
five-year auction on the advice of the banks.
Austrian government bonds had suffered in the run-up to last week's
referendum on whether to join the European Union. Yield spreads over German
bunds, which had been trading in a range of between 20 and 40 basis points,
widened to 55 basis points.
However, following the positive result of the referendum, the market
improved, and the agency was expecting to receive stronger bids at the
auction. In the event, the bids submitted by the banks were around 65 basis
points over bund yields, perhaps because banks were nervous about taking on
more inventory after suffering losses in the bond market the previous week.
As a result, the decision was taken to cancel the auction. To accept such a
level of bids 'would have been (to send) the wrong signal to the Austrian
bond market', said Mr Hans Kernbauer, a managing director of the Austrian
Federal Financing Agency. In any case, 'it was always part of our financing
programme that we should tap the foreign markets in the course of this
year'.
The chance to launch a dollar deal of two years - the maturity originally
planned for the auction - provided funding at a lower cost, he said. The
deal was swapped into fixed-rate D-Marks, and the financing was cheaper than
could have been achieved by tapping the euro-D-Mark sector directly.
Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank launched a FFr3bn five-year deal in
the French domestic market.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Open-ended emerging markets
fund from F&amp;C
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign &amp; Colonial, the investment management group, is launching an
open-ended fund which, it says, will provide investors with a diversified
exposure to emerging markets.
F&amp;C, which already has a Pounds 130m closed-end emerging markets investment
trust, has not set any firm targets for the new fund, in view of the
downturn in emerging markets.
However, the daily dealing at net asset value, and the increased liquidity
provided by the open-ended structure, should appeal to investors wanting
more efficient and less risky access to markets which are intrinsically
volatile. The Luxembourg-listed fund will follow the asset allocation models
used by F&amp;C.
The launch period for the shares, which are priced at Dollars 10 each, runs
until July 1. The minimum investment is Dollars 5,000.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Swift seeks to lift
membership with lower fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swift, the Belgian-based cross-border payment message network owned by 2,230
banks, yesterday announced heavy cuts in joining fees in an effort to
attract more small banks, securities houses and other financial
institutions.
Swift's board approved a 5 per cent tariff rebate to its members this year,
following a 20 per cent rebate last year. It also decided that existing
members would not have to pay for new electronic security equipment for the
network.
The board decided to cut fees for entry to the system - which allows banks
and financial institutions to exchange cash and securities settlement and
confirmation messages across borders - from an average of between BFr1.3m
(Dollars 38,460) and BFr1.8m per member.
The fee for full membership, which is confined to banks, was cut to
BFr400,000, while the fee for financial institutions such as broker-dealers
and asset managers to become 'sub-members' was cut to BFr200,000.
Swift is facing competition in the market for low-value cross-border
payments from systems such as Ibos, developed by Royal Bank of Scotland and
Banco Santander. It has been forced to restructure and cut costs.
Mr Francis Remacle, vice-president for sales, said Swift saw securities
transactions, including settlement and securities custody, as an important
growth area, and had cut fees to encourage smaller users to join.
He said that between 6 per cent and 7 per cent of the 457m Swift messages
last year related to securities rather than cash, compared with 3 per cent
two years ago.
Swift's revenues fell to Dollars 280m last year from Dollars 323m the
previous year, after cuts in tariffs.

BZW, the UK-based investment bank, has been given the job of advising the
federal government taskforce which is looking into the potential
privatisation of Australia's Federal Airports Corporation, writes Nikki
Tait.
Although the possible sale has been widely flagged - BAA of the UK has been
tipped as one potential buyer - the government has yet to decide how to
proceed. There are 23 properties involved, ranging from international
airports to small domestic 'general aviation' centres.

Tata Tea, India's biggest plantation company, yesterday announced a 13.15
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Rs854m (Dollars 27.11m) from Rs757m
for the year ended March 31.
Turnover totalled Rs4.36bn, against Rs4.12bn in the previous 12 months.
Earnings per share were up at Rs18.67 (Rs17.18) while the dividend has been
maintained at Rs8 a share.
The management has recommended a bonus issue in the ratio of one new share
for every two held. According to Mr KK Krishna Kumar, managing director, the
outlook for the current year appears 'somewhat clouded' due to lower export
demand for tea and higher production.
Tata Tea is a significant exporter of tea. Its total export income last year
rose to Rs910m from Rs860m.

<TEXT>
The Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday completed the sale of Sket, one
of eastern Germany's largest machine-tool enterprises, to a west German
group of investors led by Salzgitter Maschinenbau, writes Judy Dempsey.
Salzgitter Maschinenbau agreed to buy a 51 per cent stake in Sket and its
two subsidiaries, and will invest DM100m (Dollars 62.5m) until the end of
1996. It will guarantee 2,000 jobs, but this figure will be eventually be
reduced to 1,725 by 1999. The remaining stakes will be divided between the
Treuhand and the management of Sket, with the agency retaining a 25.1 per
cent share.
Sket, based in Magdeburg, the state capital of Saxony-Anhalt, had a turnover
of DM100m last year. Prior to German reunification, its exports were
targeted at the markets of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. These
markets collapsed following German monetary union.
The sale, which ends of three years of uncertainty about the ability to find
a buyer for Sket, was yesterday welcomed by Mr Christoph Bergner, prime
minister of Saxony-Anhalt.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Israeli carrier seeks to spread
its wings - Privatisation and peace could help El Al develop new markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel's decision to sell El Al, the country's state-owned airline, to the
public by December marks a critical turning point in the company's history
and a landmark in the government's creeping privatisation programme.
Earlier this month the cabinet decided to sell at least 51 per cent of the
airline through a flotation in Tel Aviv and New York. Israeli law prohibits
the sale of more than 25 per cent of the capital of a strategic company to
foreign investors, so the remaining 26 per cent stake must be held by
Israeli nationals. The government will also keep a golden share to protect
what it considers is a vital national interest.
Before privatisation the government will have to appraise the company's
value, take the company out of receivership, appoint a new board of
directors and make provisions to refinance the employees compensation fund.
Israel's finance ministry has appointed two consortia of consulting and
accounting firms to carry out separate valuations which are expected to be
finished by August. Among the participants in the consortia are Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, Ernst and Young and Mercer.
The government intends to issue a prospectus in October or November and
appoint underwriters later.
The airline, proud of an unbroken eight-year profit record in spite of the
recent recession in the global airline business, is looking forward to
privatisation as a way to increase efficiency, take it out of a 12-year-old
receivership, and to develop new markets in east Asia. Although it has been
in receivership, the airline has been granted considerable financial
autonomy while operating within a government-imposed legal framework.
However, some significant obstacles must be resolved before the government
issues a prospectus, among them: the current prohibition on flights during
the sabbath, which costs the company an estimated Dollars 30m-Dollars 40m
profit a year;
a government decision on whether it will continue to meet 80 per cent of EL
Al's Dollars 60m security costs;
special voting rights claimed by the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, an
original shareholder;
and a refinancing of El Al's employees' compensation fund.
Corporate analysts in Israel say the way the government decides to overcome
these difficulties will determine how attractive an investment El Al will be
to foreign and local investors.
The company, however, points out that in spite of the difficulties, it has
consistently reported profits since 1986 in the face of stiff competition
and global recession. Profits in 1992 were Dollars 31.5m and are expected to
be Dollars 10m-Dollars 12m for 1993. El Al says the reduction in profits
last year, in spite of an 8 per cent increase in passengers carried, is a
result of mounting competition and considerably reduced yields from tickets
as a result of price-cutting.
Mr Nachman Klieman, a company spokesman, believes that in spite of the
squeeze on profits the airline's future looks healthy. Next year the company
will take delivery of another 747 and will begin evaluating the potential
candidates to replace the Boeing 767 for intermediate flights.
Expansion of EL Al's 47 destinations is also under consideration. In the
past two years the company has started flights to Beijing and
Bombay/Bangkok, and is looking at flying to Hong Kong, Seoul and Japan.
Mr Klieman also says the Middle East peace process will assist prospects.
Israel expects tourism to double by the end of the decade to 4m arrivals,
helped by the opening of new markets such as Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and
Syria.
More important, perhaps, a comprehensive regional peace will allow El Al to
fly over the 21 Arab states which ban the airline, slashing flight times to
Asia. Such a development could make Ben Gurion airport a regional hub for
traffic from the US and Europe to the Indian sub-continent and Asia.
Although the long-term looks promising, short-term profitability will depend
on way the government deals with the sabbath prohibition and security costs.
Mr Klieman says the sabbath flight ban costs El Al Dollars 40m profit a
year, because the airline only operates five-and-a-half days a week but
incurs costs as if it was operating seven days. Under the ban, introduced in
1982 after considerable pressure from religious political parties, no El Al
aircraft is allowed to be in the air between dusk on Friday and dusk on
Saturday.
'When the government ceases to own El Al it will become, in Israeli law, a
mixed company and the government will not be able to interfere in its
business decisions,' said Mr Yossi Nitzani, head of the government companies
authority. 'Then the board of directors will have to take the decision about
sabbath flights on the basis of business principles.'
The other decision the government cannot avoid is whether it will continue
to meet 80 per cent of El Al's security costs. Any change in the government
support will immediately affect profitability, although the introduction of
a security tax is one option under consideration.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Australian group faces ADollars
445m break-up bid
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ADollars 445m (USDollars 324m) break-up bid was launched last night for
Foodland Associated, the troubled Western Australian retail, wholesale and
property group.
Mr Graeme Hart, a New Zealand entrepreneur, is joining forces with
Australia's Coles Myer to acquire and then divide the company.
The bid is being made by Rank Commercial, Mr Hart's private company, and is
pitched at ADollars 5.27 a share. It is conditional on a minimum acceptance
level of 75 per cent, and on approvals from Australia's Foreign Investment
Review Board and the Trade Practices Commission, the competition watchdog.
The TPC said it would 'closely examine' the offer, paying particular
attention to the role of Coles Myer. Coles is one of Australia's biggest
retail groups.
Mr Hart, a former truck-driver who has built his fortune by buying a series
of companies at knock-down prices, is believed to be one of New Zealand's
wealthiest individuals. His Rank company already owns a 14.9 per cent
interest in Foodland, most of which was acquired from a single institutional
shareholder last month.
If the offer is successful, Rank says its aim is to spin off Foodland's
substantial New Zealand assets - which include the Farmers Deka discount and
department store group, and a 57.4 per cent interest in the Progressive
supermarkets group - as a separate company, distributing shares in this
entity to Foodland's remaining shareholders.
Rank, which by then would own at least 75 per cent of Foodland, would pass
its shares in this new company to Whitcoulls, the New Zealand bookseller and
stationery group.
Rank would offer its remaining stake in Foodland, which would be reduced to
its Australian assets only, to Coles. Rank said the break-up bid was being
financed by bank borrowings, to be supplied by National Australia Bank,
Credit Suisse and Bank of America.
The bank facilities were still subject to 'satisfaction of a number of
conditions (including completion of documentation)'.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Finnish steel producer swings
back to black
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rautaruukki, the Nordic region's second-largest steel producer, swung to a
pre-tax profit of FM140m (Dollars 25m) in the four months to the end of
April from a loss of FM217m in the same period last year, on the back of
rising demand and prices for steel.
The Finnish group, one of Europe's few profitable steel-makers, reaffirmed
an earlier forecast that it would achieve an improvement in full-year
profits over the full-year surplus of FM144m achieved last year.
It said sales in the first four months grew to FM2.4bn from FM2.2bn, while
operating profit surged to FM288m from a loss last time of FM154m.
The group cited stronger demand in Finland, Scandinavia and the US, and
higher prices in both export and home markets.
Rautaruukki, which concentrates on flat steel products, said the growth in
demand was expected to continue in Finland and Scandinavia, where economic
recovery is under way after several years of recession.
Prices were also expected to go on rising, although the pace of increase was
slowing. Profits growth would depend partly on lower financing costs and
cost savings.
The group raised FM792m earlier this year through a global share offering,
which led the Finnish state's holding in the company to drop to 68.7 per
cent from 81.1 per cent. Almost 16 per cent of Rautaruukki is now owned by
foreigners. The share issue had increased the group's equity ratio to about
30 per cent, the company said.

<TEXT>
Placer Pacific, the Australian group which is controlled by Canada's Placer
Dome, is to go ahead with a ADollars 155m (USDollars 113m) development of
the Osborne copper/gold deposit in north-west Queensland.
The deposit, which lies about 195km south-east of Mount Isa, will be mined
at first by open-pit methods. However, during this initial eight-month
period, Placer plans to develop an underground operation, which it says
should have a 10-year life. The mine is due to come into operation in July
1995.
Over the total mining period, therefore, average annual production is
estimated to be 29,000 tonnes of copper and 37,000 oz of gold. Total
production over the mine's life would be around 324,000 tonnes of copper and
416,000 oz of gold, with a gross metal value of ADollars 1.2bn. Life-of-mine
cash costs are projected to be 63 US cents per pound of copper, including
gold credits, Placer said.
Shares in Western Mining Corporation, one of Australia's largest mining
companies, gained 3 cents to ADollars 8.44 yesterday, after the group
confirmed that early-stage exploration work on the Philippines-controlled
island of Mindanao, has found copper/gold mineralisation. The company said
the mineralisation had been intersected in two areas, and that further work
was required to determine its significance.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Begemann wants speedy DWA deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Netherlands-based Royal Begemann group wants to complete the purchase of
Deutsche Waggonbau (DWA), the east German rolling-stock manufacturers, 'as
soon as possible' in order to create an integrated group of trains, trams
and underground systems, Mr Joep van den Nienwenhuyzen, the Dutch group's
chairman said yesterday.
On completion of the deal, Begemann intends eventually to list DWA on the
stock exchange.
After 18 months of negotiations with the Treuhand privatisation agency, said
the preliminary agreement reached with the agency earlier this week has
paved the way for Begemann to acquire 74.9 per cent of DWA's shares. The
remaining 25.1 per cent will be held by the Treuhand which will have the
option of selling its stake on the market.
Mr van den Nienwenhuyzen would not disclose the proposed purchase price, or
the number of jobs it would guarantee, but said the deal was a 'straight
cash transaction'.
Consolidated profits for the DWA group, one of the last of the large east
German enterprises to be privatised, were DM23.3m (Dollars 13.9m) on a
turnover of DM3.6bn in 1992. It employs 7,300 in its eight subsidiaries.
Begemann wants DWA to complement its operations. 'We need DWA's coaches and
freight wagons for our traction and electrical installations and control
systems. There will be no over-lap on the manufacturing side . . . Our rail
group will become a subsidiary of DWA, thus giving the east German company a
wide degree of independence,' Mr van den Nienwenhuyzen explained.
The rail group, which employs 1,200, has subsidiaries in the Netherlands,
Belgium and Switzerland. Last year it had a turnover of Fl 300m (Dollars
161.2m) and a net profit of Fl 8m.
Begemann, which wants to complete negotiations with the Treuhand before next
October's state and federal elections in Germany, also intends to revive
DWA's exports to Russia.
Until German reunification, DWA was dependent on markets in the former
Soviet Union and eastern Europe. These markets collapsed after German
monetary union. Since then, Russia's sharply decreased purchases from DWA
have been partly financed by Hermes, the German export credit guarantee
facility.
However, in an attempt to dampen expectations stemming from several earlier
collapsed talks, the Treuhand said it was continuing to negotiate with other
companies. 'It is not in the bag yet,' a spokesman for DWA's branch in
Gorlitz, Saxony said.

Chase Manhattan and First Interstate are both to start selling variable
annuities through their branch networks, marking the latest expansion by US
banks into the investment business.
Both Chase, headquartered in New York, and First Interstate, based in Los
Angeles, will sell products underwritten by SunAmerica, a life insurance
company. Variable annuities are a type of insurance product in which the
returns are dependent on investment performance, and have become one of the
fastest-growing retirement savings vehicles.
US banks are prevented from underwriting or distributing such investments.
They are sold through investment advisers housed in the banks' branches, and
the policies must be provided by an insurance company. Both Chase and First
Interstate said they will manage the investments.
Total sales of variable annuities in the US were Dollars 43bn last year and
will reach Dollars 60bn this year, according to Sun-America.

The group said seven companies - IBM, Apple Computer, Lotus Development,
Novell, Xerox, Sun Microsystems, PictureTel and VideoServer - had agreed to
allow WorldWorx users to make conferencing calls on their equipment.
Video conferencing is one of the fastest-growing areas of the
business-to-business telecommunications market, and international companies
are competing to provide users with products that incorporate the latest in
communications and computer technology.
The product unveiled yesterday is a development of a service launched last
year that allowed video and data calls from one desktop unit to another, but
not among people with equipment from different computer, software and camera
vendors.
Mr Alex Mandl, chief executive of AT&amp;T's communications services group, said
customers liked the original video conferencing product, but wanted to be
able to call more than one person at a time without worrying about
compatible hardware.
With WorldWorx, 'customers will be able to make video and data calls as
easily as they make phone calls today,' he said. Explaining how the
WorldWorx Solutions will work for businessmen using the video conference
network, Mr Mandl said: 'During a conversation, I can call up a file on my
desktop computer, show it to several colleagues, allow them to edit it if I
want to, and then just click on a single button to give them the file.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kidder Peabody receives Dollars
200m capital injection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank, has received a Dollars 200m capital
injection from its parent, General Electric, and has liquidated one third of
its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities in recent weeks.
The moves appear designed to increase the company's financial flexibility
and reduce its exposure to volatile bond markets. However, GE hinted that
Kidder - whose profits last year jumped to Dollars 439m, after several
disappointing years under GE's ownership - had performed poorly in recent
months.
Mr Dennis Dammerman, chief financial officer of GE, said that Kidder's
performance 'so far in 1994 is well within GE's management's expectations
considering this year's difficult environment for the securities industry'.
Kidder chairman Mr Michael Carpenter revealed details of the company's
capital increase and sale of securities in response to reports in the US
that suggested the firm was under-capitalised and struggling with an
illiquid securities portfolio.
At the end of 1993, Kidder had just Dollars 778m of equity capital
supporting a securities portfolio valued at Dollars 73bn. This made it
substantially more highly geared than other Wall Street houses. However,
unlike other houses it is backed a triple-A rated parent. Nor does it rely
on its own balance sheet to raise funds cheaply in the capital markets,
since it does not have a stand-alone credit rating of its own.
The capital injection was made to plug the hole left by what Kidder has
claimed were phantom trading profits of Dollars 350m reported by Mr Joseph
Jett, former head of its government bond trading desk.
Mr Jett has disputed Kidder's claims, saying that everything he did was with
the full knowledge of senior Kidder executives.
The Jett difficulties have since given way to concerns about Kidder's
activities in the mortgage-backed bonds market, which has proved highly
volatile since early this year. This market had been Kidder's biggest source
of profits, with the bank handling 24 per cent of all new issues of bonds in
the first quarter of this year.
However, new issue volume during April and May, at around Dollars 10bn a
month, was just a quarter of its level in January and February, according to
Securities Data, leading to lower underwriting fees.

BCE, the Canadian telecommunications group, is expanding its international
directories business by forming a joint venture with Hongkong Telecom.
The new unit, whose revenues are expected to total USDollars 1bn over the
next decade, will publish telephone directories, including Yellow Pages, for
Hong Kong. BCE will provide management and technical services.
Mr Thomas Bourke, president of Tele-Direct, a BCE subsidiary, said that the
Hong Kong directories market was one of the fastest-growing in the world,
and that the link with Hongkong Telecom would open doors elsewhere in
south-east Asia and China.
Hongkong Telecom is 58 per cent owned by Cable and Wireless, which last year
brought in BCE as a 20 per cent shareholder in Mercury Communications, the
UK telephone company controlled by C&amp;W.
BCE is already active in the directories market in North America, the Middle
East, Australia and India.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Amsterdam sets out to regain its
place at the top - The exchange has high hopes after its overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flush with its recent success in clawing back business in Dutch government
bonds from London, the Amsterdam stock exchange is hoping that an Fl 8m
(Dollars 4.34m) overhaul of its equity trading system will re-establish its
position as the principal marketplace for Dutch stocks.
The most important part of the reform is the decision to abolish Amsterdam's
old-fashioned system of jobbers or hoekmen, whose inability to satisfy the
large-scale trading demands by international investors resulted in the
flight of such business to London.
According to Mr Paul Arlman, the secretary-general of the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange, between 40 and 60 per cent of block trades in Dutch stocks are
done in London, although many of these transactions are later unwound in
Amsterdam.
Last year, Pounds 22.3bn (Dollars 33.45bn) worth of business in Dutch stocks
was executed in London compared with Pounds 43.5bn worth of turnover in
Amsterdam. The lion's share of the turnover in London was on the Stock
Exchange's automated Seaq International system.
Mr Thom Hoedemakers, a spokesman for the Amsterdam stock exchange, says the
exchange aims to reduce London's market share to around one-quarter from its
current position of one-third. The new systems, which come into operation on
October 1, will effectively divide Amsterdam into two markets, one for
wholesale business and the other for retail investors, who own around 40 per
cent of Dutch equities.
The stock exchange will offer the wholesale market two systems, an
order-driven and screen-based trading system called Aida through which
orders can be executed automatically and with a high degree of anonymity.
Those wishing to trade outside the system can advertise their prices on
Asset, a screen-based system, which aims to compete with Seaq International.
Although the hoekmen, who will act as US-style stock specialists, will have
access to the wholesale market, they are likely to trade mainly in the
retail market.
Senior managers at leading stockbrokers in London, which are also members of
the Amsterdam Stock Exchange through their Dutch subsidiaries, say the
removal of the central role of the jobbers is the most sensible feature of
the reforms. 'There will be a greater incentive to trade, or report trades,
in Amsterdam as a result,' says the head of European trading at a leading UK
bank.
Brokers warn, however, that the diverse trading systems which Amsterdam has
put in place must quickly prove that they can produce more competitive
prices than London, since the flow of order-driven business will always be
dictated by price. Some point out, for example, that prices on Asset are
likely to be even less firm than on Seaq.
In addition, they believe that Amsterdam will have difficulty in recouping
business in the large Dutch stocks, such as Royal Dutch and Unilever, since
they have been trading on an international basis for such a long time.
However, they say that the exchange will have a far higher success rate in
attracting back business in second-line stocks, such as Aegon or Ahold,
which are also actively traded in London.

Citibank, part of the US banking group, is the first foreign bank to apply
for a licence to operate as a full-service financial institution in Mexico.
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, ratified last year, US banks
are permitted to carry out a wide range of activities in Mexico under the
auspices of a locally-incorporated holding company.
Citibank said it had applied to create a holding company in Mexico with
minimum capital of 1bn pesos (Dollars 296m), making it the first foreign
bank to take this step. It plans to develop securities broking and leasing
businesses, as well as a banking operation.
Citibank already has five bank branches in Mexico City and one in Monterrey,
offering mainly retail banking services.
Bankers Trust of the US yesterday opened representative offices in Beijing,
writes Tony Walker in Beijing.
The bank said the move represented Bankers Trust's commitment to China and
Asia.

<TEXT>
Electronic Data Systems (EDS), the computer services company owned by
General Motors, has won a Dollars 3.2bn, 10-year contract to take over
operation of Xerox's computer and telecommunications network.
The 'outsourcing' contract is believed to be the largest of its kind, and
the first to encompass the worldwide information management operations of
any company.
Under the arrangement, EDS will assume responsibility for Xerox
data-processing, telecommunications and computer network services in 19
countries, and provide and maintain the computer applications that support
Xerox's internal business processes.
It will take control of data centre operations, including the main ones in
the US, the UK and Brazil; worldwide voice and data communications; desktop
systems support; and existing business-support applications.
Xerox will retain responsibility for determining the architecture of its
computer systems, strategy and new program development. It will also
continue to service and support its customers.
Some 1,700 Xerox employees, including 1,400 in the US and 750 in the UK,
will transfer to EDS over the next 18 months.
Xerox has taken the unprecedented step of outsourcing almost all its
information management operations to 'focus resources on our core business
of document processing, which is critical to ensure our continued success in
a fiercely competitive industry', said Mr Paul Allaire, Xerox chairman. He
said the outsourcing arrangement would cut costs.
'This is the first truly global commercial information-management
outsourcing arrangement and provides an opportunity for EDS to showcase its
proven capabilities,' said Mr Les Alberthal, EDS chairman, president and
chief executive.
The Xerox contract follows EDS's recent Dollars 1.5bn order to handle
computer operations for the Inland Revenue, the UK tax authority.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Poor trend continues at Heinz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
H. J. Heinz said sales slumped in the final three months of its fiscal year
to April 2, as the US food group continued a string of disappointing
performances. The company, headed by Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Irish
businessman, also showed a sharp decline in underlying earnings.
The 4 per cent downturn in revenues to Dollars 1.95bn, compared with Dollars
2.03bn in the same quarter last year, reflected operational difficulties and
unfavourable trading conditions.
Heinz's strong presence in overseas markets heightened the impact of
negative currency fluctuations. More troublesome, however, was a 4 per cent
deterioration in sales volume, after two consecutive quarterly gains.
The decline in the three months partly stemmed from a failure to revive its
Weight Watchers businesses during the January and February period.
However, Heinz's food-service business recorded higher sales volume for the
quarter and the company raised prices on most of its core products.
Nevertheless, at the operating level earnings of Dollars 200.3m represented
a big decline from the previous year, if a Dollars 192m restructuring charge
is added back to the 1993 results. With the provision held out, Heinz earned
Dollars 54.3m a year ago at the operating level.
The comparison would have been even more unflattering if the company had not
reduced selling, general and administrative expenses by more than 7 per cent
from the year-earlier quarter.
Net income amounted to Dollars 129m, or 51 cents, against Dollars 69m, or 27
cents, a year earlier. However, the restructuring charge reduced the 1993
result by 43 cents a share.
For the year, net income was Dollars 602.9m, or Dollars 2.35, including
gains of 24 cents on disposals, against earnings of Dollars 396.3m, or
Dollars 1.53, including a provision of 45 cents for restructuring and a
charge of 51 cents to reflect accounting changes.

A decision on the Meridien Hotels chain, owned by Air France and courted by
Forte, the UK hotels group, and Accor, the French travel group, is likely to
be delayed beyond today's board meeting of the French state-owned airline,
officials indicated yesterday.
A June 30 deadline has been set for the bidding, but the sensitivity of the
sale has resulted in a series of delays. A decision was first expected on
April 28, but the rival bids were referred instead to France's privatisation
commission.
Forte's is the higher bid, valuing the Meridien chain at FFr1.8bn (Dollars
305m) compared with FFr1.6bn offered by Accor and its partner, Prince
Al-Waleed Bin Talal of Saudi Arabia. Meridien prefers the Forte offer, but
political pressure has been brought to bear to keep the chain under French
control.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Wella moves into perfume with
90% stake in Muehlens - Although haircare and perfume products have clear
synergies, Wella's apparent diversification has puzzled analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wella, the German haircare group, is to make a decisive move into the
perfumes business with the purchase of a 90 per cent-plus stake in Muehlens,
best-known for its 4711 eau de cologne brand.
The deal - billed by Wella as the biggest acquisition in its history,
although no details of terms were given - closely follows two strategic
purchases in the haircare trade, and coincides with the closing phase of a
shake-out in its European manufacturing operations.
Muehlens, a 200-year-old private concern which claims to be German market
leader in women's perfumes, had sales of about DM500m (Dollars 294m) last
year. Apart from the 4711 name, it produces more youthful brands such as
Sabatini, Presley and Tosca, and has a global licence to use the Gucci
perfume label.
Wella's existing interests in the sector are concentrated in the Rochas
company, bought in 1988 from Roussel-Uclaf, and which last year contributed
just DM160m to group sales of DM2.9bn.
Although haircare and perfume products have clear synergies in terms of
distribution and target markets, the apparent diversification puzzled
analysts, who have been repeatedly told by Wella that its prime aim was to
become world leader in haircare.
Already number one in salon products, it ranks fourth behind L'Oreal,
Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble in the retail sector. Last year, it bolstered
its presence in US hairdressing salons with the purchase of an 80 per cent
majority in Sebastian, a specialist in professional products. It later
bought a mainly-British market share with the takeover of the Silvikrin and
Vosene brands from SmithKline Beecham.
Meanwhile, Wella pressed ahead with a consolidation plan in which the number
of western European factories was reduced to four from 13. It is now on
target to cut worldwide manufacturing bases to just 10 from 30.
Observers believe more haircare acquisitions are likely which could be
slotted in to the group's established core manufacturing and distribution
business.
Accommodating 4711, a traditional family concern recently torn by filial
disputes over its direction, seems likely to be less straightforward.
According to statements yesterday from Mr Peter Zuhlsdorff, Wella chairman,
4711 is no cash cow and will require work.
While the business should more or less break even this year, he added it
would be some years before a steady stream of profits flowed.
While Gucci enjoys prestige status, the flagship eau de cologne name suffers
from a faded image, and famous name brands such as (Priscilla) Presley and
(Gabriella) Sabatini suffer notoriously from the transient nature of
sporting and showbusiness fame.
Even so, Mr Zuhlsdorff said the acquisition offered a great opportunity to
add to Wella's existing strength in central Europe and exploit more quickly
the growth opportunities offered in eastern Europe and Asia Pacific.
The main question raised by the latest deal is whether it will be followed
by more.
According to Mr Peter Harf, chief executive of the private Benckiser
cosmetics and consumer products group, there will be no shortage of bid
candidates or offers to sell in the next few years. He acknowledges
Unilever, L'Oreal and to a lesser extent P&amp;G, have scooped up dozens of
personal product brands in the past 10 years.
He said many industrial groups were reviewing their product portfolios in
the light of a sharp squeeze on margins since the turn of the decade.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Mannesmann shares slide as
Dieter faces inquiry

<TEXT>
Shares in Mannesmann, the German steel pipes to mobile phones group,
continued to suffer yesterday in the aftermath of allegations surrounding
the private business activities of Mr Werner Dieter, outgoing chairman of
the Mannesmann management board.
The shares dropped DM16.20 to DM410 (Dollars 216), nearly 4 per cent, after
it emerged that the Dusseldorf state prosecutors' office had launched a
preliminary investigation into allegations about Mr Dieter's affairs carried
in the latest issue of the Spiegel news magazine.
Shares in the Dusseldorf-based group have fallen from DM446 on Monday after
Der Spiegel alleged that a subsidiary of the Mannesmann group had been put
under pressure to buy components from Hydac, a company allegedly
majority-owned by Mr Dieter and his family, at prices higher than going
market rates.
The magazine claimed that Mannesmann, one of Germany's largest industrial
companies, had suffered losses running into millions of D-Marks as a result.
Mr Dieter, 64, has issued two statements, denying any impropriety and
claiming he told the Mannesmann supervisory board about his connection with
Hydac in 1968. All transactions between Hydac and Rexrodt, the Mannesmann
subsidiary at the centre of the allegations, were conducted on an arms'
length basis, Mr Dieter claimed.
The Dusseldorf state prosecutors' office said its investigations had not
yielded evidence of actions on Mr Dieter's part which could lead to a
prosecution. Mannesmann, itself based in Dusseldorf, said yesterday that it
had not heard from the prosecutor's office.
Mr Dieter, a tough manager credited with leading Mannesmann away from its
traditional steel pipes manufacturing activities to car components
production and telecommunications, alleged that he was a victim of a
carefully orchestrated smear campaign designed to block his promotion to
head of the Mannesmann supervisory board.
The group's annual meeting will vote on his move to the supervisory board
next month.
Mr F. Wilhelm Christians, the former Deutsche Bank chief executive who is
chairman of the Mannesmann supervisory board, has not yet made a public
response to Der Spiegel's allegations.
In spite of losses of DM513m last year, Mannesmann's shares have been among
the best performers of the past 18 months, reflecting foreign investors'
enthusiasm for the group's expansion into mobile telephones with its D2
network.

<TEXT>
Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry group, yesterday reported a brisk rise in
profits after financial items in the first four months of the year to FM151m
(Dollars 27.4m) from FM108m in the same period last year.
The improvement came in spite of a small fall in net sales to FM2.88bn from
FM3.02bn.
Metsa said delivery volumes for many products had risen sharply and prices
had also bottomed out, with the prices for market pulp, fine paper and sawn
goods in particular rising quite quickly. But some of the lift provided last
year by a sharp devaluation of the Finnish markka had been eroded by a
strengthening of the currency this year.
Operating profits for the paper and paperboard sector fell to FM56m from
FM193m, but Metsa said this reflected the start-up in January of a
film-coated offset production line at the Kirkniemi paper mill.
Operating profits for corrugated board, tissue and chemicals were down at
FM116m, compared with FM156m. But the sawn goods and pulp division saw
operating profits rise to FM112m from FM71m. Net financial expenses fell to
FM72m from FM249m.

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Suez completes sale of Victoire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suez, the French industrial and financial holding company, yesterday
completed the sale of Victoire, the insurance business, by agreeing terms
for the sale of the latter's Abeille Re reinsurance subsidiary to Scor,
France's largest reinsurance group, in a deal worth more than FFr2.1bn
(Dollars 368m).
The Abeille Re deal, which follows the announcement on Friday that Suez was
selling the rest of Victoire to the UK's Commercial Union, for FFr12.5bn, is
a complex cash and paper transaction that forms part of Suez's long-term
policy of rationalising its interests. Scor, which has in recent years
adopted an aggressive strategy in the reinsurance field, has agreed to pay
FFr1.4bn in cash for Abeille Re.
It will cede 19 per cent of its equity to Suez, which will then become its
second largest shareholder after Union des Assurances de Paris.
Mr Patrick Peugeot, chairman of Scor, valued the 19 per cent stake at
'somewhere between' the FFr700m market value of the shares and their FFr1bn
book value.
Mr Peugeot said the deal was 'completely compatible with our strategy of
increasing our market share and of strengthening our balance sheet'.
Abeille Re is a large force in French reinsurance with annual premium income
of FFr4bn.
The acquisition should enable Scor to increase its own premium income to
FFr15bn next year and to raise its share of the French market to about 17
per cent.
Mr Peugeot said it would become the world's fifth largest reinsurance group.
For Suez, the sale of Abeille Re and the rest of Victoire has left it with
FFr12bn to invest.
Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, said some of this capital would used to bolster
the finances of its banking subsidiaries - Banque Indosuez and Sofinco in
France, and Generale de Banque in Belgium.
The rest of the capital will be used to enable Suez to expand again by
making new investments, principally by buying majority or key holdings of at
least 20 per cent in industrial companies.
Mr Worms confirmed that he saw 1994 as a year of transition for Suez, which
in 1993 returned to the black with a net profit of FFr1.57bn after its first
loss in 1992. He anticipated more robust growth for 1995 with a 'significant
improvement' in the group's profitability.

Foreign institutions, led by Baring Brothers, have underwritten 47 per cent

The remaining 53 per cent has been underwritten by Portuguese institutions
led by Banco Fomento e Exterior, confirming that the state will raise at
least Es40bn (Dollars 229m).
The offer is seen as a test of investor interest in Portuguese
privatisations, ahead of sales of stakes in the telecommunications and power

FT  16 JUN 94 / International Company News: Vilmorin agrees to buy Suttons
Seeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Vilmorin, the French company which is the world leader in garden seeds,
yesterday continued its international expansion by agreeing to buy Suttons
Seeds in the UK from Volvo, the Swedish motor group.
The deal was for an undisclosed sum. It marks an important stage in
Vilmorin's development as Suttons is one of the oldest and best-known brand
names in the buoyant UK garden products market with a dominant share of the
seeds sector.
Vilmorin, which has seed interests in Germany, Spain and Italy, has for some
time been eager to expand into the UK. It seized its chance to win control
of Suttons when Procordia, the Volvo subsidiary that owns the company, put
it up for sale as part of a long-term policy of shedding peripheral
businesses.
Suttons, based at Torquay in Devon, claims 40 per cent of the UK garden seed
sales. The seed market has flourished in recent years thanks to the
heightened interest in gardening. Suttons in 1993 made net profits of Pounds
427,000 on turnover of Pounds 15m (Dollars 22.7m).
Procordia has for the past 18 months been in discussions with Vilmorin to
finalise the deal. The French group, which made static pre-tax profits of
FFr70m (Dollars 12.3m) on sales of FFr1.12bn in its last financial year to
June 30, won control of Suttons against offers from a number of UK
companies.
Mr Pierre Lefebvre, chief executive of Vilmorin, said the deal should enable
Suttons to improve its performance by accelerating its development under the
aegis of its new parent company. Vilmorin, which last autumn joined the
Paris secondary market, has a long-term strategy of heavy investment in
product development.
The group plans to increase sales in southern and eastern Europe. It intends
to expand into south-east Asia, notably Japan, although Mr Lefebvre said it
was difficult to find acquisitions in that market.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cause and effect of restructuring - UBS's
market share of equity business fell last year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In January this year London staff of UBS, part of the Union Bank of
Switzerland, stepped up to the fourth floor of the company's offices in
Broadgate to hear presentations from senior management.
In recent years they had become used to hearing news of market share gains.
The investment bank's share of institutional investors' cash equity business
leapt from 3 per cent in 1989 to 8 per cent in 1992 to make it one of the
City's top securities houses.
However, this January staff were greeted with a different message. UBS's
average market share had fallen to about 6 per cent last September, down
from UBS's perceived 'optimum level' of 8 per cent.
UBS ranked 'fifth or six overall in UK equities', Mr John Smith, head of UK
equities research, told his analysts.
At a time when a few very large institutions are dominating the fund
management industry, UBS was 'weak with large clients', he said.
Publicly, UBS blames this downturn on a restructuring that took place during
1993 and which is continuing this year.
A 'new global strategy' was being undertaken to turn UBS from 'conventional
stockbroking into a more integrated house', Mr Hector Sants, a UBS vice
chairman with responsibility for European equities, said.
It is trying to win more business from large fund management institutions
and change the role of analysts and sales staff from simple stock pushers to
advisers on strategy who can offer recommendations tailored to each client.
Such a refocusing was bound to hit UBS's market share in the short term, Mr
Sants said.
The firm had gone as far as it could with a conventional broking operation
with a narrower range of services. Restructuring was needed to facilitate
further gains.
However, former UBS managers disputed this description of orderly change and
said that Mr Sants' view of cause and effect should be reversed. 'Any
restructuring has been born from their horror at the drop off in business
from institutions,' said one former senior executive.
Evidence for that lay in the latest Greenwich Associates report, the highly
influential annual survey by the US-based consultancy of institutional
investors' views on the brokers that service them.
It found that the 53 largest institutions who pay more than Pounds 1m a year
in commission ranked UBS's research service joint seventh with Hoare Govett,
down from joint fourth last year.
The story was the same when smaller institutions, who UBS have traditionally
focused on, are included.
Overall the 135 institutions questioned, including the 53 largest, ranked
UBS seventh, down from fifth last year.
Competitiors believed that one factor for UBS has been the departure of
several senior executives, including Mr Terry Smith, head of UK research, in
1992.
Mr Sants said that staff changes had troubled UBS during 1993 but that the
restructuring had gone further than just personnel.
According to UBS documents, the staff were told in January that the company
wanted to be rated among the top three firms with all core clients and
attain a 'UK market share in high single figures'.
To achieve that UBS needed to 'focus on those clients who can reward the
full UBS service.'
This was described as a 'maximum of 50 clients, to be reviewed quarterly'.
Mr Sants said that a policy of offering a wide range of services to a
limited number of big institutional clients was not brand new. He also
believed that the focus carried no risk despite the firm's traditional
reliance on smaller institutions after its takeover of stockbroker Phillips
&amp; Drew in 1985.
However, one senior fund manager said that 'there is a real possibility that
UBS's refocusing of its services on people like me will leave them in
no-mans' land - yet to convince the big boys and having alienated their
smaller clients.'
Mr Sants rejected that. 'Smaller institutions will continue to receive what
they want, which we believe is a conventional stockbroker service.'
Mr Sants said that profitability had remained good during these changes and
that UBS's market share was now back up to 8 per cent after the 'temporary'
dip last September.
For larger clients Mr Sants said he was encouraging a change in the
traditional role of the analyst.
'The large institutions in general do not want stock pickers any more. They
want 'talking partners' who know the business and know the industry. What
they want to do with us is discuss options and get us to design solutions.'
The sales force is also affected. Mr Sants said he had been 'reorganising
sales to change salesmen from being ticket writers to account managers and
problem solvers'.
Another important part of the change process is aggressive exploitation of
UBS's triple A-rated balance sheet to push its derivatives business and
'total problem solving facilities' to institutional clients, according to Mr
Sants. UBS believes that larger clients now want tailor-made advice executed
through a sophisticated and broad product range.
Some of UBS's competitors said that strategy was sound but unlikely to mark
it out from the crowd. 'All that Hector has talked about we are doing
ourselves,' one said.
Outside analysts believe that UBS's focus is now more and more on
proprietary trading - where the bank takes positions on market movements
using its own capital - to compensate for declining customer business.
Mr Sants said that view may have emerged as a result of UBS offering its
clients more 'aggressive' use of derivatives. 'It is clear that banks such
as UBS, through the strength of their balance sheets, can differentiate
themselves in these difficult markets from competitors.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: HNV to convert Heron Intl debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Steven Green, head of HNV Acquisition, the US investor group negotiating
a bid for Heron International, yesterday confirmed the offer would convert
all the group's senior and junior debt into equity.
The group's other debt, much of which is tied to particular properties such
as the Pounds 80m linked to the Spanish properties and around Pounds 55m in
Heron's HCP division, would be taken on and restructured as necessary.
With the market valuing the Pounds 304m of senior debt at around 45p in the
pound, and the Pounds 74m of junior debt at about 6p in the pound, the bid
could put about Pounds 140m of equity into Heron.
Mr Green said he understood HNV's bid was higher than that from other
bidders, which Heron last week ruled out. He believed that he was offering a
premium because his plan envisaged retaining and investing in the group's
properties and building on the base Heron provided, rather than liquidating
the assets. He had looked at Heron to see what could be achieved if the
balance sheet was put on a sound basis.
He said that his group, which includes investors such as Mr Rupert Murdoch,
chairman of News International, and Mr Michael Milken's family trusts, had
put together sufficient money to allow all Heron's senior and junior
creditors to opt for cash. However, he expected many bondholders to take
equity instead.
One condition of the bid, however, is that HNV gains majority control of
Heron.
The investor group's cash was all equity with no borrowings, he said. It
also had funds to put more capital into Heron, for instance to develop the
properties to increase their value.
As yet HNV had not discussed Mr Gerald Ronson's future role at Heron or his
remuneration. However, Mr Green stressed that he regarded Mr Ronson's and
his team's knowledge of European property markets as an asset. He said that
his property experience was largely in the US and he recognised that local
knowledge was essential.
Aside from Heron's properties there are two trading business, a distribution
company and a car dealership.
Mr Green said his lawyers had taken a view on the possible cost of
litigation Heron was involved in and taken this into account in formulating
the bid.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: British Thornton advances 60%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Thornton Holdings, the packaging and specialist furniture group,
lifted profits by 60 per cent from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 2.11m pre-tax
during the 12 months to April 30.
The advance was achieved on turnover of Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 8.74m),
including Pounds 1.61m from the acquisition in September of Masterform, a
manufacturer of packaging and display materials.
Mr Brian North, chairman, said, however, that Masterform's profits - it
contributed just Pounds 13,000 at the operating level - had fallen well
short of expectations. 'Income arising from new orders in the second half is
encouraging but has not compensated for the income lost through the
cancellation last October by Sega of a large order for display units,' he
said.
The educational and scientific furniture operation swung into the black with
profits of Pounds 274,000 (losses of Pounds 317,000). The company plans
further investment in capital equipment to enlarge capacity.
After tax at 24.8 per cent, reflecting losses brought forward from previous
years, earnings per share improved to 11.4p (9.8p). A proposed final of 3.5p
lifts the total for the year by 1p to 6p.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Perkins buys Dorman Diesels in Dollars 50m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dorman Diesels, one of the oldest and most famous names in the diesel engine
industry, is being bought by Peterborough-based Perkins Group for about
Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.3m), including the assumption of Dollars 12m of debt.
The agreed deal, which is close to completion, has been under discussion for
five months and is the most important ownership change in the UK diesel
industry this decade.
It comes less than two months after Varity, Perkins' US parent, sold the
Massey Ferguson tractor business to concentrate on its core businesses of
Perkins diesel engines and Kelsey-Hayes automotive parts.
Dorman, established in Stafford in the 1870s, supplies high horsepower
diesel engines for the power generation market and is also at the forefront
of natural gas engine technology.
Part of English Electric in the 1960s, it was later absorbed into GEC, which
sold it in 1987 to Broadcrown Group, a private company based in Stone,
Staffordshire.
Broadcrown would not comment on the sale yesterday, beyond calling it a
'strategic disposal'. Dorman, which has 650 employees worldwide, most of
whom are based at Stafford and Lincoln, has seen profits rise in recent
years.
Pre-tax profits last year were about Pounds 3m, on turnover in excess of
Dollars 75m Perkins' sales last year were Dollars 702m.
Perkins approached Dorman as part of its strategic plan to expand its
product range, either through acquisitions and alliances, or through direct
investment in new products.
'One of the real attractions of Dorman was its product range, which is the
newest in its power band,' said Mr Tony Gilroy, chief executive of Perkins.
Perkins offers engines from five to 1,500 bhp. The Dorman engines extend the
range to 2,500 bhp and will enable Perkins to move quickly into power
generation, a key growth sector of the diesel engine market, and natural gas
engines.
The deal will also bolster Perkins' expansion plans in south-east Asia,
where Dorman has built a significant presence.
Dorman Diesels will be renamed Perkins Engines (Stafford) although the
Dorman name will be retained in some markets for the time being.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Bristol Water higher at Pounds 8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bristol Water Holdings raised pre-tax profits by 18 per cent from Pounds
6.8m to Pounds 8.01m in the year ended March 31.
Turnover grew 15 per cent to Pounds 59.9m. The core water business accounted
for Pounds 54.6m - a 6 per cent rise - largely benefiting from a permitted
price rise of 4.5 per cent above inflation.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 76p (73.9p) and a final dividend of
22.4p is recommended for an increased total for the year of 33.5p (31p).
Attributable profits came out 3 per cent higher at Pounds 5.51m, some 58 per
cent of which will be retained for reinvestment in the core business.
Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 22m (Pounds 17m). The company's
principal investment continues to be a large development at Purton Treatment
Works which is due for completion later this year. Work has also started on
two other significant contracts to improve water quality at treatment works
in the southern part of the supply area.
Sir John Wills, chairman, said the completion of these projects would mark
the end of a period when Bristol had invested over Pounds 40m in large
schemes at water treatment works. Capital spending would start to fall from
its current peak, but would remain at a 'relatively high level'.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Morrison rises to Pounds 5m despite tough
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Morrison Construction, the privately-owned construction
company, increased by 56 per cent from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 5.1m, despite
what Mr Fraser Morrison, chairman, described as 'continuing difficult market
conditions.'
Turnover in the year to March 31 increased by 6 per cent, from Pounds 208m
to Pounds 220m.
The company, which operates throughout Britain, obtained about 5 per cent of
sales abroad, principally from Kuwait, Bahrain and eastern Europe.
Morrison, based in Edinburgh, increased profits before interest in its
building and property development division, which accounts for 41 per cent
of sales, from Pounds 2m to Pounds 4.5m.
But its civil engineering division, making up 39 per cent of sales, lost
Pounds 900,000 (profit of Pounds 1m), which Mr Morrison attributed to
unsettled claims against clients on road contracts in a market where margins
were very tight.
The utility and energy division, and the housing division, which operates
only in Scotland, virtually doubled their profits before interest.
Mr Morrison said the company's broad base could absorb losses in the civil
engineering division.
Its success was founded on its commitment to quality, on its development of
trained staff and on building closer relationships with clients.
He said firmer signs of economic recovery boded well for the construction
industry.
Shareholders funds rose 25 per cent to Pounds 15m; the company has net cash
of Pounds 11.9m.
Morrison is largely family owned. Mr Morrison said the long-term objective
was to become a quoted group 'in some shape or form' but there were no
current plans to do so.
'We will react to the right opportunity when it comes along,' he said.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Placing at 150p for CPL Aromas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CPL Aromas, the fragrance and flavour manufacturing company, yesterday
announced a placing price of 150p to raise Pounds 4m net from its flotation
in a week's time.
The float, sponsored by Credit Lyonnais Laing, involves the placing and
employee offer of 4.18m shares which will bring the total number of shares
in issue to 10.88m.
The family of Mr Terry Pickthall, founder and chairman, will hold 36.4 per
cent of the shares, down from 57 per cent prior to the flotation. Ensign
Trust, wholly owned by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund, will own a
further 17 per cent.
CPL's market capitalisation at the placing price will be Pounds 16.3m. A
month ago the company predicted its value would be up to Pounds 20m.
The historic p/e multiple at the placing price was 12.2 based on earnings
per share for the year to March of 12.3p. The notional gross dividend yield
is 2.5 per cent.
Mr Pickthall said Pounds 2m of the money raised would be used to develop a
new plant on Teesside to manufacture aroma chemicals. He said aromatic
ingredients were an important growth area and the plant would develop the
company's capacity.
Aromatic ingredients account for 40 per cent of group turnover, compared to
60 per cent from fragrance and flavours. In the year to March, pre-tax
profits stood at Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.1m) on turnover of Pounds 17.3m
(Pounds 14.8m).
The balance of the proceeds will be used for working capital. Mr Pickthall
said priorities include developing the company's position in the own-brand
market.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wiseman jumps 61% to Pounds 5.13m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish liquid milk processor and distributor,
yesterday reported a 61 per cent jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.19m
to Pounds 5.13m for the year to April 2.
This was slightly ahead of the Pounds 5.09m forecast made at the time of its
flotation in March.
Turnover rose 30 per cent to Pounds 59.7m. Mr Alan Wiseman, chairman, said
the company enjoyed strong volume growth due to its position as a leading
supplier to multiple retailers.
Competitive pressures arising from multiple retailers' fresh milk pricing
policies had assisted volume growth at the expense of gross margin.
Earnings were 7.22p (4.58p) or 6.64p (6.14p) before exceptional and
non-recurring items. No dividend is proposed, but interim and final payments
are anticipated for the current year.
The company announced the sale of Gossesslie Farm, for Pounds 1.83m, which
was recently acquired as part of the Pounds 8.1m purchase of Juronom, the
parent company of Kennerty Farm Dairies.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Mansfield ahead to Pounds 14.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lower interest charges helped Mansfield Brewery to raise full-year pre-tax
profits by 15 per cent from Pounds 12.5m to Pounds 14.4m. This was despite a
slight fall in beer volume on a like-for-like basis.
The company said this year so far was 'nicely ahead' of last year, largely
because of better summer weather and strong growth in its cask ales.
In the 53 weeks to April 2, draught beer volume increased by 1.2 per cent,
with a 2.5 per cent rise in ales offset by a 2.9 per cent drop in lager. On
a 52 week basis, however, total beer volume was down by 1 per cent.
Mr Paul Handley, finance director, said the drop in lager sales was in line
with the market. On-trade sales of standard lagers in the UK market had
fallen by 5.5 per cent in the year, compared with a fall of 4.2 per cent in
beer overall.
Standard lager in pubs appeared 'to have reached its penetration level,' he
said. Mansfield sells McEwans lager from Scottish &amp; Newcastle and Foster's
from Courage.
The main growth area, Mansfield said, was cask beer. Riding bitter had shown
strong growth, and the launch of Mansfield bitter and Old Baily strong ale
in cask had proved successful.
A review of the pub estate had resulted in a fall in book values of Pounds
12.6m, or 7 per cent of the total. As a result, and despite retained profit
of Pounds 7.6m, shareholders' funds fell from Pounds 143m to Pounds 139m. Mr
Handley claimed the fall in pub values was temporary. 'We already have
evidence of a pick-up in the market,' he said.
On sales of Pounds 121m (Pounds 118m), operating profits were up 3 per cent
at Pounds 19.2m.
Interest charges were 21 per cent lower, as a result of higher operating
cash flow and lower interest rates.
After a tax charge of 27 per cent (30 per cent) earnings per share increased
to 16.39p (13.95p). The full-year dividend is raised by 14 per cent to 4.4p
via a final of 3.15p.
Mansfield's shares rose 8p to 203p.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Textiles side behind 21% rise at Hicking
Pentecost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further 'excellent progress' by the textiles division helped Hicking
Pentecost report pre-tax profits ahead 21 per cent for the year to the end
of March. There was a slight improvement in the industrial products side.
For the present year the company expects further improvement with important
contributions from the recent acquisitions of Alan Paine, a knitwear
company, and Barbour Campbell, the industrial thread business.
For the year profits were Pounds 3.44m (Pounds 2.85m) on turnover up 20 per
cent at Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 29.5m). Earnings per share were 14p (11.6p). A
second interim dividend of 3.05p was declared on April 28, for a total of
4.6p (4p).
The textiles division reported sales up 13 per cent and operating profits
rose by 24 per cent with margins improving from 11.3 per cent to 12.5 per
cent. Alan Paine contributed sales of Pounds 350,000, incurring operating
losses of Pounds 136,000 reflecting the seasonality of the business.
Mr John Lister is retiring as chairman at the annual meeting. He will be
replaced by Mr Hamish Grossart, who has been a non-executive director since
October 1991.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: London Scottish up 34% on consumer loan
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rise in demand for consumer loans and an increased share of debt
collection business helped London Scottish Bank, the consumer credit
company, to increase pre-tax profits by 34 per cent from Pounds 2.01m to
Pounds 2.7m in the half-year to April 26.
The interim dividend goes up 16.5 per cent to 1.2p (1.03p), after earnings
rose by 23 per cent to 3.2p (2.6p). Retentions were limited by a 62 per cent
rise in the tax charge as the balance of businesses shifted.
The bank, which specialises in small consumer loans, raised operating income
by 14 per cent to Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 14.2m) while costs rose by 10 per
cent. Mr Martin West, chief executive, said that it had continued to
increase productivity.
Profits from consumer credit rose to Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 903,000) while
debt collection profits rose to Pounds 827,000 (Pounds 562,000). Profits
from re-insurance of policies protecting customers against defaults on loan
payments fell to Pounds 388,000 (Pounds 547,000).
Mr West said that re-insurance profits fell because it was closing the 1990
year when recession had increased claims. The company was seeing steady
growth in loan demand.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Marston improves 16% in spite of flat
second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-based regional brewer, lifted
pre-tax profits by 16 per cent to Pounds 23.3m in the year to March 26.
However, second half profits were flat as a result of sharply increased
marketing costs on its Pedigree brand.
Volume sales of beer rose by 4.9 per cent in the year, compared with a
claimed fall of 2 per cent across the industry. Sales of Pedigree bitter
rose by 7 per cent, while the Low 'C brand of low-calorie bottled beer was
ahead by 12 per cent. Food sales in the group's pubs were up by 28 per cent.
Mr David Gordon, managing director, said the rise in underlying trading
profit had been fairly level throughout the year.
However, Pedigree and Low 'C had been heavily advertised outside Marston's
native Central TV region in the second half, with the annual advertising
bill up 87 per cent at Pounds 2.9m, of which Pounds 2m was spent on
Pedigree.
The rise in group beer volume was attributable to sales to other brewers and
the free trade, Mr Gordon said. Beer sales to Marston's own pubs were
slightly down, with a rise in managed pubs more than offset by a fall in the
tenanted estate.
Capital expenditure for the year was Pounds 36m, compared with Pounds 19m.
Balance sheet gearing rose from 7.2 per cent to 8.8 per cent. A total of 53
new pubs were bought, 46 of them managed, while 22 pubs were sold.
Marston said that in its tenanted estate, there was 'an increasing divide
between houses which clearly have a profitable future and those which may
not.' Volume sales of beer to tenanted houses fell by 7 per cent in the
year.
On group sales of Pounds 142.8m, against Pounds 127.7m, operating profits
were up 10.5 per cent at Pounds 24.9m.
Interest payments doubled to Pounds 1.1m.
After tax of Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 5.4m), earnings per share were up 16 per
cent at 19.21p (16.55p). The dividend is raised 10.4 per cent to 5.96p, via
a final of 4.36p.
Marston's shares were unchanged at 270p.
Mr Michael Hurdle, chairman, said that while market conditions were likely
to remain difficult, further growth was expected this year.
COMMENT
Assuming a similar rise in profits this year to about Pounds 26m, the shares
are on about 13 times earnings. Despite the unfashionable status of the
brewers, this could be a bargain. Marston has an asset which bigger rivals
would pay dearly for: its Pedigree bitter brand, which has long since broken
its regional boundaries. It has also stitched up a series of deals with the
big brewers which gives the brand national distribution. It is encouraging
to note that Whitbread's disposal of a large block of shares in March has
been easily digested, with the shares slightly outperforming the market
since then.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: London Electricity at Pounds 187m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Electricity, the power distributor for the capital, warned yesterday
that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission may be asked to adjudicate over
the current regulatory review as it announced pre-tax profits ahead from
Pounds 145.5m to Pounds 186.5m and a 15 per cent dividend increase.
Mr Roger Urwin, chief executive, said: 'Any company which does not consider
going to the MMC as a possibility is not being particularly prudent.
'If it is decided that a company is a loser from the review and the market
responds then that company's directors are in a difficult position.
Shareholders will want a very good reason for the directors accepting the
outcome.'
Sir Bob Reid, chairman, said the company looked forward to 'regulatory
proposals which would enable the company to continue to deliver a proper
balance of benefits between shareholders and customers and to sustain the
appropriate levels of investment in our infrastructure'.
In the year to March 31, London made operating profit of Pounds 171.5m
(Pounds 152.3m) on turnover of Pounds 1.31bn (Pounds 1.37bn).
Dividends totalled 22.5p (19.5p) after a proposed final of 15.1p, payable
from earnings of 65p (56.9p before exceptional items).
The improved pre-tax performance was helped by the closure of retailing
(Pounds 28m) and a Pounds 10m increase in the contribution from private
distribution, including the airports business bought from BAA.
The contribution from regulated businesses also increased by Pounds 2m,
helped by a cut of 310, or 4 per cent, in the headcount.
London also said there was welcome evidence of a revival in the economy with
the main business showing a 1.3 per cent increase in units distributed.
Growth in the large commercial sector was particularly noticeable.
Capital expenditure rose from Pounds 86.9m to Pounds 104.2m
The company is to seek shareholders' permission to buy 10 per cent of its
shares in the market. It also announced that it had signed a contract worth
more than Pounds 10m to supply electricity to 16 Cadbury Schweppes sites.
COMMENT
London's share price fall - down 16p to 571p - owed more to Ofgas's
announcement on rates of return for British Gas - and its perceived
implications for the power sector - rather than anything fundamental in the
figures yesterday. Certainly the City had little to complain about. A steady
approach to job reductions has helped to cut out about Pounds 30m of annual
costs over the last four years. Strong cash generation means that in spite
of increased capital costs there is little danger of the company moving into
serious debt in the next year. That gives it scope to pull off more
acquisitions, no bad thing provided it can find companies of the quality of
the BAA business which is already chipping in profits above expectations and
is liked by the City because it is so close in type to the core. Assuming a
25.4p dividend for this year, the shares were yesterday trading on a
prospective yield of about 5.5, a slightly poorer rating than average for
the sector. But with so much uncertainty about future regulation, it may be
a month or two before the shares move upwards.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Shoprite committed to expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shoprite said yesterday that it was pressing ahead with aggressive expansion
plans, in spite of the collapse of a property deal and poor results which
have knocked 93p off its share price in three weeks.
Assurances from the discount grocer came amid calls from institutional
investors for a management shake-up.
The Isle of Man-based discounter, which operates mainly in Scotland, said on
Tuesday that a sale and leaseback deal on 11 supermarkets with Allied Dunbar
and Edge Investments had fallen through.
The loss of a resulting Pounds 1.29m surplus meant that the group's pre-tax
profit figures for the six months to May 1 - which it rushed out ahead of
schedule last month because they were below expectations - fell from Pounds
2.74m to Pounds 1.44m.
Shoprite's shares have fallen from 144p to 51p since the results.
Mr David Webster, joint managing director, said Shoprite originally had
hoped to conclude the deal last Friday, and announce results tomorrow. He
defended the decision to include the deal when it brought forward its
results, saying that Shoprite had assurances from advisers that it appeared
to be on course.
He said the decision by Allied Dunbar and Edge to pull out came without
warning. Both refused to give reasons, but analysts believe that the
disappointing results may have raised doubts about the quality of Shoprite's
covenants.
Mr Webster said the group would still seek a leaseback deal on the stores,
but was 'letting the dust settle'.
He blamed the profits fall, in spite of 20 store openings, partly on
'cannibalisation' of sales. That was caused by the decision to open many new
stores near to existing ones, to squeeze out new entrants.
Shoprite's customers, primarily in the C2DE bracket, had been hit harder
than others by tax increases, preventing the usual uplift in grocery sales
in March and April.
Moreover, large superstore chains had responded to growing discount
competition with aggressive pricing campaigns.
Unlike 1993, when spring price cuts by Shoprite brought volume increases,
similar moves had not lifted sales this year.
Mr Webster said he was confident of a better performance in the second half,
through better buying, cost reductions, aggressive marketing, and a shift in
its 30-store opening programme into new areas.
That may not comfort institutional shareholders who are demanding board
changes. Shoprite directors recently visited main shareholders, but failed
to mention any problems with the property deal.
'They told us they had made mistakes in the past, but they had learnt from
them,' said one. 'But just a few days later they announce this. I will never
be able to believe them again.'
Another called for 'two new independent executive directors' on Shoprite's
board.
BZW, joint broker to the discounter, hinted yesterday that it would raise
the issue of management changes.
'We will be talking to the company and reviewing the situation in the light
of what has happened,' said Mr Philip Remnant, managing director of UK
corporate finance at BZW.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Provisions hold back CE Heath to Pounds
11.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Provisions against losses on Australian workers' compensation business held
back pre-tax profits at CE Heath, the insurance broker, in the year to March
31.
After exceptional items pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds
1.5m restated). The new provisions have arisen as a result of a judgment
earlier this month by the Australian High Court which overturned earlier
lower court decisions in favour of a Heath subsidiary and other insurers
against the Victorian Accident Compensation Commission.
'The decision has been a totally unexpected and unwelcome shock and has
clouded what would have been an excellent result,' said Mr Michael Kier,
chairman.
As a result of the ruling CE Heath Underwriting and Insurance will not be
entitled to recover certain amounts from the commission and a provision of
ADollars 50m (Pounds 22.8m) has been established.
Operating profits increased marginally to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 7.1m). Profit
from the sale of part of the company's stake in another Australian
subsidiary, Heath International Holdings, amounted to Pounds 4.3m.
Broking profits increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 15.4m).
Business from London market reinsurance declined but there was growth of UK
wholesale, international facultative and some other operations.
Profits from underwriting increased to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 7m). These
include the contribution of Heath International Holdings, the Australian
underwriting operation in which Heath had a 23 per cent stake. The sale
proceeds were ADollars 45m, of which Pounds 11m has been used to repay some
medium-term borrowings.
Computer services profits rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 5.3m.
Losses per share were cut to 0.6p (22.5p). The dividend is held at 16p with
an unchanged 11p final.
COMMENT
The markets had already taken on the news of new Australian provisions at
Heath and after last week's sharp fall, the share price rose yesterday. The
good news is that the core broking operations appear to be in a relatively
healthy state, with expenses under control and some attractive growth
possibilities in a number of markets. Pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 33m
should be possible over the next 12 months. Investors can only hope there
are no further surprises in store and decide whether the prospective p/e of
about 12 - a lower rating than other comparable insurance brokers - is an
adequate reflection of the extra risk.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Non-core losses hit Thames Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thames Water, the largest of the privatised water companies, announced a 4
per cent fall from Pounds 251.3m to Pounds 241.7m in pre-tax profits for the
year to March 31 after losses in contracting and restructuring costs.
Turnover rose from Pounds 1.04bn to Pounds 1.09bn, including Pounds 52.9m
from acquisitions.
There was an exceptional charge of Pounds 35m. Losses on Egyptian contracts
acquired in 1988, which were revealed at the half-year stage, cost Pounds
25m. Restructuring non-core companies in the UK, US, Germany and Asia also
produced one-off costs.
Sir Robert Clarke, who has just taken over as chairman, said yesterday: 'The
situation is now completely clean and clear.'
Overall the non-core businesses, on which Thames has spent some Pounds 170m
in acquisition costs and investment, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds
40.5m.
International and process contracting businesses suffered from poor economic
conditions abroad, with a fall in turnover to Pounds 120m ( Pounds 182m).
Sir Robert said: 'Conditions have been particularly difficult in Germany.
The east German economy has not exactly been buoyant.'
Turnover in products and services rose to Pounds 105m (Pounds 62m) partly
because of the addition of businesses acquired from Simon Engineering,
although UK industrial demand continued to be weak.
With commercial and industrial demand for water services also weak, turnover
in the core business rose 7.5 per cent to Pounds 872m (Pounds 811m) by price
increases.
Excluding depreciation and infrastructure renewal, operating costs in the
utilities arm rose by 0.7 per cent. Like other large water companies, Thames
has continued to reduce staff numbers, which fell by 488 - 6.6 per cent - to
an average 6,893 during the year.
However, the capital spending programme to modernise the infrastructure and
meet new environmental regulations and which absorbed Pounds 359m last year,
also pushed up depreciation in the core business to Pounds 73m (Pounds 60m)
and group net interest charges to Pounds 44.5m, compared with Pounds 29.9m.
Net debt at the year end was Pounds 671m (Pounds 516m), for gearing of 37
per cent (31 per cent).
Although earnings per share fell by 4.4 per cent to 56.8p, compared with
59.3p, dividends are increased by 7 per cent to 22.5p (21p) with a
recommended final of 15.1p.
In the present year, Thames expects its non-core businesses to break even
after paying for acquisition costs, and said its order book was running at
more than Pounds 150m. Sir Robert said: 'The recession is not completely
over but there are some glimmerings of improvement.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Southern Business shares dive 32p on
cautious outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Southern Business Group, the photocopier and vending machines
supplier, dived by 32p to 42p after the company announced a sharp fall in
interim profits.
Pre-tax profits for the six months ended March 31 fell by 56 per cent to
Pounds 3.14m (Pounds 7.2m), and the company remained 'cautious as to the
trading outlook'.
Analysts reduced full-year forecasts by up to Pounds 5m from the previous
consensus of Pounds 12.5m.
The profits fall reflected disappointing sales and what the company
described as a one-off Pounds 900,000 sales cost.
The photocopier supply industry was subject to an Office of Fair Trading
report in March, which responded to concerns over long-term leasing
contracts with a call for wide ranging changes in the industry.
SBG made a Pounds 3m provision for the renegotiation of contracts last year,
and Mr David McErlain, chief executive, said the company had fully
anticipated the report's recommendations.
No further provisions were considered necessary at the interim stage.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 26.9m, down from Pounds 29.4m, reflecting an
increasingly competitive market. Mr McErlain said sales were satisfactory
for the first quarter, but in the second quarter they had collapsed
inexplicably to about one quarter of their budgeted rate.
There was a short-fall between sales levels and sales staffing costs, and
consequently a sales cost of Pounds 900,000 has been included in the interim
figures. This would usually have been capitalised as an intangible asset, to
reflect the long-term revenues derived from each sale.
In addition, the shortening of some leasing contracts after renegotiation
contributed to a Pounds 914,000 increase in amortisation costs.
Mr McErlain said market conditions suggested a likely consolidation within
the industry. SBG would consider acquisitions, or a partnership with a major
distributor; the company has cash balances of Pounds 4.3m.
Following the OFT report, contract and price expectations within the
industry were being lowered. SBG now expects to achieve profit margins of
about 15 per cent, half their level at the peak of the market.
Earnings per share dropped 56 per cent from 4.99p to 2.18p, but the interim
dividend is maintained at 1.27p.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Placing puts Pounds 51m tag on Chesterton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chesterton International has successfully placed 20.56m shares in spite of
the stock market slump. However, the deal was priced at 100p, the minimum
price under the company's agreement with existing shareholders who are
selling through the offer.
The placing will value the property agency at Pounds 51.2m, making it
marginally larger than its main listed competitor, Debenham Tewson &amp;
Chinnocks, which is valued at Pounds 50.7m.
Mr Giles Ballantine, chief executive, said: 'We are genuinely very pleased.'
The company had targeted a flotation with a value of Pounds 50m and achieved
it amid dwindling demand for new issues.
Based on forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.1m, the shares are being
issued on a p/e ratio of 14.1 and notional gross yield of 4.13 per cent,
based on the dividend that would have been paid had the company been listed
for the year.
The pricing reflected the volatile nature of agency business, given the
reliance on people rather than fixed assets, but the company provides
greater stability through its focus on management fees, rather than
brokerage commissions.
Chesterton was wholly-owned by former and current employees, and of the
placement shares, 12.25m have been sold by former employees or those within
2 years of retirement, while a further 3.3m have come from current
employees.
A further 5m have been issued by the company, which will raise Pounds 4m net
of expenses to help pay down its overdraft and provide funds for
acquisition.
A number of 'significant' institutions have taken discloseable stakes in
Chest-erton, via the private plac-ing.
The issue was sponsored by Robert Fleming, with Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull as broker.
Share dealing will commence on June 23.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Allders rises to Pounds 12m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maiden interim results from Allders, the department store and tax and duty
free retail group which floated last year, showed a strong advance in
profits.
Pro-forma pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 11.7m in the
half-year to March 31.
The shares, which were priced at 170p last October, closed up 3p yesterday
at 227p.
Lord Prior, chairman, backed up the numbers with an optimistic statement
saying 'conditions in all our markets are better than we have experienced
for several years'.
An interim dividend of 2.2p is 8 per cent higher than the level indicated in
the prospectus, which said the 1993 dividend would have been 6.1p, with one
third paid in the first half.
Group sales in the six months rose 10 per cent to Pounds 357m, and operating
profits increased from Pounds 10m to Pounds 12.1m.
An extra trading week in the comparable period added Pounds 1.2m to
department store operating profits, while the current year benefited from a
Pounds 700,000 write back of an over-conservative provision made for
flotation costs. The underlying rise in profits was 14 per cent.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 400,000. Earnings per share
were 9p (7.7p).
The first half includes the important Christmas period for the department
stores. Adjusting for the extra week, underlying profits were 16 per cent up
at Pounds 10.4m, on sales of Pounds 167m, up 7 per cent on the adjusted
basis.
In the tax and duty free division profits jumped from Pounds 700,000 to
Pounds 1.9m. However, this was boosted by a shift of Pounds 1.8m from the
second half to the first under a new agreement with BAA, the UK airport
operator.
A Pounds 2.5m loss in North America (profit Pounds 100,000) was blamed on
dull trading, plus Pounds 700,000 of closure costs for the San Francisco
airport store, and also the effect on Canadian sales of a reduction in
tobacco duty.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Stirling in red after exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stirling Group, the clothing manufacturer which supplies Marks and Spencer,
fell into the red at the year-end after exceptional items of Pounds 4.31m
following the disposal of its brand and import divisions.
Pre-tax losses stood at Pounds 798,000 in the year to March 31, against
profits of Pounds 5.13m last year, on turnover down from Pounds 100.8m to
Pounds 95.2m.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 5.84m to Pounds 3.76m after losses from
the discontinued operations of Pounds 1.69m (profits Pounds 585,000).
Stirling disposed of its brand business, which makes underwear and swimwear,
in December. A decision to sell the lossmaking imports division was made
shortly after the abrupt departure of Mr Peter Sheldon, the former chairman
and chief executive, in January because of differences of opinion over the
direction of the division.
Mr Robert Coe, non-executive chairman since Mr Sheldon's departure, said he
was confident that the decision to focus the company's efforts on its core
business as clothing supplier to M&amp;S 'would be justified by the trading
results'.
The return on sales in the core contract division grew from 7.2 to 7.6 per
cent. Mr Steven Bentwood, chief executive, said Stirling would pursue growth
through sales and product design. The autumn programme for M&amp;S was running
ahead of last year, he said.
Losses per share emerged at 1.39p (earnings 3.92p). However, the proposed
final dividend is unchanged at 1.35p, for a total of 1.9p (1.85p).
Mr Coe said the costs of withdrawing from the two businesses had been
provided for fully in this year's accounts. Following the disposals Stirling
had Pounds 2.9m net cash compared with Pounds 2.3m net borrowings a year
ago.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Debate reopens on accountants' insolvency role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The head of a quoted British company yesterday launched an attack on the
process by which investigating accountants appointed by banks are permitted
to take on the receiverships of the businesses they examine.
In a letter published in the FT today, Mr John Jackson, chairman of Brown &amp;
Jackson, the owner of the loss-making Poundstretcher retail chain which was
recently rescued by the South African group Pepkor, described as
'objectionable' the practice of banks telling investigating accountants that
they would be appointed receivers.
Investigating accountants are typically appointed by banks to analyse a
company's viability and to advise on whether continued financial support is
justified. If it is not, the banks can appoint the same firm as receivers.
Mr Jackson also expressed concern about situations in which these
accountants are invited by appointing banks to discuss how a potential
receivership might proceed. He called for the Bank of England and the
professional accountancy bodies to examine the issues raised in the
interests of 'the business community'.
The remarks emanate from the company's own experiences. Midland Bank is
believed to have commissioned Arthur Andersen as investigating accountants
early last year. The directors of Brown &amp; Jackson are expected to reiterate
their concerns next week in the company's annual report. They had already
criticised their creditor banks.
Mr Jackson said yesterday: 'Where lenders and reporting accountants can
exercise considerable economic power, on the face of it there may be some
dangerous conflicts of interest.'
His comments are likely to rekindle the debate on a subject which has been
raised before by company directors and investors. In March the British
Chambers of Commerce mentioned it in a submission to the Department of Trade
and Industry on reforms to insolvency law. It asked whether there should be
a clearer division of roles, arguing that there may be conflicts of interest
between the banks, other creditors and management.
It stressed that it had not discovered any evidence of accountants
recommending that a business be put into insolvency to generate more work.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Glaxo faces new era as Girolami goes: Knight who reshaped
the drugs industry steps down after 25 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Paul Girolami, who brought US-style revenues - and salaries - to the UK
pharmaceuticals industry, is stepping down as chairman of Glaxo.
His gives up executive powers at the end of this month - Glaxo's financial
year-end - after a quarter of a century on the board, the last nine years as
chairman. He will leave the board, and his Pounds 1.4m annual pay package,
at the annual meeting on November 18 by which time a replacement
non-executive chairman should have been chosen. His departure marks a change
in the company's direction.
The past 13 years growth have moved Glaxo from a diversified also-ran to a
tightly focused prescription drugs group at the top of the industry. The
next few years are likely to be shaped by government healthcare reforms that
are depressing profit margins across the industry.
Sir Paul leaves a business accustomed to sustained profits growth. He became
chief executive in 1980, a year before the launch of ulcer treatment Zantac,
now the world's biggest selling drug. Glaxo emerged from a period of
declining fortunes in the late 1970s so rapidly that, by 1983, annual
profits growth of more than 50 per cent was greeted with disappointment.
He brought an unprecedented emphasis on marketing to the scientific world of
drug prescribing. Zantac sales rapidly overtook SmithKline's ulcer treatment
Tagamet, even though the medical difference between the two products was
small.
He became chairman in 1985 and committed the company to a culture of
self-sufficiency and organic growth. Prepared to be autocratic in style, he
clashed with, and removed, two chief executives between 1989 and 1993.
Today, Zantac sales are more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) a year and still
rising. The company has at least two new drugs whose annual sales are
forecast by analysts to surpass Dollars 1bn each within five years.
Yet Glaxo's prospects are less certain than at any time since the 1970s.
Changes in healthcare management, designed to control public spending, have
prompted other giants of the industry to reorientate themselves.
Glaxo knows that the days of self-sufficiency and organic growth are over.
'No one should be in any doubt that the future will be very different,' said
Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, yesterday. 'We face enormous change in
the way our industry operates.'
The change in direction has already started. Glaxo has signed a deal with US
company Warner-Lambert to sell its drugs in the non-prescription
over-the-counter market. In March this year, Sir Richard said that further
deals would be signed in the US.
Another part of the company's response was revealed yesterday. Sir Paul's
one-man rule is apparently giving way to a triumvirate of Sir Richard, the
yet-to-be-named non-executive chairman, and Dr Franz Humer, 47, who was
appointed chief operating director last year.
Glaxo is likely to find it tough to recruit a non-executive chairman weighty
enough to balance Sir Richard's mastery of both the science and craft of
running a drugs company. Earlier this year, Wellcome gave up the hunt for a
chairman to succeed Sir Alastair Frame and allowed Mr John Robb to annoy
some institutional investors by becoming both chairman and chief executive.
Sir Paul's job was, in retrospect, mainly to manage growth. Whoever takes
over will face the more complex task of changing the course of a healthcare
supertanker steaming towards an uncertain future.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Berlusconi empire undergoes untangling: A look at the
reorganisation of the Italian prime minister's debt-laden businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reorganisation of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's extensive and debt-encumbered
business empire is probably as challenging as sorting out Italy's budgetary
morass.
In the prime minister's private affairs, a start has been made. The public
offer in the flotation of 53 per cent of his publishing interests,
Mondadori, is launched today. The L990bn (Pounds 408m) proceeds will cut
debt at Mr Berlusconi's main holding company, Fininvest, Italy's biggest
media group and one of its three biggest private sector companies. Net
borrowings stood at L3,800bn at the end of 1993, or around L4,500bn gross.
The Mondadori sale is, however, the easiest part of the Fininvest
restructuring. It already had a stock market quotation and was therefore
less opaque than other Berlusconi businesses. Acquired in 1991,it had
retained some financial and managerial autonomy.
Nonetheless, Mr Franco Tato, who was moved from Mondadori to become
Fininvest's managing director in October, sees the publishing company's
flotation as the model for untangling the group. The aim is that, within
three years, Fininvest will become a holding company, with a tiny staff,
owning stakes of around 50 per cent in independent quoted companies.
'The financial services business (insurance and investment products) will
probably be floated, with us selling around 50 per cent of the shares' this
year or early next,' Mr Tato said. Disposal of the TV interests would come
last in the process. The timetable and disposal method for the supermarket
chain Standa are less certain, because it requires substantial investment in
its delapidated stores.
This radical reorganisation is necessary because Fininvest expanded too fast
in the late 1980s and early 1990s, taking on too much debt at the onset of
recession. After-tax profits last year, yet to be disclosed, were similar to
the previous year's L21.1bn - trivial in relation to turnover of around
L11,600bn.
Fininvest would probably have incurred losses under more conservative
accounting policies, according to analysts. They say there is a case for the
group making bigger provisions to cover depreciation of its TV and film
rights - booked at L1,900bn in the year-end balance sheet.
Analysts' concerns have also been prompted by Fininvest's auditor Arthur
Andersen who criticised the 1992 accounts for failing to include adequate
provisions against three contingent liabilities:
a L172bn potential tax liability on capital gains, although Fininvest is
confident this will never be crystallised;
the risk of losses on a L92bn exposure to Telepiu, a pay television station.
However, Mr Oliver Novick, Fininvest's director for corporate strategy, said
the main difficulty for the group was not so much the magnitude of
liabilities and borrowings, but the location of debt. 'The problem is that
most of the debt is in the top company, while the cash flow is in the
operating companies,' said Mr Tato.
In Italy there is no concept of consolidated profit in tax law. Each company
within a group is assessed for tax separately. So it is tax inefficient for
Fininvest to have interest and other costs in its top company and cash flows
in other companies.
In the past, Mr Berlusconi attempted to minimise the tax burden by creating
new companies, so that losses generated in one business could offset profits
elsewhere.
The result, however, was a proliferation of legal entities. When Mr Tato
arrived in October, there were 380 companies in the group, many of them
offshore vehicles.
The reorganisation is further complicated by substantial intercompany loans.
Surplus cash was lodged with an internal 'bank', Istifi. Standa had L600bn
of deposits with Istifi at the end of last year. Even the financial services
businesses had deposits with Istifi, though smaller than Standa's. 'We have
agreed we will no longer administer deposits (or take loans) from Standa,'
said Mr Tato.
Fininvest's management is also burdened with requests for information from
magistrates, who are investigating allegations that Fininvest or companies
linked to it may have been involved in paying bribes to politicians or in
other forms of malpractice. 'We have provided magistrates with 800,000
photocopies of our documents,' Mr Tato said. 'There were 52 visits from the
financial police last year.' The allegations relate to a period before Mr
Tato became managing director. Mr Berlusconi appointed him in response to
pressure from bankers.
Having become prime minister, Mr Berlusconi has now delegated day-to-day
decision making to Mr Tato. But his departure has in some ways weakened him.
If Mr Tato faces opposition to his plans from long-serving Fininvest
executives, he can no longer call on Berlusconi's backing. He said: 'I
consult Mr Berlusconi only on matters concerning his position as the
majority shareholder'.

FT  16 JUN 94 / NFC disappoints with interim Pounds 49m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in NFC, the transport and logistics company, fell almost 10 per cent
after the group reported slightly lower than expected interim profits. The
shares closed 21p down at 198p.
The group also announced that it had decided to retain its loss-making Lynx
parcels business as talks had fallen through with a number of potential
purchasers.
Pre-tax profits for the group, which is often viewed as a bellwether of
economic activity, declined to Pounds 49m in the 28 weeks to April 16, down
from Pounds 86.6m in the previous period which included a Pounds 50m
exceptional profit on the disposal of the group's waste management arm.
NFC commented on 'continuing evidence of increased activity in the UK,
although there are few signs yet of any improvement in mainland Europe'.
Earnings per share were 5.8p (12.9p). The group, which reports quarterly,
declared a second interim dividend of 1.5p making a half-year total of 2.9p,
up 7.8 per cent.
Profit before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 48.8m was 30 per cent
ahead, but below most analysts' expectations. Mr Peter Sherlock, chief
executive, said NFC's core transport and logistics operations in the UK
performed strongly and had added Pounds 40m of net new business in the first
half.
Group turnover rose 5.3 per cent to Pounds 1.03bn from Pounds 976.5m.
Operating profits grew 13 per cent to Pounds 56.5m helped by reduced losses
at Lynx, a Pounds 2.8m increase in pension credits and Pounds 3.5m
compensation for the cancellation of a property contract.
Turnover and profits in the UK transport and logistics operations were
marginally ahead of last year's levels at Pounds 444.1m and Pounds 30.2m
respectively.
Turnover in the continental European logistics business grew 21 per cent to
Pounds 90.3m, however the operations posted a first-half operating loss of
Pounds 1m, compared with a Pounds 300,000 profit. In North America revenues
grew 15 per cent to Pounds 157.6m but profit was flat at Pounds 12.1m.
Turnover from moving services, including Pickfords in the UK, increased 6
per cent to Pounds 289.3m. However profits fell 50 per cent to Pounds 1.4m
mainly reflecting the absence of 'one-off' items.
In the competitive UK parcels market Lynx boosted revenues by Pounds 1.4m to
Pounds 41.5m and operating losses fell Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 4.2m.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Cott shares dive on financial fears
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cott Corporation, the Canadian soft drink maker which has led the
private-label assault on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, lost more than a fifth of
its market value early yesterday amid speculation about its financial
condition.
The shares slid from CDollars 25 to CDollars 20.75 in Toronto yesterday
morning, following a CDollars 2 fall on Tuesday.
Cott's private-label products have eroded Coke and Pepsi's market share in
North America, Australia, South Africa and the UK. But analysts have
questioned the company's financial stability. Much of the criticism is based
on its accounting practices, which in turn has raised scepticism about the
quality of its cash flow and earnings.
For instance, Cott classifies its contracts for supermarket shelf space as
assets, while Coke and Pepsi treat these fees as expenses. Critics contend
that a minority stake in a US company, bought from some Cott executives last
year, should have been treated as compensation expenses instead of as an
asset.
Concern has been heightened by reports on Cott's presentation to analysts in
Toronto on Tuesday. Some participants criticised the company for not yet
publishing its annual report for the year to January.
Others, however, contend that the fears are based more on rumour than fact.
Mr Robert Mason, analyst at Richardson Greenshields in Toronto, ascribed the
drop in the share price mainly to rumours spread by short-sellers, mostly in
the US. 'Many accountants who have taken the time to understand the
underlying transactions agree that it is following the appropriate
practices.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / China signals thaw in dispute with Britain over Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
China has signalled an easing of its dispute with Britain over Hong Kong's
political development, which has hindered commercial negotiations between
the two countries and clouded the future of the colony.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, had told
a group of Hong Kong trade unionists that the dispute with Britain was
'past' and that relations between the UK and China should be 'corrected and
improved'.
Mr Qian's remarks, made on Tuesday, come at a time when both governments are
making efforts to repair relations after a bruising two-year dispute about
Hong Kong's political development. The row culminated late last year with Mr
Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, pushing ahead with his blueprint for
political reform. Mr Qian repeated on Tuesday Beijing's threat to call fresh
elections after it resumes sovereignty in 1997.
The apparent thaw in relations will face a test at the end of this month
when Hong Kong's legislature votes on Mr Patten's democracy plans. Most of
the proposals are expected to be accepted.
Since the spring, Chinese officials have indicated a willingness to proceed
with practical matters concerning the transfer of Hong Kong. However, some
Hong Kong government officials suspect Beijing has started a charm offensive
of little substance.
Another sign that a thaw in relations is under way is an invitation China
extended last week to Mr Alastair Goodlad, a foreign office minister, who
will visit Beijing next month. This is the first British ministerial visit
to the Chinese capital for a year. In September a top British business
delegation will go to China to improve trade relations.
In a related move, it was announced yesterday that the Sino-British joint
liaison group (JLG) would meet from June 21 to June 23. The JLG - which
oversees the transfer of Hong Kong to China and should have met last in
March but failed to do so - has a large backlog of technical work to
complete.
The forthcoming meeting is expected to seal the terms of a deal whereby the
Hong Kong government will refit some military sites in the colony for the
use of China's armed forces in exchange for the release of surplus military
land for civilian development.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Brussels U-turn revives strategy for steel rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission staged a U-turn yesterday and resurrected a rescue
plan for the steel industry which it buried barely a month ago.
The turnaround paves the way for Italy to subsidise the closure of steel
plants in the northern Brescia region, and avoids a showdown between the
Commission and the new government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
The Commission decision preserves the loose framework for curbing state aid
to the steel sector in the EU and keeps alive hopes of meeting an ambitious
target of an 19m tonne reduction in capacity by September. Sir Leon Brittan,
chief EU trade negotiator, was a lone voice of dissent yesterday.
A month ago, Sir Leon persuaded his colleagues to block the Brescia deal. He
argued that the proposal was illegal because it aimed to cut capacity rather
than closing the plants down altogether, as required under the EU's code on
steel aid.
This view was shared yesterday by the Commission's legal service.
But Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, and Mr Martin
Bangemann, industry commissioner, counter-attacked in favour of a more
flexible interpretation of the rules - buttressed by what they described as
strict monitoring of the proposed closures of the 68 Brescia steel
companies.
Mr Bangemann said the Italian contribution of 5m and 6m tonnes in capacity
cuts was vital to reach the 19m target: 'We are not bending the rules, we
are applying the rules.'
Mr Van Miert, who proclaimed the steel plan 'dead and buried' a month ago
after he was outvoted in the Commission, flew to Rome yesterday to present
the new plan to the Italian government.
He outlined strict conditions on the transfer of aid to the Bresciani, an
issue that has been complicated by the web of cross-shareholding of private
companies in the small mills:
In the event of a partial closure only, a separate legal entity will have to
be set up for the part which shuts down. Italian state aid will go to the
company liquidators only.
The parts of companies which remain open must not increase capacity for at
least five years.
Each batch of state aid will be monitored individually by the Commission,
with a report sent to EU industry ministers (who are required to approve
yesterday's Commission decision).
Companies cutting capacity will have to scrap all their plant, with no
chance of moving it elsewhere.
This last point is viewed as crucial in order to fend off complaints from
the US. Brussels, however, is playing down Sir Leon's argument that the
flexible interpretation of the steel aid code could make it more difficult
to negotiate a multilateral steel deal under the auspices of the GATT world
trade organisation.

FT  16 JUN 94 / US unveils plans for sanctions against N Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent and JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US last night outlined its proposals for phased United Nations sanctions
intended to persuade North Korea to accept international inspection of its
nuclear facilities.
Ms Madeleine Albright, Washington's ambassador to the UN, who is consulting
with other members of the Security Council on joint action, said the
measures would be 'carefully calibrated'.
'The more they break the rules, the tougher the sanctions: there is an
equation there,' she said.
The US initiative came as Pyongyang warned of a 'pitiless war' if the UN
imposed sanctions and as former US president Jimmy Carter began a mediation
mission in an attempt to ease tension. Mr Carter was reported to have held
talks with North Korea's President Kim Il-sung after a reception hosted by
the foreign minister.
The US draft resolution proposes a first stage of sanctions including a
mandatory arms embargo.
Other measures in this phase would be: a halt to technical and scientific
co-operation; a cut-off of UN economic aid; voluntary reduction of
diplomatic ties; a ban on air traffic except for passenger flights and on
commercial and cultural exchanges.
The draft calls for a grace period after adopting the measures and before
putting them into effect. Only if Pyongyang ultimately continued to be
intransigent would the Security Council approve a second phase of sanctions
including cutting off financial transactions.
Thus, the administration appears to have abandoned, at least for now, a
proposal by Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state, to block
remittances sent home by North Koreans in Japan. Estimates have placed these
as high as Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) a year, Pyongyang's principal
source of hard currency.
Mr Gallucci said the North yesterday continued to permit routine monitoring
by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency at its Yongbyon
reactor, despite having informed the IAEA, the UN's nuclear watchdog, that
it was withdrawing from the organisation.
South Korea yesterday sought to calm the war scare that has affected the
country's financial markets. President Kim Young-sam told financial leaders
there was no cause for alarm.
The Seoul bourse general share index yesterday fell by 12.80 points, or 1.4
per cent, to 890.92 after suffering a 2.1 per cent decline on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
Glaxo's market capitalisation has increased forty-fold since Sir Paul
Girolami stepped into the chief executive's shoes in 1980. Yet the Pounds
10bn decline in the company's value over the past two and a half years
reflects a tougher environment than the free-wheeling 1980s. Margins are
under pressure and volume growth is harder to come by. Sir Paul's decision
to retire as chairman is therefore timely. His instinctive dislike of
acquisitions does not sit comfortably with Glaxo's need to position itself
in a changing market, or its prodigious accumulation of cash. A large
acquisition in US healthcare is not the only answer. But shareholders will
give Sir Paul a double vote of thanks if the company he built now finds it
easier to adapt.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks as though Mr Peter Sherlock's honeymoon period as chief executive
of NFC is over. Yesterday's 10 per cent fall in the shares after interim
figures only marginally below consensus expectations suggests the market is
growing impatient for his restructuring of the company to bear fruit. The
new business put on in the UK during the first half may well take time to
show through to profits. But it is striking that both turnover and profits
were virtually flat in UK transport and logistics at a time when the
recovery was supposedly gathering pace. Indeed profits would have fallen
across the group as a whole without the smaller loss at the peripheral Lynx
parcels division and the increase in the pension credit, whose future
depends on actuarial whim. Maybe the share price would have been spared
yesterday's shock in the days when NFC used to make routine profit
forecasts, but it is unlikely to outperform till Mr Sherlock delivers the
goods.

FT  16 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Thames Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 2 per cent fall in Thames' shares cements its position as the
worst performing water company since privatisation. The shares were priced
on a yield discount to the sector in 1990 but now stand at a yield premium.
The miserable performance of Thames' diversification strategy is partly to
blame. Including yesterday's write-off, it has invested around Pounds 170m
in businesses which will do well to cover their costs this year. As Thames
acknowledged yesterday, the full year dividend would have been higher had it
stuck to its knitting as a utility.
The cost in terms of lost management time is more difficult to quantify but
potentially just as damaging. Studies commissioned by Ofwat, the industry
regulator, show Thames to be among the least efficient in the sector even
though it charges customers less than its peers. While the company disagrees
with Ofwat's conclusions - and demonstrated admirable control of operating
costs last year - it may be too late to stop the regulator setting tough
efficiency targets for the second half of the decade. Unless the non-utility
side is by then showing marked improvement, Thames could find itself
fighting a war on two fronts.

FT  16 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So it looks as though there was nothing to worry about in average earnings
after all. The apparent upward drift was just a blip caused by bonus
payments to all those City folk who spend their time predicting the
inflation rate. Moreover, the UK's productivity performance is still
encouraging. Unit labour costs were up only 1.9 per cent in the year to
April compared with 2.2 per cent in March. At some stage, as Mr Eddie George
pointed out at the Mansion House last night, interest rates will have to go
up again. On the basis of such figures he would have trouble arguing that it
must be soon.
If gilts initially reacted to the figures with a strong rally, equities
seemed a little more grudging in their welcome. Perhaps the share market's
concern is that the recovery may not be quite so strong after all. Certainly
the sharp fall in the workforce during the first quarter is food for
thought. Today's retail spending figures will provide a further pointer to
the state of the economy. In turn, that may complicate the political debate
over tax cuts.
A faltering recovery and an absence of inflationary pressure might make tax
cuts appear more acceptable. But with world bond markets still uneasy, the
authorities have to worry about the ability of the gilts market to absorb
new issues. It will not have escaped their attention that by yesterday
evening gilts' positive mood on inflation was already giving way to
nervousness ahead of tomorrow's auction announcement.

FT  16 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Hot air from British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is time British Gas stopped playing the victim and got on with adding
value to its businesses. The company may once have thought that saying how
awful things were would encourage the regulator and the government to take a
soft line. But it should now be abundantly clear that Ofgas is likely to
respond more favourably if British Gas seeks to improve itself than if it
moans.
There was really little to complain about in Ofgas's transportation price
formula. The rate of return is in line with what the Monopolies Commission
recommended. The annual price cut of 5 per cent in real terms seems
achievable. Assuming volume growth of 5 per cent a year, the target could be
hit by annual efficiency savings of 2.5 per cent. Yet British Gas responded
by saying it would curtail investment and find it hard to justify dividend
increases.
The reaction is odd. A promised real rate of return of 6.5-7.5 per cent on
new investment is not bad for a safe business like gas transportation. Given
the growth in demand, curbing capital expenditure looks a bit like cutting
off its nose to spite its face. There may be good reasons for freezing or
cutting dividends. But it is strange to pin the blame on Ofgas; British Gas
last increased its dividend in February - after the government had responded
to the MMC report.
British Gas would do better to rise to the challenges ahead. The main tasks
are to knock its public gas supply business into shape so it can face the
advent of competition in the domestic market and to improve efficiency in
the transportation business. Until British Gas communicates strategies to
achieve both tasks, its share price will remain subdued.

Stuart Mackay, of Forfar-based (authentic) bagpipe manufacturers Gillanders

Is the honeymoon over between British Gas and its new regulator, Clare

Judging by British Gas's pained response to Spottiswoode's decision on the
pricing formula yesterday, the answer would seem to be 'yes'. Announcing
that this year's dividend increase is now at risk, British Gas chief
executive Cedric Brown said: 'The document dispels any thought that British
Gas has captured its regulator. She is extremely tough, demanding,
intelligent and has a clear mind of her own.'
Then again, Observer does not recall the word 'intelligent' ever appearing
in the war of words which characterised British Gas's stormy affair with her
predecessor, the crusty Sir James McKinnon. Perhaps there is a flicker of
hope that the relationship may warm up again.

One of the toughest tasks facing Silvio Berlusconi since he was appointed
prime minister last month has been to decide where to sleep. The Italian
press has had a field day speculating whether it would be a 16th century
villa in the Doria Pamphili park, a magnificent flat in old Rome or a
mansion in that haunt of film stars, the Appia Antica.
However, problems of security and fear of antagonising the public by
ostentatious living have eliminated all these options. Instead, he has
plumped for an unused flat on the upper floor of the prime minister's office
at Palazzo Chigi.
Berlusconi's search for a suitable residence underlines the fact that the
previous 52 postwar Italian premiers were never in office long enough to
worry much about where they lived. The Chigi apartment was last used in 1983
by that hardy annual Christian Democrat Amintore Fanfani.

Wasn't the ex-ship steward one of the 'politically motivated men' excoriated

Prescott was not named by Wilson because he had been adopted as prospective
Labour candidate for Southport. Comment of this sort might go down well with
the trade union lot but they are not going to help Tony Blair's chances of

FT  16 JUN 94 / Observer: Girolami and his rival
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The retirement of Glaxo's chairman, Sir Paul Girolami, at the ripe age of 68
rounds off one of the most remarkable careers in British business this
century. It also shows an interesting sense of occasion. Under Sir Paul, the
mandatory retirement age for other Glaxo directors was reduced from 65 to
60. He himself, he always made clear, would go in his own good time.
He also made clear that his chief goal was to overtake Merck of the US,
headed by Roy Vagelos, as the world's biggest drug company. Although he has
done a remarkable job in closing the gap, he has failed in his object.
Vagelos, meanwhile, has said he will retire in November. Girolami, no doubt
by coincidence, is to go in the same month.
Given the intense competition between the two companies and the two men, it
is worth asking who won in the long run. On one view, the answer has to be
Girolami. Back in 1978, when he was Glaxo's finance director, the company
had no sales in the US. It is now America's second biggest drug company
after Merck, with sales of Pounds 2bn. This was chiefly due to Girolami's
promotion of the ulcer drug Zantac. According to company lore, Glaxo
originally planned to license Zantac in the US to Merck, before Girolami
blocked the idea.
Similarly, since Girolami took over in 1981, Glaxo's sales and profits have
doubled at twice the rate of Merck's. Merck's market value has risen
eight-fold, Glaxo's 44-fold. But on any of these criteria Merck - one of the
most admired companies in America - is still clearly ahead.
Vagelos is ahead in another sense. Last year Merck shook its competitors
rigid with the Dollars 6bn takeover of Medco, a leading US drug distributor.
In an industry obsessed by shrinking healthcare spending, this looks
increasingly like a strategic masterstroke. Glaxo, like most of its rivals,
is still struggling to respond.
Girolami, in other words, looked until lately to be ahead on points; but he
leaves his company at a point of maximum uncertainty, with his arch-rival
stealing victory at the final bell.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Reforming US welfare
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The most important aspect of the welfare reforms announced this week by
President Bill Clinton is the proposed shift from a passive to an active
stance. The laudable goal - likely to strike a chord with politicians in
other countries - is to break the 'cycle of dependency' and provide
recipients with the job training, counselling and childcare required if they
are to become productive citizens.
Although Republicans have reservations about many of the specific measures,
there is strong bipartisan support for ending the present system, both on
Capitol Hill and among state governors, many of whom are introducing their
own welfare reforms. There is little prospect of legislative action this
year, because the relevant congressional committees are grappling with the
even bigger challenge of healthcare reform. But given the consensus on the
need for change, reforms loosely based on Mr Clinton's ideas probably will
be enacted in 1995.
The most controversial change is the proposed two-year time limit on welfare
payments. This is not quite as sweeping as it sounds. The new rules would
apply only to the 'next generation' - people born after 1971, about a third
of the present case load. And the measures would be phased in slowly: by the
year 1999 it is estimated that only about 8 per cent of the welfare
population would be working for their benefits.
Nor is Mr Clinton proposing an end to public support after two years. If
recipients could not find private sector jobs before the deadline, they
would be offered publicly subsidised employment at the minimum wage.
Provided people 'play by the rules' and continue searching in good faith for
private sector jobs, the offer of public employment would be permanent.
The relevance of these measures to Europe's problem of welfare dependency is
limited. Mr Clinton is focusing on Aid for Families With Dependent Children,
a joint federal-state programme which channels benefits almost exclusively
to single-parent families. The most important differences between the US and
Europe relate to treatment of adults and the unemployed. The US has never
had a general welfare system: childless adults do not qualify for federal
benefits and get very little assistance from states. Unemployment insurance
has always been limited to six months, with temporary extensions during
recessions. It is in these areas that reforms in Europe may produce the
greatest benefits in terms of reduced dependency.
The US insistence that young mothers with children 'earn' their benefits
marks a hardening of moves toward 'workfare' which began with the bipartisan
Family Support Act of 1988. Yet it is questionable whether this is the most
urgent priority when cash for job training is so limited. Instead of trying
to get mothers out of the home, where they are gainfully employed in raising
children, it would make more sense to focus on improving the job skills of
unskilled young males, who have dropped out of the labour force in
disturbingly large numbers. If such men were more employable, they would
also make better marriage prospects. The number of out-of-wedlock births
might then decline. And the US would have begun to address one of the root
causes not just of welfare dependency, but of the poverty and violence that
disfigure inner cities.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What do the Football Association and the watchdogs of Britain's retail
financial services industry have in common? Answer: an uncanny ability to
penalise the wrong people.
Consider the case of Tottenham Hotspur. The FA has just imposed a swingeing
Pounds 600,000 fine on the north London soccer club, excluded it from the FA
Cup for a year and knocked 12 points from its total next season, which will
make relegation difficult to avoid. The offences in question had nothing to
do with controversial loan arrangements and transfer payments undertaken by
its former manager Mr Terry Venables. They concerned the less weighty matter
of irregular loans made to players in the 1980s. That was before the arrival
of the club's present chairman and controlling shareholder, Mr Alan Sugar of
Amstrad.
Mr Sugar is the kind of hard-nosed entrepreneur for whom hearts do not
readily bleed. But it is difficult to see why he, who rescued the club with
a cash injection in 1991, should bear the brunt of the FA's disciplinary
action; or, again, why players and fans who were not involved in the
irregularities should live under the cloud of a 12-point handicap. Mr
Venables, meantime, has never fully answered his critics, but has been
rewarded by the FA with the job of England's coach.
This would not seem to fit any recognisable definition of natural justice.
But it might well appear familiar to the policyholders and shareholders of
those life assurance companies that have recently been fined for sharp sales
practice. The misdemeanours were perpetrated by the directors, managers and
salesmen of the companies. Yet the fines fall chiefly on the policyholders -
including victims of mis-selling - and to a lesser extent on shareholders in
proprietary companies. This no doubt creates an impression of regulatory
activity. But it is not a kind of regulation worth having. Still less does
it constitute justice.
The FA should sharpen up its act, but may need a little bruising legal
assistance from Mr Sugar to do so. The new Personal Investment Authority
should be encouraged to require individual registration and fines for
insurance company directors. As long as sanctions are manifestly
indiscriminate, regulation degenerates into farce.

FT  16 JUN 94 / We're trying to connect you . . .: A look at the attractions
of Sprint to French and German state-owned telecoms companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
She's the quintessential savvy, beautiful, independent, professional
American woman. That is the role actress Candice Bergen plays almost nightly
on US television in two different contexts: as the star of the comedy series
Murphy Brown and as advertising pitch-person for long-distance
telecommunications group Sprint.
Right now she can be seen extolling the merits of Sprint's new
voice-activated Foncard - the world's first calling card allowing a user to
dial numbers simply by ordering the telephone system to 'call home', or any
of nine other destinations the individual nominates.
One advertisement has Bergen losing her address book as she drives across a
wild American landscape. No problem. She uses her Foncard at a remote
call-box, muttering to herself: 'Is this a great country, or what?' The
mundane act of placing a phone call seems sexy, sophisticated, even
patriotic.
It also highlights the attractions of Sprint, in which Deutsche Telekom and
France Telecom have just agreed to invest some Dollars 4bn for a 20 per cent
stake as part of a new global telecommunications alliance.
Established in 1986, two years after AT&amp;T's stranglehold on the
long-distance market was broken by an anti-trust court settlement, Sprint
has built itself into one of the Big Three US long-distance carriers, with a
strong brand identity (thanks in no small measure to Ms Bergen) and a
reputation for technological innovation.
It was the first US company to build a nationwide, all-digital fibre-optic
network - the kind of system which will form the backbone of the much-touted
'information super-highway' - and it owns one of the leading global data
communications networks, called SprintNet.
That said, it has been less successful than rival MCI Communications -
longer established and known for razor sharp marketing - at snatching
customers from AT&amp;T, whose share of the US long-distance revenues has shrunk
from 90 per cent to about 60 per cent since full competition was introduced
in 1984.
Sprint, which made some serious marketing errors in the late 1980s, has a US
long-distance share of around 9.5 per cent, against roughly 19 per cent for
MCI. But Sprint - dismissed a few years ago as a long-distance also-ran - is
showing signs of being a more aggressive, effective competitor.
It is also unique among US communications companies in having large
operations in all three important areas of the business - long-distance,
local and cellular telephony - and some analysts think this, with its
national brand-name, puts it in a strong position to benefit from the
sweeping change facing the US industry.
But it is mainly Sprint's long-distance and international operations which
make it the most attractive US partner for European telecommunications
companies - given MCI's alliance last year with British Telecom, and the
likelihood that AT&amp;T's size would make it an uncomfortable bedfellow and
might trigger competition policy alarms in Brussels.
Sprint, for its part, needs foreign allies if it is to be an effective
global player against AT&amp;T and MCI, offering business customers a
comprehensive service around the world.
The Dollars 4bn it will receive from the French and Germans will help it cut
borrowings (its debt to total capitalisation ratio stood at a relatively
high 55 per cent in late 1993) and to invest in opportunities created by
telecommunications liberalisation in the US and internationally.
Central to Sprint's growth has been the personality of its tough chairman,
54-year-old Mr William Esrey. A former Harvard Business School student and
one-time investment banker, in 1980 he joined United Telecoms, a sleepy
local telephone operator, and persuaded it to invest in the long-distance
market. In 1986, he united these operations with Sprint, the newly
established long-distance arm of GTE, another local operator. GTE eventually
sold its stake to United Telecom, which in turn changed its name to Sprint.
Sprint's long-distance business quickly gained customers from AT&amp;T but at
the start of the 1990s its market share began to slip, as the strains of its
helter-skelter expansion began to tell: it was over-staffed; it had a
reputation for billing errors; United Telecom and GTE argued over strategy;
and MCI was much more innovative in its marketing, particularly to homes and
small businesses.
Sprint's share is now rising slowly again, and profitability is improving,
thanks in part to a 1991 management reorganisation which focused more
closely on market segments. It has established a solid position among
corporate customers and has cleverly targeted affluent individuals who use
the phone often, though it is still under-represented in the small
businesses market.
The long-distance arm is in the throes of an extensive programme to cut
costs and improve cycle times which analysts expect to produce several
hundred million dollars in savings when it ends next year.
Its operating margin - operating income as a percentage of revenues - has
already risen from 5 per cent in 1992 to a little over 8 per cent, and Wall
Street expects the figure to be close to 10 per cent by late 1995. But that
would still be short of the 11 to 12 per cent margin at AT&amp;T and MCI.
Sprint's local telephone operations have a much better financial track
record. Serving 6m customers in 19 states, Sprint has one of the most modern
local networks in the US, one of the highest returns on equity among
regional carriers and the nation's fastest growth in access lines. And while
the local operations had operating revenues last year of Dollars 4.1bn, well
below the Dollars 6.1bn of long-distance, they made Dollars 954m in
operating income, far outstripping the Dollars 501m of long-distance.
Sprint's cellular telephone business, the 10th largest in America, also had
one of the industry's fastest rates of customer growth, and Mr Esrey plans
to use much of the European cash injection to bolster its position. He wants
to form an alliance with other cellular operators, which have a patchwork of
local licences across the US, to create a seamless national mobile network.
His rivals have similar plans: AT&amp;T (through its proposed takeover of McCaw
Cellular) and MCI (through a stake in wireless operator Nextel).
All three groups, and their allies, are expected to be keen bidders at the
end of this year when the federal government auctions off licences for
personal communications services, which use especially small, light handsets
and may turn wireless into a mass market.
Sprint's local phone business will face increased competition over the next
three to five years, in common with every other regional carrier, as
competition breaks down these local monopolies. But analysts think it will
suffer less than most regional carriers because its local business is
concentrated mainly in rural areas with fewer than 10,000 access lines -
making this side of its business unattractive to companies targeting areas
of high population density.
Sprint, moreover, thinks any local losses it may suffer from competition
could be greatly outweighed by the freedom deregulation will give it to go
into the territory of other regional operators: many of its exchanges are
close to large centres of population, where it could cream off business
customers.
'This may be the gold mine of local competition for us,' says a senior
executive.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Clarke on trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor of the exchequer assured his audience at the Mansion House
last night that 'we have not created the conditions for the strongest
recovery in Europe in order to throw it away by creating yet another boom
followed by a bust'. Such talk is cheap. But will Mr Clarke act as
decisively as he talks?
The chancellor is right to argue that the UK might manage a long period of
sustained growth with low and stable inflation. There are, as he notes,
three threats: unsustainable public borrowing; failure to keep inflation
under control; and problems on the supply side, which would be shown in
labour shortages and current account deficits.
So far, the recovery is going well, as yesterday's data show. Over the 12
months to May the retail price index, excluding mortgage interest receipts,
rose 2.5 per cent, well within the government's 1-4 per cent target range
(though at the upper limit of the bottom half of the target range, which is
where inflation is supposed to be by the end of the Parliament). Happily,
the underlying increase in labour earnings fell back to 3 3/4 per cent in
the year to April, down from 4 per cent in March.
Furthermore, unemployment has fallen far more than might have been expected,
by 311,000 from its cyclical peak in December 1992. Yet the employment data
are puzzling: the labour force survey shows an increase in the total number
in employment of only 149,000 between the winter of 1992-93 and the winter
of 1993-94, while the survey of employers shows a fall of 58,000 in
employment between December 1992 and March 1994. These discrepancies go to
show how difficult it is to know the economy's potential output.
The chancellor's list of threats is correct. He has also done the right
thing about the fiscal deficit, but must remind his backbenchers that tax
cuts will demand further cuts in spending. As for bottlenecks, the best
remedy of all would be a prolonged period of steady growth. Bottlenecks are
bound to plague an economy suffering from erratic demand management.
Above all, demand must be managed cautiously, since nobody knows what
potential output is. This is, in any case, not a point, but a band. What the
authorities do know is that over the last cycle the underlying annual rate
of growth was only 2 1/4 per cent: 3 per cent is probably the fastest safe
annual rate of growth of real output and, given the current account deficit,
also of real domestic demand. If inflation is to be below 2 1/2 per cent,
nominal domestic demand should rise at about 5 1/2 per cent a year, which
is, as it happens, what it did in the year to the last quarter of 1993 and,
again, to the first quarter of 1994.
Mr Clarke is right to argue that the decision to publish the minutes of his
discussions with the governor has been his most important one. But they also
show that he has been more willing to cut rates than Mr George. Markets do
believe Mr Clarke will be forced to raise rates, but fear he will act too
late. Given their past experience, investors are bound to be distrustful. Mr
Clarke must be prepared to prove those doubts misplaced.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Best form of defence: A look at the competitive pressures
leading to international alliances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few industries are surrounded by so much hype as telecommunications. Its
networks have become 'superhighways'; its new services are invariably
'multimedia'; every other joint venture claims to be 'global'.
In fact, the multimedia revolution is in its infancy, while today's grand
alliances are essentially moves by individual telecoms companies to increase
their ability to snatch core telecoms business from other international
operators. Such truths should reassure, not disappoint, the consumer: it
means more competition, better service, and the prospect of sharp falls in
prices, particularly bloated international tariffs.
This is not to minimise the sums of money at stake. More than Dollars 4bn
will change hands if the alliance between the US company Sprint and the
French and German state-owned telecoms companies is consummated. The trio is
consciously imitating British Telecommunications and MCI, which yesterday
gained US regulatory approval for a Dollars 5.3bn transatlantic alliance.
From the point of view of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, the Sprint
link-up is more defensive than offensive:
The motivation for the huge investment is to tie Sprint hand and foot to a
Franco-German telecoms alliance formalised last December. For the European
companies the prize is access to Sprint's existing networks, services and
marketing dynamism. It also gives a respectable route into the US, the home
of most multinational businesses, reducing the risk that US operators -
particularly AT&amp;T - will steal traffic from multinationals based in France
and Germany when the EU's markets are fully liberalised in 1998.
The Dollars 4.2bn which the two state telecoms companies intend to pay
Sprint is a straight equity investment in the US operator. It is not geared
to joint services or networks: indeed, Sprint talks about using the cash to
cut borrowings and bid for US cellular licences.
Of the services the new alliance proposes to offer, some, such as
international calling cards, are already generally available in the US;
while others, such as cross-border 'one-stop shop' facilities, consist of
doing better and cheaper what telecoms companies claim to do already  -
provide an efficient, cost-effective international telephone service.
Other international telecoms alliances show similar characteristics. Mr
Viesturs Vucins, chief executive of Unisource, the international joint
venture launched last year by the Swedish, Swiss and Dutch national telecoms
operators, concedes: 'Our focus is a bit unsexy - it is solving customer
needs as they are right now: better quality and lower cost for international
telecoms services.'
He adds: 'They are basic needs that should have been solved a long time ago;
and we need to get them right before we can start offering very
sophisticated services.' To succeed, a US alliance for Unisource is 'very
important'. He refuses to elaborate, but Unisource is known to be in talks
with AT&amp;T about a transatlantic tie-up.
Mr Vucins's 'basic needs' are big business. The market for providing managed
telecoms services to multinationals, enabling them to deal with a small
number of contractors for their international telecoms needs, is potentially
vast.
Dataquest, the international consultancy, estimates that in 1997 the global
market for international calls will be worth about Dollars 100bn, with the
corporate sector accounting for two-thirds. The operator able to establish
itself now with the multinationals - of which Unisource estimates there are
2,400 globally, 800 of them in Europe - will be well-positioned as national
telecoms monopolies crumble outside the US.
However, the market for telecoms companies to act as 'outsourcers' for the
telecoms needs of multinationals - that is, to take over the ownership and
management of their telecoms systems - is problematic. Surveys show large
companies reluctant to hand over full control of such a strategic asset:
according to one international operator, up to a third of multinationals
inviting tenders for outsourcing contracts end up not awarding them.
As for the multinationals, their new-found power as buyers has been enhanced
by the formation of a pan-European telecoms association of large
multinationals, including Philips, ABN Amro, ICI, Rank Xerox and ABB. Its
objective is simple: to negotiate cheaper volume tariffs and better
cross-border facilities by offering pan-European contracts to one or more of
the larger operators.
As a first stage, the association has invited British Telecommunications and
an alliance of AT&amp;T and Unisource to produce plans and prices for a
pan-European network. Mr John Sale of Rank Xerox, the association chairman,
is looking for cost savings of up to 40 per cent in return for volume
business. At the start of the year, the association had 30 members; it has
already risen to 50 'and we are continuing to receive approaches from large
companies', says Mr Sale.
For their part, the telecoms alliances are pulling out every stop to get
business from the association. They do it with some misgivings: 'Frankly,
the deal is that we undercut ourselves, and the more the better,' notes a
senior executive of one telecoms company.
But the cost of missing out could be higher still, as the alliances securing
the principal contracts use their muscle to bargain down the price of bulk
capacity from other telecoms operators around the world.

BRITAIN'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
Edited by Tony Buxton, Paul Chapman, Paul Temple
Routledge, 438 pages, Pounds 50 hardback, Pounds 15.99 paperback
Nowhere is the short-termism which plagues British economic management so
well illustrated as in monetary policy. Global fixed exchange rates,
domestic monetary targets, membership of the European exchange rate
mechanism - all have been hailed as the cure for Britain's inflationary
tendencies, and then discarded when they have been seen to fail.
The problem is not that the relationship between the Bank of England and the
government is unimportant - the international evidence suggests it is.
Neither is it that the choice between alternative nominal targets is trivial
 -more damage has been done over the past 15 years in pursuit of
unobtainable targets than by any other economic policy action.
The underlying trouble with British economic policymaking has, instead, been
to focus on a symptom - inflation - rather than structural economic
weaknesses, and to rely too much on monetary policy alone to provide a cure.
That is the underlying message of Britain's Economic Performance. Its
long-term focus comes as no surprise, for the authors were all economists or
consultants to the National Economic Development Office, a government agency
set up in the 1960s to analyse the reasons for the UK's relatively poor
economic performance and to encourage dialogue and co-operation between
employers, the government and trade unions.
Prominent in the 1970s, the corporatist, consensual style of government
which Nedo embodied went out of fashion under the then Mrs Margaret
Thatcher, although it took until 1992 - after her departure - for the
organisation finally to be abolished. This volume brings together the work
in progress of Nedo's staff at the time of its demise, plus contributions
from prominent ex-employees and some reflections on the organisation's work.
It surveys, over 18 chapters, the recent performance of the UK economy
across trade, investment, finance, labour and technology. And, as one would
expect from former Nedo staff, it strikes a balance between impressive
statistical analysis and information, and institutional detail and colour.
Not all the contributions get the balance right - the chapters on the
relationship between industry and the City are too theoretical. Others are
written in a turgid style, suggesting too many hours sitting in Nedo council
meetings. Overall, the book tends to become rather bogged down in analysis
at the expense of clarity of conclusion.
A powerful argument shines through, nonetheless: decades of under-investment
in productive capacity, in education and skills, and in research and
development lie at the heart of both Britain's poor growth and employment
performance, and its inflationary ills.
The response of government in the face of the accumulating evidence has, the
book suggests, been piecemeal and inadequate. The book's underlying message
is that economic policy has been driven by ideology and short-term vested
interest, rather than long-term strategic sense.
Its most important theme concerns the relationship between inflation and
supply-side weaknesses. The authors do not underestimate the significance of
stable demand or the damage done by the UK's boom-bust cycle.
They locate the source of macroeconomic failures not simply in errors of
judgment at the Treasury or Bank of England, but in supply-side obstacles to
sustained growth - shortage of productive capacity and of skilled labour. It
would be easy, but mistaken, argue Paul Chapman and Paul Temple, to claim
that the twin problems of inflation and the balance of payments deficit in
the late 1980s were simply caused by excessive growth of nominal demand.
Instead, they say, the true source of inflationary pressure was not wage
inflation or a loose monetary policy, but the fall in economy-wide
productivity growth, which began to push up unit cost alongside growing
skills shortages in 1986, well before wages accelerated or interest rates
fell to their 1988 lows. By failing to deliver productivity and export
growth to match the aspirations of the population for rising living
standards and imports, these supply-side weaknesses sowed the seeds of the
inflationary troubles that followed.
For the late 1980s, now read mid-1990s. Contemporary economic debate and
policymaking, they argue, remain too short-termist and shallow, and overly
concerned with monetary policymaking.
Yet even with a sluggish recovery and high unemployment, the inability of
the British economy to grow without sucking in imports and hitting capacity
bottlenecks is already starting to show. Survey evidence points to rising
skills shortages; import volume growth has outstripped export growth
throughout the recession; and private investment has barely begun to offset
the lost physical capacity over the course of the recession. Add in the
projected slowdown in productivity growth over the next year, the impact of
rising taxes on disposable incomes and the government's need to court
popularity, and the early signs of another inflationary cycle emerge.
In short, it is the underlying weaknesses of the UK economy, not simply
monetary policy mistakes, that lie at the heart of Britain's recurrent
boom-bust cycles. The risk is that the present recovery will soon by choked
off by rising skills shortages, wage inflation and capacity bottlenecks.
This means supply-side policies to boost productivity growth are as
important for anti-inflationary credibility as the relationship between the
governor of the Bank of England and the chancellor. That would, it seems,
have been Nedo's view.

<TEXT>
Sir, Kevin Brown ('PM under pressure as Tories fear disaster in Euro-poll',
June 11/12) reports my friend Sir Teddy Taylor as remarking that the voters
had 'shown in the astonishingly low turnout for the Euro-polls that they are
fed up to the teeth with Brussels rule'.
The facts do not support him. In the Kent East seat which I shall alas be
vacating next month the Westminster constituencies of Dover, Ashford,
Folkestone, Canterbury had higher turnouts in the Euro-election than in four
out of the five Westminster by-elections held on the same day.
Should I conclude that the voters are 'fed up to the teeth' with
Westminster?

FT  16 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No doubt about estimates of beer
imports to UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M H REES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was surprised by Mr Pressnell's assertion (Personal View, June 9)
that BLRA data on duty-paid imports might not be defensible. The Calais
effect has clearly given rise to uncertainty in France as to the precise
fall in the French domestic market which occurred in 1993, but Mr Pressnell
admits personal imports from France in 1993 were 'around 800,000
hectolitres, perhaps 1m at the most'. This is in line with the BLRA's
estimate of the growth of personal imports that year, bearing in mind that
personal imports were already running at more than 900,000 hectolitres per
annum in 1992.
Mr Pressnell says that beer duty receipts were higher (by 0.08 per cent) in
1993 than in 1992. But the effective rate of duty was 6 per cent higher
overall in 1993 than 1992. This leaves plenty of room for a fall in domestic
beer sales in 1993 of about 2 per cent and for the BLRA's estimate of the
growth in duty-paid imports.
The BLRA has never predicted increasing duty-paid imports would nullify the
strong growth in the take-home beer market. Nevertheless, 1992 growth of,
say, 5 per cent was reduced to 2 per cent in 1993 and pub and club beer
sales fell by 3.8 per cent.
Mr Pressnell's figures for vehicle journeys across the Channel appear to
assume that all journeys are made through Dover. Although Dover is
undoubtedly the largest passenger port for the Continent, 40 per cent of all
journeys go through other ports - Ramsgate, Folkestone, Portsmouth,
Newhaven, Plymouth, Harwich, etc. He disregards the 624,000 return trips
made by coaches and commercial vehicles through Dover. The figure of 8.5m
return passenger trips in 1993 is too low even for Dover, the correct figure
being 9.2m. Moreover, about one-third of all duty-paid imports of beer are
carried in transit vans carrying on average a full load of 860 litres. The
actual average load per car is less than 50 litres, less than half the
guideline level per person of 110 litres and the same as the old allowance
per person.
Mr Pressnell's article gives no ground whatever for doubting the BLRA's
estimates.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Free bankers and gold bugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the academic case against central banks, and for free banking, has
failed, so far, to gather much practitioner support, should the current
enthusiasm for central bank independence prove a disappointment, in terms of
successful re-establishment of price stability, then it is possible, though
far from certain, that the cause of free banking would obtain renewed
support.
The above is a quotation not from some maverick, but from the keynote paper
by Professor Charles Goodhart and co-authors (The Development of Central
Banking) at last week's Bank of England tercentenary seminar.
The argument is about whether banking requires more regulation than any
other industry. It helps to follow the argument if we make a clear
distinction between 'currency', namely notes and coins plus bankers'
reserves with the central banks, and 'money', which is a much wider concept
including bank deposits and any other instruments used for settling debts.
(Currency is also pretty close to the monetarists' idea of 'base money'.)
The issue goes back to a division among the founding fathers of economics
about the inflationary effects of banking. David Hume, who promulgated the
Quantity Theory, regarded currency as consisting essentially of gold or
other precious metals. He explained how a doubling of the amount of gold in
Britain would lead first to a rise in prices and then to a redistribution of
the new gold throughout the rest of the world. He regarded man-made
substitutes, whether bank notes or deposits, as essentially counterfeit
gold.
Adam Smith disagreed on the last point. His view, which may be called the
'classical' one, was that price stability depended on the convertibility of
notes into precious metals. The classical school argued that banks could not
issue credit indefinitely as the public had to be persuaded to accept the
notes and deposits thereby created. Banks would not only have to acquire a
reputation for caution but offer interest, at least on deposits. So the
multiplication of man-made money would come to an end where the extra
interest from advancing credit was balanced by the extra interest that had
to be paid to depositors as well as other banking costs.
There are some factual observations which tell in favour of the classical
school. The chief monument to the Quantity Theory (then called 'currency
school'), was Robert Peel's Bank Charter Act of 1844. This tried to stop the
multiplication of bank money by giving the Bank of England a monopoly of the
note issue, the size of which was tied to its gold stock. The authors of the
Act did not realise that deposits would become far more important than
notes; and the Act did not prevent a vast increase in the effective money
supply erected on a small gold base. There were no long-term inflationary or
deflationary developments, while the pound remained convertible into gold.
In our own day central banks have tried to limit the creation of deposit
money; and critics have often scoffed that their efforts are dwarfed by the
multiplication of deposits in the Euro markets and general innovation and
globalisation. Yet none of these hyped-up forces has prevented central banks
from curbing inflation once they had developed the courage to raise interest
rates enough to do so, first in the 1980s and then in the 1990s.
Some of the above arguments are taken from David Glasner's Free Banking and
Monetary Reform (Cambridge University Press, 1989), to which I alluded in
Economic Viewpoint last week. This book comes to grips with problems that
many other free banking writers have ignored; and it is free of the
fanaticism which frequently surrounds monetary subjects.
Glasner maintains that Hayek was wrong to suppose that private enterprise
money would be introduced in rival inflation-proof units. This overlooked
the cost of switching from one unit of account to another, and especially
into unfamiliar units. Thus, even at high rates of inflation, private
enterprise suppliers of money are more likely to compete by paying interest
rates containing an inflation premium. Glasner's argument is that we already
have competitive money but that the state still has a function in defining
an inflation-proof monetary unit.
What then would a moderate free banker, like Glasner, now advocate? He does
not seem to regard the central bank monopoly of the note issue, or even the
legal tender laws, as important enough to crusade against. Nor does he
insist on the immediate abolition of all central banks.
His big criticism is of compulsory state-guaranteed deposit insurance. The
fate of the US Savings and Loans institutions, which had to be rescued at
the cost of the American taxpayer, gives him all the ammunition he needs.
Such guarantees create a problem of moral hazard, as banking institutions
feel safer about engaging in reckless lending.
The argument does not stop here. There is implicit, if imperfect,
understanding that central banks will not allow commercial banks that are
household names to fail. The lender of last resort function consists today
of deliberately ill-defined guarantees in return for acceptance of detailed
supervision. It is this that gives central bankers the air of very important
people who need to be engaged, not just with monetary policy, but with the
highest figures in private finance. Without going so far as to abolish these
responsibilities overnight, New Zealand's proposals for a switch of emphasis
from supervision to disclosure are surely the direction in which to go.
An implication is that ordinary citizens and small businesses not wishing to
take a view on financial markets would be well advised to place their ready
cash in low-interest deposits backed by virtually risk-free assets, such as
short-term government paper.
Glasner departs from some other free bankers in accepting a role for the
state not only in declaring a monetary unit but in supplying a currency
denominated in that unit, which would preserve its real value. He joins the
new and old fogies who hold that monetary stability can, in the end, only be
guaranteed by convertibility into a real asset. The one asset he discusses
in detail is gold.
But unlike the pure gold bugs, he recognises that gold itself can fluctuate
in real value, especially as so much of the world's gold stock is in the
hands of central banks. He suggests base money should be convertible into
gold at a variable rate designed to stabilise the general price level. And
he therefore advocates a variable official gold price. If, for instance, the
price of gold fails to keep up with a general inflation index, the holder of
currency would receive a larger amount of gold on conversion. But if the
price of gold rose by more than the general price index - that is a threat
of deflation - then a smaller quantity of gold would be paid out for each
currency unity exchanged.
A first inspection suggests that central bank gold stocks might be enough to
give the plan a chance. IMF estimates indicate that they are worth over
Dollars 400bn. But, clearly, plans for an adjustable gold standard will need
to be fully investigated before even being proposed, let alone adopted.

Sir, We were pleased to see your interest in seasonal adjustment of
statistical series - a highly technical subject, but at the same time one of
great importance in the analysis of economic and other data ('Easter's
moveable feast dishes statisticians', June 7). The topic is one to which we
devote a lot of attention both in considering the merits of alternative
systems and in deciding how best to use options available in the X-11 system
we have adopted. In our continuing search for improvements, we have engaged
the help of Dr Estelle Dagum, an expert of international repute, to advise
on seasonal adjustment procedures.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Concerned by banking practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is normal practice for a clearing bank to obtain a report from
accountants before granting, or continuing, financing facilities for working
capital to a company that is in, or emerging from, a period of financial
difficulty. The accountants are instructed by the bank in terms agreed with
the company, which undertakes to the bank to pay the accountants' fees for
doing the work. This is unobjectionable.
However, in such circumstances, certain clearing banks may also indicate to
the accountants that, in the event of a situation developing in which the
power to appoint a receiver is exercised by the bank (possibly following a
decision not to grant or renew facilities in the light of the accountants'
report) that firm of accountants will be appointed receivers. I think this
practice is objectionable.
My concern is heightened if the bank invites the accountants to discuss how
they would proceed with a receivership while, to the knowledge of the bank,
the directors are negotiating a transaction which might create a need for a
further report by the accountants.
My concern is heightened further if, when the directors are successful in
their negotiations, the bank calls for a further report and the accountants,
to the knowledge of the bank, refuse to put in writing an acknowledgment
that they, in making their report to the bank, owe a duty of care to the
company.
Perhaps it would benefit the business community if this area was considered
by the Bank of England and the Institute of Chartered Accountants.

   From Mr VAUGHAN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Leslie Crawford's article on the supply of arms by France to the
Rwandan government ('France, South Africa and Egypt 'supplied Rwanda
massacre arms' ', June 14) illustrates clearly the problems caused by the
lack of consistent policy on arms exports within the European Union.
In June 1991, the European Council published a list of seven criteria which
should govern arms export controls (later expanded to eight at Lisbon in
1992). These have yet to be adopted by the EU, because of disagreements
between member states over interpretation.
Implementation of these criteria - especially those relating to
consideration of the human rights records of the importing country and its
internal stability - would deny certain states such as Rwanda access to
military goods, and would constitute a significant step towards controlling
the flow of arms to oppressive regimes.

Let's hope fitness and fortune ensure that New Zealand field a better team
for The Second Test than they did for the first. It is pleasant of course
(for the English) to see an English team win once in a while, but the
disparity between the sides in the first Test made it a little absurd. In
the match starting today at Lord's we want to win, but against more
impressive opposition. Ball by ball coverage runs from 11.00 am to 7.00 pm
on Radio 4 long wave. BBC1 begins television coverage at 10.55 am and there
are highlights on BBC1 at 12.50 tonight. The journalist's ultimate dream
assignment comes to an end with the screening on BBC2 of the fourth in the
series Wooldridge On Whisky (8.00). That is followed by the last in the
sequence of Lost Steptoes, the recordings from the famous 1970s comedy,
found in a cellar, which have proved that, whatever the technical quality,
the comedy writing sticks out a mile (8.30). BBC1 begins a drama series
which is not about policemen or any aspect of crime, in itself a cause for
celebration. Roughnecks is about the people who work on oil rigs (9.30).

FT  16 JUN 94 / Arts: A high risk policy at the Zurich Opera House - As
Franz Welser-Most prepares to leave the London Philharmonic Orchestra for
Switzerland, Andrew Clark considers the controversial approach of director
Alexander Pereira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The headlines said it all. 'The world's hardest-working musical theatre',
trumpeted one Zurich newspaper. 'Operatic recipe for success', exclaimed
another. What prompted the applause was a recent announcement that the
Zurich Opera House would stage no less than 13 new productions and 21
revivals next season. At the best of times, most companies notch up only
half that number.
While theatres in France and Germany curtail activities because of the
recession, Zurich has increased its workload. And instead of playing safe
with box-office favourites, it is hauling out of obscurity operas only
Wexford Festival devotees are likely to have heard. Mascagni's L'amico
Fritz, Giordano's La cena delle beffe, Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix,
Schubert's Des Teufels Lustschloss - all will join the Zurich repertory in
coming months.
Alexander Pereira, the Opera House director, admits it is a high-risk
policy. He believes he can pull it off by engaging big-name singers and
balancing the rarities with frequent revivals of Carmen, Tosca and Don
Giovanni. 'If the mixture is right, people will come,' says Pereira. 'A
theatre has to bring out new things - otherwise it stagnates. As long as you
give the impression you're trying to do it well, the public will remain
inquisitive.'
Zurich's operatic image has changed since Pereira arrived from Vienna three
years ago. He inherited a company with a deficit, low morale and declining
popularity. Today it is solvent and the talk of the town. Drawing on
experience from his earlier career with Olivetti and Vienna's Konzerthaus,
Pereira launched a high-profile marketing campaign. He brought in trendy
directors and pandered to the thirst for stars. He laid on special projects
for Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Edita Gruberova and other Zurich regulars. He
persuaded ageing divas like Grace Bumbry to tackle new or unusual roles,
helping them to prolong their careers. And yesterday, amid much fanfare, he
announced the appointment of Franz Welser-Most as chief conducter, starting
in 1995.
Supported by a mixture of Viennese charm and hard-sell, Pereira's policies
seem to have worked. Box-office takings have doubled, partly due to an
increase in higher-category seat-prices. Sponsorship has rocketed, with
banks and wealthy individuals queueing to hand over SFr300,000 (Pounds
140,000) for each new production. Going to the opera in Zurich has become
the chic thing to do.
Pereira says that theatres in continental Europe can no longer expect a
steady rise in subsidy; they must generate cash themselves. 'In the five
years before I came, box-office income remained the same, but costs were
always rising. If you carry on like that, you'll wake up one day to find the
house has gone - as some theatres in Germany are now discovering. If we want
to keep the things of value in our life, we have to do more to sustain them.
Saving money by cutting activities leads nowhere. You have to invest in your
theatre - you must make it so attractive that people cannot stay away.'
Such talk does not hide the fact that Pereira is taking an enormous gamble.
With Fedora and Andrea Chenier already in the repertory, does the Zurich
public really want to see a third Giordano opera? Will audiences flock to
Linda di Chamounix if Gruberova cancels? Is there room in one season for two
new productions by the idiosyncratic east German director, Ruth Berghaus?
There are already signs that the novelty appeal of Pereira's programme may
be wearing off. Two months ago, a well-cast new production of Cilea's
rarely-played Adriana Lecouvreur drew disappointing houses. Subscribers -
10,000 of whom buy their tickets before the start of each season - have
complained they do not always get the promised stars for which they paid so
handsomely. Members of the ensemble say the rapid turnover of new
productions leaves no time to recharge creative batteries. Some are already
questioning the wisdom of Welser-Most's appointment: he has little operatic
experience and an unimpressive record as chief conductor of the London
Philharmonic.
Critics have accused Pereira of downplaying the achievements of his
predecessors, from whom he inherited a stock of easy-to-revive mainstream
productions. Apart from Henze's Der Prinz von Homburg, in a staging borrowed
from Munich, there has been nothing this season to match the pinnacles of
the 1980s. Francisco Araiza made a puny Chenier, Alcina was undercast and La
belle Helene revealed the Viennese actor-director Helmut Lohner as an
operatic ingenue. There has been a preponderance of Italian repertoire and a
dearth of 20th century works.
'Pereira only likes the pieces he can sing along with', comments a senior
member of the ensemble rather unkindly. 'But he's a professional manager,
he's clever, he knows how to get the money. That is what's needed today. His
predecessors may have had better artistic judgment. Pereira knows how to
sell himself.'

32 SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD (U) Francois Girod
LOST IN YONKERS (PG) Martha Coolidge
ANGIE (PG) Martha Coolidge
REALITY BITES (12) Ben Stiller
Here is your culture question for the week. What do Hannibal Lecter and the
Voyager spacecrafts have in common?
Correct: Canadian pianist Glenn Gould. His classical recordings, as well as
being sent into space by NASA in 1977 as a greeting gift to other
life-systems, were included by Dr Lecter as part of his consultancy fee when
helping the FBI with their serial murder enquiries.
Now Francois Girod's wonderful, absurd, rhapsodic 32 Short Films About Glenn
Gould, actually one 90-minute-long feature structured (vaguely) after the
Goldberg Variations, continues the posthumous deification of the bizarre
ivory-pounder. Gould, as you know, was born in Toronto in 1932; became a
public prodigy at age 12; withdrew from the concert platform in 1964; and
spent his last 18 years (death, 1982) battling hypochondria and perfecting
his music in the secrecy of a recording studio.
The film turns him into a mixture of - well, Hannibal Lecter and the Voyager
spacecraft. Now he soars; now he snarls and smoulders behind the bars of his
own genius. The film is a parade of short-to-tiny vignettes: childhood
memories, mock-up interviews with the actor playing Gould (Colm Feore, a
young Depardieu lookalike), scenes of chaos in the recording studio, and
burblings of Gould philosophy including his famous 'Vertical
panculturalism.'
The movie has the wit of Peter Greenaway's early nonfiction films (A Walk
Through H, The Falls) combined with an inspired cod-seriousness. We know we
are in Irony Heaven from the early glimpse of Gould's parents - Mum tidying
house, Dad holding an armful of logs - as they pause in wonder by the open
door to Sonny's room, from which Wagner's Tristan washes forth like a tide.
The entire biopic tradition has its ontogeny-of-a-genius lunacy skewered
here. Then things get better. Through voice-off narration and dramatised
cameos, we watch the grown-up Gould practise the increasingly fiendish
cadenzas of his own eccentricity.
In one scene he holds hostage a hotel chambermaid while playing her his
records. In another, two recording technicians discuss, with earnest
triviality, the evils of cream in coffee while the soundless Gould mimes
berserkly to playback behind the studio glass. (The two worlds of mind and
matter wittily collided.) And briefly too, Yehudi Menuhin and Gould's cousin
Jessie appear to probe or pixillate the legend.
Devoid of solemnity yet never shallow, the film delivers a portrait in the
round - or at least the polygonal - that renders most other art
documentaries obsolete. Pure gold; and quite possibly pure Gould.
I identify strongly with the title of Lost In Yonkers, based on Neil Simon's
latest play. Simon's recent work has reached that prolix and dangerous state
 -uncritical mass - when it seems that any combination of notionally
surefire ingredients, however amorphous, will do. They include: Brooklyn
growing-up anecdotes; wistful Jewish jokes; play-off between mad grown-ups
and bright-eyed kids; and one plump juicy role (in the screen version at
least) for either Richard Dreyfuss or Anne Bancroft.
Here we get Dreyfuss. He plays the gangster son of German-immigrant Gorgon
Irene Worth, who terrorises her visiting grandsons and her emotionally
backward daughter (Mercedes Ruehl). It is all about as funny as King Lear
performed in a broom cupboard by a group of over eager drama students: which
may explain why the play won a Pulitzer Prize. Martha Coolidge directs.
She also directs, more noticeably, Angie. If I precis'd the plot of this
comedy-with-tears, you would suppose that it was part of the Great Feminist
Conspiracy. We have a Brooklyn-Italian heroine (Geena Davis) betrayed or
disappointed by the men in her life (lumpy working-class fiance James
Gandolfini, perfidious Irish lover Stephen Rea). And we are forced-marched
through such girl's-dorm secrets as vibrators, pregnancy tests, menstrual
minutiae; not to mention jokes about nuns and penises shared in the women's
washroom at work.
This all happens in the first four acts of Todd Graff's script based on a
novel by Avra Wing; and they are exhilarating. Far from feeling stunned by
falling freemasonry, we are amazed that in the boy's club of world cinema
these matters still are such secrets. Geena Davis, with her voluptuous
reed-tall figure, scatty charm and baby-face sex appeal, should surely
vanquish any last flicker of male chauvinist resistance in any audience.
Then, alas, we get the fifth act. Here portentousness takes over, as if the
Hollywood Cliche Patriarchy has decided that enough is enough in the fresh
ideas division. A long-lost mother (schizophrenic); a dash for
reconciliation with father and stepmother; and a piano upended over the
soundtrack to accompany the post-natal heroine's cooing valediction, 'I'm
finally part of something bigger than me.'
More love and wistfulness in Reality Bites. This bills itself as 'a comedy
about love in the 90s'. But I live in this decade and do not recognise any
of these people. Not the camcorder-wielding kook with the million-dollar
complexion and dreams of being a great documentarist (Winona Ryder); nor the
bearded boy she loves (Ethan Hawke) with the poetic temperament and
death-defying vocabulary; nor the well-meaning, white-collar, cardboardy
rival, played by the film's director Ben Stiller . . .
Are we sure that Stiller and writer Helen Childress do not have their digits
upside-down and mean the 60s? For a while the dialogue is brisk enough to
carry us over the bumps in the film's sense of zeitgeist. 'I guess I'm a
non-practising Jew,' says the whizz-kid, to which Ryder trills back, 'Hey,
I'm a non-practising virgin.'
But then no one real talks in aphorisms all the time. And surely a film
whose moral hobby-horse is the dangers of selling out - our heroine's epic
home video is bought by a TV network which turns it into a snappy Pizza Hut
commercial - should have gone easier on the product placing. We have never
seen so many drink cans and bottles waved about with their labels aimed at
the camera lens.
Finally, idiot's corner. The Chase (15, director Adam Rifkin) is a
comedy/road movie that we recommend only to fully-qualified simpletons.
Robber Charlie Sheen eludes the law over many tyre-burning miles, during
which he destroys pursuing cop cars and makes love, while driving, to his
beautiful hostage Kristy Swanson. Do not try this in your own car, even
during the long hours of a rail strike.
Hercules Returns (15, David Parker) is better. A skimpy framing plot about
three Sydney friends re-opening a derelict cinema is the excuse for a
riotous film-within-a-film. Their gala opening movie is a (real) 1960s
Italian Hercules epic, dubbed on the wing by the Aussie threesome much as
Woody Allen ventriloquised What's Up Tiger Lily. Warm to the bodybuilder
stars sounding like a group of goosed Julian Clarys, and to moments like
that in which the sacred red smoke billows forth from the Delphic shrine:
'Jesus, the Ribena looks a bit hot.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / Arts: Alston at Aldeburgh - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The concert hall stage at The Maltings, Snape, is a fine space hitherto
unused for dance. Broad, deep, uncompromising in its bare brick walls, it
has just seen the emergence of a re-born London Contemporary Dance Theatre
under the direction of Richard Alston. Admirers of the company, and of
Alston, will be glad to know that the dancers are on tremendous form and
that Alston has baptised them, as he has the Maltings in nomine
Terpsichores, with three serious recent pieces, which I saw on Monday.
LCDT's ensemble is slimmed down to 12 dancers - most of its major artists
are still there - and Alston has responded bravely to their gifts, and to
the possibilities of the stage. Britten, given the Aldeburgh festival
context, was an obvious choice for music, and this year's featured composer,
Stravinsky, has provided the other score. So, the opening Three movements
from Petrushka for piano, and Alston's intriguing gloss on Fokine.
The piano is centre stage. Rolf Hind's bold account (rich sonorities; taut
rhythms) of this devilish transcription is matched by Darshan Singh
Bhuller's impersonation of the puppet. In an odd fashion we seem to watch
two Petrushkas, so intense the relationship between transcendental pianism
and the ferocious demands Alston makes of Bhuller. (At a couple of moments,
Bhuller stands watching Hind, as if contemplating an alter ego.)
Four couples - white shirts; black trousers - are the Butterweek revellers,
their movements hinting at Fokine's folk dances as they circle the stage and
the piano which acquires a strongly dramatic presence. But the piece is
Bhuller's and he shows a brutalised and somehow noble figure, in dancing
that covers a range of dynamics from silkiest phrases to fierce anguish. It
is a superb display of expressive virtuosity.
In Sad Eyes, Alston has linked two Britten scores. The Prelude and fugue, Op
29, written for Boyd Neel, is used for plotless, open-hearted dances for
four couples. The movement is fresh, broad-spanning, unclouded. (Pleasure in
viewing it will increase when the mock-Indian outfits look less like
uniforms.) Then, with the Lacrymae Op. 48, for viola and orchestra, inspired
by a Dowland song, the mood changes as eyes sadden, seeking the rest that
Dowland's text urges.
The dancing couples are unhappy lovers, and at the last Alston allows them
that repose which is the acceptance of suffering. The choreography is
emotional, dense, subtly varied, and though I think the score a fraction too
long, the dance is shaped and performed beautifully.
The final piece was Rumours, Visions, which is Les Illuminations (Britten's
setting of Rimbaud) staged with brilliant economy of means. The excellent
lighting, and gauzy back drop used throughout the evening, was by Peter
Mumford. Costuming, ideally allusive in this
last piece, was by Belinda Ackerman. Alston conflates Rimbaud's poetic
imagery and his fraught relationship with Verlaine. Friedrich Gehrig has the
right mixture of vulnerability and wildness for Rimbaud; Kenneth Tharp's
Verlaine is brooding, watchful. Around them Alston cunningly sets the
strange mob of Rimbaud's dreamings, that wild parade which is announced in
the first song.
Among the several merits of the staging is the fact that it allows our
imaginations to follow those of Britten and Rimbaud: Alston's dances are
hints rather than statements. The drawback to the performance lay in an
orchestral imbalance: after the invocation 'J'ai seul la clef de cette
parade sauvage', I heard not one word of Gunnar Gudbjornsson's account of
the tenor role. The score, from the Britten Sinfonia under Nicholas
Cleobury, was otherwise excellent, as were the interpretations of the Sad
Eyes music.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Technology: Simple idea, big savings - A look at the success
of EMC's electronic filing cabinets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mother of an executive with EMC, the US data storage company, has
problems understanding what her son's company does. He explains the Dollars
782m (Pounds 521m) turnover operation succinctly. 'We make electronic filing
cabinets.' At Dollars 4.1m a throw, this is a gross simplification. But
EMC's rise to eminence in a Dollars 5bn market still largely an IBM fief
owes much to simple ideas.
Disk arrays are the storage component of mainframe computer systems.
Traditionally, the information these large machines handle has been held on
disks resembling long-playing records. EMC moved to smaller 5.25-inch disks
similar to the hard disk inside a personal computer. This meant a massive
reduction in space, and hence the heat generated by the storage system.
Ventilation bills plummeted.
EMC's latest top-of-the-range model stores one terabyte (1,000 gigabytes) of
information - the equivalent of 40,000 four-drawer filing cabinets or 10,000
standard desktop PCs. In the previous generation of disk systems, a terabyte
took up 400 sq ft. The IBM disk storage system holding this much data
occupies as much space as a two-car garage. The EMC model, looking like a
three-door wardrobe filled with shelves of computer disks, occupies 17 sq
ft.
Mike Ruettgers, head of EMC since 1989, claims that a US customer switching
to EMC from IBM will save Dollars 1m over five years in maintenance,
cooling, power and floor space.
In the UK, the information technology arm of British Steel, CMS, has
replaced its IBM data storage products with four EMC units. The last EMC
unit cost Pounds 300,000, but is expected to save CMS Pounds 112,000 in
electricity and air conditioning bills over the next four years.
Ruettgers was hired at a time of crisis for EMC. In 1988, components from a
Japanese supplier started failing. Ruettgers bought in fault-free disk
drives from IBM and installed them free.
Despite a Dollars 100m bill for replacing disk drives, Ruettgers claims most
customers stuck with EMC. The experience left EMC with a paranoid regard for
quality control and testing. Each disk array is now tested for up to 24
days.
While IBM remains a fierce rival, with 52 per cent of the mainframe storage
market, other large computer concerns buy in products from EMC. Bull of
France and Unisys of the US both resell EMC disk arrays in tandem with their
systems.
IBM argues that until now, smaller disk systems have lacked reliability.
While one failure every 15,000 hours might have been tolerable on PCs five
years ago, it would not do for dozens of disks running simultaneously 24
hours a day. Now, IBM is poised to launch a data storage machine running
3.5-inch disks, beating EMC at its own game and gunning for its smaller
rival on price.
Ruettgers thinks EMC can stay ahead by remembering the customer's primary
concern. The enormous data-processing needs of banks and airlines generate
unwelcome bills in support services. Swissair and Direct Line insurance of
the UK are customers. EMC knows its target - '70 per cent of dp (data
processing) dollar is maintenance and enhancement,' says Ruettgers, who
previously worked in the US missile industry.
Market analysts predict nine-fold growth in large data storage capacity by
the end of the decade. Although small, powerful workstations have taken over
many of the mainframe's functions, the information storage needs of service
industries mean vast archives of digital data must be kept somewhere.
Squeezing more data into less space for a lower cost is the perpetual
rallying cry of the IT industry. EMC knows its doubling of turnover between
1992 and 1994 cannot be maintained, but the demand for economical mass
storage is there in abundance.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Technology: The end of the queue - Automated supermarket
checkouts will cut waiting time, writes Della Bradshaw in a series on
electronic retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After steering a packed shopping trolley along busy supermarket aisles on a
Saturday afternoon, there is yet a greater hurdle to overcome: the wait at
the checkout counter. Mindful of such irritation, supermarket bosses are now
considering how to cut the queues using self-service checkout counters and
automated trolleys.
John Hollis, partner at Andersen Consulting, believes it is the push for
better customer service and the need to beat the competition that is driving
such innovations. 'Anyone starting up now would use this kind of
technology,' he says.
Chris Hughes, managing director of the UK's Retail Automation Consultancy,
is more sceptical: 'The main advantage to retailers is that it will cut down
labour costs.'
In the Netherlands, in the Geldermaisen store of Albert Heijn, the largest
Dutch supermarket chain, shoppers are now using a hand-held scanner which
they attach to their trolley as they enter the store. Customers
electronically read the bar-codes on their choice of goods using a scanning
gun. Once shopping is complete, a bill is automatically printed out which
the customer takes to the cashier in order to pay.
Although self-scanning involves extra work for customers, it does mean they
can check the price of each item as it goes in the trolley and keep a
running total of how much they are spending. It also eliminates the need to
unload the items on to the conveyor belt and then put them back into the
trolley at the checkout.
Elsewhere, much of the research effort has gone into automating the conveyor
belt at the checkout so that customers scan their own goods. Retailers in
Scandinavia and the US have been the most eager to install these. But they
could become common throughout Europe within the next five years,
particularly for scanning small numbers of items, such as sandwiches at
lunchtime. 'I have difficulty in seeing someone scan 120 different items
from the monthly shop,' says Terry Fielding, managing director of the UK's
Chiltern Retail Systems.
The basic principle of these checkouts is that the customer passes the goods
over the glass plate in the conveyor belt, a job usually done by the
cashier. Once the task is finished, the customer goes to the cashier to pay.
In the US, various derivations of the basic system have been tested, says
Geoff Beckett, director of business development at Uniquest, supplier of
software systems and services. In the Uniquest check-out, the scanned goods
travel through an archway where they are measured and weighed. If the weight
and shape tally with the information from the scanned bar-codes, the item
travels on; otherwise, it is rejected.
Uniquest has gone further by building in swipe card facilities so that goods
can be paid for electronically. But the popularity of discount coupons in US
stores complicated the process and this scheme has largely been abandoned.
Contrary to expectations, the self-scanning check-outs have proved
particularly popular in the US with elderly people. 'They are convinced that
the cashiers fiddle them. Also they can take their time and can keep a
continuous check on how much they are spending by looking at the sub-total,'
says Beckett.
The popularity of self-scanning checkouts will vary according to the
location and culture of the store, believes John Polidore, director of
front-end operations for Pathmark Supermarkets. It has installed Uniquest
checkout systems in seven of its 150 US stores and plans to introduce a
further two as part of its trial phase.
In some cases customers are eager to scan their own goods, in others they
want someone else to bag the goods and lift them on and off the conveyor
belt.
However, no Pathmark store will be equipped entirely with Uniquest systems,
says Polidore. 'We would like our customers to choose. We see this firstly
as a customer service issue. If the customer likes to use it they'll come to
us. It will increase our customers.' A second advantage is that the
self-scanning system deals more effectively than traditional checkouts with
any sudden rush of customers.
Innovation is continuous. The latest self-service checkouts incorporate
scanners that can read the bar-code through 360`, so that customers can
place the goods in a random fashion on the belt. In a development from
German manufacturer Potrafke, the goods travel on a belt through a
transparent acrylic tunnel where the bar-codes are read.
The advantage to the customer, says Gerald McLucas, managing director of
Potrafke in the UK, is the speed with which the goods are scanned. The
advantage to the retailer is that they get 'two cashiers for the price of
one'. Because the goods scanned have to pass through the tunnel, the system
also helps to prevent shop-lifting.
The potential for higher levels of shop-lifting is still seen as an
important disadvantage of self-scanning systems. But the emphasis on
security varies from country to country, says William Wood-Robertson,
marketing manager with German manufacturer ADS Anker. 'The Americans are
enthusiastic about the technology even though they have a relatively high
crime rate.'
John Pellaumail, director of custom products for the international arm of
Symbol Technologies of the US, which developed the Albert Heijn system in
conjunction with the retailer and the TNO Product Centre, in Delft, believes
there is still a 'psychological barrier to stealing'.
At Albert Heijn, customer trolleys are randomly checked to ensure that
contents match the items listed on the bill. To make customers aware of the
checks, they have to join a 'club' before using the scanners and agree to
the terms.
The club system could have further inherent benefits. 'Because customers
have to be pre-registered members of the club, this could be used by
retailers to build customer loyalty schemes,' says Hughes. He believes the
membership cards issued could become the retailers' equivalent of a 'gold'
card.
The overriding feature of all of today's systems is that each bar-code has
to be read separately. 'In 15 years' time, there probably won't be any
checkouts,' says Fielding. 'If bar-codes could be read electronically, you
could swipe a bank card at the beginning, push the filled trolley through a
loop and your bank account would automatically be debited.'
Earlier this year, the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research in conjunction with the British Technology Group announced that it
had developed Supertag, where each item of shopping would be labelled with a
tag emitting a radio signal. Once the customer finishes shopping, the
trolley is pushed through a gate - similar to the X-ray machine at an
airport - which 'reads' each signal. All the items in a full trolley of
shopping could be individually identified in seconds.
Today the high price of the tags - about 60p each - precludes their use on
packets of tea or tins of baked beans. But, says Peter Hawkes, assistant
director of electronics at BTG, within the next two years, the tags could be
used to secure high value items such as leather jackets.
He believes that as more applications for the Supertag emerge, and costs
drop, the technology will appear in food stores, starting with discount
warehouses, 'where they can tag the whole carton, not just the can'.
Even more revolutionary would be for customers to sit in front of a computer
terminal in the supermarket coffee shop and select packaged goods by
pointing to pictures on the screen. The customer would pay the cashier and
drive round to the delivery point to have the goods loaded into the car -
bypassing the trolley and check-out belt altogether.
As Hollis points out, revolutionary though the concept sounds, 'the
technology for this sort of system is already here'.

FT  16 JUN 94 / People: 'General' Goehtz off to NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank has captured Hans Goehtz, one of Deutsche Bank's
15 'generals' and head of its global foreign exchange, money markets and
precious metals division since 1990. At NatWest Markets he will be
responsible for all continental European treasury activities.
As a 'Direktor mit Generalvollmacht', Goehtz was just one rung below
Deutsche's hallowed 'Vorstand' or management board and stood a fair chance
of being a candidate if a board vacancy arose.
However, rumour has it that Goehtz, 45, decided to look elsewhere when it
became clear that another 'general', Bernd-Albrecht von Maltzan, the head of
Deutsche's securities sales and trading, was likely to gain the upper hand
when their two trading areas were consolidated into one large group. Maltzan
took up his position last year when Barthold von Ribbentrop left to set up
an investment fund.
Based in Frankfurt, Goehtz will develop NatWest's local capacity as well as
oversee the large dealing volume which flows into London from the dealing
rooms in Madrid, Milan and Frankfurt. He will report to Paul Winchester,
regional director for UK and European treasury.

FT  16 JUN 94 / People: Pressure of work forces non-executive directors to
resign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Proof that Brian Walsh's new job as vice chairman of TI Group is more than a
cosmetic change of title. Walsh, who joined from GKN as TI's finance
director in May 1993, is shedding his only non-executive directorship
following last week's reshuffle at TI.
Walsh, 50, is resigning after less than two years on the board of the
Cookson Group. Although Cookson's board only meets eight or nine times a
year Walsh feels that he no longer has time to do the job properly given his
new responsibilities at TI where he has assumed responsibility for the
operations of the group hq.
He joined the Cookson board when he was still at GKN and where he had been
doing the finance director's job for several years. 'My calendar is always
pretty full,' says Walsh, who expects it to get even busier now that he is
being called to represent the company as vice-chairman. Walsh chairs
Cookson's audit committee and has just returned from a four-day board trip
around Cookson's US operations.
He reckons that he spends at least three days a month on Cookson business.
It is understood that Cookson's non-executive directors get paid between
Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 20,000 a year for their services.
Walsh's decision to resign his only outside directorship at a time when many
executives are being encouraged to take on such jobs will add to speculation
that he is emerging as a serious contender as a future chief executive of
TI.
In a similar move, John Sadler, who has recently become chairman of Pearl
Group, has decided that because time is limited, he should resign as
non-executive chairman of the Alexon Group after the agm next Monday.
He will be succeeded by Patrick Cooper, already on the board; Michael Adams,
a non-executive director of Allders, also joins the board.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Wanted: team spirit
 -Saatchi &amp; Saatchi North America's new head has a tough task. Richard
Tomkins meets Bill Muirhead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ugly, yes. Embarrassing, certainly. But the widely reported feud between
Maurice Saatchi, chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, and Charlie Scott, the chief
executive, is arguably just a sideshow compared with the advertising group's
most pressing problem: its poor performance in the US.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi may be UK-based, but as a global advertising group, its
most important market is the one where most of the world's biggest
multi-national corporations are based - and that lies on the other side of
the Atlantic.
Yet Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, the parent company's biggest US agency,
has been floundering. In spite of a buoyant US economy, it lost more
business than it won last year. A 1.6 per cent decline in gross income sent
it from number four to number seven position in Advertising Age magazine's
league table of US agencies.
Worse, revenues are set to dip again this year after the loss of the
important account for Helene Curtis hair care products at the end of 1993.
One man has already paid the price: Robert Kennedy, chief executive of
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi North America, who was forced to resign in January. Now,
two more heads have rolled: those of Harvey Hoffenberg and Rich Pounder,
respectively the chairman and vice-chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising's New York office, its biggest in North America.
So what is wrong with Saatchi in the US? Simple, says one rival: they just
haven't been running the business properly. 'The client relationships aren't
good enough, the creative isn't good enough. It's what it always is: not
doing it right. You lose business when you are not paying attention and you
win business when you are.'
Some industry observers go further, saying poor morale has been at the root
of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising's problems. One Wall Street analyst says
Harvey Hoffenberg, the New York boss, was disliked by those who worked for
him, though a Saatchi employee puts it less cruelly. 'The trouble is,
Harvey's not a very upbeat person, and in an agency, you've got to be upbeat
and buzzy. That was really not happening here. People were kind of fearful.'
In such a a people business, such an atmosphere would clearly be unhelpful.
And as the agency repeatedly failed to win new business, morale declined
even further. 'The lifeblood of any advertising agency is new business,
whether new business from existing clients or new business from clients
outside, and we were just abysmal at getting it,' says a Saatchi insider.
Meanwhile, Saatchi's US executives were doing little to endear themselves to
an increasingly cost-conscious parent company with their unusually large
salaries. Kennedy was getting Dollars 800,000 (Pounds 533,333) a year plus
perks and bonuses, and Hoffenberg was hardly worse off with basic pay of
Dollars 700,000 a year. 'They were ridiculously overpaid - outrageously so,'
says a rival agency.
The new head of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi North America is Bill Muirhead, a highly
regarded Saatchi veteran who has been parachuted into New York from his
previous job in London as head of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Europe. He acknowledges
that morale has been low.
'The agency is really an amalgamation of two long-established American
agencies, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample and Compton Communications,' he says.
'When I arrived here I found a situation not dissimilar to the one I found
at British Airways (a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi client) when I started working on
that in 1982.
'On the outside it was British Airways but on the inside it was still BOAC
and BEA (BA's forerunners). The two cultures had never been brought
together.'
At Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, Muirhead says, the result is that people
haven't been working as a team. 'People have been split up: they've tended
to work in isolation from each other. There's been no vision for the
company, no real focus. Those are the things I've got to put right.'
Muirhead believes one way of building team spirit is to promote from within
'rather than the mercenary, hired gun thing' so that the people running the
company have all grown up with it. He did that in London, he says.
'We will bring in some fresh blood as we go forward, but there are a lot of
very good people here - probably a lot of people that are better than the
people I had in London. It's just that they haven't been focused on the
right things and haven't been properly motivated.'
Muirhead seems to regard the London operation as a model for New York. 'What
we have there is a successful agency producing terrific work that is a fun
place to be; so if we could replicate what we have there, that would be
great.'
That kind of talk has irritated some in the US advertising industry, who
resent the implication that the British know better. Some Saatchi people in
the US are also said to be unhappy about the 'British invasion' of their
ranks, represented not just by Muirhead's arrival in New York but by the
appointment of several British people at Backer Spielvogel Bates, Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi's other US advertising agency.
Muirhead says this is nonsense: nationality is irrelevant. And anyway, he's
Australian.
In any event, the people he has just appointed to become chief executive of
the New York office and to sort out the creative department are both from
other parts of the US operation - respectively, Michael Jeary, previously
chief executive in San Francisco, and Stanley Becker, chief creative officer
at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS/Pacific in Los Angeles.
The top executive of a rival agency says it clearly is not ideal that
Muirhead comes from outside the US. 'Putting UK-experienced people in there
to sort things out is obviously more difficult than if you put a native in
there. But Muirhead's a talented guy. If anybody can put it right, he can.'
For Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's sake, he had better be right. As Muirhead himself
acknowledges: 'More than 60 per cent of the world's multi-national
advertisers are based here, in North America. If we cannot expand here, then
whatever we do in Europe will be irrelevant.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Roots versus
lifestyle in a changing country - A look at the nature and direction of
advertising in the new South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty we are free at last,'
thundered a recent commercial on South African Television. It showed the
flags and dates when various African countries gained independence, before
arriving at South Africa in 1994. It closed with a black man in the
speaker's chair in parliament with a voice quoting Martin Luther King's now
famous phrase, also used by president Nelson Mandela in his victory speech.
The commercial was for Sales House, a clothes retail chain, and the campaign
was by Ogilvy &amp; Mather Rightford, the country's biggest agency. But far from
being seen as a celebration of the new South Africa, the campaign was
condemned by some leading figures in South Africa's advertising industry as
a throwback to the days of apartheid.
Made in the spirit of 'black consciousness' and 'black pride', the
advertisement followed on from two others in the series, one with a strident
black 'man of Africa' and another showing a confident and assertive 'woman
of Africa'.
'Times may be changing but I regard these advertisements as white people
pretending to understand the black African psyche,' says Peter Vundla, a
former employee of O&amp;M and now managing director of Herdbuoys, South
Africa's first black agency. 'It's a romantic view that does not speak to
us. They may be aimed at black shoppers but frankly we see them as a joke.'
Controversy over the Sales House campaign reflects a wider debate on the
nature and direction of advertising in the new South Africa. For years, the
country's agencies concentrated on communicating with the white community
which makes up around 14 per cent of the population.
Sophisticated campaigns for everything from cars to mass consumer products
were mainly in English and Afrikaans. There was little to show a black
population existed in the same country or indeed, that blacks were
consumers. Those wishing to reach a cross section of the population
generally ran separate campaigns: racial mixing in a commercial was rare.
Change began in the late 1970s, with a growing awareness and recognition of
the rising black urban population and its increasing consumption of products
once seen as the preserve of whites. The process was helped by pioneering
multi-racial advertisements from South African Breweries in the 1980s and
gathered pace with the political changes of the 1990s.
Today, there are those who argue that advertising, for so long dominated by
one race, should move from being 'Euro-centric', that is, made by and from a
white person's point of view to 'Afro-centric', taking on the values and
perspective of the black South African.
Nearly 60 per cent of Sales House customers are black and O&amp;M has been in
charge of its campaigns since 1986. However, the more strident black pride
campaign has only been running for three years.
Robyn Putter, creative director of O&amp;M Rightford, has become identified with
'Afro-centric' advertising. He says: 'This is a campaign that people
identify with. Black people do not need to apologise for who they are and
we've tried to bring this out.' He points to requests to run the same
advertisements in the US as proof of the success in reaching black people.
But Reg Lascaris, managing director of Hunt Lascaris, which ran the
successful ANC election campaign, counters: 'Black consumers don't want to
be seen as 'man of Africa'.' He advocates the use of marketing bands, based
on occupation and education. 'What matters is a person's level of
sophistication. Whether they are black or white does not matter. It did in
the past, but not now.'
Vundla suggests that understanding black people is the single most important
factor for any agency in South Africa. 'Nothing has changed. Most agencies
here don't even have black people at senior level nor have people in them
even ventured into a township. How can they claim they understand the black
majority market and how to reach them?' he says.
Explaining his departure from O&amp;M, he says: 'I think this is where agencies
like ours can make a difference. We know our people and how to communicate
to them irrespective of economic level, yet we are not offering an inferior
service. We use first world methodology to target what is, after all, a
third world market.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / People: EEF decides on Mackenzie
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Engineering Employers Federation has appointed Graham Mackenzie
director-general, finally drawing a line under the uncertainty prompted by
the surprise departure of former dg Neil Johnson and the possible merger
with the Confederation of British Industry.
Mackenzie, who was president of the EEF for two years to April, has been
acting director-general since January. The new appointment takes effect from
July 1.
Johnson left the EEF at the end of November, a few weeks after Mackenzie had
quit as chief executive of UES Holdings, the Rotherham-based steel and
forgings group. Since then, Mackenzie has been increasingly active at the
EEF.
The organisation has known since February that it would need to appoint a
new director-general, once it became clear that a plan to merge its central
functions with the CBI had collapsed.
A more limited partnership based on a joint programme of alliance with the
CBI's National Manufacturing Council will also not take place, although the
EEF and CBI will continue to co-operate.
Mackenzie, 50, lacks some of Johnson's affability but is an effective and
articulate communicator, and is keen to maintain and develop the EEF's
profile.
Before joining UES in 1990, he worked for the TI Group from 1967 to 1989,
joining as a graduate trainee and rising to become a main board director.
Between 1981 and 1983, he was seconded by TI to the government's Central
Policy Review Staff.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Accountancy Column: Crying wolf too often over the
'liability crisis' - A look at a lengthy but ultimately one-sided debate on
an important professional topic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three concepts associated with the creative accountancy term 'extraordinary
item' could rarely be more appropriately used than in connection with a
recent issue of a US academic journal: significant, but one-sided and
questionable.
The Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy, published by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has devoted an entire issue to the
liability crisis and its impact on accounting, based in turn on papers given
at a conference on the subject in April last year*.
There is little doubt that the topic is extremely important, and it is
welcome to see it debated at such length in an initiative taken by an
academic institution. The disappointment is the lack of balance in the
analysis it contains.
It is particularly ironic to see some of the dangerous assumptions made
without supporting evidence by academics of economics and accounting, who
have a reputation based on objectivity, rigour and numerical analysis.
Take this comment from Mr William Kinney, chair at the graduate school of
business from the University of Texas at Austin: 'It is fair to say that
litigation threatens the continued existence of independent auditing as we
know it today'.
Or - from the same author - that many claims against auditors 'may be
non-meritorious', simply because the average value of legal settlements is a
small proportion of the average value of claims.
Take the oft-repeated but rarely analysed mantra that the downfall of
Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the large US accounting firm that collapsed in 1990,
was caused by litigation issues. In fact, a number of other factors were at
least as important.
The conference organisers clearly made an impressive attempt to make the
debate wide-ranging and relevant to policy by including professionals in
practice as well as academics. Sadly, the rhetoric of senior representatives
of four of the 'Big Six' firms (which have reportedly spent Dollars 2m
apiece lobbying for litigation reform) rings a little hollow.
There is an almost suspiciously common line taken by four of the firms. They
all talk about the personal pressures caused by lawsuits and the exposure to
unlimited liability, and the reluctance of firms to continue to audit higher
risk clients. They suggest (though none provides any examples) that
promising accountants are rejecting the offer of partnership for fear of the
consequences.
Mr Larry Weinbach, managing partner-chief executive of Arthur Andersen, says
small and medium-size firms are reducing the audits they undertake to reduce
their liability exposure. Yet most of the large lawsuits are against larger
firms.
Similar points come from Mr Michael Cook, chairman and chief executive of
Deloitte &amp; Touche. Yet his stance is in apparent contrast to the view of Mr
Ed Kangas, managing partner, who in a more general interview with the FT
last year did not even raise litigation reform when he was asked to list the
most important challenges facing his firm.
All this is not to say that much of the sympathy towards the current
litigation situation in the US is unjustified. It is just that many of the
arguments are far less relevant and need to be applied with considerably
greater caution in the UK and other jurisdictions.
For example, the firms call for 'fee-shifting' - also known as 'the English
rules' - by which unsuccessful litigants must pay the winners' legal fees if
the claim was frivolous, in place of each side paying its own costs. They
want the elimination of bonuses paid to representatives of class action
suits which act as incentives to the emergence of professional plaintiffs.
They also criticise the litigiousness prevalent in the US, with plaintiffs
rejecting any personal responsibilty for loss, in a process characterised by
Mr Richard Breeden, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), as 'heads I win, tails I sue'.
Yet ironically, Mr Breeden himself (regrettably absent from this journal)
does not support proposals to reform joint and several liability, by which
one defendant can be required to pay damages disproportionate to the degree
of culpability. He argues that it 'strikes a reasonable balance' between the
interests of auditors and those of taxpayers and investors harmed by poorly
audited companies.
Two senior officials at Ernst &amp; Young provide (though irritatingly without
naming names) a useful summary of legal precedents. They highlight an
English-based company which offered shares only to UK residents but sued its
English advisers in Montana to avoid the risk of having to pay the other
side's costs. It even floated a zero coupon loan note to fund the
litigation, which will pay bondholders a percentage of any award.
Nevertheless, the Journal does contain some excellent articles. One of the
best pieces is written by Mr Robert Elliott, assistant to the chairman of
KPMG Peat Marwick, who argues that 'hard data should replace anecdote'.
He suggests that research is needed into: whether users value audits; who
gains from litigation awards; whether settlements disproportionate to fault
improves auditors' performance; and what has caused the crisis.
The problem is that the accounting firms and their insurers, so willing to
call for reform, have been equally reluctant to provide such information. At
least one group of respected academics in the UK trying to research
litigation reform has been refused access to professional indemnity data on
the large firms, for example.
Mr Walter Schuetze, chief accountant at the SEC, argues the liability crisis
is a function less of auditing failures than accounting failures. Citing the
collapse of the Savings &amp; Loans industry, he says tighter standards rather
than ones leaving much to judgment would have prevented a position in which
'management puts on its rose-coloured glasses, and the auditor is unable
prove that his or her client is wrong'.
Mr Weinbach makes an interesting point in suggesting that litigation is
forcing 'defensive auditing', in which - like doctors carrying out needless
tests - accountants are forced to spend increased time checking and
re-checking at the expense of efficiency: a process that adds much to cost
but little to value.
This needs further examination. After all, conducting needless tests even
when judgment dictates they are not necessary is one thing; but ensuring
financial statements are accurate within reasonable levels of confidence is
quite another.
Mr Cook sketches out different scenarios for the profession, including one
in which the additional audit costs for clients without any litigation
reform would be 25 per cent to 50 per cent higher. More detail would
certainly be helpful.
Thomas Lys, from the Kellogg graduate school of management at Northwestern
University, reveals a sharp rise in lawsuits against auditors - but the
total from 1960 to 1985 was still only 335.
One perspective sadly lacking throughout the articles is of those who have
lost money in companies where the audit report was inadequate. An important
missing topic is analysing precisely what limits to compensation would be
feasible given the firms' stated willingness to pay damages when they have
done wrong. It seems that at least one more academic conference on the
subject could be easily justified.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Ariel is back as top of soaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ariel soap powder, produced by Procter &amp; Gamble, was the consumer goods
brand with the second largest retail sales last year, beating Unilever's
Persil into third place for the first time since 1990.
The top-selling brand in 1993 was Coca-Cola, which clocked up sales of more
than Pounds 411m in the UK. Ariel's sales were Pounds 238m, just ahead of
Persil's Pounds 236m. Advertising spending on Ariel last year was Pounds
22.3m, compared with Persil's Pounds 18.8m.
The two soap giants are battling over Unilever's recently launched Persil
Power. Procter says its rival's new product rots clothes - a claim
vigorously contested by Unilever.
The brand ranking figures have been produced by Nielsen, the market research
organisation, and are published today in the trade magazine Marketing. They
show an overall 3.1 per cent average growth in retail sales for the top 50
brands. The magazine says the figures disprove 'the accepted wisdom that
fast-moving consumer goods brands are in trouble'.
The figures were collected too soon to reflect the impact that the launch of
Sainsbury's Classic Cola had on Coca-Cola, but the retailer's brand was
estimated earlier this month to be settling down to about 60 per cent of
cola sales in Sainsbury's stores.
The fastest-growing brand last year, with a 93 per cent increase in sales,
was Patak's Indian Foods.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Spurs faces further Premier League probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, WILLIAM LEWIS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tottenham Hotspur faces continuing investigations by the Premier League over
an allegation that it handed over a large illicit payment to ease the
transfer to the club from Nottingham Forest of England player Teddy
Sheringham.
The football club - fined a record Pounds 600,000 this week by the Football
Association - said yesterday that it was considering a possible appeal
against the FA's ruling.
The FA action was taken after allegations that the club made interest-free
loans of more than Pounds 400,000 to players between 1985 and 1989, in
contravention of FA rules.
Some of the players who received the loans - handed out immediately before
they joined the club to induce them to sign - did not expect the cash to be
repaid, according to a September 1992 report to the club from accountants
Touche Ross, which has acted as Tottenham's tax advisers.
In its ruling the FA also banned the club from the FA Cup and deducted 12
points from its score in the Premier League next season. The 12-point
deduction opens the possibility of relegation next year from the league to
the Football League. According to industry estimates this and exclusion from
the FA Cup could cost the club several million pounds in lost sponsorship
revenues and TV income.
The club said yesterday that it had settled a 1992 Inland Revenue claim that
it owed at least Pounds 500,000 in tax. It added: 'The payment made was well
below that figure.'
It emerged yesterday that the Revenue has recovered more than Pounds 10m in
out-of-court settlements for unpaid tax from football clubs in
investigations in the last few years.
In recent years at least ten clubs have paid additional tax in response to
Revenue investigations or after they have gone voluntarily to tax
inspectors.
A large number of other professional clubs are under investigation by a
special team of Revenue inspectors based in Solihull, West Midlands.
The Revenue will not confirm details of any investigations, but it said
yesterday: 'One court case can generate a lot of activity. We have raised a
substantial sum from a number of clubs.'
On the London stock market yesterday the club's shares fell 17p to 63p soon
after the opening, but then rallied to close unchanged at 80p.
The club said yesterday that it would be taking advice on possible legal
action against past employees and directors. It added that it had been
penalised after volunteering information to the FA about loans and payments
made to players before Mr Alan Sugar, the current club chairman, took
control in 1991. The club said: 'It is like finding a dead body in the
attic, turning it over to the police and then being done for the crime
yourself.'
Insiders believe that the club's case was weakened because of the continuing
presence on its board of Mr Douglas Alexiou and Mr Tony Berry. Both were
directors while loans and ex gratia payments were made to players. Neither
man was available for comment yesterday.
A report prepared by accountants Touche Ross for the club's board last March
shows the extent of the loans and ex gratia payments to players since 1985.
They include Paul Gascoigne, who received a Pounds 30,000 loan and a Pounds
70,000 ex gratia payment, Paul Stewart, who was lent Pounds 75,000, and
goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, who received a Pounds 50,000 loan. The sanctions
against the club come after years of allegations that top soccer clubs
routinely make illicit payments to players and managers to facilitate the
transfer of leading footballers.
Mr Alex Fynn, an independent football analyst and author, said: 'Payments
which evade the FA's regulations are quite widespread. Clubs are in a
cash-rich business and spend highly on footballer's wages and transfers
because they are worried about failure.'
The FA said: 'We have heard many allegations about this kind of thing
(illicit payments) but the evidence is lacking. We are not involved in any
other investigations into other Premier League clubs.'
Mr Sugar will announce the club's response to the FA's ruling this morning.
A spokesman said yesterday: 'We have been considering all the options and do
not want to rush a knee-jerk reaction.'
Last night Mr David Walker, the co-ordinator of a supporters' group, said he
had begun legal action to challenge the FA's decision and to postpone
enforcement of the judgment.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Welsh agency to examine further redundancy deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Welsh Development Agency yesterday told the Commons public accounts
committee that it is investigating what appear to be excessive redundancy
payments of about Pounds 600,000.
The series of payments were made between 1983 and 1989, and are separate to
those made under an unauthorised redundancy scheme for which the publicly
funded agency was strongly criticised by the committee last year.
In a letter to the committee, Mr Barry Hartop, the agency's new chief
executive, said that he was also investigating several other issues from the
period 1989 to 1992. These concerned value for money involving the agency's
business services division and some tax and pension matters.
Mr Hartop became chief executive in March when Mr Philip Head resigned after
the committee's report. In his letter to the committee's chairman, Mr Robert
Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, he said that he had notified the
Welsh Office and the National Audit Office of his concerns.
It is understood that Mr Hartop has not formed a conclusion on these issues,
but believed he should notify the committee of his actions.
The WDA takes the leading role in the economic development and regeneration
of Wales. Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, who took over as its chairman last summer
from Dr Gwyn Jones, yesterday said that the agency had taken serious note of
the committee's report and the level of accountability which was expected.
'Investigations are not limited in scope,' he said. 'They apply to any
possible area where there may be cause for doubt as to whether matters have
been properly dealt with.'
In its report last July the public accounts committee said that the agency
had introduced a redundancy scheme outside local government terms. A public
body, the MPs said, should not be able to 'pick and choose' the best terms
on offer from superannuation schemes to which it did not belong.
The committee said that the scheme had incurred a loss of Pounds 1.4m and
had not been approved by the Welsh Office. 'We regard it as quite
unsatisfactory that the agency did not follow this clear legal requirement,'
the MPs said.
Other management practices were criticised and the committee said that
standards had been well below what parliament had a right to expect.
Mr Rowe-Beddoe has been trying to rebuild public confidence in the agency,
which is now being restructured. Yesterday's letter is understood to be
intended to show that the new management team will bring to light any
matters requiring scrutiny.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Political Notebook: Major grits his teeth to shuffle cabinet
pack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prime ministers don't like reshuffles. Choosing who sits around the cabinet
table is the most powerful prerogative of their office. But contrary to
intuitive wisdom they rarely enjoy exercising it.
Even Baroness Thatcher found it hard to sack the disaffected and the
incompetent in her governments. She did preside over one or two spectacular
reshuffles - as when she cleared out the 'wets' in the autumn of 1981. But
she was not as confident in wielding the knife as it may appear in
retrospect - witness the survival of Lord Walker.
Mr John Major's track record suggests that he finds it even harder. He did
grit his teeth last year to sack Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor. But the
impact of what was meant to be seen as a strong re-assertion of his
authority was undercut by the timidity of the accompanying changes.
His time in Downing Street has left the impression of a prime minister in
the thrall of the competing factions in his party. Promotion of a good
performer on the centre-left of the party must always be balanced by
advancement of someone on the right. Mr Major has made no secret of his
frustration - most notably with his tirade against the cabinet 'bastards'.
The essential task of a reshuffle should be to improve the quality of
government. This administration needs more competent, steadier ministers at
all levels. But Mr Major's position is such that now he has announced his
plans - and foreshadowed in the process a period of dangerous instability
during the next month - he must also persuade his critics that he can be
master in his own house.
Lady Thatcher recounts with satisfaction in her memoirs that after her
September 1981 reshuffle The Times commented in its editorial column that
the impression left was that of 'the indelible stamp and style of the prime
minister herself'. Mr Major needs a similar review.
That brings us to the personalities. The pivotal figure in deciding the
shape of the reshuffle is Mr Douglas Hurd. The foreign secretary's recent
carefree demeanour has been of someone preparing to move to a more tranquil
career. But he has told friends that he is not ready to jump from the
Titanic. Before leaving - probably next year - he wants to drop a few
anchors for for-eign policy in the late 1990s.
So Mr Major's room for manoeuvre may well be limited. Mr Kenneth Clarke will
remain chancellor. Mr Michael Howard has not had a good year, but seems safe
at the Home Office.
With those three great offices of state accounted for, the realistic option
is for a radical shake-up further along the cabinet table. Sir Norman
Fowler, the party chairman, will leave one vacancy. But Mr Major needs three
or four more.
Mr John Patten at education, Mr Peter Brooke at heritage, Mr John MacGregor
at transport, and Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords, are among the most
obvious candidates for dismissal or retirement. If Mr Major heeds the advice
of his soul-mates he might sack a 'bastard' - pour encourager les autres.
But the fate of the friendless Mr Patten will be regarded by Tory MPs and
ministers alike as the litmus test of the shake-up. If he stays in the
cabinet Mr Major will be branded weak. If the prime minister keeps Mr Graham
Bright, his parliamentary private secretary, the epithets will be a great
deal harsher.
The candidates for promotion to the cabinet are obvious enough - Mr Stephen
Dorrell at the Treasury, Dr Brian Mawhinney at health, Mr Jonathan Aitken at
defence and, possibly, Mr David Davis, the public services minister. If Mr
Major is imaginative he will add Mr David Curry and Mr Jeremy Hanley to that
list. Along the corridor, Lord Hesketh is said to be keen to return to
government as leader of the Lords.
As to the redistribution of portfolios among those who retain their places,
the most important appointment will be that of party chairman. Mr Major is
being urged by some to press Mr Michael Heseltine into the post. But it is
more likely that he will appoint a close political ally.
One intriguing possibility is Mr Tony Newton, the underrated leader of the
House of Commons. Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, could move into Mr
Newton's slot. Mr David Hunt is also in the race for the chairmanship.
Elsewhere, Mr Michael Portillo can expect his own department, although Mr
Major will not want to give the standard-bearer of Thatcherism too big a
promotion.
But when the dust settles in mid-July it will not be so much each individual
appointment that counts. His administration has been beset by a lack of
constancy for which Mr Major has often shouldered too much of the blame. Now
he needs a team that will offer both competence and loyalty. Reshuffles do
not have the miraculous qualities often ascribed to them. But this one will
count.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Police arms stall Channel tunnel accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and France have failed to reach agreement on the policing of the
Channel tunnel, opening up the prospect of further delays to the start of a
full passenger service.
Senior officials from the Home Office and France's Ministry of the Interior,
meeting in London, were unable to agree on the powers of French police
stationed at the shuttle terminals at Cheriton, on the English side of the
Channel.
Under a British proposal governing security arrangements for a fully
operational Channel tunnel service French police would be allowed to carry
their weapons only when stationed at fixed 'control' zones in Cheriton.
The French have agreed that their officers should hand over their weapons
before travelling on through-trains arriving at or departing from Waterloo.
But the French still believe that their police should be able to carry guns
as they walk or drive between the tourist and freight terminals at Cheriton.
The British are insisting that guns outside the control zones should be
locked up in special containers.
Underlying the British position is the wish to restrict as far as possible
the visible movement of French armed police on UK soil.
The UK view is that unrestricted movement could lead to the danger of
weapons being used, which might at the same time trigger complicated legal
disputes.
The Home Office is also thought to be reluctant to fuel the debate in the UK
about whether British police should be more widely armed.
The French Ministry of the Interior blames the disagreement on cultural
differences. For the French police carrying guns is traditional and there is
some resistance at a political level to cede too much to the British over a
project that cuts across national boundaries.
A Home Office spokesman described Tuesday's talks as 'inconclusive' although
'both sides are moving in the right direction'.
He added: 'This is an issue that needs to be thrashed out before the Channel
tunnel becomes fully operational.'
A further meeting at official level has been fixed for the end of the month.
Some French and British police officers fear privately that the guns problem
is becoming a political football because of an issue of national
sovereignty.
They say that co-operation between the two forces involved in the Channel
tunnel project is good and open to flexible arrangements.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Legal ombudsman warns on levels of service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The campaign by the Law Society and Solicitors Complaints Bureau to crack
down on fraud by solicitors was diverting the bureau from its primary task
of investigating complaints about solicitors' work, the Legal Services
Ombudsman said yesterday.
Mr Michael Barnes said - while presenting his third annual report - that
nearly half the bureau's resources were devoted to dealing with the minority
of complaints involving default and dishonesty by solicitors.
He said: 'The impression I have is that this shift of resources has taken
place at the expense of the bureau's ability actually to investigate
ordinary run-of-the-mill complaints of poor service, delay and so forth.'
Mr Barnes said that in its early years the bureau had been overwhelmed by
the number of investigations and it had resorted to standard responses,
local conciliation and referring complaints back to solicitors to deal with
under their own internal procedures.
But that attempt to find other ways of dealing with complaints may have gone
too far, he said.
Mr Barnes welcomed proposals by the Bar to extend its complaints system to
enable it to award compensation for poor service by barristers.
The ombudsman, who looks at the way complaints against barristers,
solicitors and licensed conveyancers are handled by their professional
bodies, received 1,235 new complaints last year, similar to the 1992 figure.
Mr Barnes ordered lawyers to pay compensation in 42 cases and professional
bodies to pay compensation in 20 cases. In 84 cases he recommended that the
professional body should reconsider the complaint. The average amount of
compensation recommended was Pounds 427 and the highest Pounds 3,000.

FT  16 JUN 94 / London's image at risk, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London relies on 'history and ambience' to maintain its position as a world
financial centre, says a report by the Institute for Metropolitan Studies, a
research group.
The report, based on interviews with 40 senior executives of banks,
insurance companies and other financial institutions, says: 'The sense that
London is slipping and the lack of any overall strategy are strongly felt by
those people who in the coming years will be taking the decision to stay or
leave.'
The report stresses London's strengths in attracting financial-services
companies, including its geographical position bridging Tokyo and New York,
its language, which is the language of international financial business, and
English law, which is widely used for international banking contracts.
It says, however, that maintaining London's positive image was critical.
'Should this belief (in London) falter, many businesses in the financial
sector which operate in London because of it, would themselves begin to
disappear, setting up an accelerating spiral of decline,' the report says.
The report says that London needs public and private investment and a
powerful, accountable authority with a long-term overview of transport,
housing and employment.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Property services grow by 15.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK market for property services grew by 15.5 per cent to Pounds 974m
last year, following two years of contraction, according to a report on
chartered surveyors by the Economic Development Briefing, a research group.
The chartered surveyors' survey reports that almost 10 per cent of clients
expect to make more use of chartered surveyors and estate agents in the next
12 months, while 5.5 per cent foresee a reduced need for outside property
advice.
Demand is expected to increase most sharply for investment deals, building
surveying, lettings, developments and planning advice. More moderate
increases are forecast for rating, investment and funding advice, property
management and project management.
The demand for portfolio management is likely to remain static, while plant
and machinery services may see a slight fall in demand.
The survey found that the most highly recommended surveying firms were DTZ
Debenham Thorpe, followed by Chesterton and King Sturge.
The survey involved 907 companies, which last year paid out Pounds 300.5m in
fees and commission.
In a separate report, the Economic Development Briefing estimates that the
value of all property services provided for and by the public sector was
Pounds 120m last year.
Employment in public sector property departments has declined by more than
10 per cent in the past year and is expected to fall by another 10 per cent
by the middle of next year.
The government's requirements to put property-related services out to tender
should help professional firms gain a larger share of the public sector
property services market.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Heathrow 'must be focus for expansion'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's Heathrow airport must remain the focus of plans to expand runway
capacity in the south-east, says a report published yesterday by the
Chartered Institute of Transport.
The institute, the professional body representing the transport industry,
says that it has found 'major deficiencies' in a 1993 Department of
Transport report which said that Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted or Luton
offered worthwhile prospects for accommodating a new runway. The report
concluded Heathrow would provide the greatest benefits but would also
involve the demolition of 3,300 homes and raise noise levels for 250,000
people.
The institute insists in its report that the 'mega airport' for the
south-east must be Heathrow because of its pre-eminent position and because
of the international trend towards greater centralisation based on major hub
airports.
The CIT says that a pair of close, parallel runways would provide additional
capacity similar to that projected for the single runway suggested in the
DoT's own report. It says they could probably be constructed wholly within
the existing airport perimeter.
The report rejects the idea that total UK air traffic will be the same if
runway capacity is provided at airports other than Heathrow. Mr Stephen
Wheatcroft, chairman of the CIT working party which drew up the report said:
'We believe that diversion to other European airports will result in
substantial loss to the UK economy.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / Bucks joins councils on abolition list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buckinghamshire yesterday became the seventh county council this week to be
recommended for abolition by the Local Government Council for England.
But unrest in the counties which have already been threatened with abolition
overshadowed the announcement.
Several district councils, which have been the strongest supporters of
abolishing the two-tier system of local government, now believe that leaving
the current structure untouched would be better than adopting the
commission's recommendations.
Cambridge city council is planning a legal challenge to the commission's
recommendations for Cambridgeshire - which would abolish the county and
split it into three all-purpose authorities - and hopes to receive the
backing of the county's other councils.
The commission has two alternative recommendations which it will put to
local residents, but all involve abolishing the county council and merging
Cambridge city with surrounding rural districts.
Mr Simon Sedgwick-Jell, leader of Cambridge, said that Cambridge residents
were in effect being denied any choice. He also complained that most
councils in the county had called for the two-tier status quo to remain as
their second preference, but the commission was not presenting this as a
viable option.
West Oxfordshire district council, which under the commission's proposals is
to merge with Cherwell district council following the break-up of
Oxfordshire county council, will campaign to keep the two-tier system.
The council's working party on the local government review said it believed
that service delivery would be disrupted 'over many years', estimated costs
were 'unreliable and likely to be greater than suggested', and council tax
would increase if the new plans were implemented.
The commission has made a similar proposal for Buckinghamshire. Its
preferred option is that the county should be split into three all-purpose
unitary authorities which would combine the powers of the existing county
and the lower-tier district councils.
They would be Milton Keynes (based on its existing district boundaries);
Aylesbury Vale (also based on current boundaries); and a merger of Wycombe,
Chiltern and South Bucks.
As a second option, the commission suggests that Milton Keynes should be
made a unitary council on its own, while the rest of the county is covered
by the existing two tiers, with Buckinghamshire county council - the only
Conservative-controlled county in the UK - still controlling education and
social services.
Mr Kenneth Ross, chairman of the county council, said he favoured the latter
choice.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Pledge of Pounds 8.9m to cut fishing fleet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A total of Pounds 8.9m is to be made available this year for fishermen who
want to leave the industry as part of a plan to reduce Britain's fishing
capacity by 19 per cent by 1996, the government announced yesterday.
The funding is the latest tranche of a Pounds 25m decommissioning programme
which came into force last year. The scheme had been put on ice after a High
Court challenge by fishermen to controversial government plans which would
limit the number of days they would be able spend at sea.
In December the High Court referred the case to the European Court. Mr
Michael Jack, fisheries minister, said he was putting the outcome of the
European court case to one side.
He said: 'We've thought very carefully about what the industry said in the
court case and we're trying to work together with them on conserving fish
stocks.'
The government is discussing technical measures to preserve fish stocks such
as changing the design of nets to allow young fish to escape. Mr Jack also
plans to monitor whether remaining vessels in the fleet are fishing harder
to compensate for those leaving the industry.
He said: 'We have to make certain there have been genuine reductions in
fishing to make decommissioning worthwhile.
'We also have to evaluate carefully technical conservation measures to make
sure they work before they are implemented.'
Last year 135 vessels were taken out of business from a fleet of 11,000.
This cut capacity by less than 5 per cent.
Fishermen were sceptical yesterday that decommissioning could achieve the
capacity cuts required by the European Union without more funding. Mr George
Traves, a trawler-owner in Bridlington, said: 'It's just not doing the job.
We need at least Pounds 100m to take out the sort of capacity they're
talking about.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / Aid for Hualon attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chief executive of one of the UK's last independent yarn spinners
yesterday used his company's annual meeting to attack the British
government's 'ludicrous' decision to help Hualon, the Taiwanese textile
group, to set up in Northern Ireland with Pounds 61m of public funds.
Mr Edmund Gartside, chairman and managing director of Shiloh, the
Oldham-based textiles group, told the meeting: '(This) must go down as one
of the most ludicrous decisions ever made by a British government in the
long history of total mismanagement of textile trading policies.'
The meeting, held in one of the company's mills in Royton, Greater
Manchester, urged Shiloh's management to convey its unanimous support for Mr
Gartside's speech to every MP.
Mr Gartside said it was desirable to create jobs in Northern Ireland, but
the Hualon project was ill-conceived.
He said: 'There is already over-capacity in the European market for the
fabrics the plant is to produce and there is no identifiable market for the
end product.
'The money is going to a foreign investor whose executives are reported to
have been convicted of financial fraud in their own country.'
Mr Gartside is a respected figure in the UK textile industry. His family
founded Shiloh, which went public in the 1950s.
The company made Pounds 1.14m pre-tax profit on Pounds 28m turn-over in the
year ended March 31.
It employs about 600 in Surrey, Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Scotland.
Two-thirds of its business is in healthcare products, mainly incontinence
pads.
The company led an anti-dumping action against imported yarn in 1987, but
although it succeeded four years passed before import duties were imposed in
the UK. Mr Gartside said this meant about 7,000 jobs were lost in the
interim.
He told the meeting, to applause: 'How any government can sit back, fail to
support efficient UK textile plants, allow them to be closed down through
unfair competition and at the same time throw Pounds 61m of taxpayers' money
at a dubious project proposed by a foreign company . . . defies belief.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / Piper loss 'impossible' Gooda chief said
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The loss of the Piper Alpha oil platform had been considered by a senior
Gooda Walker underwriter to be completely impossible, the High Court heard
yesterday.
Mr Stanley Andrews, underwriter for Syndicate 298, which lost heavily
following the disaster, said he had thought only an earthquake could result
in the platform's loss.
'We never honestly thought that the loss of Piper Alpha could actually ever
occur,' he said.
Mr Andrews, who resigned from Lloyd's after the massive losses sustained by
his syndicate, was given evidence in the case brought by 3,095 Names who are
suing the Gooda Walker agency for negligence.
He said others in the market, not Gooda Walker underwriters, had been
responsible for the enormous losses suffered by syndicate 298.
Questioned what had gone wrong with the arrangements made by the syndicate,
he said its overall classifications had been wrong. 'It was false
information passed to us by the direct market,' he said. 'The direct market
did not know their own exposures.'
Mr Andrews agreed he had never calculated the actual total exposure to risk
that Syndicate 298 faced. Instead, he reached a 'reasonable' assessment of
this exposure by considering the syndicate's premium income.
He was challenged by Mr Jonathan Gaisman, for the Names, that this was a
totally unsatisfactory method.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Beckett may win TGWU nomination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The TGWU, Labour's largest affiliated union, is expected today either to
nominate Mrs Margaret Beckett for the Labour party leadership contest or
nobody at all, according to union sources. The deadline for nominating a
candidate is midnight tonight.
The GMB, the third largest affiliated trade union, is also expected to
decide on the nomination of a candidate today. Many officials of the
traditionally centre-right union would like the GMB to nominate Mr Tony
Blair, but it is possible the union's executive will also go for Mrs
Beckett.
Mr Ken Livingstone withdrew from the leadership contest yesterday, admitting
that he had no hope of gaining the 34 nominations needed to run.
Amid a last-minute flurry of activity ahead of today's nominations deadline,
Mr Livingstone forecast that Mr Denzil Davies would also be 'squeezed out'.
That would leave three candidates for the leadership - Mr Blair, the
modernist shadow home secretary; Mrs Beckett, the interim leader of the
party; and Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist shadow employment secretary.
Mr Blair, who has the support of a majority of Labour MPs, is regarded as
almost certain to win. The contest for deputy leader, between Mr Prescott
and Mrs Beckett, is more uncertain.
Mr Livingstone, leftwing former leader of the Greater London Council, said
there was 'no point in advancing one left candidate by damaging others.'
Mr Prescott said his campaign for nominations from Labour MPs was 'going
very well'. He said many MPs had supported Mr Blair because of media reports
that he was certain to win.
After Mr Livingstone's withdrawal, the leftwing Campaign Group of Labour MPs
decided against backing any leadership candidate. It issued a manifesto
against which to judge the candidates, putting the emphasis on full
employment and a national minimum wage.
The GMB general union conference voted yesterday to oppose the Labour
party's new rules that require women-only shortlists in the selection of
parliamentary candidates for the next general election.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Spottiswoode finds some comfort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator, drew comfort yesterday
from being attacked left and right for her decision on how much British Gas
can charge competitors to use its delivery system. She inferred this to mean
that her formula was about right.
Even so, the strength of British Gas's reaction - its warning about
dividends and the threat to gas-industry investment - will be hard to
ignore. Similarly, the accusation from the independent gas companies that
the formula is too weak and will leave consumers paying far more for their
gas than they should be, will provide critics powerful ammunition.
Yesterday's move places one more building block on the competitive market
for gas, which is gradually being constructed following last year's monopoly
inquiry. Large consumers are already able to buy from suppliers other than
British Gas. Domestic consumers will begin to get a choice in 1996.
But all suppliers will have to use British Gas's network of pipelines and
storage to transport their gas. So the level British Gas can charge for this
service is key because such charges account for about half the cost of gas
delivered.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission made several recommendations. One was
that British Gas should hive off its transportation and storage business
into a separate unit - which is now being done. Another was that transport
and storage prices should be governed by an inflation-linked formula. A
third was that the formula should allow British Gas a return of 4 per cent
to 4.5 per cent on assets, and 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent on new
investments.
British Gas had sought a return 6.7 per cent on existing assets and 10.8 per
cent on new, while the independent gas companies were arguing that British
Gas's assets were overvalued at Pounds 17bn, and should be recalculated.
Ms Spottiswoode is proposing to set a price of 14.16p per term starting on
October 1, with a formula adjusting it by at least the rate of inflation
minus 5 per cent each year until 1997.
She said that this would give British Gas a rate of return 'towards the
bottom end' of the range suggested by the MMC, but with the strong
implication that British Gas could earn more if it tried harder -
specifically, by continuing to reduce its costs by 2.5 per cent a year. She
also said that she had accepted most of British Gas's figures and forecasts
without question, which was 'generous'.
But there were two points where she took issue. One was British Gas's
assumption that the recent spate of mild winters would continue. It is
clearly in British Gas's interests to give a low forecast for gas use,
because this justifies a higher unit charge to achieve the agreed rate of
return. Instead, she has assumed average winters.
The second is over the cost of splitting the transportation and storage
business into a separate unit. British Gas says the cost of this is heavy
because it involves setting up large computer systems. But Ms Spottiswoode
says that British Gas should be able to recoup that cost through greater
efficiency.
To the disappointment of the independent gas suppliers, however, she
declined to revalue British Gas's assets, leaving this for a further review
which will set the next price formula after 1997. 'We would like to see this
done earlier,' said Ms Caroline Harper, managing director of Amerada Hess
Gas, who believes the assets may be overvalued by 20-30 per cent.
The two issues which arise from the decision are British Gas's claim that it
could throttle investment in the transportation and storage system, and the
effect on end-user prices.
Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas finance director, said it could probably
achieve the predicted return in the first year, but would fall below it in
subsequent years as the price formula began to bite.
The view among many industry observers was that the formula was indeed tough
and that British Gas might have insufficient incentive to continue investing
at the current rate of Pounds 900m a year. Mr Jonathan Stern, a consultant
with Gas Strategies, said: 'It's severe, specially if you assume that
inflation will be low in the years ahead.' On the other hand, the more gas
British Gas can pump through the system, the bigger its profits. So it does
have an incentive to expand and upgrade capacity.
Ms Spottiswoode said the formula would drive prices for gas suppliers down
by 3 per cent from next October. The formula would also help offset any
price increases for consumers who live in remote areas once the free market
develops. Until then, householders would be protected by a separate ceiling
on prices.
The independent gas suppliers also emphasised yesterday that prices would go
down because competition would eat into British Gas's heavy costs.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Forsyth's boundary objection rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, appears to have lost his battle
against Boundary Commission proposals for his Stirling constituency in
Scotland which could cost him his seat at the next general election.
The commission said yesterday it would not hold a second public inquiry into
its decision to remove part of the Stirling constituency and transfer it to
the new Ochil constituency.
Many political observers believe the loss of the 6,000 voters in the
Airthrey electoral district, which includes Bridge of Allan and Stirling
university, would remove enough Tories to tip the balance against Mr
Forsyth, who had a majority of 703 over Labour at the 1992 general election.
Mr Forsyth had denounced the revised proposals as 'ludicrous' and urged
constituents to object to the commission. Nearly 800 objections were sent
in.
But the commission said yesterday that the question had been fully discussed
at the first inquiry and the protests contained no new arguments to make it
change its mind.
The only possibility of a change of mind could come when the commission
re-appraises all its recommendations for Scotland to ensure consistency
before submitting its final report.
Mr Forsyth, who was a Scottish Office minister and for a year a
controversial chairman of the Scottish Conservative party, is not commenting
on the issue until today.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Report shows drop in share for coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The share of coal in the electricity market fell to 53 per cent last year as
gas and nuclear increased their penetration, according to the government's
first energy report, published yesterday, Michael Smith writes.
Coal's decline from 66 per cent in 1990 is expected by independent analysts
to continue, as the share of gas increases from 9 per cent last year.
Nuclear power may also grow from last year's 26 per cent as power stations
improve their efficiency and Sizewell B comes on stream.
The 1994 Energy Report is the first in an annual series promised by the
government last year as part of its response to the public outcry over pit
closures. The Department of Trade and Industry was advised by a panel of
energy market specialists.
The 138-page document re-affirms the government's intention to continue
moving towards a fully competitive market for all fuels.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, expected emerging competition to maintain
strong downward pressure on prices.

FT  16 JUN 94 / George says rate rise 'will come'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, last night held out
the prospect of higher interest rates in Britain, although he left unclear
when they would be necessary.
In his speech at the Mansion House Mr George said that the present framework
for UK monetary policy gave a better chance of achieving price stability in
the medium term than at any time in his professional lifetime.
But the testing time for the structure put in place since sterling's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992 'will come - as
it must inevitably come sooner or later - when we need to raise interest
rates in order to moderate the pace of expansion and pre-empt the emergence
of associated cost price pressures,' he said.
He added that a rate rise might still be some way off, but he hoped that
'whenever it comes' it would be regarded 'as a considered response to the
underlying strength of the economy, and to the prospect of inflation in the
medium term, and not as evidence of weakness, in simple knee-jerk reaction
to the latest set of erratic monetary or economic data'.
In remarks that appeared to prepare the ground for a pre-emptive interest
rate rise, rather akin to those decided this year by the US Federal Reserve
Board, Mr George said the Bank's purpose would be to maintain Britain's
current expansion 'at a sustainable pace'. It was 'not to leave the
tightening of policy so late that the economy is brought to a juddering halt
by a much larger interest rise than would otherwise be needed'.
Taking a swipe at some City commentators the governor said the management of
monetary policy could not be judged by how low interest rates could be
pushed or how long they could be held down.
'Nor is it a matter of snatching at what casual observers may see as
'windows of opportunity'. That lies at the root of short-termism in both
finance and industry,' he said.
Mr George reminded his audience that rising employment depended importantly
on smaller businesses which needed to be served effectively by the financial
sector.
But he had an upbeat message on the state of the economy. In the past year
the growth rate had exceeded the inflation rate for only the fourth time
since 1970.
'The challenge is to improve on this performance and sustain it year after
year,' he said.

FT  16 JUN 94 / SFO powers face legal test case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A test case over the powers of the Serious Fraud Office to suspend the right
to silence and force suspects to answer questions was taken to the High
Court yesterday.
In a judicial review, the SFO is asking two judges to overturn a ruling of
Clerkenwell Magistrates Court that Mr Larry Trachtenberg, one of six men
charged over the Maxwell affair, was entitled to refuse to answer questions
put to him by SFO investigators. The magistrate ruled in February last year
that Mr Trachtenberg had a reasonable excuse not to answer questions put to
him under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 because he had already
been arrested.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Patten overrules parents on opt out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday overruled a vote by
parents against their school becoming grant-maintained by opting out of
local education authority control, John Authers writes.
He said the local authority involved had published misleading information
before the ballot was taken.
His action, the first time he had used the power given to him under
legislation passed last year, intensified the political row over the
government's opting-out policy.
Parents at more than 1,000 schools in England and Wales have voted to opt
out, under rules introduced in 1988, but the rate of opting out has fallen
sharply in the last year.
Mr Patten overruled the ballot taken at Christ Church Middle School,
Staffordshire because, he said, the school had published information
'claiming, wrongly, that the school would incur a financial deficit if it
became grant-maintained'. The ballot must be run again.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Clarke cautious on tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, last night promised to cut taxes 'but
only when we can afford to do so, and not before we can afford to do so'.
Giving the annual Mansion House speech, he pledged the government to sound
public finances, low inflation and further improvements in the supply side
of the economy with the aim of 'a long period of healthy balanced growth,
which creates jobs and sees gradually higher living standards for all'.
Addressing the bankers and merchants of the City, Mr Clarke said the
government had 'not created the conditions for the strongest recovery in
Europe in order to throw it away by creating yet another boom followed by a
bust'.
He declared that he intended to 'stick to the prospectus' of putting UK
public finances on a sustainable footing and 'above all maintain tight
control of public expenditure'. The public, he said, would not have
confidence in a government that cuts taxes before getting borrowing under
control. 'Low expenditure is the key to lower taxes', the chancellor said.
Marking out a more ambitious course for reducing public expenditure than
that in last November's Budget, Mr Clarke said: 'My medium-term aim is to
see general government expenditure (GGE) falling below 40 per cent of gross
domestic product once again.'
Existing Budget projections envisage a fall in GGE (excluding privatisation
proceeds) to 41 per cent of GDP in 1998-99 from 45 per cent in the past
financial year.
The chancellor underlined that the planned spending limits detailed in the
Budget's 'new control totals' were ceilings, implying that he would seek to
undershoot them.
The new control total approach would allow the government much better
control than formerly over public expenditure as the economy recovered, he
said.
Surveying slightly more than a year as chancellor, he said his most
important monetary policy decision was to publish the minutes of his monthly
meetings with Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor.
'I have deliberately created a system of decision-taking about interest
rates in this country which is one of the most open and transparent in the
world,' he said.
'I have given today's politicians and tomorrow's politicians no choice but
to pursue the path of low inflation to which we are so clearly publicly
committed'.
Mr Clarke reaffirmed that he would continue to set monetary policy to keep
underlying inflation in the target 1 per cent to 4 per cent band and reduce
it to the lower part of the band by the end of the present parliament.
Inflation, he said, was 'a silent thief that robs the elderly and cheats the
saver'. Low inflation was 'not an optional extra', it was 'the necessary
condition for the steady and sustained growth that I want to see in the
1990s and beyond'.
The chancellor strongly rejected the idea that the government should
tolerate a little inflation to stimulate a 'feel good' factor.
'A little more inflation will not make savers, workers or home owners feel
good for long,' Mr Clarke said. 'A fraudulent inflationary 'feel good' would
soon turn to 'feel very bad' as the bust followed the boom.'
While low inflation and sound public finances were necessary, they were not
sufficient conditions to achieve sustained satisfactory growth.
That required supply side changes to ensure that increases in demand were
translated into more growth and not more inflation.
For that reason, the government placed much importance on its recent white
paper on competitiveness and on education and training.
Mr Clarke was bullish about the current state of the UK economy, noting that
there were growing signs that high consumer spending was being supported by
exports and investment.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Average earnings growth falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rate of growth in average earnings fell in April, calming fears that
high wage rises might be putting upward pressure on inflation.
The underlying annual rate of growth of earnings in April was 3 3/4 per
cent, according to the Department of Employment, compared with 4 per cent in
March. The annual rate had been climbing since a low of 3 per cent in
November.
The fall was welcomed by City analysts who had feared that the rate might
increase to 4 1/4 per cent. Mr Sanjay Joshi, head of bond research at Daiwa
Europe, said: 'If it had gone to 4 1/4 per cent, there would have been
substantial pressure on the Bank of England to push up interest rates.'
The Department of Employment said that bonus payments, particularly in the
financial services sector, had accounted for part of the upturn in the
annual rate of growth. These bonuses were now dropping out of the underlying
numbers.
There was little evidence, the department said, that pay settlements in
general were getting out of control. Of 10 recent settlements, all but two
were at 3 per cent or below - the exceptions being Lloyds Bank clerical
workers, at 4.5 per cent, and agricultural workers, with 4.9 per cent.
The annual rate of increase in manufacturing and production was unchanged at
4 3/4 per cent, on an underlying basis, between March and April.
But the underlying rate is based on a three-month moving average which
smooths out monthly fluctuations.
The non-underlying monthly rate showed a decline in both production and
manufacturing wage growth. Production fell from a seasonally adjusted 5.1
per cent in March to 4.5 per cent in April and manufacturing from 5.3 per
cent in March to 4.6 per cent in April. The underlying rate of service
sector rises fell to 3 3/4 per cent in April from 4 per cent in March. Again
there was a sharp change in the non-underlying numbers, with the annual rate
falling to 3.2 per cent in April from 4.3 per cent in March.
These April falls should help restrain the underlying annual rate over the
next couple of months.
In the three months to April, wages per unit of output in the manufacturing
sector were 1.9 per cent higher than in the same period of 1993. This was a
fall from a rate of 2.2 per cent in March.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Unemployment at lowest since March 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment fell in May to its lowest level since March 1992, providing
further evidence of a steady economic recovery.
Figures published by the Department of Employment yesterday showed that the
number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell in May by 20,100, on
a seasonally adjusted basis, to 2,661,400. The unadjusted total fell 81,833
to 2,652,601.
Some of the shine was taken off the numbers, however, by statistics showing
that the workforce in employment fell 92,000 to 25,266,000 in the first
quarter of the year.
Falls in unemployment occurred in every region, with the percentage of the
UK workforce unemployed falling to 9.4 per cent from 9.5 per cent in April.
Northern Ireland remains the region with the highest proportion of
unemployed (13.1 per cent, seasonally adjusted). East Anglia has the lowest
proportion (7.2 per cent).
Male unemployment was 12.8 per cent in May, while the rate for females was
5.1 per cent.
Since its recent peak in December 1992 unemployment has fallen by 310,000.
The employment department said the trend has been a monthly decline of
20,000 to 25,000. The number of vacancies at job centres increased by 1,000
to 147,400 in May.
The decline in the number of people in employment between December and March
is based on information collected from employers.
However, the Labour Force survey, which is based on interviews with
individual workers, disclosed a 7,000 rise in employment between the autumn
and winter periods.
In part, this may be due to differences in timing - the Labour Force survey
is conducted between December and February - and in the method of
compilation. Another reason for the difference might be a jump in 79,000 in
the number of 'economically inactive' people, as found by the Labour Force
survey.
The employment department said that other factors which might explain the
discrepancy included different methods of seasonal adjustment, people with
more than one job, and people in occupations not recorded in the employers'
survey, such as domestic service.
The decline in employment, recorded by the department, was almost entirely
due to a fall in the number of employees. In the other categories, a fall in
self-employment was offset by a higher number of people on training schemes.
Service-sector employment fell 61,000 between December and March, with the
biggest decline in the banking and financial services sector, which lost
29,000 employees. There were also declines in hotels and catering and in
transport.
Overtime working, which had jumped from 9.22m hours in February to 9.72m
hours in March, fell to 9.06m hours in April.
Manufacturing employment rose 3,000 in April, but productivity continues to
rise. In the three months to April output per head in the manufacturing
sector was 2.8 per cent higher than in the same period last year, and 1.6
per cent higher than in the three months to January.
The 12-month total for working days lost in April through industrial
disputes was the lowest on record at 329,000.

</HEADLINE>

The GMB general union conference voted yesterday to oppose the Labour
party's new rules that require women-only shortlists in the selection of
parliamentary candidates for the next general election.
This means the controversial rule passed last year will be debated at this
autumn's party conference.
Labour is committed to ensure that half its parliamentary candidates in both
winnable and vacant constituencies are women.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Ashdown hits at claims on jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown said yesterday that it was fraudulent of politicians to
pretend that they could deliver full employment - in what amounted to a
rebuke of the Labour leadership candidates.
The Liberal Democrat leader used a speech in Harrogate to argue that 'full
employability' was what was needed. He defined this as a policy geared to
'maximising individual potential'.
He said full employment was not a realistic goal with 'open global markets'.
It was 'simply fraudulent' of politicians to 'pretend or to promise that
they can deliver full employment' in such conditions.
Speaking three days after Mr Tony Blair and Mr John Prescott clashed over
whether a Labour government should set targets for cuts in unemployment, Mr
Ashdown said Britain did not need 'massed armies of road-sweepers or
Romanian-style lift attendants, at a cost of massive extra borrowing,
rampant inflation and lost competitiveness'.
He said: 'If government spends its money on trying to create immediate but
transitory low-skilled full employment it will not spend it on creating the
conditions in which lasting, high-skill fuller unemployment can prevail
later.
'The doctrine of full employability put responsibility on individuals to
fulfil their potential and on the state to provide the support that
individuals need to survive and succeed.'
His comments came as Mr Prescott, a leading Labour 'traditionalist', called
for an emergency jobs recovery programme to tackle unemployment.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Inflation remains subdued in May
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The price of salad vegetables, spectacles and secondhand cars rose last
month, while footwear, furniture and heating costs fell.
Overall inflationary pressures remained subdued in spite of a small rise in
the underlying rate of inflation, figures from the Central Statistical
yesterday showed.
The retail price index including mortgages rose 2.6 per cent in the year to
May. This meant that the rate of headline inflation was unchanged from the
previous month. However the retail price index was 144.7, up from 144.2 in
April.
Measured without mortgage payments - a category favoured by the government
as a better guide - the index showed that the underlying level of inflation
was 2.5 per cent, up from April's rate of 2.3 per cent.
The figures were marginally worse than City forecasts, which had predicted a
0.1 per cent fall in the headline inflation rate.
But analysts yesterday pointed out that the rise in the underlying rate was
affected by seasonal factors and said that the overall pattern suggested
weak inflationary pressures.
Mr Don Smith, UK economist with Midland Global Markets said: 'Seasonal foods
can be very volatile - this month they added 0.1 per cent to the underlying
rate.'
Measured on a monthly basis the price of seasonal foods rose by 6.9 per cent
in May - the biggest monthly increase since May 1966. Fresh vegetables were
the main contributor, with the cost of lettuces pushed up by crop problems
in Spain. Potato prices also rose sharply in the month and were 30 per cent
higher than last May, largely as a result of storage problems.
But this was partly offset by the non-seasonal food sector, where prices
rose only 0.1 per cent on the month - the lowest increase for 12 years. The
CSO said that this reflected continued price discounting of items such as
bread and cakes.
Elsewhere the price of household goods recovered slightly over the month
after falling in spring sales, although prices still remain 0.3 per cent
lower than last May.
Costs in the motoring sector were higher in May than April, with a 2p rise
in the price of petrol and 0.5 per cent growth in the cost of secondhand
cars.
The clothing and footwear sector continued to show signs of sharp
competition, with the cost of women's clothing falling 0.3 per cent
month-on-month. The CSO expects clothing costs to fall further with the
summer sales.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Bank chief presses for City battle on crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City regulators must be put in the front line of the battle against
white-collar crime to prevent further damage to London's standing as a
financial centre, Lord Alexander QC, chairman of National Westminster Bank
said yesterday.
The former Bar chairman said the failure of recent high profile cases such
as the second Guinness prosecution, the year-long Blue Arrow trial and the
case against Mr Roger Levitt, had 'given rise to a sceptical view about City
trials'.
In particular the sentencing of Mr Levitt, former chairman of the Levitt
Group which collapsed with debts of Pounds 34m, to 180 hours community
service on a plea of guilty to misleading FIMBRA, had 'badly dented City
confidence in the criminal process', he said.
'Over-complexity' lay at the heart of all recent failed high-profile cases.
The solution was to make City regulators 'principal judges of market abuse'.
Giving the 1994 Commercial Bar Association Lecture last night Lord Alexander
said the UK should adopt the US approach. There, insider dealing could be
dealt with under criminal law and as an administrative offence. 'There is no
doubt that it is easier to present a case simply to City regulators who have
the background of market knowledge. And such regulators can inevitably know
more easily than a jury when specious expertise is being dragged in to
obscure the truth.'
Progress had been made between the Serious Fraud Office and the Securities
and Investments Board in agreeing the type of case which in future might be
better dealt with by regulators.
But ultimately a legislative framework was needed to give authority to such
changes, he said. SIB would need the power to fine as well as suspend and
disqualify practitioners. Parliament would have to determine which types of
offence should be handled by City regulators.
Allegations of large-scale plundering of clients' money should still be sent
for criminal trial.
He said there was also a need for greater co-operation from the defence to
help juries focus on the issues. Defendants should be required to co-operate
fully by stating their defence, agreeing facts with the prosecution and on
disclosure of evidence.
The civil justice system was also in need of urgent reform to keep costs in
proportion to disputes, Lord Alexander said. This could be achieved by
promoting mediation and settlement procedures and by giving judges greater
control over case management and making them responsible for budgets.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Labour falls silent on strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As hundreds of thousands of rail commuters struggled to work by road
yesterday, Labour was trying hard to remember how to respond to
public-sector strikes. It is a political skill that Labour leaders have had
little chance to practise recently.
On the eve of the strike there was no comment from Mr Frank Dobson,
transport spokesman, or any of the three main candidates for the Labour
leadership.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting leader, dodged an opportunity to support
the strike at Commons question time, while Mr Tony Blair and Mr John
Prescott remained silent.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said of the action: 'It is a reminder
that there could be a new virulent strain of the British disease around the
corner were we to have the Labour party back in power.'
Mr Prescott, who is sponsored by RMT and whose father was a railway
signalman, tried to claim that he knew too little about the dispute to
comment. As he was transport spokesman until last year this lacked
credibility. So he switched quickly to attacking the government.
He said: 'The government deliberately triggered (the strike) to take
attention away from their deplorable economic mess and the electoral
disaster they suffered last week.'
As shadow home secretary Mr Blair doesn't have to comment on this dispute,
and he won't volunteer any comment.
Labour officials said they believed the strike would not harm the party's
standing, mainly because it was widely believed to have been triggered by
government intervention.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Unions at BBC to review action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions at the BBC will decide by early next week whether to call off their
programme of industrial action and take part in up to eight weeks of
detailed discussions with management.
The proposals for what would in effect be a breathing space in the dispute
over performance-related pay and some terms and conditions of service,
emerged from long sessions this week at Acas, the conciliation service.
The National Union of Journalists will decide at a delegate meeting today
whether to enter the new discussion process amid pressure from some members
to ballot before any further strikes.
Bectu, the main technical union, where there is little sign of desire for a
ballot, will meet on Monday to decide its stance.
The BBC management has proposed negotiations in the resources directorate on
the details of the conditions of service it wants to operate and on any
associated compensation arrangements.
The aim will also be to finalise details of plans for 'salary management'
and appraisal.
The BBC management then wants to meet the unions again at Acas in late
August 'to confirm the detail of the whole package on which the trade union
could respond'.
The BBC said yesterday that because of pressures on resources the management
wanted to implement changes from November 1.
Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, said yesterday that the BBC had not
backed down on its main demands that performance-related pay should go ahead
or that some terms and conditions of service would be negotiated with
individual directorates rather than centrally. The BBC had conceded that
appeals against performance ratings would be handled at the centre.
Industrial action planned for Friday has been lifted while the unions
consider the proposal put to them at Acas.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Government admits pay policy pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday admitted that ministers warned Railtrack not to
breach public-sector pay policy after the corporation tabled a 5.7 per cent
offer to signals staff.
Downing Street officials explicitly denied Labour allegations that Mr John
Major, the prime minister, intervened to prevent a settlement between
Railtrack, the state-owned railway infrastructure company, and the RMT rail
union.
But Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said he made 'the general
government position' clear to Railtrack after June 9, the date of an
internal Railtrack letter to managers disclosing the 5.7 per cent offer.
Mr MacGregor said the government stood by a statement last September by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, which froze the public sector paybill: 'I
have repeated that point to the Railtrack board,' he said.
Government officials were unable, however, to explain whether the government
would object to a pay deal between Railtrack and RMT if it was financed by
productivity. Such a deal would not breach Mr Clarke's guidelines.
Mr MacGregor said that the RMT claim was for 13.8 per cent, excluding
payments for restructuring. 'We have made it clear that a claim of that sort
is not sustainable at a time when others have made more modest settlements
and inflation is low,' he said.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, also denied that the government had
intervened in the detailed negotiations between Railtrack and RMT.
But he said ministers were keen to send a clear message to industry about
the importance of containing public expenditure and restraining pay bill
costs.
He said: 'I hope every public and private sector organisation is aware that
we are not prepared to see this country going down the road of paying itself
inflationary pay increases that destroy our competitiveness.'
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said Mr MacGregor's comments
showed that the rail strike was 'entirely the fault of the government and
no-one else.'
He added: 'I am glad that it is being admitted that this was a result of
government pressure, because if it was not, Railtrack would have been guilty
of grotesque incompetence, stupidity and bad faith.'
Mr John Prescott, Labour's employment spokesman, said it was 'quite clear
that the government intervened even though management had come to an
agreement with the unions.'

FT  16 JUN 94 / Race for party leadership narrows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ken Livingstone withdrew from Labour's leadership contest yesterday,
admitting that he had no hope of gaining the 34 nominations needed to run.
Amid a last minute flurry of activity ahead of today's nominations deadline,
Mr Livingstone forecast that Mr Denzil Davies would also be 'squeezed out'.
That would leave three candidates for the leadership - Mr Tony Blair, the
modernist shadow home secretary; Mrs Margaret Beckett, the interim leader of
the party; and Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist shadow employment
secretary.
Mr Blair, who has the support of a majority of Labour MPs, is regarded as
almost certain to win. The outcome of the contest for deputy leader, being
contested by Mr Prescott and Mrs Beckett, is more uncertain.
Mr Livingstone, the leftwing former leader of the Greater London Council,
said there was 'no point in advancing one left candidate by damaging
others.'
He urged his supporters to vote for whichever remaining candidate looked
most likely to defeat Mr Blair.
'We want the strongest possible showing for the left in that vote, so that
Tony Blair's room for manoeuvre is constrained in what he might want to do
if he becomes leader,' he said.
Mr Prescott said his campaign for nominations from Labour MPs was 'going
very well'.
He said many MPs had supported Mr Blair because of media reports that he was
certain to win.
'A lot of MPs might have thought that, but that is not what people think in
the country,' he said. Mr Prescott's support is believed to lie mainly among
traditionalist socialists in the constituencies and trade unions.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Feared chaos gives way to moderate upsets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a repeat performance of April last year the predicted road chaos arising
from the 24-hour national rail strike failed to materialise. The country was
largely unscathed according to the Automobile Association.
In London, which was expected to be the worst affected because 400,000
commuters are decanted at 11 main rail terminus, and 150,000 cars drive in
each day, there was only slightly increased traffic flows at peak hours.
The AA said: 'There was congestion on the M25 and M4 but it was earlier than
usual . . . and it was due to accidents as much as anything.'
Special cars parks set up in Hyde Park, Regent's Park and in Wandsworth
coped easily.
One car park in Royal Albert Dock, close to the City, was virtually empty.
Mr Peter Bewsey, director of operations for National Car Parks, which
operates 600 car parks nationally and 200 in London, said: 'I would say we
were underwhelmed. We have 23,000 spaces in London and they were not all
taken up.'
Motoring organisations, the Department of Transport and the police said
motorists had started journeys earlier than usual, and doubled up in cars.
It was clear, however, that a large number of commuters decided to stay at
home and enjoy the sunshine. Most of the London Underground system was
working normally, as were the buses. Most employees who wanted to make the
effort could get into work.
Lloyds Bank, which has 8,000 workers in London, said it did not have to
close any branches because it had used 100 buses to bring in 4,000 workers.
SG Warburg, the merchant bank which employs 2,000 in London, said it
functioned as usual. Goldman Sachs said that most of its 1,800 employees had
made it into work relatively easily, but it had said that anyone who could
work from home was free to do so.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Senators will fight move to end Alaska oil export ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEREMY KAHN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US senators are promising strong opposition to any attempt to lift the
20-year ban on Alaska North Slope oil exports when it comes up for renewal
at the end of this month.
Senator Pat Murray of Washington state claimed yesterday 'a broad coalition'
of interests backed the current export prohibition, and most of her
colleagues would vote to keep it in place.
Mr Howard Marlowe, director of the Coalition to Keep Alaska Oil, a lobbying
group representing business, consumer and labour interests that has
successfully fought off three attempts to kill the ban, said more than 60
senators had indicated they would vote to keep the export prohibitions.
The Department of Energy is working on a report, not yet released, but
rumoured to offer economic evidence supporting abolition of the prohibition.
Alaskan North Slope oil accounts for nearly 25 per cent of the US's 6.6m
barrels of daily output. At present, most of this oil is refined in
California, but if the ban is lifted, it could be exported to Asia.
The ban was introduced in during the 1973 oil crisis to protect national oil
supplies, but has since been embraced by environmentalists eager to protect
Alaska from further oil development.
British Petroleum, the largest producer in Alaska and the company with the
most to gain from the ban's removal, has persistently pressed for the
lifting of the prohibitions.
There are indications that organised labour, formerly a big stumbling block
to those fighting to lift the ban, is coming around to BP's side.
The seafarers' union, which supported the ban because Alaskan oil must be
carried on US-flag ships when it is transported to another US state, has
apparently reached a deal with BP. They will no longer oppose lifting the
prohibition, in exchange for new legislation requiring that all Alaskan
North Slope oil exports be carried on US-flagged vessels.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Mexico venture set to get Cuba on the line: Part-purchase of
island's telephone monopoly may be first in wave of investment - A look at a
foreign project that at first sight seems improbable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign participation in the privatisation of the Cuban telephone system
appears to be the most improbable of ventures. The country cannot receive
remittances from its biggest long-distance market, the US. The local
currency is not convertible. The telephone network, largely untouched since
the 1959 communist revolution, is rapidly deteriorating. And the privatised
company may be subject to compensation claims dating back to
nationalisation.
But Mexico's Grupo Domos, which will spend nearly Dollars 1.5bn over the
next several years to purchase 49 per cent of Cuba's telephone monopoly,
EmtelCuba, and to modernise the island's telecommunications infrastructure,
believes it has structured the contract in a way that is 'viable
financially, politically, and legally'.
If it is right, the move, by simultaneously improving business services and
setting a precedent for long-term private investment in Cuba, could set off
a wave of foreign investment.
The big price tag for the company, which had some US telephone company
executives gasping in disbelief, is not quite as large as it seems. Domos
will pay out about Dollars 500m for its share in the company, as much as
half of which is expected to come from a foreign partner with
telecommunications technology that the British investment bank Rothschild
believes it has lined up. Another Dollars 200m in long-term
preferential-rate financing will be obtained in a swap deal liquidating the
Cuban government's outstanding debt with Mexico.
The remaining Dollars 800m, half of which the Cuban government will have to
put up, will be invested over a seven-year period in an ambitious
modernisation programme. The plan calls for a three-fold expansion in the
network's penetration to 1m working phone lines. As part of the arrangement,
EmtelCuba has received a 55-year monopoly concession on local and
long-distance service as well as data and image transmission.
Still, Domos's ability to recuperate its investment depends on two uncertain
things: a change in US policy towards telephone communications with Cuba and
the convertibility of the Cuban peso. Currently all transmission charges due
to Cuba for telephone traffic with the US go into an escrow account held for
potential legal claims against Cuba.
For this reason Cuba limits direct calls from the US to 300 a day and all
other calls between the two countries get routed through third-party
nations. However, while tightening the US blockage of Cuba in most other
ways, a 1992 law authorises the US Federal Communications Commission to
increase communications links between the two countries and the US Treasury
to allow dollar payments to Cuba for telephone calls.
As a result of that change, WilTel International, a large long-distance
carrier in the US, signed an agreement in March with EmtelCuba to build a
fibre optic line from the tip of Florida to a point near Havana. The deal
and the mechanism to remit payment to Cuba are awaiting White House
approval, but the concept has been agreed to in principle, according to
WilTel executives.
WilTel estimates that in 1991 60m call attempts were made from the US to
Cuba and that, in the first year of liberalisation of telephone services,
between 25m and 50m minutes of calls would be handled. EmtelCuba would be
entitled to about 60 cents per minute plus a surcharge of about Dollars 3
per collect call made from Cuba to the US.
Domos says that its contracts allow it to pull out of the deal if the FCC
and the US Treasury decide not to allow dollars to be transferred to Cuba
and say a convertibility scheme for the Cuban peso has been worked out with
the Cuban government, but will not offer details.
The prospect of change in policies by a post-Castro government does not
worry Domos. 'A new Cuban government will not be more to the left than the
current one. It will have to be more capitalist,' says Pedro Sepulveda of
Domos.
Domos also discounts the question of compensation claims, arguing that the
infrastructure is practically worthless while no new investment could be
subject to such a claim.
Yet others are not so confident. 'If you buy anything Castro nationalised
then you are buying into a potentially dangerous logic,' says on telephone
executive who has regular dealings with Cuba, 'because by purchasing
something from his government you are validating the right of confiscation.
If it was OK for Castro to confiscate and then privatise, wouldn't it be OK
for a new government to do the same thing?'
Claims by US citizens on property in Cuba, including EmtelCuba, are almost
certain as part of any move by the US to life the blockade, according to
Jorge Dominguez, a Harvard professor at the Inter-American Dialogue in
Washington.
Yet Prof Dominguez is optimistic the deal can work because Cuba needs to
modernise its telephone system to bring its economy up to a functioning
level. 'This is very different from other private investments in Cuba . . .
because it is a long-term project, it will have an innumerable multiplier
effect on the economy and shows the openness of the Cuban government to
privatisation,' he says.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Caracas bank closures under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by the government of President Rafael Caldera to shut down
eight troubled financial institutions provoked criticism in Venezuela
yesterday, although it was viewed by some economists as the best way to stem
a drain on the government's budget.
The Venezuelan banking council, which represents the private banks, sharply
questioned the government's move and said its members had not been
consulted.
In Congress, Deputy Gustavo Tarre, leader of the opposition Christian
Democrat Copei Party, described the government's decision as 'late', but
agreed that official financial aid to the banks could not continue
indefinitely.
Seven banks (Amazonas, Bancor, Barinas, Construccion, La Guaira,
Metropolitano, and Maracaibo) and a finance house, Fiveca, were closed. They
were controlled by some of the country's most prominent business families
such as the Mendozas (Banco La Guaira), the DiMases (Banco Construccion) and
the Brillembourgs (Banco Metropolitano).
The closing of the banks, which included the government takeover of more
than 50 subsidiary financial companies, represented a heavy blow to the
Venezuelan economy, already in the second year of an economic recession.
The move raised questions about whether there would be a further loss of
confidence in the banking system, already damaged by the collapse of the
second-largest bank, Banco Latino, at the start of the year.
The banking collapse has come at a time when the government has been trying
to get its budget under control. The government has announced action -
including accelerating privatisations - to bring down the budget deficit,
which was running at a rate of 8-10 per cent of gross domestic product
earlier this year.
The government has been helped by higher oil prices than forecast and the
bolivar's devaluation - which raises the local currency revenues from oil
sales abroad by the state oil company. But the bank crisis has cost the
government dear: the estimated cost so far is estimated at Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 4bn) - half of which has gone in financial assistance to the eight
banks.
The administration finally decided the banks' losses were getting out of
control and it had to stop the continued loss of official aid funds.
IDEA, an economic analysis company and the London School of Economics said
yesterday the banks' closure does not mean the drain on public finances is
over, since the government may decide to further reimburse depositors.
'Nonetheless, a one-off reimbursement of depositors is a far better
situation than a continuing bleeding of public finances through attempts to
bail out unprofitable banking concerns,' they said.
The closure affects around 2m account holders in a nation of just over 20m,
and an estimated 14 per cent of deposits at the country's 49 commercial
banks. Calculating the true volume of deposits held is tricky, since many
banks held large sums in offshore subsidiaries that did not appear on their
balance sheets.
As of May 30, the government estimated their total losses at over Dollars
2.1bn, or around 30 times registered capital as of the end of 1993.
Venezuelan officials said that the banks could reopen after a week or so to
begin repaying depositors up to the equivalent of approximately Dollars
24,000.
However, the final disposition of these banks remains in doubt. Former
owners have until June 29 to come up with cash to re-capitalise their banks
and recover control. If this does not occur, the most likely option is
liquidation.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Battle lines emerge on derivatives law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Debate is intensifying over a US government study of derivatives trading
that could play a central role in congressional deliberations on whether to
impose tighter regulations on the sector.
The study by the General Accounting Office, the government audit agency,
warned of gaps in the regulatory framework that threatened severe damage to
the financial system, and recommended new legislation to bring federal
oversight to unregulated subsidiaries of securities firms and insurance
companies dealing in derivatives. These are sometimes complex financial
instruments whose yields are tied to other securities or indices.
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a grouping of big
dealers, attacked the GAO report as 'good facts' but 'bad conclusions'.
'Anecdote, conjecture and surmise are not sufficient bases for imposing
restrictions on an essential risk management tool,' ISDA said last week.
The GAO has issued an unusual rebuttal of the ISDA document, challenging its
criticisms and insisting its own recommendations, issued last month, would
neither increase costs nor reduce the availability of derivatives.
Mr James Blothwell, GAO's director of financial institutions and market
issues, challenged ISDA's view that derivatives raise little risk of
'domino' failures through the linkages they create between separate
financial markets.
'The potential for derivatives linkages to hasten the spread and expand the
scope of problems during any financial system crises is a sound reason for
federal oversight of derivatives,' Mr Blothwell said in testimony to a House
of Representatives subcommittee.
Congressman Edward Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who has been one of
the loudest voices calling for more regulation, has asked the GAO to expand
its original survey by studying dealers' sales practices, to make sure they
are selling only to customers able to understand the product's complexity.
Some express scepticism at the prospect of riding to the rescue of banks,
multinational corporations and international fund managers, who are the
largest customers, but concern remains over whether derivatives are being
sold to relatively unsophisticated local government treasurers.
Senior congressional leaders do not share Mr Markey's haste, and have
decided not to push for derivatives legislation this year. The Clinton
administration continues to argue there is no immediate need to change the
law.
'The Treasury has not concluded that other legislation concerning
over-the-counter derivatives is necessary or appropriate at this time,' said
Ms Darcy Bradbury, deputy assistant secretary for federal finance at the
Treasury.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Robb easily wins Virginia primary

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senator Chuck Robb easily won the Democratic party's nomination to represent
Virginia in the US Senate, picking up 58 per cent of the votes in Tuesday's
primary election.
But November's general election will pit Mr Robb not only against Mr Oliver
North, the controversial former marine nominated by Virginia Republicans,
but also against two independent candidates.
Both Mr Douglas Wilder, a former Democratic governor, and Mr Marshall
Coleman, a former Republican state attorney general, filed petitions with
more than enough signatures to get their names on the ballot paper in
November.
None of the candidates arouses much enthusiasm among Virginia voters. Mr
Robb has been tarnished by his sexual exploits, while Mr North, who has
admitted lying to Congress over his role in the Iran-Contra affair, has been
denounced by Virginia's senior senator, Republican Senator John Warner.
A poll by Mason-Dixon last week showed all four candidates close together:
Mr Robb first with 28 per cent, and Mr North last with 21 per cent.
Voter turnout is expected to be crucial to the final result, and to judge by
Tuesday's primary, when fewer than 10 per cent of Virginia's registered
voters took part, is likely to be low.
Mr Robb collected only 154,524 votes, which was barely a tenth of his score
in his last election. He did, however, win nearly 70 per cent of the votes
in the populous Washington suburbs of northern Virginia.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Brazilian currency tensions increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tensions are rising in the Brazilian government ahead of the July 1 launch
of the country's new currency, the real.
President Itamar Franco, a populist who has often opposed the orthodox
economics of the finance ministry, is thought to support lower interest
rates and improved wage levels, at least for some public sector employees.
However, the finance ministry believes relaxing policy on either front would
threaten the government's anti-inflation plan, of which the new currency is
the final step.
Mr Romildo Canhim, a minister with links to the military, is pushing to
unify public-sector pay at a single, higher rate and for an extra 29 per
cent army pay rise.
Both measures would benefit the armed services, but could cost between
Dollars 5bn and Dollars 7bn a year. Such an increase would immediately send
the government budget into deficit and undermine the credibility of the
real.
In the past, some of President Franco's more wayward demands have been
blocked by his advisers or the former finance minister, Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso.
But Mr Cardoso's successor, Mr Rubens Ricupero, has so far seemed less
prepared to stand up to the president.
For example, President Franco decided last week that private-sector school
fees would be cut sharply when the new currency is introduced, even though
such measures are unsustainable for more than a few months.
For the finance ministry, which is finalising details of introduction of the
real, disagreement within the government and threats to the budget are very
worrying.
The real, which will initially be pegged at parity to the US dollar, is to
be backed by a portion of Brazil's Dollars 35bn foreign reserves.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Sluggish growth in US industry output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US industrial output grew sluggishly last month, reflecting the third
consecutive monthly decline in car production, the Federal Reserve said
yesterday.
In a separate report, the Labour Department published revised estimates
yesterday showing that manufacturing productivity grew at an annual rate of
6.9 per cent in the first quarter, a better figure than expected.
US industrial production rose by 0.2 per cent last month and by 5.5 per cent
in the year to May.
Coming after a revised increase in production of 0.1 per cent in April, the
figures were seen as reinforcing other data pointing to a mild deceleration
in the pace of US economic growth.
The weaker tone of recent statistics has helped create a more optimistic
mood in the US bond market because the Federal Reserve is not expected to
raise short-term rates in the near future unless growth or inflation shows
greater buoyancy.
The overall factory operating rate dropped marginally from 83.6 per cent in
April to 83.5 per cent.
The Federal Reserve closely monitors the operating rate, because it is seen
as a leading indicator of upward pressure on inflation. The operating rate
peaked at 83.9 per cent in June 1989.
The drop in industrial production reflected a dip in car output after a
strong first quarter. Excluding cars, manufacturing output rose 0.5 per cent
last month. Output of business equipment and construction supplies both rose
0.9 from April.
The growth of manufacturing productivity reflected strong efficiency gains
in durable goods industries where output per hour rose at an annual rate of
8.5 per cent in the first quarter.
Productivity in non-durable goods rose at an annual rate of 4.4 per cent.
Overall productivity rose at an annual rate of 1.3 per cent, reflecting much
slower gains in efficiency in service industries.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Switzerland and Germany, the two contenders to host the new World Trade
Organisation, set out their respective stalls for Geneva and Bonn yesterday
with a tempting array of financial inducements, benefits and privileges for
the organisation and its staff. Members of the preparatory committee of the
WTO, which is scheduled to take over from the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade on January 1 1995, agreed yesterday to aim for a consensus
decision by July 15.
Geneva, now home to Gatt and several United Nations agencies, remains the
clear favourite. But the possibility of losing the WTO to Bonn, with the
risk that this could start an exodus of international organisations from
Geneva, has goaded the Swiss government into unprecedented generosity.
Germany, which is moving the seat of government to Berlin at the end of the
decade, is meanwhile mounting an aggressive campaign to attract
international organisations who could fill empty government offices and
provide substitute jobs and incomes. If the WTO were to choose Bonn, others
might follow.
Both offers include splendid rent-free accommodation (in Bonn the federal
parliament buildings from 1998, in Geneva Gatt's lakeside headquarters) and
conference facilities. Bonn is offering to meet removal costs and
installation expenses, but Geneva is offering a building to house the
diplomatic missions of least-developed countries, which would greatly reduce
the costs to them of WTO and UN representation.
Geneva also has the advantage of a concentration of international
organisations, including some with which the WTO will need to work closely
such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation, the UN Conference on
Trade and Development, the UN Environment Programme and other environmental
groups.

FT  16 JUN 94 / World Trade News: US companies use protectionist tactics,
says budget office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A report by the Congressional Budget Office concurs with a long-standing
contention by foreign companies that US anti-dumping and subsidy laws have
become a protectionist tool for uncompetitive US companies.
'Many of the legal provisions and procedures that have evolved - especially
those used for calculating dumping margins - are biased against foreign
exporters and against US consumers of foreign goods,' the report says.
The study, requested by senior Republicans on the House ways and means
committee, which oversees trade, has drawn fire from a top US Commerce
Department official. The report's flaws, said Ms Susan Esserman, are
'far-reaching in both substance and scope as they suggest a fundamental
misapprehension of. . . the role and application of the anti-dumping and
countervailing duty laws.'
While the debate over the so-called 'trade remedy' laws is raging, the
Clinton administration is struggling to balance competing interests as it
amends the laws in implementing legislation for the Uruguay Round deal. A
ways and means committee memo on the exercise says about 70 changes to the
laws are required with about 25 of them likely to raise 'significant policy
or political issues'. Several lawyers representing exporters said an effort
was under way to give domestic petitioners an advantage in administration
reviews, when duty levels are assessed.
Senior Republicans said they would use the CBO study to help ensure that the
changes were not protectionist. 'US exports during the past five years are
the most frequent target of dumping actions in other countries,' said
Congressman Bill Archer a Republican on the ways and means committee. 'If
the US resorts to using its laws in a protectionist manner, we can be sure
that foreign governments will also adapt such practices and avoid meaningful
reform of their anti-dumping laws,' he said.
The CBO study said the evolution of the laws as a protection for US industry
abrogated the original purpose of the law, which was to protect against
predatory pricing. Ms Esserman said the CBO had it wrong, that the law was
consistent with Gatt and provided a remedy to domestic industries injured by
imports and sold 'at less than fair value'.
'The report appears to proceed from unstated theoretical premises hostile to
the purposes of the trade laws and is myopic in its failure to consider the
real world implications of its assumptions,' she said.
Mr Bruce Turnbull, a trade lawyer who has carefully followed the
implementing legislation, said initially the administration favoured US
protectionists. Currently its position was less clear.
A number of export industries, including the steel-using manufacturers, have
formed a Pro Trade Group, which this week called on the administration to
'adhere to the market-opening thrust of the Gatt agreement in adopting fair
proposals'.

<TEXT>
Electrolux, the world's leading maker of household appliances, yesterday
said it was resuming a direct presence in South Africa through a joint
venture with Barlow, the South African industrial group.
The Swedish company sold out its operations in South Africa in 1977 after
Sweden imposed trade sanctions and barred any new investments. during the
apartheid regime. The lifting of sanctions at the beginning of this year
prompted moves back into the market by several Swedish companies, including
the pharmaceutical groups Astra and Pharmacia.
Electrolux forecast it would shortly become the market leader in South
Africa in vacuum cleaners and garden equipment. It will hold a 60 per cent
interest in the new venture, to be called Electrolux South Africa, which
will include the operations of the hitherto Barlow-owned Electrocool, which
has been making Electrolux products in South Africa under licence, and the
local sales of AEG white goods bought by Electrolux this year. The venture
will initially make and sell absorption refrigerators, vacuum cleaners and
garden products with projected sales in its first year worth SKr250m (Pounds
21m).

FT  16 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Car import issue unresolved - Japanese
makers increasing purchases of US parts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Japan yesterday ended three days of negotiations on increasing
car and car parts imports with few indications of any concrete progress.
One Japanese trade negotiator said that the two sides still encountered
differences in the bilateral car sector talks and that discussions would
continue next week in Washington.
But while negotiators were locked in discussion over how to improve market
access for foreign car and car parts makers, there were indications that
political pressure and market forces were doing their part to improve
foreign access to Japan's car industry.
Toyota, Japan's largest car maker, said it had increased its purchases of
US-made car parts by 5 per cent last year to Dollars 4.65bn (Pounds 3.1bn),
or more than four times the Dollars 1.1bn it spent five years ago.
Toyota expects procurement of US-made car parts will increase to Dollars
5.28bn this fiscal year as a result of increased local procurement in the US
and greater imports. This is in line with a voluntary plan to increase
procurement of US-made car parts announced by the company in early 1992 when
former President George Bush visited Japan with US car industry executives.
Behind the increase in car parts procurement by Japanese car makers is a
pressing need to reduce costs and remain competitive in the face of a high
yen. Toyota already purchases 90 per cent of the leather it uses from US
suppliers and 10 per cent of its sheet glass. 'Domestic prices are too
high,' it says.
Mitsubishi Motors, which recently said it was considering buying steel from
Korean makers to reduce costs, is also looking into whether it can procure
the same parts for its Japanese-made cars as it does at the Diamond Star
Motors factory in the US.
Local procurement in the US is expected to rise to between Dollars 1.4bn and
Dollars 1.6bn in fiscal 1996 from Dollars 650m in fiscal 1993.
Nissan, meanwhile, said that the Dollars 3bn of local parts it procured in
the US last year already exceeded its voluntary plan of Dollars 2.9bn for
1994 indicated to Mr Bush two years ago, and was more than four times the
Dollars 660m the company spent in the US in fiscal 1988.
Nissan plans to increase local procurement of US-made parts by 75 per cent
to Dollars 3.4bn in fiscal 1997, and to increase parts imports by 70 per
cent to Dollars 1.7bn in fiscal 1998, up from an estimated Dollars 980m.
However, the Japanese car makers say that their upbeat local procurement and
import plans depend to a large extent on firm markets and continued
improvements by US suppliers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alex Trotman, chairman of Ford of the US, the world's second largest car
maker, warned yesterday that weak currencies would not protect European and
North American car makers for long from Japanese competition, writes Kevin
Done. Despite the deep recession in the Japanese vehicle market Toyota, the
leading producer, still had cash reserves of Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.6bn),
he said. 'They are planning to be competitive with a yen at about Y55 to the
D-Mark or Y90 to the US dollar,' he told the International Chamber of
Commerce in Paris.
'Protectionism lives in Japan,' claimed Mr Trotman, but the protection had
come at the cost of the Japanese consumer. Japan's economy was run primarily
for the benefit of its producers. He warned that 'Japan either must open its
market, or the yen will open it up for them'.

FT  16 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Row over award of Portuguese bridge
contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two international construction companies have become embroiled in a public
row over one of Europe's most prestigious civil engineering contracts, the
construction of a new bridge over the Tagus river in Lisbon.
The French company Bouygues, whose consortium lost to a consortium led by
Britain's Trafalgar House, is complaining that the Pounds 714m contract was
unfairly awarded and is pressing the Portuguese government to rescind its
decision.
Mr Jacques Marquet, a senior executive of the French company, has written to
Portugal's minister of public works questioning the basis on which the
contract was awarded in April. The letter claims that Gattel, the state
concession company for the bridge, ignored a report by an independent
adviser to the government which stated that the French offer was better on
technical grounds. The company obtained a copy of the report through its own
means after Gattel withheld circulation of documents which might have shed
light on how the final decision was made.
A senior manager with Bouygues said: 'We think the Portuguese government
made its mind up about the contract before we even started bidding. It now
seems obvious to us that we were simply allowed in to simulate competition.'
In awarding the contract, Gattel said the two final offers were tied in
terms of financial proposals but that the Trafalgar House consortium won on
'technical grounds.'
The deadline for the losing consortium to appeal against the decision
expires on Monday.
Mr Joao Morais Leitao, the Portuguese lawyer for the Trafalgar House group,
yesterday said that the decision on technical aspects was made in
Trafalgar's favour in January, four months before the final decision was
announced, and that the rest of time was spent on deciding other aspects.
The Bouygues and Trafalgar consortiums were shortlisted in November 1993. It
later emerged that the European Union was committed to providing a grant
covering about half the cost of the project through the Cohesion Fund.
Trafalgar House and the French group Campenon Bernard each have 24.8 per
cent in the project. Five Portuguese companies have 50.4 per cent.
The consortium known as Lusoponte plans to complete the 12km bridge by March
31 1998, in time for Expo '98, which is being hosted by Portugal.

FT  16 JUN 94 / New violence overshadows Algeria's debt problems:
International creditors wonder whether refinancing will prove a futile
gesture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Algeria's commercial bank creditors meet in the next few weeks they
will almost certainly follow the example of the country's official creditors
at the beginning of the month and reschedule or refinance its Dollars 4.7bn
(Pounds 3.13bn) of commercial debt.
But they are unlikely to be any more convinced than the official creditors
are that the violence and political stalemate will not make it a futile
gesture.
For one thing, Algerian President Liamine Zeroual's hopes of quelling the
country's Islamic insurgency appear to be foundering. After a lull in April
radical Islamic groups have resumed their attacks on troop convoys, barracks
and other army installations.
Between 30 and 40 people are dying every day. State-owned vehicles and
buildings are being put to the torch. The control room of the Meftah cement
plant near Algiers was sabotaged a few weeks ago, cutting output of a vital
product.
The surge in violence is causing increasing concern in western capitals,
where it had been hoped that the recent agreement between Algeria and the
International Monetary Fund - followed two weeks ago in Paris by the
rescheduling of Dollars 5bn of the country's Dollars 26bn foreign debt to
sovereign lenders - would pave the way for much-needed economic reforms.
At the London Club meeting of commercial creditors, expected this month, the
Japanese banks will play a key role. This is not only because they hold
two-thirds of Algeria's commercial bank debt, but because they play a key
role in financing the projects of Algeria's oil and gas company, Sonatrach.
Some 95 per cent of Algeria's foreign exchange income is derived from
exports of hydrocarbons and Sonatrach's capacity to increase those earnings
are key to Algeria's recovery.
While the Japanese banks oppose rescheduling, France has put pressure on
Tokyo, as it fears a fundamentalist takeover in Algeria if international
financial backing is not available to its former colony.
When he became head of state four months ago, Gen Zeroual initiated a
twin-track policy of dealing with the violence, now in its third year. He
sought to establish contacts with imprisoned leaders of the Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS), which in January 1992 was headed for victory when the
army cancelled Algeria's first multi-party elections since independence. In
fact, Gen Zeroual met the two imprisoned FIS leaders, Mr Abassi Madani and
Mr Ali Benhadj, before he became president.
The second track to Gen Zeroual's policy was to tell security forces to
'clean up' areas which had fallen under the control of Islamic groups.
Gen Zeroual's desire for some sort of a dialogue was a break with the past
when senior members of the regime, notably the army chief of staff, General
Mohamed Lamari, made no secret of their wish to 'eradicate' the
fundamentalists.
During the past four weeks however, supporters of the Islamic Armed Movement
(MIA) which is the military wing of the FIS, and the more radical Islamic
Armed Group (GIA) have murdered dozens of conscripts - in some cases by
slitting their throats with knives inside their barracks.
Clashes have occurred in Telagh and in the port of Tenes, to the west of
Algiers, in Medea and Bouira south of the capital and between the ports of
Jijel and Collo to the east where, on May 19, a military convoy escorting 25
Russian civilians back to Algiers was ambushed, leaving three Russians and
11 Algerian soldiers dead and many wounded.
Diplomats in Algiers are however concerned at what they feel is the loss of
control of the imprisoned or exiled FIS leadership over the MIA, let alone
the GIA, whose leaders were trained in the camps of Peshawar in Pakistan and
fought against the Russian troops in Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, infighting among senior army and security officers continues. The
chief of staff, Gen Lamari, appears to have gained the upper hand for the
time being. But a number of his peers are reported to be unhappy about the
high human cost of the tactics of 'eradication'. Many of the doubters belong
to a younger breed of educated officers who did not fight in the war of
independence against the French and have supported efforts to usher in a
more modern style of economic management. Foreign observers fear that a
serious split among senior commanders on how to deal with the FIS could lead
to a coup - or civil war.
Ordinary Algerians continue to pay the price. Educated guesses put the
number of lives lost at more than 5,000 in the past 29 months. Many fear the
Islamic radicals who two weeks ago killed the rector of the Bab Ezzouar
University of Science and Technology, Professor Salah Djebali. Others fear
the security forces that conduct what the human rights organisation Amnesty
International recently called 'extra-judicial executions . . . in total
impunity'. Shadowy government death squads are widely blamed for the recent
murder of four lawyers known for their defence of Islamic activists.
Meanwhile, the 49 per cent devaluation of the dinar, which preceded
Algeria's letter of intent to the IMF, resulted in relatively modest food
price increases as most prices were already freely set by traders. The
government also set up an effective 'safety net' to soften the effects of
the devaluation on the purchasing power of state employees. This helped
enlist the support of the powerful trades union movement.
Senior western diplomats, bankers and oil company executives are praying the
worst will not come to pass. But one admits in private to 'functioning on a
wing and a prayer'.
Abdel Haq Layada, alleged to be one of the leaders of the GIA, was sentenced
to death by a court in Algiers yesterday. He was handed over to Algeria by
Morocco last year.

France and its European and African allies are prepared to intervene
militarily in Rwanda if massacres continue and a ceasefire is not respected,
Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Paris. Intervention could occur 'relatively soon if we learn of new
massacres in coming days,' Mr Juppe said after testifying before the
National Assembly's foreign affairs committee.
Rwandan government and rebel officials reached a ceasefire agreement in
Tunis on Tuesday. Fighting abated in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, last night
after rival forces traded mortar and small-arms fire for most of the day.
Rwanda's interim president said his government would strictly observe the
ceasefire and had the means to stop massacres. In the latest incident, 60
teenage Tutsi boys were abducted by Hutu militia and murdered, a UN official
said.

The annual pan-African summit ended on an optimistic note yesterday, after
winning agreement from Rwanda's warring parties to implement an immediate
ceasefire, Reuter reports from Tunis.
'In view of the urgency of the situation and in their strong desire to
restore peace, seriously compromised in Rwanda, the parties to the conflict
have agreed to put an immediate end to hostilities,' a communique said after
the three-day Tunis meeting of the 53-member Organisation of African Unity.
However, fighting in the Rwandan capital Kigali did not immediately abate.
'Heavy mortars and small arms fire have rocked the city since dawn,' said
Brigadier-General Henry Anyidoho, the deputy commander of a hapless United
Nations peacekeeping force. The headquarters of the UN mission in Rwanda was
hit by gunfire, he added.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Appeals likely over Abu Dhabi BCCI sentences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Both prosecution and defence sides are considering appealing against
sentences handed out in the Abu Dhabi courts on Tuesday to 12 former
executives of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
All but one of 13 BCCI executives on trial were found guilty and given jail
sentences totalling 61 years and a demand they repay more than Dollars 9.1bn
(Pounds 6bn) of money belonging to Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in
the bank.
Lawyers were yesterday trying to clarify the procedures for determining how
long those sentenced would have to stay in prison, given the improbability
of being able to pay the civil penalties imposed.
It appeared that any judgment on this would rest with the Abu Dhabi court of
execution, a senior court.
It was also unclear yesterday whether periods spent in detention in the
Police Officers' Club in Abu Dhabi by 10 of those charged would count
towards their sentences.
Six of those found guilty have been sentenced to three years each, but since
under local law 21 days counts as a month and they have been held since
September 1991, this period has expired.
The Abu Dhabi authorities said they were attempting to gain access to Mr
Agha Hasan Abedi, founder and president of BCCI, who was sentenced in his
absence to eight years. He is unlikely to be extradited from Pakistan.
Under the terms of an agreement drawn up with the US authorities, Mr Swaleh
Naqvi, former chief executive of BCCI, may be returned to Abu Dhabi from the
US after he has served out any sentence in the US, where he was flown in
May.
The US authorities are believed to be considering sending him first to the
UK or other countries with which it has extradition treaties for possible
prosecution.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia, a substantial trading partner and provider of aid to the South
Pacific, yesterday urged island nations to improve internal government
policies, warning that they could face serious and mounting economic
problems if they failed to act.
In a hard-hitting speech, Mr Gordon Bilney, Australia's Pacific island
affairs minister, said there were some broad issues - such as environmental
management, population growth, and trade and investment - 'which if not
addressed with a sense of urgency could have consequences which would make
more immediate political problems seems small by comparison'.
Mr Bilney noted that real gross national product in the Pacific island
countries had grown by an average rate of only some 0.1 per cent a year over
the past decade. 'In short, whatever policies we've been following in the
South Pacific - and by 'we' I mean island countries and donor countries
alike - are demonstrably not working,' he said.
The minister offered few precise remedies, but stressed the need to achieve
lower population growth rates by 'a careful mix of policies'. He also urged
nations to develop a united approach towards bigger, distant-water fishing
nations, to ensure sustainable development; to guard against exploitation of
topical forests; and to mobilise domestic savings and open their economies
to foreign investment.
Asked whether Australia would consider withholding aid from Pacific nations
which failed to improve internal policies, Mr Bilney said this was 'far too
stark'.
Mr Bilney's speech represented the first significant policy statement on the
South Pacific by an Australian minister for six years. Australia's trade
with the region amounts to around ADollars 3bn (Pounds 1.46bn) a year, and
its aid contribution is close to ADollars 500m.

FT  16 JUN 94 / World airlines expect return to profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The international airline industry expects to return to profit this year
after suffering four years of huge losses.
After losing Dollars 4.1bn (Pounds 2.7bn) last year and a total of Dollars
15.6bn since 1990 on international scheduled services, the International Air
Transport Association (Iata) yesterday said the industry was likely to show
a profit of about Dollars 1bn this year.
'We are hopeful we have turned the corner,' said Mr Tom Murphy, senior
director of the organisation, which groups more than 220 carriers.
The improvement in the industry's financial position reflects continued
growth in traffic with capacity remaining under control and an improvement
in passenger yields.
Although the industry had hoped to see the first signs of an overall
improvement last year, Mr Pierre Jeanniot, Iata's director-general, said
1993 was far worse than expected.
Originally the industry had expected to lose about Dollars 2.4bn on
international scheduled services last year but ended up with a Dollars 4.1bn
loss, the second largest in its history after the 1992 loss of Dollars 4.8bn
Airline unit costs had fallen by 6.2 per cent last year, compared with
expectations of an 8.8 per cent decline in costs. This was not sufficient to
offset a 7.2 per cent decrease in passenger yields.
For the first time since 1988, traffic last year grew faster than capacity,
with traffic 7.7 per cent up on 1992 and capacity up only 5.2 per cent.
But Mr Murphy said much of the traffic growth had been 'bought' through
promotional and discounted fares at the expense of yields. This led to the
bigger-than-expected loss of Dollars 4.1bn last year.
While traffic increased last year, the operating revenues of Iata airlines
fell by Dollars 400m to Dollars 107.7bn, reflecting the pressure on
passenger yields.
Traffic this year is expected to grow by 8 per cent, with capacity growing
more slowly by 5 per cent. This, coupled with a small decline in costs as
well as yields, was likely to lead to a Dollars 1bn profit in 1994.
Although this was a sign the industry cycle was finally turning, a Dollars
1bn profit still represented less than 1 per cent of the industry's annual
turnover, Iata officials noted.
Mr Murphy said last year's losses were not evenly distributed across the
industry. About half the airlines were hovering around break-even, some were
doing well and about one-quarter of the industry made losses.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Russia pressed on air safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The International Air Transport Association (Iata) is urging Russia to
enforce more stringent licensing procedures for new airlines and improve
flight safety standards in the face of an alarming increase in the country's
air accident rate.
Iata is also worried by flight safety standards in the rapidly growing
Chinese market.
Mr Pierre Jeanniot, Iata's director-general, yesterday said he had written
to the Russian authorities recommending that they be 'more cautious' in
granting licences for airlines being established following the break-up of
Aeroflot.
Iata officials said civil aviation figures from the former Soviet Union
showed 'a considerable decrease' in safety last year and so far this year.
Although the volume of air traffic has been falling because of high fares
and poor service standards, the number of deaths caused by air accidents
increased last year to 348 people compared with 250 in 1992.
This year the figure is likely to be even worse, following the Aeroflot
Airbus A310 crash and another fatal accident involving a Russian-built
Tupolev Tu-154 airliner.
But on China, Mr Jeanniot said he was encouraged by the Beijing government's
decision to limit the number of new licences it is issuing for new domestic
airline operations. 'China realised they were getting a bit thin to ensure
safety standards and decided to curb growth a little to ensure better
safety,' he said.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Food prices up sharply in China: Press told not to report
details as grumbling increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese consumers have been rocked by a series of steep price increases for
staple foods such as grain, prompting widespread grumbling at a time of
worker and peasant unrest.
The authorities last week increased the price of premium quality flour by 37
per cent and rice by nearly 17 per cent.
This comes on top of steep prices rises for most basic commodities in the
past 12 months.
A Beijing municipal official confirmed yesterday that the price rises had
come into force on June 10, but he said the Chinese media had been
instructed not to report details, to avoid inflaming opinion.
The price increase coincides with simmering unhappiness over price increases
in urban and rural areas. Agitation among industrial workers has become
commonplace. Cost of living increases are running at more than 20 per cent
in China's cities.
China's press, warning of the dangers to the economy of spiralling price
increases, has demanded action. The official Business Weekly said at the
weekend the 'side-effects of the pricing reform and the rocketing cost of
production materials have combined to form the Achilles heel of the
economy'.
In March, China reintroduced price controls on 20 items, including services
and food. It authorised local governments to implement measures to ease the
inflationary burden on consumers.
Meanwhile the State Statistical Bureau yesterday forecast that it would
reduce economic growth this year to between 9 and 10 per cent compared with
13 per cent in 1993.
It reported that growth slowed to about 12 per cent in the first half of
this year. This would 'make it easier' to achieve the targeted growth rate
of 9-10 per cent.
Beijing yesterday ordered the virtual suspension of trading on most of the
country's futures exchanges as part of continuing efforts to toughen
regulation of chaotic financial markets.
The Securities Commission, a regulatory arm of the State Council, China's
cabinet, is expected to limit severely the number of exchanges after
reviewing their licences.
Some 40 futures exchanges dealing in commodities and currencies had
mushroomed in China's cities since last year and were in effect operating
beyond the control of the hard-pressed regulatory authorities in Beijing.
Peoples' Daily, the Communist party newspaper, reported at the weekend that
speculation on international futures markets through local brokerages had
led to huge foreign exchange losses.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Japan MPs urge electoral amnesty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A majority of members of Japan's lower house of parliament yesterday called
for an electoral amnesty until the establishment of new constituency
boundaries, likely this autumn.
The request, in a petition signed by 306 of the 511 members of the lower
house, was presented to Mr Tsutomu Hata, prime minister of the embattled
minority government.
This reduces the likelihood of a sweeping change in government over the next
few months, but does not rule out a vote of no confidence against the
administration.
Mr Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic party, and Mr Tomiichi
Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic party, the two biggest
opposition groups, have called for a vote of confidence after this year's
long-overdue budget gets through the upper house. Parliamentary officials
expect the budget to be adopted by June 23, a week before the end of the
parliamentary session on June 29.
If successful, such a vote would lead to a cabinet reshuffle which could
broaden the government with opposition members getting ministerial posts.
Signatories to yesterday's petition, organised by Mr Yuji Tsushima, chairman
of the LDP's main policy board, include 60 LDP politicians and 34 from the
SDP. This confirms that opposition parties agree, after weeks of indecision,
that they would gain little by calling an election under the existing
multi-seat constituency system. That would make it look as if they wanted to
delay popular political reform.
Parliament agreed only last January to replace the existing system, blamed
for fostering corruption, with a mixture of proportional representation and
single-seat districts. However, the Home Affairs Ministry has not yet
completed the draft of the electoral boundary bill needed to complete
political reform, expected to go to a parliamentary session after the summer
break.
Meanwhile, the coalition is negotiating behind the scenes to attract support
from both opposition parties and stave off a no-confidence vote.
Here the North Korean crisis has tipped the balance towards a coalition
partnership with the LDP, on the grounds that it may need LDP moderates'
support for sanctions against Pyongyang. The strategy of Mr Koji Kakizawa,
foreign minister, for a warning to North Korea followed by phased United
Nations sanctions has broad LDP support. Mr Kakizawa was a member of the LDP
until seven weeks ago, when he accepted a job with the new government.
A growing number of LDP politicians want to keep Mr Hata in power at least
until early next month, to avoid Japan looking embarrassingly leaderless at
the annual Group of Seven summit in Naples from July 8 to 10.
A last-minute parliamentary rush to get the budget through the lower house
prevented Japan from sending a cabinet minister to the recent ministerial
meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

FT  16 JUN 94 / UK 'must push for total test ban'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain has this week made a welcome shift in its attitude to stopping
nuclear tests but should go much further, according to a group of US arms
control experts visiting London to lobby for a comprehensive test ban.
The experts criticised US handling of the North Korean crisis, saying it had
raised the stakes too quickly and left Pyongyang with no way to back down
without losing face. 'We are pushing the North Koreans into a corner,' said
Mr Paul Warnke, the US government's former head of arms control talks.
The shift in British policy was indicated by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence
procurement minister, in a parliamentary answer. He made it clear Britain
would no longer insist any test ban treaty must contain loopholes that would
allow small-scale explosions in the interests of safety.
'We now aim to use and develop alternative technologies,' the minister
added, indicating Britain was confident computerised simulations could
substitute adequately for nuclear explosions.
Arms control advocates are lobbying hard for the five nuclear powers to
conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty at their negotiations in Geneva
this year. They believe a test ban will help persuade smaller countries to
agree to extension and consolidation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty when it
comes up for renewal in 1995.
Mr Warnke and his colleagues urged Britain to become an advocate of an early
test ban, as opposed merely to following the US lead. They said Britain was
wrong to insist that as many as possible of the world's potential nuclear
'miscreants' should sign up before any test ban treaty entered force. This
stance could lead to fatal delays in installing a new non-proliferation
regime.
The Korean crisis had driven home the need for some internationally agreed
arms control system, even if not all countries wanted it, because otherwise
there would be no mechanism to isolate and punish wrongdoers. China wants to
complete a series of nuclear tests before agreeing to a ban. In France,
President Francois Mitterrand is a strong advocate of a ban, but right-wing
opponents have reservations.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: German insolvencies up 31.2%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
German insolvencies rose 31.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year
compared with 1993, the federal statistics office reported yesterday. Credit
unions warned that Germany faced its worst year of bankruptcies since 1945
with up to 11,650 insolvencies in the first six months of this year. In
western Germany, insolvencies rose 21.2 per cent to total 4,945; in the five
eastern Lander the number of insolvencies leapt 117.5 per cent to 1,031, the
statistics office said. It predicted the rate of insolvencies would fall,
pointing to a 15.4 per cent increase in March and a still lower forecast
figure for April.
In the first two months of the year, the number of insolvencies had risen by
up to 40 per cent. Worst affected were construction companies, trading
companies and service companies, where insolvencies rose 43 per cent.
Preliminary claims against debtors in western Germany totalled DM4.3bn
(Pounds 1.7bn), similar to the figure a year before, while in eastern
Germany debt totalled DM1.3bn, which, despite the dramatic rise in
insolvencies, was equal to the amount a year ago.
The Bundesbank yesterday lowered its repurchase rate from 5.10 per cent to
5.05 per cent.
The Dutch foreign trade surplus narrowed to Fl 1.4bn (Pounds 500m) in
January from Fl 2.2bn in December, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.
Finnish industrial production adjusted for working days increased 9.7 per
cent year-on-year in April, and 0.4 per cent from March, Statistics Finland
said.
The Belgian National Bank yesterday cut its key central rate to 5.05 per
cent from 5.10 per cent.

The Bank of Norway yesterday issued an upbeat forecast for the economy but
warned the government that its loose fiscal policy and rising wage claims
could cause overheating. The central bank forecast a 4.5 per cent increase
in private consumption this year, against a December forecast of 2.75 per
cent. It criticised the government for not tightening fiscal policy in the
revised national budget unveiled in May, and warned against an inflationary
budget for 1995. The Bank of Norway sees gdp growth of 4 per cent this year,
with the non-oil economy expanding by 2.75 per cent this year and 3 per cent
in 1995. Consumer price inflation, at 0.9 per cent, is at its lowest for
more than 30 years. The central bank expects inflation of 1-1.5 per cent
over the next two years and sees the current account surplus rising from
NKr22bn (Pounds 2bn) this year to NKr29bn in 1995.

Finland's plans to enter the European Union on January 1 were spared
disruption yesterday when the centre-right coalition government survived a
parliamentary vote of no confidence despite the abstention of some of its
own members. But Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, faces a further challenge
on the EU issue on Saturday when his Centre party votes at a special
conference on whether to back Finnish membership in a referendum on October
18. The party, which is founded on the agricultural community, is deeply
split on EU policy. Mr Aho is expected to prevail but a decision not to back
membership would throw the government into turmoil and delay the formal
ratification of Finland's accession agreement with the Union.

Poland has agreed a new draft Dollars 900m standby agreement with an
International Monetary Fund team for 18 months until the end of next year.
The funds will go to boosting Poland's hard currency reserves as well as
helping to finance a 45 per cent debt reduction deal agreed earlier this
year with western commercial banks. The policy draft, which is likely to be
approved early in August by the IMF and still has to be formally adopted by
the Polish government, assumes that inflation next year will fall to 16 per
cent from this year's projected 23 per cent figure.
Next year's deficit budget meanwhile will fall to 3.7 per cent of gdp from
this year's 4.1 per cent. Mr Michael Deppler, the head of the IMF group said
yesterday that the medium-term programme drafted by Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, the
new finance minister, and adopted recently by the Polish government,
contained 'good policies for Poland' and that he was confident that
unemployment would fall by the end of 1997.

The French government is planning to extend measures aimed at curbing the
growth in long-term unemployment, Mr Michel Giraud, the employment minister,
said. In an interview in Les Echos, the financial daily, Mr Giraud said that
the government would extend from 18 to 24 months the exemption on employer
contributions to social security charges for new workers recruited from the
ranks of the long-term unemployed.
According to Mr Giraud, the measure will apply to the hiring of workers who
have been registered as unemployed for more than three years, who are
disabled or who have been claiming welfare benefits below standard
unemployment benefits for more than one year. While the overall unemployment
rate has shown signs of stabilising at about 12.2 per cent of the workforce
long-term unemployment has continued to rise.
BSN, the French-based multi-national food company, has signed a joint
declaration with an international trade union guaranteeing the rights of its
workers to trade union representation. BSN, which employs more than 56,000
workers in Europe, the Americas and Asia, has signed the declaration with
the Geneva-based International Union of Food. Most international companies
say they comply with local labour arrangements.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Nato, Russia in talks accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nato yesterday agreed to Russia's request for urgent talks on the
relationship between Moscow and the alliance, despite bitter arguments at
last week's meeting of foreign ministers in Istanbul. Ambassadors from the
16 Nato members yesterday 'agreed to invite Russia to begin discussions in
Brussels immediately', according to an alliance spokesman.
Until recently, the alliance had been insisting that Russia must join its
Partnership For Peace military co-operation programme under the same
procedure as the existing 20 members, by signing up first and discussing
practical details later. However yesterday's decision confirmed that Russia
is having some success in convincing the alliance that a wide-ranging
agreement in principle on the shape of Russia-Nato relations must be sealed
before Moscow signs up to PFP.
At last week's meeting in Istanbul between foreign ministers of Nato and the
former Warsaw Pact, western diplomats described as a 'disgrace' the firmness
with which Russia insisted on several key points in the final communique.
These included the exclusion of any reference to the possibility that
countries such as Poland and Hungary might become full members of Nato.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Italy tries to grasp the pensions nettle: A look at the
budget implications of a constitutional court decision ordering payment of
arrears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The state of Italy's public finances has rudely interrupted the Berlusconi
government's euphoria over its spectacular performance in the European
elections.
The immediate problem is a decision last week by the constitutional court
obliging the government to pay arrears on certain categories of pensions
dating back to 1983. But the need to find extra funds and neutralise the
impact of the court ruling has highlighted the unresolved problem of Italy's
public sector deficit, still equivalent to more than 10 per cent of gross
domestic product.
This in turn has provided a brutal reminder that the government of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, for all its talk of reducing taxes and stimulating the economy,
has a very slim margin of manoeuvre in its as yet ill-defined economic
policy. The nervous reaction of the financial markets to the court decision
 -both on the bourse and towards government bond prices - has rubbed home
the point that the deficit cannot be ignored.
Estimates of the cost of making the pension payments vary considerably
because of the complexity of interpreting the court's decision. The upper
limit has been put at a staggering L30,000bn (Pounds 12.4bn) by Mr Clemente
Mastella, the labour minister, and it is unlikely to be lower than
L16,000bn.
The confusion is surprising because the constitutional court decision was
known to be imminent.
Its ruling in favour of paying arrears on certain minimum benefits stopped
in 1983 was considered a near certainty by the previous Ciampi government
and Mr Mario Colombo, the head of Inps, the state pensions institute, wrote
a letter on May 11 to Mr Berlusconi when he had just been named prime
minister warning of the potential costs.
Tuesday afternoon was taken up by various meetings between Mr Berlusconi,
his economic ministers, Inps officials and the comptroller of public
accounts. Officials say that by tomorrow a definitive analysis of the cost
will have been made; but they decline to say whether there will be a
pre-summer mini-budget and whether plans for the 1995 budget have had to be
rewritten.
The government's initial reaction is to try to spread the arrears payments
over a period of years, beginning in 1995. Thus the mini-budget could be
retained as the government's original objective of finding around L6,000bn
(mainly in spending cuts) to hold the public sector deficit down to
L154,000bn. In this way, the timid economic recovery could be encouraged,
stimulated by already announced measures giving tax incentives to invest and
create new jobs.
But this approach would not obviate the need for a tough 1995 budget if
Italy is to lower the budget deficit in line with its main European partners
as pledged. The government is acutely aware of this dilemma and hopes the
markets will be satisfied by an early commitment - probably before the end
of the month - to tackle the issue of pensions head-on.
Italy's generous state pensions scheme has become a drain on Italy's public
finances. Pensions are the largest item in the budget and account for 42 per
cent of current spending. Measures introduced by the Amato government in
1993, considered bold at the time, are now inadequate.
The compulsory retirement age was raised from 55 for women and 60 for men to
60 and 65 respectively (a rise of one year every second year as of 1993).
The reference period for calculating pensions was increased from 5 to 10
years and the period of contribution entitlements was raised from 15 to 20
years.
The linkage between nominal wage growth and wages was cut, restrictions were
imposed on the much abused early retirement benefits and employee
contributions were raised marginally to 9.9 per cent of total earnings.
According to the Bank of Italy, pension outlays last year were L181,000bn,
up 4.7 per cent. But without the Amato measures the bank says the rise would
have been far greater.
Equally worrying is the way the growing population of pensioners - more than
20m and for the first time more numerous than those in work - cannot be
funded by the contributions of those in jobs.
This year the treasury expects to have to cover a deficit of L74,000bn. The
amount is already L7,000bn above budget and could be higher, as double the
number expected of local government employees have submitted requests for
early retirement. There have also been costly early state-backed retirement
settlements in the steel and motor industry.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Rocard challenges rivals to run against him
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Rocard, the French Socialist leader, yesterday staked his
political future on a confidence vote on Sunday within his party and
challenged rival bidders for the French presidency to stand against him.
Mr Rocard said the Socialist party's national council would determine 'my
present and future' after what he called a 'very serious setback' for the
Socialists in the European elections. The party won only 14.5 per cent of
the vote, its worst performance for a quarter of a century.
Last night, Mr Rocard said he would seek a vote of confidence from the
party's national council. Rivals seeking the party's nomination in next
year's presidential race should run against him.
'Anyone who wants to, and thinks he has something to propose, can be a
candidate (for the presidency). No one can claim to have a hold on the
position,' he said.
'As for me, it goes without saying that I will let the next National Council
decide. I have never run away from responsibility.'
However, he said the right time for the party to designate its presidential
standard-bearer was 'not for several months, at the end of this year or the
start of next year'.
The French system lacks clear-cut US-style primaries to designate
presidential candidates. But since he became the Socialist party's first
secretary after its parliamentary election defeat in March 1993, Mr Rocard
has striven to acquire the mantle of the party's 'natural' presidential
candidate. In yesterday's statement, Mr Rocard effectively said this mantle
was up for grabs.
But he also made clear that he intended to fight for the presidential
candidacy. He said that from the Euro-election result 'we have to draw the
consequences, individually for myself, but also collectively for us all.' He
said he would have 'proposals for our recovery' to put to the 300 odd
members of the national council on Sunday.
In the immediate aftermath of the June 12 poll he had offered to resign, but
close associates dissuaded him from doing so.
The gravity of the situation for Mr Rocard was graphically illustrated in a
survey carried out for the Liberation newspaper, which showed that last
Sunday the Euro-list of Mr Bernard Tapie, the populist Marseilles
politician, had far out-polled the Rocard list among the young and
blue-collar workers, two constituencies that kept the Socialists in power in
the 1980s.
However, the odds still probably favour Mr Rocard staying on as leader for a
while, if only because Mr Jacques Delors is the only other mooted Socialist
presidential candidate of any stature and his 10-year stint as European
Commission president is not due to end until December.

FT  16 JUN 94 / EU steelmakers suspicious of Brescia ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign and Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's steelmakers reacted with resignation but little enthusiasm
yesterday to the European Commission's decision to let Italy grant aid that
will help steel plants in the Brescia region cut capacity.
The move keeps alive the European Union's rescue plan for the industry. Ms
Angela Busi, who heads the long products division of the Italian steel
federation, said yesterday: 'It's obviously a step forward and we are very
happy.'
But steelmakers elsewhere in Europe believe aid rules are being bent, or at
least fudged. British Steel said it still believed that only those subsidies
which conformed to the EU steel aids code should be allowed. The Italian aid
did not appear to conform.
Usinor-Sacilor, the French state-owned steel group, gave a mixed reaction to
the ruling. While it welcomed the extension of Italian capacity cuts, it
stressed that the terms of the aid to the Brescia steel plants had to be
rigorously observed. There was also considerable scepticism over where the
final 2m-3m tonnes of capacity cuts would come from to achieve the minimum
19m tonnes of cuts in hot rolled products capacity sought by the Commission.
The Italian plan to cut 5m-6m tons of capacity would produce total cuts of
16m-17m tonnes across Europe, assuming that the 11m tonnes of cuts already
pledged are implemented. But one industry spokesman described as a 'Delphic
utterance' yesterday's statement by Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry
commissioner, that there were several possibilities under discussion to make
up the shortfall. 'We have no idea what he is referring to,' he said.
Thyssen, Germany's biggest steelmaker, said it was relieved that the EU
steel plan had been revived but warned that it would be difficult to turn
projected cuts into real cuts.
'Generally the plan is an instrument which stabilises the market,' said Mr
Peter Blau, spokesman for Thyssen. 'The question is will the Italians
actually be able (to make the cuts)? There I have my doubts.'
Usinor-Sacilor, meanwhile, said that even if the 19m tonne target was not
reached, the important thing was to maximise the amount of restructuring.
Thyssen said there were no immediate prospects that yesterday's developments
would bring a solution for Eko Stahl, the ailing eastern German steelworks,
any closer. 'We have had talks with a variety of partners in France, Britain
and Luxembourg but there is still no solution in sight,' it said.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Britain leaves door open to Dehaene: Hurd does not rule out
Belgian to succeed Delors if choice is deadlocked at Corfu summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, yesterday underlined the
government's determination to press the candidacy of Sir Leon Brittan as the
next president of the European Commission. But he pointedly left open the
door to the eventual appointment - possibly in the autumn - of Mr Jean-Luc
Dehaene if there was an impasse at the European Union summit in Corfu.
The chances of breaking the deadlock over the succession to Mr Jacques
Delors now rest on a meeting of Christian Democrat leaders in Brussels next
Wednesday, two days before the summit.
Mr Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, and Mr Ruud Lubbers, his Dutch
counterpart, will be present, but so will Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany,
the most likely powerbroker. Mr Kohl will also discuss the issue in Bonn
today with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier. Italy is seen as a
crucial swing vote.
In a wide-ranging review of Britain's approach to the Corfu meeting, Mr Hurd
defended the 'multi-speed, multi-track' approach to Europe it had set out in
the recent elections for the Strasbourg parliament.
He said this vision of a more flexible Union did not mean Britain would
lapse into a 'sour, negative view'. Nor would it consign itself into a
notional 'slow lane'.
Instead, in defence and foreign policy, for example, the government was
determined to remain in the forefront of efforts to strengthen co-operation.
He told a committee of MPs: 'What we want to do is to make the common
foreign and security policy effective. . . we are in the van.' There would
be other areas in which Britain would take a lead.
But he hinted that the government expected the work of the 1996
intergovernmental conference on the next stage of development of the EU
might extend well into 1997, the last date for the next British general
election.
Pressed on the succession to Mr Delors, Mr Hurd said that Sir Leon was an
'outstanding candidate' who would have the strong and full support of the
British government. He refused though to criticise Mr Dehaene, commenting:
'We have nothing against him personally. In fact, he presided rather well
over the Belgian presidency.'
The job description for the next president would be as important as the
individual chosen for the post. Britain did not want another 'philosopher
king' seeking to extend the authority of Brussels. Rather, the Commission
should 'grip and deal competently and persuasively with the powers it
already has'.
Hopes of a deal in Corfu rest on a complicated package in which the job of
Commission president would be traded for the top post at the European
Council secretariat and a joint European Union candidate for the World Trade
Organisation.
Mr Lubbers is said to be digging in his heels after being snubbed by the
French and Germans. Mr Dehaene, who has refused to announce a public
candidacy, has now 'developed a real taste for the job', according to an
associate.
A Dutch veto of Mr Dehaene would allow the British to avoid the blame for a
stalemate at the summit. Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, paid a
visit to President Francois Mitterrand yesterday to push his candidacy. Mr
Lubbers saw Mr Mitterrand for an hour in Paris yesterday - continuing the
public lobbying for a job which, in the past, has been settled through
discreet diplomacy.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Restructuring puts thousands of jobs at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The plan to restructure Italy's privately-owned steelmakers could cost more
than a quarter of the 25,000-or-so jobs in the private sector, according to
the industry federation, Federacciai.
Yesterday's news that the European Commission had approved the proposal did
not bring rejoicing steelworkers on to the streets of Brescia, the northern
town where many of the myriad small steel mills are located. But Italy's
private steelmakers, particularly those financially strongest, quietly
welcomed the decision, and even the strict conditions attached to it, as a
guarantee that an orderly restructuring could now take place.
'Let's hope that now, the Italian government can get things moving,' said Ms
Angela Busi, managing director of the family-owned Acciaierie di Lonato and
chairman of Federacciai's long-products division.
Italy's private steelmakers say they have been waiting almost two years for
a helping hand from Rome and Brussels. They have seen most of the Italian
government's political effort go into negotiations with the Commission about
the fate of Ilva, the chronically loss-making state-owned manufacturer which
employs about half the steelworkers in Italy.
Meanwhile, the government's inability to guarantee funding for
private-sector closures helped scupper some manufacturers' attempts last
year to pool their resources in a Commission-approved 'crisis cartel'.
Now, however, the misnamed 'Bresciani' (the town may be the biggest but it
is not the only steel-making centre in Italy) believe they have found a
champion in Mr Vito Gnutti, the new industry minister, who is due to meet Mr
Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner, in Rome today. Mr
Gnutti, a member of the populist Northern League, is from Brescia, and
industry sources say he has already impressed them with his dedication to
the problem.
In talking to Brussels, he may have been helped by the fact that the
Commission could not really look elsewhere for the extra private-sector cuts
needed to complete its EU rescue plan. This is partly because it is a highly
fragmented sector, a side-effect of rapid growth after the war, when
family-owned companies took advantage of the abundance of scrap to fuel
their foundries. The sector groups as many as 90 different companies, 68 of
which committed themselves to the closure programme approved yesterday in
Brussels.
Certain individual companies are just as efficient as, if not more so than,
their competitors in other EU countries, but everybody in the sector agrees
that as a group, the Brescia steelmakers are too numerous and too small.
Yesterday's Commission decision will mean outright closure for some small
companies. But it will permit some of the larger and more complex groups,
which operate in different sectors of the market, to carry out a subsidised
closure of their least-efficient units, provided they meet the Commission's
conditions.
Mr Enrico Badiali, a director of Federacciai, adds that Brussels is getting
a bargain by accepting the plan. He points out that a commitment to cut
capacity by up to 7m tonnes, in exchange for about L700bn (Pounds 288m) of
state aid, compares favourably with the deal struck for Ilva, which is
allowed to make smaller cuts and receive greater subsidies.
If the plan succeeds, he admits the future for the private sector, enlarged
by the newly-privatised Ilva divisions, will be more optimistic than for
many years.

FT  16 JUN 94 / Foot-dragging slows path to single market: Commission is
pointing a finger at the laggards in an attempt to prod them into more rapid
legislative action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eighteen months ago the single market for Europe was launched with great
fanfare. Yet it is still far from complete. Today, the European Commission
will point the finger at the EU's most slothful members to find out why
their parliaments have still not adopted all the legislation crucial for the
free flow of goods, services and capital within the market's frontiers.
Commission tables to be produced at today's council of ministers meeting in
Luxembourg show that Germany, France and the Netherlands have the poorest
record on pharmaceutical products: in company law Germany, Greece, Spain and
France fall well short; on intellectual property, half the EU's member
states have delayed adoption of the relevant directives; perhaps most
worrying of all - since it accounts for 15 per cent of the EU's gross
national product - is the sluggish progress made on securing a single market
in public procurement.
Second, and more crucially, ministers will be asked to consider a proposal
designed to examine rigorously those areas of the single market where no
harmonisation legislation applies but where the principal of 'mutual
recognition' of technical standards is supposed to ensure that pressure
cookers made in Italy, for example, can be sold without obstacle anywhere
else in the Union.
This proposal goes to the heart of a dilemma facing Europe's policymakers.
With countries still blocking goods from other member states on the often
spurious grounds that safety or technical standards do not match, the
Commission has to decide whether more legislation is required to maintain
momentum behind the single market.
It is unlikely to get agreement on the proposal today. Several countries are
opposed, most notably France and Germany, against whom most complaints have
been received.
The decision to step up pressure on EU members comes after what Mr Raniero
Vanni d'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the single market, describes
as a 'period of observation'.
'Overall, the single market is working,' he says. 'But in some areas,
legislation at a national level has been delayed - completing the
legislative programme must now be an urgent priority.'
The naming-names exercise is thus designed to prod member states into
speeding up their legislative programmes to ensure, as one official put it,
that 'home bases are covered'.
The Commission insists that its approach is less about public humiliation
and more about fact finding. 'The idea is to go through those areas that are
performing worst, and for the member states to spell out the problems that
are getting in the way of adopting directives,' said the official. 'We want
to get detailed responses from the member states as to when we can expect
these problems to be unblocked.'
The exercise will continue at the next council meeting in October, when Mr
d'Archirafi intends to switch his focus away from the quantity of
legislation adopted, to the quality of legislation once it reaches national
statute books.
But more likely to provoke heated argument at today's meeting is the
Commission's proposal to examine where mutual recognition of technical
standards is not working.
When the single market was first dreamt up, it was deemed unnecessary to
harmonise standards in all commercial sectors. Standards in sensitive areas
such as medicine, chemicals, cars and toys would be harmonised under
legislation agreed by all 12 member states. But for the bulk of goods and
services mutual recognition was supposed to ensure that prams, lollipops and
electric light bulbs, for example, would circulate freely.
In practice, there have been endless hitches. A Commission inventory of
barriers to trade based on complaints from manufacturers shows that peas
from Belgium, for example, came up against barriers in Denmark because of
'classification problems and quality standards'. The UK objected to Dutch
radishes because of worries about a certain fly. Ceramic tiles from Greece
have been barred from the French market because of 'difficulties in
obtaining type approval'.
Generally, the complaints tend to come from manufacturers in smaller member
states who cannot get their goods circulated in the larger countries. A
survey by the Danish finance ministry produced a shockingly high number of
complaints about remaining technical barriers to trade.
As a result Brussels is coming under pressure to produce more harmonisation
legislation, particularly from the less powerful EU members such as Denmark
and Spain, to deal with those areas where mutual recognition is failing.
'There have been, for example, a lot of concerns from caravan makers,' said
an official from DG15, the directorate responsible for the internal market.
'We have had pressure to produce a directive over things like dimensions and
the materials with which the caravans are made.'
As a first step, today's proposal recommends a change to the way in which
complaints are recorded. At present, Brussels relies on manufacturers to
keep it abreast of what is going on at a grassroots level. Now it wants to
switch the onus to the authorities who are doing the refusing. In other
words, any national authority that refuses a product from one country will
have to notify the Commission thereby providing Brussels with a more
complete record of where problems are arising and where more harmonisation
legislation might eventually be required.
Some member states - notably Britain - are very keen. The French and
Germans, however, have argued that there are so many examples of where one
country is blocking another's goods that the proposal will spawn unnecessary
bureaucracy.
Some at the Commission are sceptical. They say the Germans and French do not
want the issue to be tackled so they can continue to block products from
other countries, thus protecting their own manufacturers.
What is certain is that today's meeting is unlikely to produce a consensus
on the proposal. That is more likely to come in October when internal market
ministers next meet.
Until then, and until the information has been gathered, the Commission will
continue to favour mutual recognition as a better, less cumbersome, route
than legislation. This is partly because legislation is so costly, but also
in recognition of the fact that a directive on caravans, or peas would do
nothing for the image of the meddling Brussels bureaucrat.
But if mutual recognition continues to be flouted by the Union's biggest and
most powerful states, some countries, and many manufacturers, will step up
pressure for more harmonisation. At that point Brussels will have to decide
how best to tackle the grievances of the Belgian eiderdown maker who,
because of the stuffing he uses, cannot sell his products in the
Netherlands, Germany or France.
